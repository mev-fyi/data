[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david andrew yang on the podcast can't believe it man what an epic podcast that was what were some of your favorite parts well he just came out and said it uh the forward party is the crypto party apparently according to andrew yang you heard it here uh and so we we really had a podcast about the deep alignment behind andrew yang's vision for the future of the world and how crypto relates to that and not only how crypto relates but also how crypto can actually achieve some of these same goals and visions that andrew's looking for but perhaps in an easier more direct way as somebody that volunteered for andrew yang's campaign in 2020 it was an absolute honor to get him on the podcast and even just being able to talk to him about our advice for what we have for the forward party as it relates to crypto and his advice for the crypto industry as it relates to politics was insanely valuable and i don't think that this will be the last of andrew yang on the bankless podcast yeah i don't think so either and it's definitely not going to be the last of andrew yang's um you know conversation about crypto i felt like in that episode he almost you know stood up and said hey i'll be an advocate for crypto i'll help you guys like i you know and maybe he couldn't do that when he was a democrat maybe you can't do that as a republican either you're too embedded in the existing institutions but the ford party provides him an interesting platform to do that in because the ford party is all about like you can be a democrat and be the ford party you can be a republican in the ford party just in the same way you can be a crypto advocate and be a democrat or republican in the u.s and what really struck me david from that conversation is like this andrew yang really gets it like he understands what crypto is trying to do and he understands the existential threat or the kneecapping effect he used the word kneecap several times when talking about the us government's interference in the crypto industry he understands that's a real threat and he knows how to work the process and how to navigate that threat i think he can be a huge ally for crypto and regardless of what where you are in the political you know spectrum bankless is not a political podcast but for crypto we are crypto needs to step into the political arena if we're going to actually mainstream this this is sort of our next step so it's not about being a democrat or republican or left versus right or anything else this is about being pro-crypto and anti-authoritarian and andrew yang gets the struggle understands why they're doing this why we're doing this and understands the the benefits that crypto can provide what a fantastic conversation man yeah there are some things about andrew yang or perhaps some things that he's not that actually makes him the perfect crypto representative well he's no longer a democrat he was running under the democratic party but now he is making a third party called the forward party and he's also not an institutionalized politician he's not a politician he's a guy trying to get things done and the way that he sees getting things done the most effectively is via politics and government but he doesn't want to be a politician he just wants to see results and in the same way that crypto is not a left or right industry we just care about innovation and moving forward and so i think of of all industries out there crypto is actually the most interested in a non-partisan party which is itself a party that is trying to be outside of the realm of politics and just trying to do what we use on the podcast a protocol upgrade to the way our democracy works here in the united states yeah i love it you know he's the son of a physicist uh and his mother was at you know uh computer science he he grew up playing video games right you know dabbling in dungeons and dragons these things like he he he's a systemic thinker he's also an entrepreneur these qualities i think make him uh finely tuned to actually understand this uh industry and understand what we're talking about here not to mention being very young as a in comparison to the other politicians that are out there yeah absolutely young of mine as well you know eager to dive into these things so in this podcast we opened up with the the problem that he sees in america and uh the fact that the problems he sees requires systemic solutions then we talk about what solutions he thinks american democracy needs in the realm of nation-state reform and then i think we get to a really interesting point in the conversation where we talk about this third path which is crypto which uh you know the crypto solution is basically a blank slate to many of the problems that andrew yang sees building a fresh new system from the ground up and building trust that way so a lot of cool things to talk about he also mentioned a dow for his political party forward what what is this guys you're just gonna have to tune into the full episode to get the the digest and uh also if you're a premium subscriber make sure you tune into the debrief that dave and i recorded post podcast it's a hot one without further ado we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible and get right into the podcast with andrew yang arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and now it's live with over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on the ethereum l1 sucks too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization that's why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrary many defy applications that are on the ethereum layer 1 are migrating over to layer 2s like arbitrage and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer 2s there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.aubertrum and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed and start having a defy experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defy apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest who probably needs no introduction for a number of our listeners particularly those us listeners andrew yang is on the bankless podcast today he's a former presidential candidate he's a former mayoral candidate new york city as well he is the founder of the newly launched forward party which we're going to talk a lot about in fact he's just written a book on why he's doing it we're going to go through some of the concept in his book the book is called forward i've got it right on my back shelf there proving that look at that yeah it's looking good it's there fantastic book andrea um you know two fun facts before we begin just for our audience fun fact number one is david hoffman my co-host actually volunteered for your 2020 campaign out in seattle he's a you know contributor fun fact number two and this is for the bankless listeners i learned as i was reading andrew's book that he grew up playing dungeons and dragons in video games and reading comic books and sci-fi so andrew i feel like you're already one of us this is very much our clan and our tribe people who did that growing up so uh officially welcome to bank list my friend thank you for having me ryan and thank you so much for your support on the campaign david uh we had some great times and yes i definitely was a bit of a geek or a lot of a geek growing up so if that's the tribe then certainly count me in i think that's the early tribe of crypto adopters we all kind of come from that heritage um you know and uh video games and you know geekery computer stuff that that's all us um but i gotta say it's really great to see a politician actively engage with the crypto community because most of you guys are still scared of us andrew but you don't seem afraid of crypto and i want to start with this question what do you make of crypto like what's your take on it the high at the highest level is this a good thing is this a bad thing uh what's what are you thinking about the subject i have a lot of friends in the crypto community and i got to know people like david when i was running for president i am a huge proponent of cryptocurrencies as a force for innovation and democratization in the future i hope that we can help it realize its potential and that frankly government doesn't come along and do something to screw the industry because it doesn't understand what the heck is going on and and that unfortunately is a very real possibility i think most people saw what happened recently where there's this infrastructure bill and then people were like that's fine you know you know infrastructure building all of a sudden cryptocurrencies get wedged in there they're like what what just happened and then some of like the discussion around it seemed completely incoherent that there was like a scramble to be like can someone explain to these folks what is going on and then there was this unfortunate intersection between us politics and its dysfunction and the cryptocurrency community um and and so my my hope is that we can try to get some sanity into uh washington around the fact that cryptocurrencies should be here to stay and if we are thoughtful about it we could do a an enormous amount of good to solve some of our biggest problems that we're struggling with just just really quick on the infrastructure bill why do you think that happened why do you think there was that sort of reaction do people just not understand it are they do they feel threatened to buy it is it a mixture of both it's a mixture of both for sure i mean the reason it happened in real life in the infrastructure bill is they're looking for money they're just like hey we're gonna pay for this thing you know i hear that if we tax these cryptocurrency transactions we can generate billions of dollars ooh let's do that and then someone was like well come up with the language and then someone came up with language that did not make a whole lot of sense and would have roped in a bunch of folks that would have had a very hard time actually complying or or shouldn't have been considered broker dealers in essence and so then the industry did reach out to various legislators and sympathetic senators and then there was a compromise that was broached and then the compromise kind of ran aground because of the timing and there was i think at least one senator who stood up and and um was uh frankly you know against um any amendment and so we have to do our best to try and edify and educate uh some of these legislators because one of the functions of our leadership right now is it's kind of old like the average age of a us congress person is 57 senator at 62. and if you look at leadership it's generally even 15 to 20 years older than that andrew one of the big discussion points we want to have on today's show is how we think that crypto actually fits into a lot of the visions that you have and articulate for the future um but before we actually get there i think it's important to kind of back up and start this story uh at the beginning at the where where it should start which is uh your 2020 campaign was a campaign to drive awareness towards uh the coming tidal wave of automation and perhaps the amounts of social unrest that that promises to bring and i would say more or less mission accomplished on that endeavor um well david you helped make it happen thank you yang gang and everyone who helped advance the case absolutely absolutely well while unfortunately you didn't win the 2020 campaign you did achieve those goals and now you have redirected your attention on towards a bigger a bigger uh fight which is the reconstruction of the way that our democracy actually works so andrew can you uh let our listeners know why is that the fight why why have you shifted from automation towards this new fight which is the structure of the american democracy running for president was an incredible journey and i tried to document it in my book forward notes on the future of our democracy but i also try to figure out why we feel so stuck why is it that america does not seem to be humming or working and what i found was that we're stuck because our government system is essentially designed to fail us where we're at a point in american life where if everyone does the reasonable thing according to their incentives we are sunk because our political incentives will lead legislators into their corners and blame the other side for failures because it turns out that some of these issues are more valuable to politicians unsolved and solved like if you came forward and solved it and had this mammoth compromise instead of being rewarded you'd be likely to lose your job and so nothing gets done and so i started to dig in okay if we shouldn't expect it to work how could you make it work better and i will say that i believe that the future of this country uh is very very dark if we don't make serious changes politically where polarization now is at civil war levels we're seeing political violence in real life uh 42 percent of people now regard their political opponents as evil or their mortal enemies and so if that's the context where does it lead if you get rewarded for extremity so i came to these conclusions last year and thought well what you would need is a dynamic change what you would need is incentives that reward leaders for catering to 51 of us instead of the most extreme 20 and that systems change consists in real life and i'm happy to say you actually can do something about this i mean it seems impossible but you can um is you switch to open primaries and rank choice voting in the 24 states that allow for ballot initiatives where if enough of us get together we can say you know what i don't like the fact that the the party controls the primary and controls all the levers like let's switch to open primaries uh and so that became my mission and i thought okay let's make that happen but the mission overall is still the same it's just to make stuff work better and have our democracy stand the test of time and for the cryptocurrency community you all are whizzing along just like you know creating things and like seeing how things can be so much more efficient you're like i don't need these clutchy bureaucracies like this is fantastic and you look at government you're like what [Laughter] so so in many ways i'm trying to bring the future to government um but i've concluded that the single biggest problem really is the duopoly problem yeah it's it's fascinating and we want to get into more of kind of the duopoly problem and actually um the solutions that you're presenting because in crypto terms what we would call the the op the idea of rank choice voting and open primaries is like a a protocol change a upgrade to the core mechanism of the system right that's really what you're doing but before we get into some of the solutions that you're presenting your book is as presenting with some of these upgrades i want to dig a bit more into the problem and uh one of the themes of your book as i was reading it i took out that really resonates i think with the crypto community is the problem institutional distrust okay so people no longer trust the legacy institutions in fact we've started calling them legacy institutions andrew and one of the lines we often say is our institutions are failing us so i think part of it andrew is like there's institutional distrust but a lot of it feels like it's deserved distrust and i want to ask you the question is why do you think people no longer trust the legacy institutions have they failed us or is there just a miscommunication somewhere down the road what's going on here many of these institutions have failed us and then when you look to hold someone accountable there's no one to be found and so then the anger and resentment builds up in various ways and you can pretty much pick an institution i'll just use government as the big example because i talk about in my book the united states is now 28th in the world on measures like drinking water clean drinking water that is i'm sure there's shitty drinking water [Laughter] clean drinking water quality education infant mortality life expectancy 28 with a down arrow we're like getting worse and so you look up and say hey why are things going poorly and then everyone's like oh you know don't worry about it like we we've got it's like oh really you've got it like you could look at any institution of american life and start questioning like the media and and the media is actually now the defining uh institution for a lot of partisans at this point where 69 percent of democrats have a high trust in the media and if you look at republicans it's down to 15 so what you're seeing in terms of the two-party system is that democrats kind of embody and trust these fading and failing institutions and then republicans have this anti-institutionalist fervor which is like that you know this shit's not working uh tear it up break it up and what i'm hoping that we can provide is this middle ground the ford party is say these institutions have real problems and we need to upgrade them we need to try and have them get with the program um and the hope is that that actually can clarify people's sense of what the real problems are but the institutional mistrust has been earned yeah i want to talk about this because this hit me like a a pile of bricks when i was reading it is you actually talk about the institutions you're talking about media and education all of these other things but the core institution that's at the base layer of all of these other institutions is democracy itself right our governance protocol because that's the way we actually improve these institutions is through a decision-making process we call it democracy right in theory theory right and you said this you said democracy itself is losing legitimacy what did you mean by that this past election is still in question in the minds of tens of millions of americans uh i think 21 million americans say that force is warranted to try and restore who they believe the rightful president is so in that environment and again if only 15 of republicans trust the media then you can't rely upon elections to peacefully transfer power from administration to administration i mean that sounds dire but we're seeing this play out in real life one of the things that i'm going around on my book tour talking about is that at this point everything is on the table in american life and generally speaking when i talk about that i'm being kind of bleak honestly like whatever crazy you can imagine in american life like riots and civil war and and uh disintegration uh it's all possible you know i mean we we have actually seen uh an insurrection attempt uh in washington that that cost american lives like whatever crazy you can think of it's on the table uh and so we have to try to accelerate the positive possibilities as well as the negative possibilities you know you know it's like like the things that other people regard as uh too good to be true it's like actually we probably could build an alternative financial system where people uh have control of their own data and it's seamless that there's trust i mean that it is fascinating how the cryptocurrency community really is in some ways the antidote to this mistrust because you're like hey like no one can even tamper with this stuff like i couldn't if i tried [Laughter] yeah we really do feel like this is a third path right you said you know uh some conservative republicans right now want to tear it all down democrats want to you know bolster the existing solutions right and i i get the forward party is really a third path it's kind of this middle ground of reform the crypto path is operating in parallel and its motif is like let's build a parallel system and a new source of trust for some of these things in some of these institutions but we'll get to that in a second i uh oh it's true the parallels are very very strong uh you know and i love that i mean you there's like a new way in crypto and there's a new way hopefully uh with the forward party i mean that that's the goal and i will say too i people probably gathered this but the the ford party wants to help the cryptocurrency community navigate this political landscape and see to it that uh our legislators don't do something dumb and crippling well we definitely need that help because uh we don't have very many allies when it comes to uh capitol hill and so we are we are looking to bolster our ranks and in addition towards uh what you were saying well one thing i can say just to chime in on this david so so the forward party um can support democratic and republican candidates who are for example pro crypto and we can intervene in primaries like we can do whatever we want so this is something that i want to do like i want to help reform government and build the future and so to the extent that there are different approaches that the cryptocurrency community wants to take i think the forward party can be one approach absolutely um and one of the best things about the crypto society cryptoculture crypto people is that we generally are inherently a political we're not ideological we enjoy innovation as our solutions rather than tribalism as our solutions uh even though the crypto world does does come to be very very tribal at times um it's a it's the irony of it all david because the forward party is kind of the anti-polarization anti-tribalism tribe so i get it i get it right andrew in addition to talking about how our democracy has lost legitimacy there's also a section in your bank about how or excuse me in your book about how the banking system also uh you ran up against in trying to achieve your goals and in our minds the democracy side and then also the finance uh world are kind of like the two pillars that are holding up our entire country it's how is our country going to be run and how are we also going to allocate money towards the rest of the economy uh and you had this ubi experiment where you wanted to distribute a bunch of cash towards a bunch of different people so you could prove it yeah so you could prove the efficacy of ubi can you uh talk about the problems that you ran up against when you tried to do this yes so it was march of 2020 the pandemic had just started and i was looking around saying what's the most positive thing i can do and so what i came up with was giving a million dollars to a thousand poor families in the bronx and i thought this would have a few effects number one it would enable them to stay indoors and adhere to uh public safety guidelines if that was uh hard for them because maybe they had to leave the home to get stuff or work or something and i also wanted it to be an emblem for what our leaders should do which is like look we should just be sending people cash to stay home when the pandemic first had us isolating and so i called jp morgan chase and i called citibank and was like hey we'd like to identify a thousand of your poorest customers in the bronx so we can send them a thousand bucks each i mean pretty good deal right um you could probably guess what happened next uh they they gave us the run around and then we went through regulatory and then they shot it down saying like oh they're like privacy problems and meanwhile i'm gonna guess that anyone who has an account with these banks would have loved a thousand bucks and would not have had a problem with citibank or jpmorgan chase sharing their information for this purpose but being an entrepreneur i kind of guessed that they might not be able to oh the next thing i did is i said hey how about you just give us like 4 000 250 gift cards or bank cards or or cash cards like debit cards um we'll maybe be able to use those maybe i'll like run around and like give them away or like mail them to people in the bronx uh and they couldn't even do that now that one was a mild surprise i was like that really did not sound that hard you know it's like just give us some freaking debit cards um but being an entrepreneur at the same time i was running around trying to find institutional partners who might have these relationships and i found one in the form of neighborhood trust that works with the working poor and so we they actually had a bank account information they had a credit union so they had uh accounts for a thousand four families in the bronx so we went through them we gave each of these families a thousand bucks and then a neighborhood trust even did a counseling session with each of them so they knew it was coming in the rest of it very very positive i actually still run into people um who got that money uh occasionally or someone who knows them it's like hey hey my friend got a thousand bucks from you like you know we'll always appreciate you and i was like oh thanks um but you can tell i mean like our banking system just wasn't up to the challenge and then when our government decided to follow suit and send 1200 checks to tens of millions of americans how did they do it the irs they said you know what you know like we have tax returns we'll send checks we'll put money into people's accounts that had a lot of problems too i mean there are a lot of people at the bottom end of the income scale that don't file taxes very sensible right i mean if you're making below a certain threshold you're working out the books so they didn't get anything meanwhile the government of togo set up a digital currency payment system and uh got some like uh digital money which translated a real money to millions of people in one of the poorest countries in the world so like we had this scrappy non-profit we managed to get this million dollars out the u.s government we just relied upon these old pipes and everyone looks up and is like yeah that's fine i mean to me it's not fine it's like you missed millions of people that probably could have used it the most i totally agree this is actually an area that uh that crypto can solve um you know fairly easily sort of air dropping you know stable coins or dollars to individuals accounts um but but i'm curious because you sort of see this is like the the basics of a banking system right the ability to send a simple payment and you i think conclude that chapter with like if that's broken we can't even distribute a simple payment via existing banking system like what else is broken is the rest of the banking system broken what are these other areas in the economy that are broken i'll say another thing that you know crypto community often talks about with the existing banking system if you want to save money right you put it in the bank account a savings account you're earning point zero one percent interest right how is that a savings good old point zero one percent interest i mean you're supposed to you don't even bother because don't even bother and or or you just i guess you're forced if you have any scrap of savings at the end of the month to invest in the stock market or something else right there there are no savings accounts so if you compare our system to china it really does feel like the us banking system is behind is failing us and you know china's doing some innovative things with their you know fintech companies but they're adding a whole level of state surveillance which obviously is not what we want uh but anyway that's a hallmark of a broken system i want to talk about another chapter in your book andrew um big tech they can they seem to control everything around us these days right we've entered this digital era but we don't have digital property rights in the digital era and so large social media companies own all of our digital property they own our usernames they own our passwords they own all of our data we don't have any of the data is that a problem in your mind very much so and it's it's bad for our mental health it's bad for our human agency uh it it's appropriating more than 200 billion dollars a year in economic value from us that we're not seeing a dime i actually kind of got a laugh out of this entire facebook whistleblower uh stuff because she she has unearthed these reports saying facebook knows that facebook is bad for you and then i was like that's newsworthy like didn't we already know this like what's going on seen a few documentaries already yeah you know at this point it's common sense there i knew that i'd already seen studies saying that at least teenage girls were getting super depressed on instagram and the rest of it uh and and so horrors like facebook had data saying that it depresses people you know like it was i mean i shouldn't laugh because you know that shit's up but it but it's one of the things about our data that's getting you know uh used against us and so i i believe that we should have the ability to own our own data even if we decide to lend it or lease it to various companies for our own convenience and the single biggest uh ridiculous example of where we are are those consent agreements we all click i agree i agree it's like what the heck is going on with those agreements like no one knows you know just like it's pretty much like just sell your stuff to us and pray for the best and click this button and then you're like okay and then you just move on and you hope nothing blows up um but it's not the sweet deal that a lot of people hoped it was when we came up with this as the business model so i i guess i want to zone in on this right we've got these problems and these are just two examples you have you have chapters on this that's the middle part of your book all around the different problems and the ways the institutions have failed us we haven't talked about media and other things but i guess to your point about facebook like we all know that these social media companies are a problem we all know that our banking system sucks isn't great could be upgraded but here's the thing nothing ever gets done to fix it no capital okay so tell us pretty in summary right yeah why why does nothing ever get done about this stuff well the the main reason is that nothing will happen to anyone if nothing is done about this stuff uh so congress's approval rating nationally right now is 28 so three out of four americans don't like what's going on or not going on they've noticed the re-election rate for individual members is 92 percent which is a pretty freaking high re-election rate you know i mean you can't get much higher than that and and so you have essentially near permanent job security for these legislators regardless of whether or not these problems get solved and again if you did try and meaningfully solve a problem you'd be much more likely to lose your job because it probably would have involved some compromise maybe you reach across the aisle some people will accuse you of being ideologically impure of working with the enemy that you know like you're not the true warrior that i wanted and one of the reasons why the incentives are so polarized and extreme is that the folks who will decide whether or not you come back to office in two years are not the everyday voters in your community but they're the most rabid extreme partisans on either side uh real oddballs like people who are just super plugged in to party activities and will be there and just yell and scream at you if you deviate from orthodoxy so in this people that shift the overton windows against the people in the middle yes that's true they're they're just saying don't do it don't do it be ideological be extreme and so in this environment you're actually more surprised if something does get solved than if it doesn't so andrew we have this broken broken democracy we have this broken uh we and we have so many other things in our nation that are also broken that we would love some effective regulation for yet nothing seems to get done about it and so this is perhaps the motivations behind why you've created the forward party because you think that like if you try and fix it from the left well then you are ultimately fighting the right and if you try and fix it from the right well then you have to fight the left so you need to make something in the middle which you've labeled the forward party which i think is a great name and one of the big platforms that the forward party is standing on is this idea of open primaries and ranked choice voting and as ryan said in the beginning this is in crypto terms what we consider a protocol upgrade where if we have these systemic problems the only way you solve systemic problems is with systemic solutions so andrew why are these the systemic solutions that we need to go after why is this going to be the the thing that helps fix everything else so this has happened in real life in the state of alaska love you alaska i don't know how many listeners are in alaska so uh last year alaska switched to open primaries and ranked choice voting um which means that the current legislators can take their case to the entire electorate and not just the 20 most rabid partisans and there was an example of what happened here where senator lisa murkowski of alaska voted to impeach donald trump the only republican senator to do so who was also up for re-election next year her approval rating among alaskan republicans now stands at six percent so it like it genuinely was political suicide that if she had to go through a primary she loses for sure but because of the protocol upgrade she doesn't need to go through the gauntlet of the 20 most extreme she can just say to all alaskans look you know you like me give me another shot uh you know i'm an independent person like i have my own judgment and opinions and so what we need to do is flip the switch in states around the country so that the reasonable middle actually gets rewarded politically that people who are willing to do work and compromise with the other side get rewarded and it's doable via ballot initiatives in 24 states around the country it happened in alaska it cost seven million dollars to flip that switch in alaska and i'm going to suggest that liberating two senators and probably the same number of members of congress from perverse incentives was like the best investment of like seven million that that a lot of us can imagine um so imagine running around to another 20 states and doing that let's say that costs i don't know 500 million or something like that because alaska is a pretty cheap media market so it's not like they'll be seven like some of the states get pretty expensive um but if you were to make our government more rational more reasonable more productive more prone to compromise uh for 500 million dollars i mean that'd be like the best investment of all time given that you know uh uh the direction we're heading now is dysfunction and eventual civil war in my opinion not to be hyperbolic but it really is on the table i don't know if people sense that i i think crypto senses that for sure like we're right there with you like that it's true like crypto folks would be like yeah i could see it yeah we could totally see it all right so but let's dig into the to the mechanism here right so uh i understand that this is a very practical solution good roi right can be done in a lot of states by ballot initiatives but but guidance through for for somebody who's not politically minded and some in crypto um aren't right they're part of that a lot of you aren't because you're too busy making  happen and you're like why would i give myself brain damage by looking at politics some people in crypto just kind of stay away from politics as a matter of fact but like well also because politics is all this like tribal and like that's not your jam either i get that too okay but open open critical upgrades are our jam okay so we don't understand i agree i agree yeah what what's what's an open primary like so what was it like before was it only democrats and republicans two parties could run and with an open primary does that mean basically anybody can run unaffiliated and anyone you don't have to be a democrat or republican registered anyone can vote for them among the among the population is that what that looks like that is what it looks like but i want to take it back to first principles because i think it'll be interesting to people if you look at the constitution you won't find a word about political parties because the founding fathers weren't fans they actually tried to warn people against political parties john adams said the worst nightmare would be two political parties because they would just smash each other into oblivion and nothing would happen i mean uh you know imagine that and so all of the mechanics of these elections are decided at the state level uh and the political parties are not official fixtures of government they just happen to run everything um that they are you know depending upon which one you're looking at something like 150 years old that sort of thing and so a closed party primary is the norm in most of the country and what it means is that if you're a democrat who's registered as a democrat you can vote the democratic primary and if you are not a registered democrat you cannot vote in in that primary i can use an example my own race the new york city mayoral primary about 900 000 people voted in the democratic primary all of whom were registered democrats now this city has 9 million people or so in it so 10 of people voted in what was almost certainly going to decide the next mayor of this city independents and republicans who were registered to vote had to switch their registration four months before the election in order to vote in the primary who the heck is going to switch your registration four months before the election so they'll come up to me four weeks ahead of the election and be like i want to vote for you what do i do and i'm like you are three months too late so so that that's the norm in most of the country is a closed party primary and what you want to do is exactly what you just described make it so that you can run under any party line any affiliation raise your hand like ryan could show up i don't encourage this right i know maybe i do ryan could show be like hey i'm running for congress it's under the bankless party the forward party we might actually do that at some point who knows so you never know you should yeah you you'd have a a great set of stories um so you you so you put your name your party next to it and then everyone just votes for whomever they want uh and then the the top five vote getting candidates go to the general and have something called a ranked choice voting uh final general election so the ranked choice voting is a system where you can rank up to five candidates by your order of preference so if you just love ryan you can just be like ryan is my guy number one and just walk out but maybe you like ryan first and then david second and then andrew third so you go one two three uh you know ryan david andrew and rank choice voting is incredibly powerful because it eliminates what's called the spoiler effect it also can make it so that if you had two republicans and one democrat in the final five the two republicans don't cannibalize each other which is everyone's concern um and then somehow make it so that the democrat wins because let's say i was a republican i came in and they're the two republicans and one democrat i could vote for my favorite republican first and then my second favorite republican second and then and then there isn't like a vote splitting uh that happens you get rid of the spoiler effect it discourages negative campaigning because if i trash you then we both look bad and then the other candidates look better by comparison uh you can end up building interesting coalitions because even if i don't command 51 percent of the vote let's say i have an issue let's call it crypto let's say i show up it'll be like hey i'm a one issue candidate i'm the crypto candidate i don't have 50 of support but i've got 10 of support and then someone else is trying to build their coalition they'll look at you and be like what is your issue well how about i adopt that issue and then maybe i can have your support and then they can try and get their way to 51 so it empowers dynamism it empowers minority points of view it gets rid of the party dominance of everything because right now you you have no chance of winning if you don't have a d or an r next to your name and and the machinery has to anoint you essentially in a lot of these places so this upgrade combination of open primaries and rank choice voting would introduce genuine uh ideological and political diversity and innovation and dynamism andrew i want to check this mental model against your beliefs and see and see if this is right one of the metaphors that really helped me understand how our democracy and our political system ended up being the way that it is is that we have the republicans and the democrats and these are kind of two monopolies that are trying to consume everything right they want and because there's only two of them that's what stretches the middle and pushes the middle towards the fringes and a lot of the behaviors or the incentives that we've seen such as like actually registering with a party not being able to vote outside of your party are efforts in continually to monopolize more and more of the voting base and so when i see these two protocol upgrades i'm seeing something along similar along the efforts of some anti-trust uh efforts or you know straight-up anti-monopoly efforts and so these new mechanisms allow for people to express like you said a greater diversity of opinions without being confined under these monopolies that the democrats and the republicans have established upon our democracy how do you feel about that take now that's very apt right now 62 percent of americans say they want an alternative to the two major parties 60 say both parties are out of touch and so imagine if you were an entrepreneur and you arrived on the scene and there was a marketplace with two companies and 60 of people said hey i want a third choice like wouldn't you rush to start a third choice right though people have been wanting an alternative for a long time but the two parties have tried to suppress any real competition so that's the world as it stands everyone wants a choice but the two parties don't want to give you that choice and i have a feeling that the crypto community is going to look at that and say you know what i think that eventually the duopoly is going to give because like that's not a sustainable situation like i think that's what most of us would think and it's been really interesting i started the forward party officially to the public uh you know maybe 10 days ago or something along those lines and there's just so much both enthusiasm and like and they're not going to let you win kind of thing it's like the duopoly is going to like try and crush you in various ways um and i have to say that's energized me i've kind of enjoyed it where i'm like oh like this is like uh you know like the reflexive resistance of the machine where they're trying to squash you and suppress you in various ways um but i have a feeling most people listening to this would look at this and say there's no way this duopoly is just going to keep on lumbering on yeah and i have a feeling it's not going to work can you i have a feeling they're not going to be able to squash you and suppress you they've been saying that about crypto for years right and the the resilience is when you have a bottom-up movement that is by the people for the people and you have the support of the people it's very decentralized it's very hard to crush it's very hard to choke off um i wanna you know in one of your recent uh interviews i think you used this term that also uh perked my ears up and i think the crypto community probably resonates with is you said these protocol upgrades that's open primaries ranked choice voting is actually anti-authority like anti-authoritarianism right it's like protection against authoritarianism it really is what do you mean by that because we're all about that in crypto right not left but right but we are definitely anti-authoritarian what do you mean by that how does this protocol upgrade help that cause let's say hypothetically you had a really really bad leader of one of the major parties they got control of the party and then everyone in that party all of a sudden uh falls in line or they lose their job and and that's a situation now this is a situation that the founding fathers would have been trying to prevent at all costs but they never imagined that there'd be only two major parties at this scale and so the safeguards institutionally are pretty weak where if you have one major party succumb to authoritarianism they can run the government uh fairly um seamlessly i mean it you know not i mean our government's really clunky and cludgy so it's not like they can like make make some some things happen but they can exert authority over a lot of the government um fairly autocratically now that's just a poorly designed system and one of the things i'm saying is that the duopoly is poor design and again the founding fathers would have looked up and been like this is the stupidest design of all time if you were going to try and resist authoritarianism because it's like one point of failure like you just get through there then all of a sudden they're like oh runs one of the major parties only two of them like you know they have a lot of brain like a lot of lovers and so if you had a more intelligent system which by the way most other democracies have the uk has five parties germany has seven sweden eight the netherlands eighteen and so there if you have a party that has really bad leadership that's a problem but that's not like an existential problem where you get an authoritarian that rules a country it's like you have one party that loses its mind for a while and then the other party is like oh i hope they get it together but but then that one party can't like convince three other parties to just fall under their thrall it's one reason why this duopoly is just so dumb like this duopoly is almost set up to allow for authoritarianism it's so it incentivizes it right it's the logical conclusion it kind of does incentivize it it is a logical conclusion and that's one of the things i'm trying to open people's eyes to where it's like look this system is going to fail first it's going to fail to deliver for the people and second it's going to fail to stop an authoritarian from taking control of the whole thing so what we have to do is upgrade the protocol and design it more intelligently as quickly as possible and by the way we don't have a whole lot of time um and and then you make that case and then people just start you know lobbying partisan accusations at you and you're like you are not hearing what i'm saying at all matcha everyone's favorite dex aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless

that you wanted to to give out to the people of new york and recently on twitter you also tweeted out uh a tweet when talking about uh talking to some crypto folk uh ubi doesn't have to be denominated in fiat so has your experiences trying to get ubi out the door and into the hands of people uh have you thought about how crypto would relate to this subject matter and help helping serve ubi to the people oh yeah when i talk to people in the cryptocurrency community some of them love the idea of alleviating poverty through cryptocurrency you can get the resources in people's hands much more seamlessly as we've discussed and you can do it via different digital currencies or tokens and so there are a lot of people who are working in that direction and i tweeted earlier i guess it was a couple months ago now i said cryptocurrency is one path to universal basic income uh because i believe it is you know there's absolutely nothing saying that it needs to be denominated in us dollars or or fiat now if i'd gotten control of the government like i would have done it via us dollars so i'm not going to lie i mean i totally still want to do that but if we can do it via other currencies i'd be equally excited i just talking about the subject of ubi because i think of the the six sort of solutions that uh you go through in your book um these are the two almost like closest to the protocol upgrades right the like the you know ranked choice voting and open primaries and also ubi like these are direct things that can be done um and just relaying maybe what the crypto community might think about this i think a lot of the crypto community is sort of supportive right you know they see that the wealthy have had sort of quantitative easing asset price inflation for the last 10 years and so like some getting some money to the non-wealthy and equalizing things kind of balances things out right and obviously you mentioned the ability to do this via crypto crypto platforms crypto rails you know ben bernanke says you could open up a fed account and you could distribute that via your crypto mechanisms for instance but there is an aspect that some people in crypt i will tell you are uncomfortable with andrew and i'm wondering if you could address some of these concerns about um ubi and that's some in the crypto community are very worried about manipulation of let's call it the the money printer okay um that is the power to mint coin the you know because this power generally ends up in the hands of the wealthy elite as we've seen in the past who end up using the money printer to benefit themselves there's also the the concern about inflation maybe either asset price inflation or just you know plain old cpi you know prices go up at the grocery store what are your thoughts on these two criticisms coming out of some of the crypto community i i understand i have friends in the community um so we have conversations about this stuff to me we're already putting the money out there we're just doing it poorly to the wrong parties so what do i mean uh the cares act that was passed last year was 2.2 trillion usd uh a very very small fraction of that went to people and families 17 percent by one account so 83 went where airlines banks like big institutions were just like jammed money into their pipes [Laughter] and then there were a lot of people who were suffering in various ways uh even though we actually did engage the printer as you you said so to me right now we're in the worst of all worlds where we're like engaging the printer like the people who need it most aren't getting it so i'd want to invert the ratio where if you were if you're going to put out 2.2 trillion dollars i'd want to see 83 of it go to people and families um who are struggling during that time um so that that's the point i make to folks is like look we're doing it we're just doing it really really badly and poorly um now the the second aspect is like does that end up pushing prices up uh it would push prices up in certain categories uh you know that you can see it um the one of the major problems we have and i've dug into what what's making people the saddest where if you look at the primary sources of inflation in the us economy it falls into three categories education health care and housing and education and healthcare are particularly dysfunctional markets uh people feel like they don't have any choice but to pay and so the the firms just say well how much are we going to raise prices by this year this much that everyone's like what you know but then he's like well what am i going to do not send my kid to school or like not like you know get that medical treatment uh and so what you'd want to do is you'd want to attack the real sources of inflation where they exist i do believe in a lot of the consumer categories prices are fairly stable because you see a lot of competitiveness and efficiency in those markets when the supply chain is actually functioning at a high level which right now you know it's not that's i think also uh causing some of the the price increases that we're seeing it's not buying power it's just that you know people aren't able to uh get the materials they need to the um the retailers so andrea we we've covered i think two main things some of the the problems the institutional problems that we've seen the problems underlying the american democracy we've covered some of your solutions you've got some more embedded in the principles of the forward party but you know the the two big ones are open primaries and ranked choice voting and also ubi and some other things i want to talk to you a bit about um crypto right and let's have that conversation because in reading through your book and digesting all of the information that you put out and your your goals your initiatives um david and i and i think many in the crypto community can't help but see a ton of alignment okay so here are the base core principles that we might be aligned on andrew first we see the same core problems institutional problems systemic problems that aren't going to go away by just electing another new shiny politician representative right these problems are deep they're embedded in the system um both crypto and i think the ford party are super bipartisan right this is not crypto is not an issue that the left or the right or have taken you could say non-partisan exactly there is really no allegiance um it's also a popular movement that's on the fringe and so i remember like when you started talking about ubi in like 2017 2018 how much on the fringe that was right like everyone thought that was just over wacky town well we've been there with crypto they they used to think crypto was totally wacky town just you know drug dealers and you know shady things going on and so we've been there and we built that from the bottom up the the other thing is we want to upgrade protocols and we want to build new institutions crypto is not an industry that is trying to tear down existing institutions we're saying just want this is what we want and you said this recently which really resonated with me is um i think you were talking to crystal ball or somebody about like media and you said i have a theory that in the new world people won't trust institutions they'll trust people not institutions they'll trust people that is crypto okay so i guess i want to ask you is it you know do you see all of these alignments and what is there for you know the crypto community in the forward party i want to make the forward party the crypto party truly because i do see the alignment is very very deep and the parallels are so strong where you have this system you could say the political system of the financial system that you see that it's failing and flailing in its various ways and then you say okay maybe we can do better maybe we in my case i do want to try and help the political system upgrade itself and modernize itself one other thing i'm for that people i think will appreciate and i referred to it a little bit earlier is term limits for our representatives which by the way 75 of americans are for um and that would keep it from being such a gerundocracy where you have you know like folks who have been in dc for 25 30. that's another protocol upgrade um and i i want to make the case to legislators that the crypto currency community is a force for progress a force for innovation a massive provider of jobs uh you know i think i tweeted something where i said rule of thumb if you face a trillion dollar industry that could define the future like don't screw it up you know like it's a pretty it's a pretty simple message it's like guys like please please please like take a bit of time to figure out what the hell you're doing here because like this is a very very significant uh generator of jobs and value um i think that's pretty common sense i i will say to folks who are listening to this that some some people listening to this are like oh like we shouldn't be regulated at all like i i do think that there is going to have to be like some kind of uh sit down and uh kind of uh official um almost like a daytime like a you know uh but i i don't think it's realistic to say you're just gonna um do your own thing entirely like there will have to be some regulation but you know you want to do it the right way you want to do an intelligent way and i will say to everyone listening to this is that at root politics is about incentives and we have to just make the incentives stronger to be for crypto and understand crypto than just be someone who's like oh they're like these crazy dudes who are like building this like parallel financial system we're going to screw them while we can still screw them we're like we're going to like freaking kneecap them while we still got the crowbar i mean there are 100 some people who are thinking in those terms you know i think we've run across them yes yeah so so what we have to do is just make it in people's interests you know like it's pretty straightforward so if if the forward party has a a set of resources let's call it millions of dollars and then we go around the party primaries and like they're they're republicans running against republicans and democrats running against democrats and that is the practical reality like you know like i'm a practical dude it's not like they're like forward party candidates running around in these these races and so then not yet not yet i mean you know you gotta start start with uh what's going on out there and so i'll call someone out like there's a guy named brad sherman who's like a very anti-crypto we know brad oh yeah yeah there you go um like he's a democrat and he you know hates crypto he's like pretty much said like i'll do everything i can to destroy it i think i don't i forget what his words were um and then his opponent is a woman i'm friends with named uh erica uh rhodes and and um there it's democrat on democrat um and so we should support erica and say like hey check it out like you know you're you like crypto you get resources you have a better chance to win and politicians respond to resources and incentives like if they figure out wait a minute if i'm if i'm actually sympathetic to this industry like i'll get some resources then you'll see their attitude shift um so that's the game we should play you know if if this sounds positive the people listening to this give to the forward party and then we'll give to the politicians who understand your industry andrew they we are increasingly finding that the crypto folk are really really care about crypto yeah in fact there's the uh i would say that there's a increasingly high percentage of them that that's kind of the only thing that they care about they're a single issue voter and very happens to be extremely well capitalized i i also will say beyond helping candidates which i totally want to do like we also need to have a very high level washington lobbying organization that can talk to congressional offices and the rest of it um i i'm here to tell you all that lobbying really works like it's one reason why these industries do it um like these industries go in there and sometimes they can make things happen but more often they can keep things from happening that's like now the washington arrangement it's like i can't do anything but keep you from doing it too um and and so this is something where the cryptocurrency community needs to play catch-up um so support candidates yes but also talk directly to congressional offices and they do again respond to resources i mean like you know if you go in and say look like you you just said david where you're like look we've got resources we care it's not it's not enough to have resources and care we have to do what we do which is be smart go in and be like okay like what are the pressure points where can we apply resources where can we apply influence and then you'll see results one of the ways that i see alignment in one of the many ways i see alignment between the crypto world and and the platform that you are are promoting andrew is that um you want to say something no no yeah please i just want to share my experience in lobbying for cash relief um and so this is one of the things that that we can do together the cryptocurrency community and if there's someone who represents a cryptocurrency community they can get meetings with legislators i believe or at least their staff and the staff is just as good because the staff control the policy levels very much like the um the legislator will look at the staff and be like where am i on this and then they'll ask their policy director for a brief um but when i was lobbying congress for cash relief one of the things that was interesting was like i would uh get you know my team would reach out like we had a lobbying operation um and which we still do by the way um and so the lobbying operation would reach out to these legislators and one of the things that we found made life easier was like hey will you take a call with andrew yang and it turns out that legislators are very happy to talk to andrew yang because i'm famous and they saw me on tv and i've got like a couple million followers and the rest of it and so they imagine that if they talk to andrew yang then like some some like social media magic might rub off on them and like well you know like like i'm like i'm someone they recognize so my my ability to get a meeting with the legislator is very very high um and and that was something that i learned you know like i didn't know that but like i had calls mainly zoom um because it was 2020 um with 65 legislators or whatnot where just like have a zoom with them and just like talk through things and then their policy person would be on the zoom uh and so we'd we'd talk through in that case it was like hey you know like casually if like a lot of people in your district really like it it's like very helpful like that we should probably do it um and and so that that is like the blocking and tackling of this stuff but i've found that having someone who they recognize who they think has some clout um who they think has some resources behind them uh like it makes it a lot easier to get the meeting i want to unpack this because i think this is really really important andrew you you have completely in your 2020 election campaign you completely shifted the conversation with regards to ubi but more about money shifting the conversation about money and also society and that is something that we in the crypto world definitely need to learn how to do because crypto generally has a pretty negative stigma of with people that don't know about crypto uh and yet it is something that everyone in crypto sees as beneficial towards society if we could just figure out how to explain it so what lessons from your 2020 campaign about shifting the conversation shifting the overton window about who thinks uh what about ubi what lessons do you have to teach us in the crypto world about how we can do the same the single biggest lesson i'm going to give you and this is in my book is that people listen to other people and it was what i said to crystal too um so when i started my presidential campaign it was actually called ubi 2020 because i was like you know i don't want this to be about me i want this to be about the ideas and that was a very dumb idea on my part ubi 2020 would have been a total done really and part of it i will confess to you all too was my self-consciousness at the time as like just a fairly regular guy i mean that there was some discomfort being like you know yang for president like it just felt a little bit uncomfortable um but i i realized that was exactly what i needed to do so if you want to try to convert people's perception of the crypto community you're going to need a human being you're going to need an ambassador who then goes out there and pounds the message and can convey the qualities that you want conveyed in a way that will humanize both the community and the industry uh and that's a tall order because who wants to be that guy you know what i mean like like what a drag you know and and also because of some of like the misconceptions people will probably be like oh like look at this person they're like out to like protect theirs and whatnot you know so it's but that is genuinely i think what it would take i don't know if that's helpful well i mean elizabeth warren just labeled us our entire industry as a bunch of shadowy super coders so we definitely have an uphill battle to get after wow that does sound very sinister i guess it could have been worse than the schemer things it's okay andrew we put on t-shirts now and wear it proudly it's kind of cool actually she made it cool it turned into a cultural meme yeah um but so honestly david and i thought in this section we were gonna have to uh like pitch you on a few things that solutions crypto could do you know for for kind of the ford party platform but he here you are at the outset saying hey the ford party is the crypto platform so maybe you know the board party is just about making things work better which i'm going to suggest is the crypto platform it is yes yeah so so so let's talk about this here's what we've been looking for as the crypto community is number one a uh politician with some legitimacy and call it like you know uh clout i guess it's the kids are calling it these days um to actually talk positively about crypto but but not in a way that's like pie in the sky actually know about crypto enough to talk about the key talking points right being able to use crypto being able to uh you know go into detail on why crypto is good for society not just number go up not just a small pool of people benefit but like the the pros of crypto because that story is not getting told in mainstream like number one that's what we do yeah there needs to be like an implementation where you can frankly show the politician around the community that has been impacted in this way like that like that's the kind of that would work yeah and the second thing we want um is it some policy right some like ideas like a platform on crypto so there are all of these unresolved things andrew and crypto like we don't really have clarity on our taxes and there's a little bit of clarity but like we don't really know we don't have clarity on what's uh what's a uh security and what's a commodity all right and hester purse a commissioner at the sec has proposed things like a sandbox for crypto fantastic idea why is no one adopting sec commissioner hester purse's idea from two years ago to create a sandbox for some of these tokens to let innovation thrive we need that we need some clarity from the cftc on what's a commodity and whether smart contracts are regulated the same way intermediary institutions are regulated we need some clarity from fencing what we're really looking for i think in the crypto community is not like no government intervention stay away from crypto is a partnership with the us government because like we really feel like the us's adoption of crypto is like adoption of the internet in the 1990s it's like the us could be home to the next silicon valley a ton of the top decentralized finance engineering teams are us-based they're here but they're getting driven out right now andrew because we have a anti-crypto regulatory regime going on and the us has not proved itself yet to be a home for crypto innovation so we we'd only need a spokesperson and kind of a party alignment behind this we also need like uh a policy some some like ideas to actually implement a few things to say to them look let's have the sandbox uh that was recommended let's give some clarity on what coins are commodities versus securities i mean like these things are yeah these things are relatively common sense um and the partnership you're describing in my mind needs to exist because the last thing you want to do is drive this talent this ingenuity uh out of the u.s i mean like that there is a capacity here to do something really important and profound but there's going to be reflexive resistance on the part of regulators really if you're a regulator you look at it and be like oh like what are my choices here like they're they're naturally going to land uh on stuff that i think is going to be onerous and uh obtrusive uh that that's going to cause problems because they'd rather do that than uh in their minds like leave uh all these holes but that right now they're just not even being decisive and if i'm you all i think the major problem i mean obviously you'd rat you'd rather than be indecisive and decisive in a bad way um but like the the thing that you don't have really is any kind of clarity or transparency uh or um um like timeline you're just like what the hell are we doing we're in like this weird holding pattern and again a weird holding pattern is better than them it up but [Laughter] but but at some point particularly when you're talking about the level of value that we are now it's like you you need an intelligent approach that gives people clarity andrew we've been talking about the number of ways between the between how the forward party and the crypto people are aligned but i actually want to take this a step further because there are a number of uh drums that you've been beating policies that you've been advocating that i actually think that you might not be able to do without crypto or at least it's going to be significantly easier if you do it using crypto infrastructure and one of the visions that you've had for the world i want to tap into now is the concept of a social currency or social credits can you talk about your your vision for what a social currency is one of the there are a lot of problems in american life but one of them is that jobs are disappearing and people would all the time come to me when i was talking on the presidential campaign they're like look you know a job isn't just a money it's a community it's structure it's purpose and fulfillment i would be like i know i know like like i want those things in the worst way uh and so the the problem we're going to face is that there are going to be more and more americans that are on the outside looking in uh and if you were brutally honest you would say look if we're just going to judge this person based upon the monetary value of their time like they're gonna be more and more people where you're like shrug look like i can have ai do the call center job you used to do and so like you know what what choices are we gonna have um and if we just let the market take it to the extremes and you're gonna wind up with like some very very like terrible situations and so one of the things i wanted to do i still want to do is create more touch points in the economy for people who do things that we're excited about um that paying them dollars for uh you know could be one approach but maybe we can also reward them with some new currency that they can cash in in their local businesses or or at their local nonprofits and it gives you a you can think of it as like an amex points for like volunteering or something along those lines um there there was a practice called time banking where if i do something for you then i get like a in essentially an hour that i can then pass to someone else be like hey like do this for me and then they get the hour it's really cool um and and so the the goal is to create new opportunities for people um where they're able to help someone in the community based upon something that they can provide that might not be like the highest order activity in the world honestly it could be like babysitting like lugging crap out of your house like whatever it is um to try and create more touch points for people and i think there are ways to do it that don't involve money because a lot of these things that you you are asking people to do i think it would actually work better if it wasn't just cash you know what i mean like where if someone's volunteering in a non-profit or tutoring you don't necessarily want to be like here's here's five bucks like if you whereas if you give them some new form of currency then it would serve the same impact and then people would both value it and monetize it in different ways so andrew i think that this same exact vision for the world is being executed by what in the crypto world we're calling the world of daos which are uh unfortunately decentralized autonomous or yeah i love it they're working on the forward now as we speak i think yeah where some folks are coming together to say well they you know i mean they they ended they're very fast so they've already read my book and we're like hey we should make this happen and oh by the way yang we don't really need you to do anything because you know like that that's the beauty of the dao right right right so that is absolutely phenomenal and for listeners who are tuning into this show and have not heard yet of dao's like andrew said it stands for digital autonomous organizations i kind of think it's a terrible name i think that really they should just be called digital organizations but the power behind these digital organizations is they all centered around the token that they minted a new currency that is an internal currency to that organization and that internal currency can be passed around as people contribute towards the organization and so we are using these this crypto infrastructure to mint new coin and that coin is a collectively shared currency that people pass around as they as they contribute and then in in theory the value of this currency also reflects the value of the organization and so in the crypto world we actually think that we found a way to make sustainable wealth generation that is human oriented rather than like corporation or like you know monopoly oriented and i think that this actually this blossoming dow ecosystem which is generating a ton of excitement inside of the crypto world hopefully we can find a way to export this same infrastructure that we've created this wealth generation infrastructure towards the rest of america and the rest of the world and it also represents kind of a form of ubi if we can mint new coin that's not the dollar and actually send that to people's wallets using these very efficient crypto rails and then have the value of these things be associated with the power of the organization that they represent and these organizations are permissionless to enter because anyone that feels like they can contribute can enter them we think that this very much aligns with a lot of the drums that you've been beating for the past few years i couldn't agree more it's such a wonderful vision it's perfectly aligned with this uh social credit that i described in my last book uh yeah let's make it happen you know one of the things i do want to try and close on for people um is this is like the realization i had like hopefully after listening to me talk for a while it's like oh yang reminds me of some people i know like i'm like you know i don't think i'm that dissimilar from a lot of you and i made the ridiculous decision to run for president a number of years ago in part because i had this very strong conviction that some of the problems that were coming down the pike you would actually need the government to get a handle on uh you know um and you could you can be anti-government uh totally get it um but one thing i'm going to suggest to folks listening to this is like like you can't ignore politics anymore and that there may be you know a sign of that just the basic one is like well we can't ignore politics because they're just going to come and you know like do something really dumb like like that's a fine reason not to ignore politics you know what i mean like like that there are um both unsound problems and also interventions you want to try and make more intelligent um and rational so whether it's through me and the forward party whether it's through some other mechanism uh you're a massive community and you're going to have to do something i know that you haven't relished in the past which is kind of stick your head in and figure out what the hell is going on with government certainly i'd love to be an asset and an ally in this but i do want to suggest to people that you know i think now is the time like you know like it's been played out over a particular period of time but like now now we're going to have to do it and it's part of the maturation and modernization uh of the community and the industry in my opinion i agree now is the time for crypto to get a bit more political now is the time for politicians to get crypto i think both are true yeah crypto get but get more political and political politicians get more crypto that's a very fine recommendation well on that note um i guess maybe this dovetails into uh what one of your chapters and with something we've been discussing uh earlier one of the problems is big tech kind of owns your data right and the idea with crypto is you own your data right ethereum for example is a digital property rights system and all of the you know digital data that you generate on ethereum is yours as a user and i guess in the spirit of uh politicians getting a bit more crypto we actually had we we heard right before a couple days before we recorded this podcast people found out that andrew yang was coming on banklust and there was one member of the crypto community who was super excited he'd actually purchased a um you might call it a domain name andrew so you know in the uh in the internet world this would be like a dot-com in the crypto world we have these unstoppable domains uh called dot eth domains i think did someone get me someone got sweet i'm going to show you this someone got you a sweet a sick dot eth i'm gonna show you this andrew yang dot eth this is uh the ethereum name service i'm gonna do a search on this this is the individual that uh that owns it right here um we only know this address actually we we're in touch with the community and he said prior to this meeting hey if andrew yang comes on the podcast i want to give him andrew yang dot eth as a domain name thank you ma i i love this so much i'm really grateful i have historically been a little bit slow to get various domain names so i had to get andrew yang.com off of another andrew yang because there are a lot of us so this this so this means a great deal to me i realize how special it is thank you thank you thank you this is reserved until 20 uh 26 andrew and we can coordinate off the call with some of your people and and find out a way to to make sure you get this your ether dress connected yes thank you andrew this is your passport into web3 instead of having an email and password to log into uh you know facebook or twitter in the world of crypto this is your login information and this is how you retain rights over your data and also if you want to play in the crypto twitter games this is also if you're uh an ethereum person you put a dot eat at the end of your name to signify your tribe you know i'm so grateful i feel like you guys just gave me the keys to an internet castle well this is awesome and it's not us andrew to be clear it's not david or myself somebody from the community has stepped up he believes in the planet community absolutely so andrew i guess as we uh bring this to a close um i mean this has been super exciting to to talk to you about i think there's there's a kindred spirit here in the foreign party's platform and the crypto platform and i see lots of opportunity for collaboration moving forward i guess we've talked about some dark things though in uh you know throughout this conversation right you use the term even civil war you know political violence i've heard you say and these are very real threats but i think you are an optimistic person by nature or you wouldn't have written the book you wouldn't have run for president you wouldn't have talked about a solutions to some of the problems you see in the future leave us with some optimism here andrew what makes you optimistic about the 2020s the cryptocurrency community is an example of something that does get me excited where no one could have imagined it arising to this size and scale and impact over this last number of years and i do think that you all are something of a sleeping giant that if you decide to get involved in a particular direction you can do just about anything under the sun and i want you all to use that ability one to make sure that your industry stands the test of time and the government doesn't do anything dumb but then also to build a version of the future we'd be excited about i mean i am very very concerned about the future certainly of the us i mean you can see signs of degradation anywhere you look but i'm also someone who's seen incredible things arise out of nothingness you know i'm a serial entrepreneur i saw a national company just start out as one tutor and a starbucks i started a national nonprofit with nothing but a powerpoint deck and like a bit of resources and then it became a multi-million dollar organization that touched thousands and thousands of lives and created thousands of jobs so like i've seen the magic um you've all seen the magic too like you've seen uh things created out of thin air that have immense value and have changed lives like you know that this has the potential to change hundreds of millions of lives so let's do it let's get it done i mean it's not going to do itself that's for damn sure so it's like the spirit that you all embody in our channeling that's what gives me hope truly well andrew i think the last aspect of alignment between the crypto world and the forward party and and um what you've been saying for the past few years is that everyone in the crypto world is extremely optimistic uh and i think it's because of the future that we are trying to collectively build here gives us reason gives us reasons to be optimistic let's build that future let's do it let's build that future and and i do hope that everyone gravitates towards optimism and andrew i volunteered for your campaign in 2020 and i will be extremely optimistic about also helping support the forward party in 2022 and beyond thank you david thank you ryan you two are tremendous and uh yeah let's make this conversation like a bit of a an historic occasion i got andrew yang.ed the crypto community and the forward party have linked up uh hopefully we'll be able to look back on this that's something that helped shape our future for the better thank you both so much you're welcome andrew thank you for joining us and of course whenever you have a historical occasion in crypto you have to make an nft out of it so maybe some listener
