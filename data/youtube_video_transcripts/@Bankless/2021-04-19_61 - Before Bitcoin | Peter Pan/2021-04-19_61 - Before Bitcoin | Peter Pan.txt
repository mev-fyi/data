[Music] welcome to banqus where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm joined with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless david we've got an episode we've never done before can you describe what listeners are getting into today yeah i recently put out the article all about cryptoculture on the bankless newsletter and that was the first article that i ever did a discovery process on and so i went out to different people who i knew could speak about crypto culture because the theory is cryptoculture is awesome and fantastic and we all want to export it to the rest of the world but when i was talking to my friend amin solomani he forwarded me off to uh this before bitcoin series from peter pan and peter pan's been a key member of the ethereum ecosystem part of meadow cartel ventures and he has he back in 2018 wrote these four series about what he calls before bitcoin the history of cryptography and this is where i think cryptoculture really got instantiated in the first place where the early formation of these early cypherpunks who came together to fight fight these math-based battles math verse the world or math versus the government and that has defined a lot of what this industry has come to be and i immediately just realized how powerfully awesome these series are these written series are and so i wanted to get the get this information out to the world to as many people as possible because the story of bitcoin and ethereum and all the things that we're doing today on ethereum that story really started in the 70s it didn't start in 2009 when the bitcoin was first the first bitcoin block was mined and it didn't start in 2015 when ethereum was launched it started in 1970 when some of these early cypherpunks shook hands for the first time and decided to build something together guys this is really important listening for you today uh if you're in the bankless program you know that everything in crypto is an intersection between all of these various fields we've done episodes on the history of money before and that's important for you to understand but equally important is the history of cryptography that is one of the underpinnings of this entire system and this episode gives you the history of cryptography tracking all the way back to the cypherpunk roots and it gives you insight into the culture that surrounds crypto so it's absolutely required listing as far as format goes guys we're doing this a bit different we're doing something we've never done before think of this as an audio book if you use something like audible which i do all the time you're familiar with the format of audio books uh that effect essentially is what the the back half of this podcast episode is it's a full-fledged mini audio audiobook for you so at first right after this intro david and i are going to talk with peter pan who is the author of this audio book and uh get his insights into what we're about to get into and then this audiobook is is divided into four parts it starts with part one the 1970s around the public key saga part two the 1980s which gets through the origins of decentralization then the 1990s and the crypto wars and leads into 2000s and the birth of cryptocurrency so david's going to be reading it as if he is reading an audio book the format was fantastic for me to absorb this material and we think you're going to enjoy it as well so today you get a podcast plus an audiobook i'm really excited about this episode david yeah it's it's truly a hidden gem and i'm super happy that we were able to get what peter pan wrote into more ears it's well deserved and i think some of the information here is under appreciated uh and and perhaps just unknown uh and so we're going to make this uh information a little bit more known today all right with that we want to tell you about the sponsors who made this episode possible metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of defy here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage this means you can swap a wider range of tokens and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right bankless nation we are here with the author of this fantastic series peter pan he is a community first investor at 1kx he's also an investor and part of the leadership of the meta cartel ventures group and also venture dow peter how are you doing doing great thanks ryan uh peter this this series of articles that you wrote almost reads like a an audio book and that's that's kind of how i listen to it actually i listened to it before i actually read the series david was kind enough to record his voice reading through it uh and i just i just downloaded it into my brain that way but i was super impressed with the the depth of um of research but also kind of the the narrative through line that this series of articles put together it very much read like an audio book i i was wondering if you could maybe start with why did you write this piece a good question i'm by the way i'm super honored that you actually picked this up because it was just kind of floating out there right you know for a while um and it was actually one of the first things i really like worked on in the crypto space so i joined the crypto space about nearly three and a half nearly four years ago and um yeah it was just firstly me you know going for the usual cycle of like you know learning about tokens you know reading my papers being fairly you know lost uh amongst the buzz right and i think it was in late 2017 where i started going to a local film meetups where i was like look where in the first meetup i i ever really went to uh that was run by this guy called bucky poobot right um he's he was like the godfather of the ethereum uh sydney ethereum developer community so he told me you know like basic things such as like what is a network it's like you know what is a blockchain network what is the firm blockchain network well you know what is ether scan what are private keys and that was like you know i think my first one was in september uh of 2017 and i went down the rabbit hole into learning about the technology and i was pretty immersed by it and and i realized that you know web free and ethereum was going to be a very very special like uh you know it was going to be a place of special work like it was going to be the work that was being built was important um i didn't really know how or when right but i knew that there was a lot of catch-up work to do so i you know quit my role as a designer late that year and just you know i kind of time blocked myself like one year to like fully dedicate myself to learning about uh the firm ecosystem and you know to get involved and just to like figure stuff out and find a job in the space right um and you know initially as a i guess you know i was a designer doing user i guess user research ux design non-technical not don't have a computing background so i really started to just like ask questions like what is the frame network really what is it right like you know this network of you know computers running software across the internet like what is a computing uh network what are computers themselves what is the internet uh how does how do you i guess even you know transfer information across the internet securely right um i and i just like slowly started asking these questions uh all the way until like i started breaking it down to like i you know i guess go through the different abstraction levels of like uh you know from computers uh themselves understanding like how they communicate with each other network layer to understanding you know what is actual cryptography itself right to unders realizing it's just like you know it's all number theory in general right in discrete mathematics so try to like really grasp and you know gain a brief appreciation of each layer of abstraction and only once i did that did i realize i could really have a solid sense of where blockchains like really um fit in in this context of technology itself right and one of the things i also did was not only learn about the technology like uh i basically when i learned about each like piece of technology or each uh level abstraction i also try to understand and learn about you know who was the people behind them right um i generally find people much more interesting than just technology itself and i think when i came to the the part about cryptography i did the standard reading where i went for like obviously the history of like you know encryption in general right um from the ancient times to like the modern era and i think you know it was actually uh when i started learning about you know um asymmetric uh cryptography where i realized you know just slowly when i went for the history of the people involved i realized they had really strong linkages to the uh cypherpunk movement and and in cryptocurrency in general and i realized that you know um the lineage here is actually much stronger than you know people may have like made it out to be and i just like you know you know when i did this research was really you know unstructured i just realized i kept rambling to people about it because i was like i thought this was a really cool um story right and i realized i should just start writing about this and when i started writing about it uh it was also a part of my dis you know kind of research process as well of like you know digging through the different people involved right like david chong um you know the um like i guess you know uh diffy and like hellman people like that yeah kudos to you peter for for diving deep and going through the the research um you know when we introduce you and you have this in your twitter tagline we introduce you as a community first investor right and what what you did was basically not only some some kind of technical study uh in terms of what is cryptography and and uh defining that but you're almost an anthropologist in this where you sort of track the the cultural lineage of this crypto movement all the way back to where it began sometime in the 1970s and i love how this series of articles again it almost reads like an audio book is laid out where you have the 1970s and you have the 1980s and 90s and all the way up through today and how how this movement has fed into uh the crypto native movement a movement that bankless is is one part of as well so this is fantastic history but i wondered if you could talk a little bit about the cypherpunks because these are the heroes of the journey uh throughout these decades what what was the value system of the cypherpunks if we talk about this cultural lineage what did they care about what did they believe in yeah um i would probably call the first cypherpunks you know i mean obviously you had the 90s right uh movement of the cypherpunks but i really think that it started with you know uh one hellman whitford jiffy and ralph merkel like they were the people who really came together to really publish the findings on like on how to solve like you know the uh problem of asymmetric uh encryption decryption right right like i guess one distinction you know for those who are listening they'll probably learn this in the articles but those symmetrical um encryption and decryption well like the key uh you know for securing information uh encryption and decryption shared the same key and because of that you couldn't really um share the key publicly right uh at all um so it was very hard to like actually transmit like secret information across unsecured like communication channels the key the the not the key but i don't want to say that but the the innovation of asymmetric key crypt cryptography was the fact that you could actually decouple the encryption and decryption keys so you could encrypt something and actually publish that encrypted information and uh you wouldn't need to uh someone with the decryption key could then just decrypt that right and that encrypted information could be published anywhere right um this was the problem to solve back in the day in the early 1970s and you know cryptography research until then was mostly you know funded by the government and the military and because of that cryptography was really kept in a dark it was like no one really uh understood much about it it wasn't cool um but it was actually you know martin and you know and whitfield that they really like there were two individual researchers that really set out to solve these problems individually and then they found each other and they when they found each other they started you know uh discussing you know the research problems and they realize they're working the same thing but the key thing was um they you know they have this choice of like you know uh i guess whether they should be working on this problem or whether they should be working for a logic more much more well uh like corporation to do this sort of work and one reason why they did uh did do this in public right and publish in open source at work was because they believed that this technology way too far fought way too powerful for the for to just be you know kind of to be gated by one government to be you know uh kept in the dark right and that was like one set of valleys that drove them to really like do kind of do all their research and that really ushered in this like whole new movement around cryptography when they published the paper but you know it was the first ever piece of like really strong you know and you know really strong piece of cryptography that was pushed out into the public and that created like a renaissance around cryptography itself um and this was like one of the themes uh you know throughout the 80s as well with david trum's work he really cared about um he really he was an advocate for privacy you know he was a person who invented the idea around metadata and how like you know encryption only encrypted messages but not the data around the messages right like when it was sent and so on and all of these people in history who actually pushed uh these innovations on that you know did it for because they believed in selling something bigger than themselves really it was they did it you know uh for a set of valleys that we understand as the cipher values and which is really around you know privacy self-sovereignty on the internet freedom uh information freedom and so on and i think a lot of um i took i i i guess i took a lot of these learnings and you know they became kind of us inspiration to a lot of my personal work in the space early on um which was like you know to do something important peter was a part of your article where it recapped an email that came out of the cypherpunk email thread and that part really stood out to me and so i want to read a few lines here um cypher and this is just from the the guy that sent out the email to everyone else inviting all the other cypherpunks to come and join him in a cypherpunk meeting and in this email he gave out a couple of things that he believed what defined cypherpunks and he said cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down cypherpunks will make the network safe for privacy and cypherpunk's write code how much of these statements which were just the statements of one man back in i believe the 90s one cypherpunk self-identified cypherpunk two other self-identified cypherpunks how much how much of these values and beliefs and definitions of what makes a cypherpunk do you think is still held true today by the cultures that surround like bitcoin and ethereum and open systems right um the the reason how that we how we ended up talking about about your piece is i went on this discovery process to try and figure out what crypto values actually are and it was amin soleimani who who focused me back to to your work and so my question here is how how has cypherpunk values become extrapolated to the communities and cultures around bitcoin and ethereum it's a really good question um i think one thing about the cyclones that they understood was that cryptography was this like tool that could protect the you know worlds that they created themselves on the internet right it gave them uh protection from others you know created this shared environment i think for um adapted to web free it's all about you know web free we have these tools known as smart contract set which we can use to create entire new worlds entire new economies to participate in and i think yeah i i do think that you know it's the cypher monks have this you know they're probably like self-identified anarchists in this sense i think the difference here within you know ethereum or webfree in general is that we generally see like this not so much as a tool to you know purely just protect um but also to create and build and coordinate i think this is the key thing i i do think like i think james young said something a long time ago that resonated was like you know the whole uh goal of the fearing was to create the dao right like the the dao was actually the idea all along and you know today we have really like we've realized a somewhat like decent version of the racial vision right of like this decentralized you know economy that really self-runs but maybe instead of machines running out we realize that you really do need these like human driven human people fast communities that actually operate the these different economies that right that run today so i think instead of you know purely as a means of like protection defending uh you know i i do see like you know uh web free as like as a means of cop like coordination right i think that's a key theme so not anarchy but coordination instead is part of crypto's legacy now yeah i would think so where do you want to go next round um i'll jump to this okay peter i i one thing as i was i was listening to this that kept uh standing out to me was throughout the decades this dance between the the cypherpunks and the government right um this interplay that that kind of uh is left with us now crypto crypto folks often talk about the the final boss being sort of you know the government popping up and and trying to ban crypto ban ethereum banned bitcoin right um so far that hasn't happened but that legacy has has kind of persisted and throughout the 70s and the 80s and the 90s and into the 2000s there was always this dance between the power of cryptography in the hands of the people and governments who weren't sure whether they wanted this power to be propagated it was super interesting for me to realize how much cryptography as a technology was treated as a weapon it was on the munitions list like banned munitions list the same list that you know missiles and and nuclear weapons are on right can you talk about this interplay between crypto and and governments and what it kind of means for us today as as we explore this this new horizon in in the in the world of crypto yeah i know cryptography is definitely dangerous in itself especially when you know uh it was closed sourced and you know i you know it was on the music munitions list mostly from uh world war one really like you know that's where it started um so i i wouldn't say exactly that they didn't want it to be you know in the hands of people i think it was just deeply deeply misunderstood and it was just you know it was by default you know on the munitions list because you know every government and in the world right really competing on these like technology armed races right so uh it was a matter of like national security but i think uh as like you know computerization really hit you know us in the early 60s and then you know everyone had computers and technology was really you know more abundant you know obviously with opens like open source i don't even see open source as a movement but rather as you know purely just like this natural process of like uh of like information freeing itself right through technology um as as this progress really progressed i think like this idea that uh information was uh this sort of technology information was harmful for national security was uh maybe it had you know some mirror but it was like futile on the end right um and you know initially i think in the 90s it's just the government didn't really understand computers or internet or cryptography or information rights at all they just like you know they they went into uh computer laboratories rated you know companies and just like went for the emails they even sent emails themselves right through the same computers like they didn't really understand any of this um and a lot of the you know initial decisions for the government were pretty misplaced and you know uh ignorant to a lot of extent i would you know to i would the comparison would be like imagine today you know the us government would say that you know putting like um you know this like vaccination data on the eos blockchain you you'd imagine the outcry you know like uh of that you know today that they would be the equivalent of that you know maybe in the mid 90s um it was just a lot of ignorance uh uh misinformation but it took them like you know maybe a decade from the early 90s to late 90s for that's really breakthrough and what happened was just that more and more people were educated and slowly uh parts of that educated group you know uh increasingly uh uh i guess you know um were more like people who worked in government right it's like always slow in terms of like this education and uh you know education of the government itself because it's just this giant system right and i think it's a matter of time in general um i mean even today you have like regulators here and that you know really addressing define general um and this process generally like goes on so very very slowly until you know you hit you know kind of you hit this barrier between um you kind of like there's always moments in in history where like really strong technologies like you know cryptography or even perhaps you know soon like defy really hit the boundaries of and comprehension of like what of a government's mental model of how they regulate and enforce and usually this often needs to be settled in the court of law right where like all the facts are laid out where a lot of educational uh pro you know uh education uh happens uh for like regulators in government and it's a painful painful process but for cryptography itself right it took three uh look like i guess free um court cases uh from the 1995 to 97 for that to like really break through and how happened was just like you know the first case i think was like this teacher who wanted to teach cryptography um you know to their students and they had one international student in the classroom right uh and he was handing out cd roms right of cryptography right like you know i think it was something like uh key exchange you know protocol and technically he you know he got a letter from the government saying you must cease and desist because you know you're technically giving foreign nationals you know uh like heavily regulated cryptographic information and technology and this was like as educated he was like pretty pissed off he was like why why can't i educate all my students so you know and and generally like uh from this teacher's case against the government you know uh to a few other cases the natural progression of and understanding cryptography went from like the first case was made of like cryptography is free speech right you know uh you know at least like cryptography is just math right so math is like free speech you can't you know you can't ban this so you can't you know it was against the first amendment to really like ban any sort of uh information right so they've you know mocked the us government's you know like decision like by printing out like uh cryptographic protocols as books right you can't you know banned books uh and certainly this this kind of grew like step by step into um cryptography software is free speech right you cannot ban software and then slowly that you know uh as it was just like a lot more education the government really relented and finally removed it as a restricted you know uh munition right i i do agree that there is a lot of uh education that had to be done um and and yet also that there does seem to be some sort of conflict with those uh in government at least or those in powerful places who um might be a bit more authoritarian a bit more totalitarian there was this move by the government to put in um clipper chips uh for example which is essentially like a back door that you talked about to to modern encryption of course this didn't work out because it was easily easily cracked um but but all of this makes me wonder about th this idea of a you know we talk about in the us and in the constitution there are rights protected by all the amendments and and the bill of rights of course what would a digital bill of rights look like for society surely would it would include something like the right to encryption for individual citizens if we were to create something like that um so there does seem at least in in free societies to be sort of a an education process whereby like once governments understand the benefits to individuals of this technology they get on board because you know freedom of speech is a protected right although encryption itself is kind of um anti-authoritarian societies or anti-governments that would seek or powerful individuals who would seek to oppress the people so there's also this kind of kind of conflict do you see a little bit of that in the legacy that cypherpunks left us yeah for sure i mean cryptography was math and you can't stop math right you know it's no like like human written law could ever stop that right so it was almost like you know the government's trying to ban a few stupid things in the past as well like you know banning alcohol probate probation right like that was never going to work even like you know um the war on drugs right argue this like you know um like kind of issues there and i guess you know yeah i don't understand the government very well in general i don't think too many people do um but yeah i do think that there's definitely the sense that you know what sort of like i mean it's i guess the us government let's be specific in general they have an interest for the to protect the us dollar right to be the economic system uh the reserve currency of the world they have a direct incentive uh to protect that so i yeah i do actually see like potentially this sort of like uh a real conflict of interest here in sort of regulating you know um free open like economic systems and like also wanting to uh actually protect their own right not saying it's a bad thing uh you know necessarily the u.s dollar being a reserve currency but it's been protected you know uh for many means you know uh yeah through war through many other things and i don't i definitely you know could see a pathway it gets ugly right uh but i also could see um yeah like some sort of nuance but but before we finally get to some sort of resolution there's definitely gonna be like a period of time where the worlds do clash and that's gonna need to be resolved one way or another um yeah peter we're about to send bankless listeners into over an hour and a half of me reading your series and so as people gear up for that and get ready for that what would you hope um would be the takeaways for people who are going through each one one of these parts there's four parts and they're all and they're all combined together what should listeners really be pondering or thinking about while they are hearing this and what do you hope that they take away when they are finished i would say think about why you're in the space and you know how you want to contribute to it you know um one way you know this this sort of like uh person of writing this series really affected me was it made me really think hard about you know what i was going to leave behind in many senses right you know um and it made it push me to do work that i felt like i guess uh that everyone else did and that i wrote about right like you know i kind of like stopped thinking i i think i had this mental model before i wrote uh about the series it's just like you know to do big things you have to like go change the world and things like that but i realize you know it just the every the innovation really happens in a huge wave and you know from the outside it seems like this you know a heroic kind of quest to change things but in reality it's just a lot of really you know smart driven people pushing things one step at a time and you know to do something important what you need to do is just help progress a space one step at a time yourself right so like figure out uh what step that is you can actually contribute to well peter once again thank you for for writing this piece and as soon as i stumbled upon it sorry i'm gonna well once again peter thank you for writing this piece and as soon as i stumbled upon it uh i actually started just hitting record before i had even read it because i knew that it was going to be something that i wanted to get out to as many people as possible and so again thank you for um writing it in the original um here we go and so thank you for originally writing it and putting it together to make sure that this information can actually get out the door um what would you say peter before listeners get into it what would you say is the legacy of the cyberpunks and is that legacy still alive today absolutely um exists everywhere and the hashes that you know uh we you know we create today for you know for our transactions you know it's everywhere so um for the organizations we call dallas today right you know these were imagined long long long time before and yeah we're the ones who are now executing uh upon those like ideas all right bankless nation let's go into exactly what those ideas are and where they got formed and so we bring you before bitcoin by peter pan but first we have to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs of d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balance your governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i

many different answers and if they are right they will likely be vague jabs at the truth what many people do not know is that bitcoin was a creation born out of the cypherpunk movement originated during the 70s but formed in the 90s it fought the u.s government's injustices surrounding digital freedom and pioneered modern rights to personal privacy while you can try to understand the cypherpunks through a google search you may struggle to deeply understand the full picture unless you understand the context of the movement itself you have to zoom out and think bigger who seated the movement of the cypherpunks where did all the ideas come from before bitcoin is a series which aims to give you a historical perspective of cryptocurrency's technology and philosophy to do this i'll be writing a four or five part series focusing on cryptography the underlying mechanisms of all cryptocurrencies along with the philosophies of privacy formed over time this will be an exploration through the 70s 80s 90s and 2000s where in each decade an overview of the series is focused on these points part one the seventies how cryptographic knowledge was democratized through the publication of public key cryptography part two the eighties the origins of decentralized services anonymous communication networks and digital cash part three the 90s the origins of the cypherpunks and part four the 20 uh the 2000s technologies born out of the cypherpunk movement during the 2000s and part 5 bitcoin the original designs of bitcoin and early coin forks this series will be a long read it won't be your typical 300 word pamphlet disguises a medium article written as a marketer or the usual short punchy stuff you find to understand anything historical context is important and the time to do in doing so is an investment this aims to provide just that introduction so we want to understand cryptocurrency and its history where do we start i want to kick things off by first talking about the 70s and the creation of public key cryptography while you might groan at a dusty black and white image of the 70s just like i did when i first researched cryptography i didn't realize how important this decade was until the 70s cryptography was mostly used by the military to secure communications research was mostly conducted by intelligence agencies gec hq nsa or licensed research labs operating by enterprises such as ibm cryptography was used for commercial purposes and the public had little access to the knowledge the hold on modern day cryptography would have been broken by the publication of public cryptography released by three cryptographers known as helman diffy and merkel their work would result in the first big public wave of interest into cryptography so what is public key cryptography cryptography is the practice of securing and protecting information against enemies or people who have no right to the information it is the underlying mechanism that secures the authenticity and integrity of information and ultimately what makes blockchains and cryptocurrency possible public key cryptography is a shift in the use of cryptography that now secures most cryptocurrency protocols how does it work essentially public key cryptography allows people to send encrypted information to public to a public address over unsecured channels and only people with access to the public addresses corresponding private key can decrypt the information the private key is also used to sign off and authenticate information sent away to verify the legitimacy of its origin in the case of cryptocurrency while people can send bitcoins to a public address and see how many bitcoins it holds only the owner with its corresponding private key can use the bitcoins and sign off on transactions this was extremely important concept for cryptography and would lead to the first big interest in cryptography three cryptographers known as martin hellman whitefield diffy and ralph merkel would be behind and they would have a very interesting story so how did these researchers defeat the government's control on strong cryptographic knowledge first let's follow the story of a cryptographer known as martin hellman a young ambitious man hellman grew up as a nerd where he was exposed to science at an early age by his father a physics teacher at a local high school he remembers that quote my father had books on the bookshelf that i would pull down and read about things including one i remember gennatt's physics an old physics text from eight the 1890s that he bought obviously it was an antique even for him and my seventh grade science fair projects came out of that so i was interested in science but not particularly cryptography and i loved math too end quote early career following his interest he studied electrical engineering from new york university and completed his master's degree in electrical engineering at stanford university in 1967. fairly well suited to academia he did well and enjoyed his time at school while it might be intuitive to assume that he studied cryptography at some point he never much associated with the side of computer science until later on instead early on he was very career driven having already planned his life at an early age he envisioned that he would be married at the age of 35 and until then he would be traveling the world working in management for big businesses at the age of 22 he set out to complete a phd in some and some esoteric way of thinking called decision logic hellman saw a doctorate as an opportunity to counter his youth in management based on the logic of quote if i had this the phd it would be a way to help quell the questions like what can this kid do ironically in his first year of his phd he had gotten married that did not slow him down and within two years of starting his phd at the age of 24 he achieved an early breakthrough he released his dissertation learning with finite memory hanging on with his grand life plan he followed his dreams to go work for ibm for a brief moment he was struggling the decision to either teach or work in enterprise but guided by the allure of traveling the world and a lot more money he decided quote no thanks i don't want to be poor early influences of harry feisal and peter elias so he went off to work for ibm at the thomas j watson research center in new york hellman worked in the pattern recognition department building machines that tried to recognize numbers from photographs while hellman's work was nothing to do with cryptography ibm and his own division focused on cryptographic research from that division he met a german researcher called a horst feistel through their friendship feistel introduced helman into cryptography they often had lunch discussing cryptographic systems and seemingly unsolvable problems hellman regards faisal as one of the biggest early influences and would go on to later design the government's data encryption standard des as he mentally matured and also when his wife was pregnant he asked himself do i really want to be traveling the world or do i want to have more time with my family it was the timeless dilemma that we had to face throughout history wife and child versus money choosing family he became an assistant professor at mit's department of electronic engineering this is where he met peter elias mit's head of the electronic engineering who collaborated on research with cloud shannon the father of information theory if that means nothing to you he essentially invented the modern day cryptography that was used in world war ii after meeting peter gave hellman a copy of shannon's landmark paper a mathematical theory of communication night this was the that paper is from 1948. this was another major influence of hellman that shaped his mathematical understanding of cryptography he became good friends with elias and which over time deepened his fascinations and knowledge of cryptography hellman regarded elias as being another pivotal part of his education into cryptographic philosophy pursuing research in 1971 hellman returned to stanford this time as an assistant professor while he continued to work on decision making research by the end of 1971 he had started to prefer pursue cryptographic research his colleagues and friends at stanford did not support his decision to do so they told me i was crazy hellman said the funny thing is was he didn't exactly disagree with their sentiment a quote from hellman how could i hope to discover anything that the national security agency which is the primary american code making code breaking agency didn't already know and they had classified everything so highly that if we came up with anything good they'd classify it but driven by his intellectual fascination and previous experience with the influences at ibm and mit he believed that cryptography would be a commercial importance in the future he gave his first talk and released his first technical report on cryptography in 1973. hellman hellman's work soon spread and did not go unnoticed in 1973 a researcher called whitefield diffy reached out to him whitefield diffy a very bored young man in contrast to hellman diffy was first introduced to cryptography early at the age of 10 years old when his father a history professor brought home cryptography books from a local library he loved mathematics but hated school diffy was never described to have performed competently and how he never applied himself to the degree his father hoped diffy barely graduated despite his performance he was smart enough to ace the entrance exams for mit studying mathematics there he remembers how he tried to teach himself how to program but thought of it as very low class work overall he was pretty bored and instead spent most of his time studying pure mathematics skimming day jobs to to work on a.i and the code breakers just when he graduated the us government started to draft young men to fight in vietnam machine guns and screaming vietcong did not particularly interest diffie so instead he took a job developing software and doing other quote low class work at the same time he also started to work part-time at mit's project mac's artificial intelligence laboratory run by two pretty smart people martin miniski and john mccarthy defeat had a very strong relationship with mccarthy and learned a lot from him unknown to diffie and many at that time mccarthy would go on to later be regarded as the father of artificial intelligence coining the term ai often quoted mccarthy believed that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it he was incredibly focused on the future believing that the conception of such intelligence will come within five to five hundred years under his guidance diffie was exposed to his computing philosophy and developed a deep understanding of networking electronic keys and authentication diffie later followed mccarthy to stanford to join his new ai lab during his time at stanford diffy read david khan's book the code breakers the story of secret writing it summarized the history of cryptography from ancient egypt to the time of its writing and was described to have profoundly influenced him in his beliefs surrounding privacy compelled to pursue his own personal reaches of cryptography he left sale and sale was the organization the ai lab in stanford that i mentioned earlier he left sale in 1973 spending the next year jumping around the country to meet and discuss cryptography with different experts quote i was doing one of the things i am good at which is digging up rare manuscripts and libraries driving around visiting friends at universities and in 1974 as part of his research he visited visited ibm thomas j watson laboratory at yorktown heights to meet with a cryptography research team at the time it was led by horace feistel the guy who introduced cryptography to hellman when diffy visited he couldn't learn much as much of the work as was classified by the nsa instead he was referred to martin hellman a professor at stanford university who is working on similar cryptography hellman meets diffie in the fall of 1974 witt shows up on my doorstep i'll never forget that day hellman in 2011. through a referral hellman agreed to admit diffie at his house in 1974. diffie came in the afternoon but stayed for dinner and left at 11 pm the short meeting expanded over hours of discussion hellman recounted how working in a vacuum had been taxing in a way and finding a kindred spirit was really something soon after diffie took a job at a local research group and like his first job he would soon spend more time working with hellman on cryptography than his actual job early in 1975 they had something else to work worry about the des data encryption standard des early in 1975 the government published the des it was the first encryption cipher that was approved for public and commercial use the nsa published the adoption of the des by financial services and other commercial sectors where strong encryption was needed sim cards network devices routers and modems previous to the des the first amendment classified cryptography along with munitions and other items that were in military and character you had to be licensed to handle any form of cryptography and all work related to it was classified by the nsa this was the first publicly approved use of such technology how the des was designed the need for a national encryption cipher was released after a study conducted in 1972 by the national bureau of standards now known as nist the national institute institute of standards and technology basically a shell of the nsa they requested design proposals from research centers around the us in 1973 and 74. after running up dry the first time in 1974 ibm conceived of a cipher called lucifer lucifer's design was led by ibm's very own horus feistel this cipher was an improvement on previously developed cipher but fit the design request from the nsa lucifer went underwent an extra stage of collaborative collaboration with the nsa where they wanted to reduce the key size from 64 bits to 48 bits on a basic level it means needing less processing power to encrypt and decrypt their final decision to reduce the key size to 56 bits would later come back to bite them hellman and diffie's criticisms hellman and diffy initially embraced the des with open arms as they saw it as a huge step forward bringing cryptography into the public view but as they looked closer they foresaw how the shortened key length was vulnerable to brute force attacks but more importantly along with amongst the research circles the ibm team accused the nsa of tampering with the cipher after the cipher was sent to washington for approval it was returned with an altered s box the part of a cipher that returned plain text into ciphertext during the 70s there's a general sense of distrust about the government this wariness stemmed from a period after world war ii learning from the control of totalitarian governments the ussr nazi germany the public was vigilant against the intrusion by the government the public fears were reflected in orowell's 1984 and other popular texts that explored government surveillance control of society and personal freedom this sentiment continued into the 60s where the decades was rocked by the assassination assassination of jfk the cuban missile crisis and the socio-political movements such as the black rights and gay rights movements in the 1970s this was exaspe exacerbated by the watergate incident in 1972 which was a controversy surrounding president nixon's authorized bugging of the democratic national committee headquarters in washington dc to the public their fears were slowly but surely manifested before their eyes people believed that the nsa had built a cipher which they could bypass themselves merkel the kid who knew nothing soon after the release of the des hellman and diffy release a technical paper called multi-user cryptographic techniques and they soon learned of ralph merkel a young 23 year old computer science student from berkeley hellman was 30 years old at the time and diffie was only one year younger uh older excuse me merkel's puzzles before meeting helman and diffy merkel had already been working on his early concept of public key encryption which would later be known as merkel's puzzles he started working on his ideas during his computer science course cs244 where he stumbled across the riddle how do you re-establish secure communications when a hostile enemy already knows everything he needed to complete a personal project for the course and it seemed perfect for him to develop his ideas when i thought about how you can possibly establish security when everything is known to the eavesdropper and the eavesdropper can listen in on communications how can you possibly establish security so my first thought was it doesn't look like you can so i'll try and prove that it's impossible so i tried to prove that you couldn't establish security and i tried and tried and tried and i failed miserably then i thought about it some more and i said well if i can't prove that you can't do it i'll turn around and try and figure out a method to do it and when i tried to come up with a method for doing it having just tried to prove you can't do it i knew there were cracks in my proof were so so to speak and i knew where i could try and slide through so i worked on those places and lo and behold it turned out it was possible i could use the cracks in my proof to to come up with a method for actually doing it and when i figured out how to do it there was this well the traditional aha moment where i said quote oh yeah that works i can do it that happened very rapidly and it was it was all one night of staying up late and thinking and then realizing oh my gosh i can do this thing it seems very counter-intuitive but i can actually figure out a key i can establish a cryptographic t key over an open communications lines even if the enemy the interlooper the eavesdropper knows everything with no theoretical or historical knowledge about cryptography he was unaware of of how the problem was considered to be unsolvable he put everything into a paper and shared it around the head teacher of the security course couldn't understand his weird work and told merkel to pug her off and when he submitted his work to the cacm a well-respected computer science journal he was rejected but this time not because it was nonsense but because the editor thought his contents of his work were quote not in the mainstream of present cryptography thinking however he also shared it with a computer scientist called peter blaitman who immediately noticed the value of his work unbeknown to merkel uh blakeman was friends with diffy who invited him out to a cryptography meetup in stanford during a car ride it might be blatman blattman briefly outlined the problem merkel was working on apparently diffy had been obsessing over the problem for years and upon hearing about how some young computer science student had potentially solved the problem he dismissed such a possibility erupting into an outburst but once diffu was calm again he became excited about the possibility of such a solution helmand and diffie had recently submitted a paper which explored the applications of public key encryption under the assumption that it was possible diffie game gave blattman a copy to give to merkel quote there are these guys at stanford who talk just like you after reading their work merkel sent over his paper when the other two had read it they completely shifted their way of thinking despite merkel's youth and complete lack of cryptographic knowledge his creativity had solved the public key distribution problem this young 23 year old managed to achieve what academics had strived to do for years but hellman and diffy found his solution inefficient with their cryptographic understanding they had found a far more compact solution to the key distribution problem and came up with a new iteration of public key cryptography soon their concepts would be formulated into a paper that would be known as new directions in cryptography following their collaboration merkel left for stanford taking up helmand's invitation to work under him as a phd student new directions in cryptography in november 1976 the paper new directions and cryptography was released it discussed fundamental problems of cryptography public key cryptography and protocols that facilitated authenticated communication merkel was credited for his independent work but in the end the communication protocol was named the diffie-hellman key exchange however despite this in 1977 when public key encryption was patented merkel was credited as one of the three inventors diffie reflected on merkel as a possibly the most inventive character in the public key saga the system had since been known as the diffie-hellman key exchange while the system was first described in a paper by diffie and me it is a public key distribution system a concept developed by merkel and hence should be called the diffie-hellman merkel key exchange if the names are to be associated with it i hope this small pulpit might help in the in that endeavor to recognize merkel's equal contribution in the invention of public key cryptography martin hellman 2002 the concepts discussed in the paper are used to design and secure blockchains we use today one of their purposes of the paper noted at the end was to quote inspire others to work in this fascinating area in which participation has been discouraged in the recent past by a nearly total government monopoly it's a quote from the paper new directions in cryptography for the time the public had access to powerful encryption technology their work broke the control on cryptographic knowledge fueled by the growing distrust of the government's des cipher the technology in the paper enabled the first big wave of public interest in cryptography and encryption it was later revealed by that helmand diffy and merkel were not the first conceivers of public key cryptography a form of it was initially created and applied to an algorithm by researchers from great britain's intelligence agency gchq and while the nsa had access to this it was all classified and remained in the dark untouched now imagine if these three never published public key encryption our world potentially might be very different hellman diffy and merkel's publication managed to incite a new wave of innovation that would last for decades whereas governmental agencies kept their findings behind closed doors this contrast very much highlights the importance of open collaborative work within cryptography but also other sciences fittingly in the line of the first paper it had begun with we stand today on the brink of a revolution in cryptography while hellman and diffy continue to work on cryptography merkel was the one that continued to excel spending the rest of the 70s as a student of hellman and diffy merkel continued to impact cryptography in the 80s later going on to invent cryptographic hashing closing statement for this part of the series these three cryptographers would break down the barrier to for cryptography a cryptographer known in the in the 80s known as david chom would go on to directly build upon their work and conceptualize the need for autonomous communications payments and ultimately the need for decentralized services chom's work however would only be made possible through the dedication of helmand diffy and merkel continuing on from the 70s the story of decentralization picks up right after the publication of public key cryptography beginning with a computer science student called david chalm like ralph merkel he was also from the university of california berkeley as a graduate student he recently learned about cryptography in the late 70s through the paper new directions in cryptography 1976. this was martin hellman's whitfield diffies and ralph merkel's publication on public key cryptography chom was not alone in his discovery of cryptography at that time the san francisco bay area was becoming the world's leader in technology through the local presence of apple intel and hewlett packard the money and excitement attracted international tech talent when the paper new directions and cartography was released interest in cryptography spread like wildfire amongst scientists academics researchers and engineers after about a decade of dishing it out between microsoft and apple the 70s personal computing boom was tapering off star wars 4 had just come out in 1977 and the concept of the internet had started to turn heads worldwide the world was moving towards a digital future and the tech wasn't the only thing reflecting it it was newly it was a newly found sense of fascination and romanticism revolving around computers robotics and technology apple's record-breaking ipo of 1.3 billion would later pour fuel into the impending software boom and set silicon alley for success for the next 30 years being part of the first new wave of interest into cryptography chom naturally looked into it through his natural aptitude for breaking things while having little little about his early life and personal details online he shared hints of where his natural curiosity for technology had come from while all others were playing in the sun trom recounts how he spent most of his childhood breaking locks and playing with safes he was from a wealthy family and had access to a computer early on and like many modern days uh teenagers he spent his adolescent years staring at a computer screen but instead of youtube and facebook he spent time trying to break computer systems and cracking passwords being part of the first generation that grew up using computers technology was natural to him but so was his hacker paranoia having broke and exploited seemingly secure systems trump had likely developed a sense of cynicism about most technologies having that instinct as he studied cryptography he saw an aspect that was of cryptography that was overlooked metadata the traffic analysis problem while public key encryption conceptually solved the problem of encrypted messages thought it was only one piece of the puzzle he knew that encryption did not necessarily mean secure he saw the unprotected data around protected messages of who converses with who and when they converse as a risk to personal privacy with his information he knew that people could theoretically be identified and tracked completing his graduate studies at the time he decided to write his research or paper on the traffic analysis problem how do you keep secret the knowledge of who converses with who and when they converse he graduated in 1979 releasing his first major cryptography paper untraceable electronic mail return addresses and digital signatures while initially released in 1979 it was only later published in 1981. citing the helm and different merkel's work of new correct new directions in cryptography in the paper trom outlines the personal the risk of personal privacy and provides the blueprint of an anonymous mailing protocol using something known as a mix network his protocol protected the identity of the messengers as well as the time of the message being sent how to how do mixed networks work a mix network is a network made up of nodes that use public key cryptography to authenticate messages these nodes send information to each other to mix up the original sender's identity and timing of messages the message addresses was important as it could be used to identify the origins of the message the timing of the message could also be used to identify the messages that would correspondingly move within a network with a mix network when you send a message to someone the encrypted message would first be passed to a node where it would be batched with other messages from other senders this batch would then be sent to between different nodes think of a pinball full of messages bouncing around different nodes in the end the message would exit out of the network and end up at the intended address with the original sender hidden for replies to the message it would be sent back to the original address that would be unknown to the sender thus the identity of senders and order of messages would stay unknown and prevent the ability to trace and spy on messages while designing a network he dismissed a solution that used a single message authenticator believing that would be easily compromised instead he insisted that ideally each participant is an authority the mixed network protocol would be built would be used to build a tor the anonymous browser that you can use to buy drugs or hire hitmen yes incognito mode is not anonymous mixing is also used by monero to anonymize transactions untraceable payments understanding the potential risk of unprotected metadata he also saw financial attraction transactions in the same light in an increasingly digital world tron believed that e-commerce would play a huge role in the world but so would the traceability of consume payments he believed that the timing of transactions and goods purchased not only enabled the tracking of people but allowed for the profiling of individual lifestyles consumer choices and political leanings quote the time of payment for every transaction made by an individual can reveal a great deal about the individual's whereabouts associations and lifestyle for example consider the payments or such things as transportation hotels restaurants movies theater lectures food pharmaceutical alcohol books periodicals dues religious and political contributions in 1980 he patented a digital cash system secured by cryptography which would form the basis of cryptocurrency patent number 4529870 outlined a protocol that was able to conduct financial transactions with an external system exchange data with an external system contain an id linking to the ownership of data within the external system store data relating to the interactions within the external system and secure the stored data through cryptography where it could be accessed using a secret id known to the owner chom later fleshes out the concepts of anonymous payments in his paper blind signatures for untraceable payments that was later released in 1982. similar to the concept of mixed networks he proposed payment his proposed payment protocol required including the masking of the sender the amount being sent and also the time of the transaction stumbling onto the concept of decentralization back then as a student his work was dismissed as political and radical by his peers similar to martin hellman in the 70s at stanford chom also faced scrutiny over his work upon pursuing his doctorate studies his head teacher told him don't work on this because you could never tell the effects of a new idea on society ironically his head teacher would turn out to be right despite the pressure from his peers trump decided to continue his doctoral studies revisiting the ideas in his first paper about mixed networks he decided to research the concept of trust in computer systems as a hacker chom did not trust central authorities in computer systems as he thought that they could be easily hacked instead he believed that systems where participants were authorities were harder to compromise researching the concept of computer systems that established trust between parties that don't trust each other chalm argues for the need for decentralized services in his dissertation computer systems established maintained and trusted by mutually suspicious groups paper 1982. here are some quotes it is not enough that the organization maintaining a computer system trusts it many individuals and organizations need to trust a particular computer system there are many other similar applications of computers which involve private sector records relating to consumers such as those arising from credit insurance health care and employment relationships public sector record keeping such as areas as tax social security education and military service are quite similar all of these applications involve one group who owns or control the computer systems and who is particularly concerned with reliability in maintaining the operation of the system and with ensuring the survival of the data maintained by the system they would will be called trustees a second group or set of groups are primarily concerned about the confidentiality of the data which relates to them that is available to the system there may have may be a third group or set of participants which may overlap with the first and second groups who are concerned about the correctness of the operation of the system initially led by his concerns towards communications metadata his idea of mix networks was one of the first concepts of a decentralized service his concerns about metadata led him to focus on the need for anonymizing payments while chom was focused on personal privacy after having looked over his work and how he presents the concept of decentralization i personally don't think he understood the magnitude and importance of decentralization at that time tron presents decentralized services as a means of solving certain conflicts of interest between consumers and businesses in certain application aspects rather than how it is portrayed in today's world as a socio-political movement decentralization in its paper was first presented as an economical solution for businesses graduating in 1982 chom decided to continue his research on cryptography as the decade continued trom's ideas had started to mature and a vision of the future had started to form inside of his head watching the growth of computing explode faster than anyone ever predicted chan was worried tom's warning to the world in 1985 computerization is robbing individuals of the ability to monitor and control the ways of information about them is used already public and private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves individuals have no way of knowing if this information is inaccurate outdated or otherwise inappropriate new and more serious dangers derive from computerized pattern recognition techniques even a small group of them using using them and tapping into data gathered in everyday consumer transactions could secretly conduct mass surveillance inferring individuals lifestyles activities and associations the automation of payments and other consumer transactions is expanding these dangers to an unprecedented extent wow this is me david speaking now this was in 1985 and i think we can extrapolate that into the world today where we talk about twitter facebook you know youtube and the control that these the technologies implicitly have over our lives due to the metadata that we give these things for free pretty crazy that chomp predicted this in 1985. all right back to the article acknowledging orwell's dystopian world with the paper's title it talks about the dangers of using data that was building up around computing systems choms warned of this continuing trend of computerization which would render society open to exploitation and mass surveillance he also argued that surveillance might significantly chill individual participation and expression in group and public life the inadequate security and the accumulation of personally identifiable records moreover pose national vulnerabilities information service providers and other major interests for example could retain control over various information and media distribution channels while synergistically consolidating their position with sophisticated marketing techniques that rely on gathering far-reaching information about consumers the main body of his paper summarizes a decentralized economy based on his previous research into the decentralization of messaging and payments despite his ideas being previously fragmented he then knew the true importance of his ideas surrounding decentralized services seeing the future that the world was moving towards he was acutely aware of the crossroads which lay before society chom understood that the decision of the internet's architecture would have enduring social and political consequences projecting the vision of two futures one built with a current technology and one built with decentralized services he saw that the two approaches appear to hold quite different answers a choke from quote from chomp large-scale automated transaction systems are imminent as the initial choice for the architecture gathers economic and social momentum it becomes increasingly difficult to reverse whichever approach prevails it will likely have a profound and enduring impact on economic freedom democracy and our informational rights so what is decentralization one of the most fundamental beliefs trom had was the right to personal privacy with the world becoming ever more interconnected he saw the need to protect personal data he saw cryptography as a means of doing so if you think about it cryptography is essentially the practice of protecting information against individuals that didn't have access permission to access it cryptography is a digital law enforced by the law of mathematics a force beyond central control no one is above it and when individuals are empowered to control and protect their data using cryptography only then can true personal privacy be realized charmsaw decentralized services as the means of protecting privacy enabled and secured using cryptography is something outside centralized control hence this is why decentralized systems are trusted he could believe in the math he did not trust governments and companies sounds like a nutcase right here is um the author peter putting in a image of the edward snowden leak from 2014 where the title is edward snowden leaks that exposed u.s spy program we all know the implication of this there's a lot of images here i'm just going to scroll through them ah yeah facebook cell phone metadata worries are added to the fallout from facebook's data scandal the news users have been reporting that personal data held by facebook shows that the social network has collected metadata about phone calls and text messages on android devices facebook says that the logs are part of an opt-in feature adding that it will never sell this data and this feature does not collect the contents of calls and messages ah yes and then the final picture is cambridge analytica a a individual i believe who's the president of it um could be wrong uh giving a presentation where the the title of the presentation is called the power of big data and psychographics in the electoral process jesus like i don't even need to connect those dots for you i'm sure the listener can do that all right back to the article wow was david chom a time traveler no he was not a time traveler he just had an exceptionally clear thought in his vision of the future he was right wasn't he yes kind of while it does seem that way we haven't gone down the route of decentralization no system is ever perfect and i wonder if we would be dealing with the problems of the same magnitude if the world did follow the heat of trump's advice never nonetheless history has so far point pointed towards the need for decentralized services after 30 years after its paper the world did indeed build itself around centralized services with 2.2 plus billion users on facebook the world's data was protected by goodwill goodwill did not hold up goodwill and the promise of facebook had little power against the cia and government the lack of cryptographic ownership led to the abuse of data by cambridge analytica so is it too late well the internet might have taken a wrong turn nothing points to the fact that things are too late to change that's what history is full of evolutions in culture technology and society the world will always be moving the question is just where after the 80s tom spent the rest of the decade researching cryptography and by 1988 had moved into the netherlands starting his own research group and after a decade of research he would finally act on his vision of a decentralized world he found his company digicash in 1990 and then created ecash the first world's the world's first digital cash system gaining worldwide attention many cryptographers interned and worked for digicash including hal finney nick zabo and eric hughes one of the founders of the cypherpunks a movement that would be explored in the next part of the series digicat digicash would experience highs and lows rejecting 180 million dollar acquisition from microsoft only to declare bankruptcy a while later if you want to read more about digicash there is a link in the article by the end of the 1980s chom had become one of the most well-regarded cryptographers in the world trauma was one of the people who knew where the world was going he understood things that others didn't deciding to focus on building a company he would leave behind the seeds that would ultimately bloom into the 90s cypherpunk movement this movement would go on to stand for the liberty and the fight against governmental injustices of the 90s do you remember what the head of the teacher said to chom back when he was still a student at berkeley don't work on this because you can never tell the effects of a new idea on society all right that is the end of part two on to part three continuing on from the 80s during the 80s technology software and computing made massive strides in 1982 adobe autodesk and sun micro systems were founded 83 intuit was founded and microsoft word was released in 1984 cisco was founded dell was founded hewlett packard released their first inkjet printer 1985 aol was founded 1987 mcafee antivirus was founded 1989 adobe photoshop 1.0 was released and apple broke into the top 100 us companies ranked by revenue while the world of tech was shot ahead other areas of life law and society failed to keep up the wild west of the internet was soon ruled by hackers with user names that even 12 year old 12 year olds of today would cringe at criminals would be coming were becoming increasingly sophisticated through technology while the us government had remained recklessly clueless agent baxter and the legendary star wars defense contractor autodesk in early april 1990 a rock band lyricist named john perry barlow received a call from the fbi asking for an interview he was an early user of the internet and was and was part of many online communities and while he didn't know why the fbi had contacted him he thought it would be suspicious to turn down their request a few days later special agent richard baxter from the federal bureau of investigations showed up at his doorsteps barlow was accused of being a part of a hacker group called new prometheus where they had distributed stolen macintosh rom source code despite agent baxter producing little evidence of his allegations barlow soon realized that he could not get through to agent baxter since this was a crime involving software and technologies you would probably assume that someone half competently knowledgeable would be sent to investigate barlow apparently no according to barlow quote complicated by agent baxter's fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology i realized right away that i that before i could demonstrate my innocence i would first have to explain to him what guilt might be the interrogation dragged on for three hours he had been told for example that autodesk the publisher of autocad was a major star wars defense contractor and that its ceo was none other than john john draper the infamous phone freak also known as captain crunch as soon as i quit laughing i started to worry similar to how a dad might initially laugh at the clumsy of a son as barlow sat there he soon started to worry for the future of america at that moment he realized how the confusion of agent baxter and the rest of the government might put everyone else else's rights and freedoms at risk after three hours of beating a dead horse special agent richard baxter had let him go barlow posted his experience onto well the first online community forum created in 1985 it was where the hipsters of yesterday hung out not long after he was contract contacted by none another member who had a similar experience that member was mitch caper a software kingpin of the 80s he was the founder of lotus a company that made note taking software and had in the last decade released its first spreadsheet software lotus would later be acquired by ibm for 3.5 billion in 1990. caper was also accused of the same crimes committed by the hacker group new prometheus he was also very alarmed by the fbi's lack of understanding with software and technology if the authorities didn't understand it how could they respect the rights that come with it within a week caper had flown out to meet with barlow as the snowstorm raged outside barlow's offices they talked about their experiences as well as the recent secret service raids of operation sun devil operation sun devil was a part of the clinton clinton administration law enforcement effort targeting cyber crime early in january they had released a public statement announcing it our experience shows that many computer hackers suspects are no longer misguided teenagers mischievously playing games with their computers in their bedrooms some are now high-tech computer operators using computers to engage in unlawful conduct the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreliable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause not without support by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized this roughly translates into to fight crime we can now do anything we want but hey we will try to not and violate and abuse anyone one of the first targets of operation sun devil were a hacker group known as the legion of doom and soon after the members known as alpha alpha acid freak fiber optic and scorpion were raided accused of hacking phone systems the secret service kicked down the doors and turned their house upside down the computers were confiscated along with books notes telephones audio tapes and other suspicious electronic equipment barely 18 years old and still living at home their families were also subject to police treatment near the end of their discussion barlow and caper they both realized that the complete overstep of their civil rights and knew that something needed to be done to defend them the beginning of the electronic frontier foundation wealthy from his ventures he agreed to cover all legal costs and defend the hackers case within a week barlow and caper were in new york setting up the legal team for the three teenagers they decided to work with rbskl uh rabinow rabinowitz boudin standard krinsky and lieberman the law firm renowned for defending civil liberties the day after acid freak fiber optic and scorpion would rock into walk into rb sql's chamber to become the first cyber conflict of the 90s after doing so a journalist reached out to follow up on barlow's experience with the fbi during his phone call with the journalist barlow happened to talk about his efforts with caper in defending the hackers unexpectedly several days later the news the newspaper headlined lotus founder defends hackers the headlines stormed the public and soon went viral steve wozniak the co-founder of apple reached out and jumped on board as an advisor agreeing to give unlimited funding to the legal efforts of caper and barlow alongside wozniak they were joined by john gilmore a tech entrepreneur gilmore was known as a troublemaker with a hobby that included annoying the nsa just the year before in 1989 he had leaked an nsa banned cryptography paper during his career as a self-taught programmer and sun microsystem's fifth employee he was known to quote never take on a job unless he was convinced it was the right thing to do being rich from sun micro system stock options he spent the latter half of the 1980s hosting the alt forums known for being a place where anarchists lunatics and terrorists hung out more recently in 1989 he started up a company called cygnus support to pursue pursue his passions freedom of speech freedom of software and freedom of encryption as an anarchist and freedom fighter the group of barlow and gilmore represented what he believed in soon after the publicity they learned of the rating of steve jackson games similar to the three hackers the game company had their whole office confiscated by the secret service at the time steve jackson games was making a video game titled cyberpunk which the cia believed to be a handbook for computer crime this secret service looked into all their emails and had even deleted many as reported by the company the secret service was recklessly out of control and had no concept of digital rights on the 8th of june 1990 barlow released his iconic paper crime and puzzlement he writes about everything that had happened leading up to the involvement of caper wozniak and gilmore in the defense of three hackers americo is entering the information age with neither laws no nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself feeling the need for a formal in organization to fight against injustices at the end of the article he reveals the formation of the electronic frontier foundation eff an organization that would raise and disperse funds for education lobbying and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the constitution into cyberspace word of the eff traveled fast and to barlow's surprise he had touched upon an issue which received overwhelming levels of public acknowledgement the steve jackson games case would go on to set historical precedent and categorize electronic mail along with voice calls where a warrant was needed to gain access to them a pretty good bill early in next year in 1991 senator biden and added an addition to bill 266 a piece of legislation focused on anti-terrorism and the addition to the bill allowed for the government to access plain-text contents of voice data and other communications when appropriately authorized by law it basically meant that the government would be able to spy on all communications available at will all forms of communication at the time a software engineer who was building an encryption program heard about this news known as phil zimmerman spent the last decade heavily involved in liberal politics as a nuclear freeze activist and more recently started focusing on technology he was building a tool that could allow anyone with a computer to encrypt messages and files using the rsa encryption algorithm considered to be of military grade rsa had only been used commercially but zimmerman believed that everyone should have access to strong cryptography and the ability to communicate privately his program was called pgp which stood for pretty good privacy a name inspired by the grocery store known as ralph's pretty good grocery he had been vaguely debating how he was going to make a business from pgp but when he learned to build 266 he did not take the news lightly he saw it as impending doom the government was about to legalize spying and the exact activity his software was looking to protect against taking the bill as the ultimate deadline zimmerman rushed to get into the hands as many people as possible missing five mortgage payments in a row zimmerman said this is not a commercial product it was a human's rights project and while version 1.0 was considered to be weak and poorly written the recipe of sleep deprivation having no money and rush work is not an optimal one for writing software zimmerman released pgp in may of 1991 along with his famous article which included the software docs why i wrote pgp if privacy is outlawed only outlaws will have privacy intelligence agencies have access to good cryptographic technology so do the big arms and drugs traffickers so do defense contractors oil companies and other corporate giants but ordinary people in grassroots political organizations mostly do not have access to affordable military-grade public key cryptography technology until now pgp empowers people to take their privacy into their own hands there's a growing social need for it that's why i wrote it he started uploading pgp to different forums and sites it was open source free and didn't require a license for commercial use he wanted to be he wanted to put military-grade encryption into the hands of everyday people in anticipation of impending doomsday helped out by his activist friends pgp started to spread did you know before the rise of most totalitarian governments they confiscated and banned the ownership of guns this was the case in nazi germany the soviet union and italy during world war ii etc within a week people started using it around the world and within a month thousands had already downloaded it it was soon used by burmese freedom fighters and even spread to eastern europe where one person replied to zimmerman if dictatorship takes over russia your pgp is widespread from baltic to the far east now and will help democratic people if if necessary however in spite of zimmerman's scurried efforts civil liberty groups including the eff had rallied against senator biden and the addition was removed from bill 266. it turned out that it was biden who ultimately motivated the urgent release of pgp into the public may and hughes two very crazy individuals early next year gilmore hosted a party in san francisco where he invited cryptographers together to hang out and drink that was when eric hughes and timothy c may met hughes was a young mathematician who had just come back from amsterdam where he was where he worked with david chalm's digicash may was originally a hardware engineer at intel who had just spent the last three years attempting to write a non-fiction novel about david chom's ideas whilst eric was still in his mid-20s and may was in his late 30s they immediately connected over their equally crazy libertarian views by chance they were both also equally obsessed with david chalm's work timothy c may was a rugged character having been brought up by a naval officer he was a free-spirited libertarian from the early age of 12 where he very much enjoyed his guns holding a pleasantly heavy cold metallic firearm felt liberty liberating and empowering in a similar fashion while chong played with his locks and safes as a child mae's favorite toys were his ar-15s assault rifle and his 357 magnum fittingly mae pursued a career as a hardware engineer during the 80s his libertarian views gravitated him towards the wild west of cyberspace and fantasized how encryption makes it easy and even safe to ignore most local laws about what can be done in cyberspace in 1986 he read david chalm's paper security without identification card computers to make big brother obsolete and quit his drop he wanted to write about david chalm's ideas leaving intel as an employee rich from stock option options he started to write a novel called degrees of freedom may attempted to write about a rule a world ruled by digital money and data heavens blockchain's question mark time stamping and nsa surveillance and similar to most teenagers who wrote about spy fiction he never finished his the novel being an engineer at heart after three years of struggling as a writer he was done with the sidelines i don't want to work on this stupid novel i want to actually build this elaborate world that i was imagining eric hughes had studied mathematics at berkeley as an undergraduate student during his time there he was first exposed to the work of david trum at a cryptography conference crypto86 chom had been talking about a system of digital money where he stressed the importance of anonymous payments in the increasingly digital world unlike others hughes was captured by the political implications of technology and cryptography after a short consulting consulting stint he left for amsterdam to work for david chom's digicash but despite being obsessed about his research hugh described how he was not too fond of choms personality a comment that would not surprise any of the past and present digicash employees after a short stint at digicash he came back home he had come back earlier in may 1991 to apply for a berkeley graduate school as hughes had mentioned needing a place to stay while he looked for a place to rent may offered to cover him while it made sense then hughes agreed and came to live with may for a short while upon arriving he ended up doing very little of what he was intending to to do look for a place to live instead hughes and may spent the three days straight just talking about crypto whilst others had day jobs may was a rare mix of being rich as well as a failed author and hughes was a young 20-something year old with no responsibilities we spent three intense days talking about math protocols domain-specific languages secure anonymous systems man it was fun said may the first meeting later in september of 1991 hughes may and gilmore came up with the idea of gathering a regular meetup of tech libertarians they liked the idea and sent out hughes to a newly rented house so on a september saturday morning 30 or so academics engineers and crypto advocates sat on the unfurnished floor of hugh's newly rented house and so it began may had prepared 57 page handouts detailing concept of cryptography and other background information on the discussion that they planned they included a diskette copy of pgp 2.0 which was released the week before after ceremoniously distributing the packets he began the meeting by reading aloud his five-year-old creation to which he called the crypto anarchist manifesto it was a political manifesto written back in 1988 during may's short-lived career as an author it projected a vision of a future where the world's data liberty and governance were ruled by laws of cryptography and mathematics he originally written it for the cryptography conference crypto1988 he printed out hundreds of copies and gave them out but no one cared too much about the political implications of cryptography but unlike those present at the crypto 88 conference as may read the manifesto out the motley crew of crypto fanatics who sat on the floor nodded and grumbled in approval excerpt if the government can't monitor you it can't control you politics has never given anyone lasting freedom and it never will may didn't trust in the protection of privacy and freedom with companies instead he trusted the law of mathematics to do so may in an early video conference in 2017 commented how at least one or two of the people present had probably created bitcoin after initial discussions around the world they lived in they started to play a series of role of playing games that simulated cryptographic concepts by now you would probably have realized how huge geeks these people were for the rest of the afternoon and evening they used paper and envelopes to play out digital money information markets pseudonyms hypothetical drug trading systems and reputation systems they had naturally arrived at the issue that chom had originally encountered metadata and its exploitability frustrated at how cryptography had made little progress since the 80s they talked about how they would go about implementing charm solution of a mix network the group talked about cryptography all night long and ended up sleeping on the floor of hugh's bare floor during the next morning while hughes and may were buying bagels they asked themselves why limit the club to the physical world when the real mass of potential cryptography fanatics were on the cyberspace they realized that the internet was going to be built in chat rooms not in someone's living room within a week hughes developed mailing list 1.0 a remailer list think like an email chat room the mailing list would send mails to and from different users and hide the original sender's identity behind a pseudonym how finney would implement pgp 2.0 into the re-emailing list and another cypherpunk called cottrell would implement message batching to hide the timing of messages hugh's girlfriend jude millen the editor editor of a tech magazine commented how you guys are just a bunch of cypherpunks a play on the world cyberpunk and cipher the term would soon be worn as a badge of pride and political defiance within a month of the first meeting the mailing list was up and members could subscribe by emailing cipherpunks-request toad.com after 13 years david chom's concept of a mixed network was finally realized the birth of the cypherpunks this mailing list would become the harbor of america's most back channel discussion surrounding cryptography drug markets assassinations and government politics julian assange along with the creators of tor bittorrent and most likely bitcoin were part of this list early on within a week it had a hundred subscribers and by the end of the year there would be over 2000 similar remailers hosted around the world one of the first messages serviced on the 10th of october 1992 which announced the details of the second cyberpunk offline meetup this time it would be held in the offices of cygnus support gilmore's company in mountain view where google now currently resides in here's a what seems to be an email from the email list the second meeting october 10th 1992. the second meeting will be held in the new cygnus offices exact address and directions to follow we do not have yet an exact agenda but one should be arriving in the next few days please mark your calendars now and start telling your friends for this meeting and until further announced we are using a transitive trust system for invitations invite anyone you want and let them invite anybody they want and so on the crypto anarchy game we tried out at the first meeting was a good success as we could have hoped for from an untested idea the game seems useful and fun enough to want continued play and play testing so we'll be playing it again and on future meetings we've observed several interesting emergent behaviors in the first session including resellers and reputation behaviors we'll play a two-hour session this time and discuss it afterwards the cyberpunks list is a forum for discussion about technological defenses for privacy in the digital domain cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it cypherpunks acknowledge that those that want privacy must create it for themselves not expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of benefits and beneficence cyberpunks know that the people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers envelopes closed doors and couriers cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions the most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption to encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy but to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best to defend it cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography cypherpunks which wish to learn about it to teach it to implement it to make more of it cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social structures cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to defend it cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good cryptosystems cypherpunks love to practice they love to play with public key cryptography they love to play with anonymous and pseudo-anonymous mail and forwarding and delivery they love to play with the dc nets they love to play with secure communications of all times cypherpunks write code they know that someone has to write the code to defend privacy and since it's their privacy they're going to write it cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks may practice and play with it cypherpunks realize that security is not built in a day and are patient with incremental progress cypherpunks don't care if you don't like their software they write soft cypherpunks know that their software can't be destroyed cypherpunks know that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy continued the second meeting of the cypherpunks will be saturday at noon john gilmore has graciously provided us with a meeting space at the new cygnus support offices these offices are so new in fact that sidness will not have been moved in yet this meeting will be a bring your own pillow or chair since it will likely be held in a largely empty space directions are at the end of this message attendance is transitive trust arbitrarily deep invite whoever you want let them also do so and so on invite them also to join the mailing list do not however just post the announcement time will come for that i'd like everyone to who plans on attending this meeting to send me hughes soda.berkeley.edu a message telling me so i'd like to get a rough headcount before saturday for game planning we are starting at noon because of popular demand eat beforehand or bring a burrito or something it will be fine to eat during the first segment it won't be any more disruptive than the game is bring your own pgp public key for in-person key distribution preferably on diskette we need a portable pc or three to do key distribution if you have one you can bring post it to the list and tell people we've realized after the first meeting that a strict schedule is nonsense this meeting will have a very informal schedule schedule starting at noon we're going to play session 2 of the crypto anarchy game in which players try to conduct business under the watchful eyes of others we want to play for two hours and then have a dis a discussion about experiences afterwards for about an hour some of the improvements over last time will flatter denominations of money wider distribution of commodities more watchers governmental and otherwise and perhaps some pre-printed forms we'll take a break to regroup for about 10 or 20 minutes for the second half we'll talk about the security of remailers i'll lead the discussion we'll be designing protocols and analyzing attacks and defenses i've done this done this with digicash for electronic money protocols and remailers are much easier but still probably more than an afternoon's discussion we'll do this until six or so when people will have to start leaving everyone who wants to will go out to dinner i don't know any of the restaurants down there perhaps someone can suggest one and then the rest of the emails this the directions okay so back to peter pan's article that was just an email thread that was part of the cypherpunk's email thread um now we're now back to the article from peter pan cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it cypherpunks are devoted to cryptography cipherpunks love to practice cypherpunk's write code unlike other political movements throughout history the cypherpunks were able to equally match and defeat the government through direct action an archive of the messengers are available online here's an archive of the first year of messengers there's a link in the article john gilmore's shenanigans so while gilmore was running his company organizing crypto rebel rebel meetups he was caught up with another hobby of his annoying the nsa he had been battling a court case with the nsa and scored another win for the cypherpunks earlier that year in the june of 1991 he had learned of some books written by a cryptographer known as william friedman he was the founder of the u.s signal intelligence service the precursor to the nsa after reading two volumes of friedman's work he realized that the other four volumes were classified he asked for them to be declassified they said no this was not because gilmore was a pain in the ass but instead he had stumbled across one of nsa's founding documents so being a curious george he started hunting for them and ended up in virginia after being tipped off by a friend when he found the exact books that were classified by the nsa he mailed them to himself however life was not as simple as that under surveillance the nsa demanded him to hand them over denying the request he argued how these textbooks are relatively simple cryptographic techniques and that he obtained them legally to get them off his back he gave his story to the press and after a front-page headline focusing on the nsa they dropped the pursuit of gilmore and the books soon after the books were declassified the nsa hated the publicity and were forced to give it up so after all that effort what value were their books to gilmore and the cypherpunks apparently nothing gilmore just wanted to stand up to the nsa and prove that government could be defeated gilmore won nsa zero pgp 2.0 gets into trouble early next year in 1993 pgp fell into the sights of the us government after having attention drawn to zimmerman through rsa's intellectual property dispute regulators initiated a criminal investigation on the violation of arms export control act cryptography since world war ii had been considered as a military product and controlled within the same class as munitions while back then the world was made up of stone and chalk in the 90s it was a digital one where software and computing led to the us's gdp with zimmerman given a court date the eff and the public rallied behind him in response to the government he printed copies of pgp's source code on hardback to cover as a political stunt books were protected by the first amendment under free speech but cryptography was outlawed what about a book that had cryptographic source code what was that then but despite all the ridicule the public threw at the government it was clear as day zimmerman could not deny it he had violated the munitions act things looked grim for the software engineer turned hippy quote to have 10 lawyers tell me unanimously tell me that it was hopeless it was a ton of bricks it was the worst day says zimmerman his all-star legal team was sure of defeat until one of them had an idea known as phil du bois he built his reputation through creativity in defending criminals celebrities and generally crazy people who did stupid things instead of denying and pleading du bois idea was to go on the offensive and portray the government as a danger to freedom this would become this would become key to the zimmerman defense and luckily for zimmerman the government would soon step into its own noose shortly after the zimmermann case in april 1993 the bill 266 had come back in another form the clipper chip sinking the clipper chip there is no better time to release an nsa spy device that allowed federal state and local law enforcement officials the ability to decode and intercept voice and data transmissions its timing was perfect to further piss off an already irritated nation that stood behind zimmerman the clipper chipset was a manufacturing standard that encrypted data similar to the des of the 70s it had been part of the clinton administration's attempts to manage the country's security the government just wanted to protect everyone by having access to everything everywhere whenever they wanted and while the des of the 70s had had suspicions of being backdoored the clipper chip was straightforward about it it was part of the chip's inherent design and was openly announced through its proposal it had a slight improvement upon the des 56-bit key and use an 80-bit key and like most government projects today back then you could also trust the quality of the work that sarcasm by the way with a healthy distrust of the government and fresh memories of the last three years when the clipper chip was announced the public erupted against it they had just woke this this sleeping bear a very excited crew of cypherpunks official civil rights groups such as the eff responded to the proposal in well-tempered criticisms of how it endangered freedom but in the general public population frenzy and paranoia is ensued orwell's dystopian world of 1984 was about to come true in contrast to the mainstream urgency the cypherpunks were rather excited imagine this you forecasted a doomsday and had started preparing for it and 10 years later it happens and sure while the world looks like it was going to end it would be hard to not get excited to watch the world scramble and arrive at the same conclusions which you had already arrived at the cypherpunks predicted and expected this day the war is upon us announced timothy c may clinton and gore folks have shown themselves to be enthusiastic supporters of big brother timothy c may eric hughes john gilmore and other cypherpunks rallied against this news with a level of giddy enthusiasm and while the cypherpunks openly oppose the chip and debate raucously about their withdrawal many others including may did not actually take it too seriously they knew the vulnerabilities of the chip design and how public key cryptography fundamentally becomes useless the moment anyone else has the private key the back door of the ship was almost like a sick joke to them on the day of the release may wrote first the bad news the government wants to control encryption though they are playing coy about it it's clear that eventually they will try and ban quote the good stuff it's clear zimmerman and others have gotten their attention now the good news it does not matter the game is over we won the government may engage in holding actions but it still doesn't matter what we have here is the state's pitiful attempt to make the best of a bad situation this amazing policy announcement is a tacit admission of defeat how can i be so sure the cat is out of the bag free mil-spec data encryption is readily available for all within a year equivalent voice encryption freeware will join it there is no way the government can stuff the encryption cap back into the bag they can pass their laws we will do as we please and they will help us nonetheless there have been an emergency meeting at the offices of cygnus support with 50 cypherpunks tightly packed into a room they would brainstorm ideas to destroy and rebel against the government similar to how in fight club tyler durden would hand out assignments that cipherpunks printed off parody stickers that said intel inside and stuck them inside of computer stores where mei had originally drawn it on a whiteboard as a joke referring to big brother inside other design t-shirts that shouted fight the clipper had lines from may's crypto anarchist manifesto whitefield diff was a major influencer during this clipper chip saga and would later write a famous public letter to the clinton administration here's an excerpt no right of private conversation was enumerated in the constitution i don't suppose it occurred to anyone at the time that it could be prevented now however we are on the verge of a world in which electronic communication is both so good and so inexpensive that intimate business and personal relationships will flourish between parties who can at most occasionally afford the luxury of traveling to visit each other if we do not accept the right of these people to protect the privacy of communication we take a long step in the direction of a world in which privacy will only belong to the rich the import of this is clear the decisions we make about communication security today will determine the kind of society we live in tomorrow early next year in 1994 a national council of 40 experts industry leaders and academics wrote a public open letter to the clinton administration asking for the clipper proposal to be withdrawn this group of 40 included all three original creators of public key cryptography martin hellman whitfield diffy and ralph merkel ronald rivest one of the creators of the rsa encryption david chalm founder of digicash philip zimmerman creator of pgp here's an excerpt the clipper proposal should not be adopted we believe that if this proposal and the associated standards go forward even on a voluntary basis privacy protection will be diminished innovation will be slowed government accountability will be lessened and the openness necessary to ensure the successful development of the nation's communications and infrastructure will be threatened next section government don't worry we have it covered next year during may of 1995 the nsa finally responded failing to give an inch of ground they responded through a fairly pointless press release that attempted to assure the public of the chip security the cryptographic strength of the clipper algorithm is very substantial and should be highlighted with regard to the atnt tsd 3600 device and other similar devices these vendors almost exclusively employ des encryption des encryption is based on the use of 56b key information clipper employs an algorithm which is based upon an 80-bit key although it's 20 bits longer although it's only 24 bits longer clipper encryption provides 16 million times as many permutations which makes it geometrically more difficult to decrypt this fact is a critical counterpart to the encryption methodology and makes clipper encryption attractive by 1994 the communications manufacturer at t had started creating hardware with the chip communication companies were starting to use the chip but despite this the ideology of the cypherpunks had reached far and wide as the chip was released into commercial products the cypherpunk soon had eyes on the restricted design of the chip an att embedded systems engineer called matt blais had the job in testing the chip for production and was able to examine it closely he discovered that while the cipher itself was relatively secure the nsa's key for access to the encrypted backdoor was only a 16-bit hash that could be brute forced it turned out that blaze was also a cypherpunk and part of the mailing list after consolidating his findings he published them in 1994 effectively breaking the chip's design soon after his findings the clipper chip was discarded and found impractical by the government and also commercial producers the tides were finally starting to turn next year the cypherpunk's efforts will continue and transition into a series of legal battles karn vs the united states soon after the vulnerability of the clipper chip was released a programmer known as philip r khan stepped up to the challenge the government's classification of cryptography as a munition he ordered an assessment of a book that contained cryptographic source codes for encryption algorithms unable to dispute the claim it was found that the book was not subject to the munitions act khan continued to request a second assessment of the book's cd disk which contained the source code detailed inside the book but unable to prove otherwise it fell under the munitions act the nuances here were decided on the potential ability to cause malice through the medium in which the source coast was held on but his efforts would not be wasted bernstein versus the united states next year in 1995 karn's case held the legal grounds for another challenge a student of berkeley called daniel j bernstein attempted to publish a paper along with source code about his encryption protocol and through his publication challenged the munitions act in federal trial court of northern california based off the precedent of karn vs the united states the court ruled that the source code inside the paper was speech protected under the first amendment while karn's case had ruled text forms of source code to fall outside of the munitions act bernstein's case proved it to be protected by the first amendment under free speech the pieces of the puzzle were slowly coming together junger versus united states peter drunger would be the next to challenge the munitions act he was a law professor who enjoyed teaching from first principles and wanted to wanted his students to not only study but also play with concepts explored for one of his courses he was restricted to only taken international non-us citizens as he had included an encryption program in the course materials where it officially recognized as the export of cryptography held back from teaching he announced his case against the munitions act believing that it violated the first amendment leveraging the recent cases of khan khan and leveraging the recent cases of karn and bernstein junior's case would emerge victorious later in 1999 to conclude how software would be protected by the first amendment but immediately after junger's initial challenge the clinton administration gave in jungler's case would only be closed later on later that year on the 12th of october 1996 president bill clinton signed executive order 13026 cryptography was officially removed from the munitions list and placed on a lightly controlled schedule the export of cryptography was no longer prohibited through this order zimmerman's case would also be dismissed as the consequences of exporting no longer carried any weight the battle was won but was it over no coming full circle from hellmann diffy and merkel later in 1998 as the remaining legal cases surrounded cryptography were finally being closed gilmore looked to press on and completely destroy the government's claim and involvement on future cryptographic technology the cypherpunks community has set their size the cypherpunks community has set their sights on the des originally released in 1976 it was an encryption standard that was provided for commercial use the des was what martin hellman and whitfield diffy had to pose and what inspired the open publication of public key cryptography one of their criticisms of the des was that it was 56-bit key was theoretically vulnerable to a brute force attack but back in the 1970s doing so was considered unfeasible with the degree of computing power available but in the now in the year 1998 it was a different story later that year rsa data security released a bounty to see who could crack a des secured message after five months it would be solved they set a bigger bounty of ten thousand dollars to see if anyone could do it faster and better after missing the boat on the first challenge gilmore who by then had a successful business took on the challenge with a cryptographer called paul coacher he worked under and was trained by martin hellman one of the three original public key inventors fitting for the mission that would bring history full circle gilmore and kosher spent 222 thousand dollars to build a computer called deep crack within 56 hours that the des was cracked after about two decades of controversy the des was finally broken and soon officially declared defunct by the year 2000 all restrictions and regulations surrounding cryptography had been removed by the government open source cryptography was legal and allowed at the beginning of the 90s the world wasn't sure where it stood with cryptography until the government gave people a reason to care the cypherpunks fought and won they did so to protect the right of personal privacy and liberty through cryptography they will continue to rampage through the 2000s leaving behind in their trail tor and the rise of the deep web torrenting and piracy wikileaks and transparency but more relevantly bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the next part part 4 we will explore the creation of tor bittorrent wikileaks and the birth of bitcoin here's some awesome pictures standing on the shoulders of giants huh part four the last part by the way on the home stretch before bitcoin part 4 the 2000s new millennium continuing on from the 90s this movement fought the injustices of the u.s government and their treatment of digital rights it all began over a series of hacker raids that would spark a decade-long skirmish between the cypherpunks and the government with civil rights emerging victorious the world was no longer in 1992. cryptography was removed from the munitions act and code was officially deemed under the protection of the first amendment act of free speech by the end of the 90s it was a different world msn was founded in 95 google was founded at 98. in 2001 apple would soon release its first ipod to change mobile technology forever myspace would emerge in 2003 facebook in 2004 youtube in 2005. the world was changing and a new era was on the cusp but what about the cypherpunks after the late 90s victory over the government there was a short time period in which things seemed quiet and naturally there was no need for an underground dwelling of rebels anymore cryptography was legally open source and its export from the us spread strong cryptography all over the world by the 2000 cypherpunk mailing this activity was dying out after the attack on 911 the government questionably increased their brute force authorization on hosting services for investigations and soon cypherpunk mailing lists were shut down as a joke one of the last cypherpunk mailing lists renamed themselves to cypherpunk al-qaeda.net in a recent video conference call in 2016 timothy c may remembers that quote i didn't think it would be too smart to be part of a group labeled al-qaeda.net many others thought the same and the members of the list fled elsewhere with over thousands of messages spanning over nearly a whole decade it served as the cypherpunk war room and the home of the 90s techno-libertarian spirit with the infamous mailing list coming to an end things were just getting started for the cypherpunks a cambrian explosion of internet information services would erupt in the following decade and change society forever and with developing applications of the internet from file sharing video streaming gaming e-commerce the cypherpunk missions of privacy and uncensored techno technological freedom stayed ever relevant the cypherpunk spirit continuously lives on through bittorrent the tour network pirate bay wikileaks the silk road dark net markets and all its contributors where many were part of the original cypherpunk's mailing list julian assange was a very active member back in 1995 and so were core members of the tor project bittorrent and other open source advocates but also through bitcoin and the web 3.0 we often lose track of perspective of where we are in history it is far too easy to look no further beyond the local maximum of technol technological innovation that was the reason i wrote the series before bitcoin bitcoin wasn't a eureka moment it was a technology constructed with ideas and blueprints spanning over nearly half a century it is part of a movement that has been brewing for the last 40 to 50 years starting with martin hellman whitfield diffie and ralph merkel's open source publication of public key cryptography they started the movement of the cypherpunks that would see the ideology behind bitcoin it enabled true immutability and censorship resistant data but more importantly it was a significant zero to one moment for decentralized technologies the rag tagged bits and pieces making up bitcoin can be found in the waking trail of the cypherpunks satoshi built bitcoin along with hal finney nick zabo and wei dai it was handcrafted by the veterans of the 90's crypto wars it was part of the inventing spirit of the cypherpunk movement that will continue to live on while this might be a historical series it is yet to conclude as we are all part of it and continuing it it seems motionless and still but one thing is certain in history and that is change and change has been part of the cypherpunks movement for the last 40 to 50 years we have to take a step back and appreciate that bitcoin and now ethereum is simply another piece of the puzzle that will fit into our story and the movement of the cypherpunks it is simply just another important stepping stone for the movement just like public key cryptography the cypherpunk's mailing list bittorrent tor and wikileaks we have to look beyond what is in the present and into the future in order to shape the world that we want while david chom knew about the consequences of a centralized internet no one else believed him to work towards a better future we may not realize it but we are moving towards something that is way bigger than anyone can imaginably conceive a future built on cryptography and liberty even back in the 70s martin hellman and whitfield diffy knew it themselves we stand on the brink of a revolution in cryptography here's some more pictures here's andreas antonopoulos talking about bitcoin to a crowd of four people in an empty room in 2013. wow here's gavin wood presenting ethereum at devcon1 thank you and it has been a pleasure writing this series i hope you have enjoyed it history is rich and full of surprises it simply takes some effort to look around there's a lot to be gained knowledge gratitude and wisdom next time look into it you will find richness and delight on par with the creation of public key cryptography and the cypherpunks themselves the before bitcoin series pays homage to all the heroes who fought to protect privacy freedom and liberty while the spotlight of this series did land on a select few i want to also address those individuals who names were not mentioned the names that fell through the cracks of history the early internet engineers that wrote and maintained code for public infrastructure the cryptographers who sought to protect the freedom of speech and privacy the vendors who risked their freedom to enable free commerce of contraband goods the contributors who answered the stack exchange queries the open source project managers and the whistleblowers who sacrifice their own bringing to bring in justice into
