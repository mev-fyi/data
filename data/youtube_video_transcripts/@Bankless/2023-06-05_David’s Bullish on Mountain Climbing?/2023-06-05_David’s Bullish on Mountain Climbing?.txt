how do you maintain interest during the market my strategy is to invest time and energy into something completely different so that when you do have time for crypto you make it in very intentional and you go very deep so I'm bullish on climbing mountains what in one month time I will be in the middle of Mount Rainier and Mount Baker and then at the end of ECC I've signed up to climb the Matterhorn the Matterhorn is 15 000 feet I don't want to do this podcast solo David yeah I know this is great this is great news I'm excited for you
