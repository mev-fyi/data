there are some criticisms in the community about Lido right now and I think there's the perception among um critics that this would not be a good thing do you think this addresses the critics critiques or do you think there's still something to them Ryan in order to answer that I I want to take kind of a step back it's not a Lido problem right this is kind of a general problem that ethereum is dealing with and has to deal with welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless Lido has over 30 percent eth staked right now all of the each staking 30 is in Lido should we be alarmed by this is this a threat to ethereum's decentralization that's where we start this episode today but we didn't end the episode there we also got into the more meaty topic is it even possible to keep ethereum decentralized over the long run the guest today is protocol researcher hasu and this is a fantastic episode a few takeaways for you number one we talk about the state of staking as it is today what happens when an entity controls over one-third of ethereum's stake what about two-thirds number two we talk about the state of Lido how can it become more decentralized is it on that path number three we talk about this cultural phenomenon in ethereum we've got idealists and we have pragmatists there seems to be a cultural class between these two ideals of ethereum and the reality of network effects and the lock traps what's the right balance and number four we end the episode actually where we start which is this question does Lido have a bad rep is that fair or is it unfair David this was a really interesting episode to me I love having hacuan it's not his first time coming on Bank list why is this episode significant to you the need for this episode has been crescendoing I would say there has been a growing conflict with lydo between lydo and others taking as a service organizations out there and some of it is real and can and concerning and these concerns have been elevated by some in the ethereum leadership some strong ethereum community members and other critiques of Lido I think might be narrative and might be opportunistic by other uh staking as a service orgs and so we I want to really unpack this question in this episode does Lido deserve the bad rap that it gets so this is the in defense of lado episode where elido representative can come and speak on behalf of the vision for for Lido which is not something that I don't think you and I have yet been able to articulate here on the podcast and so what is real about the critiques of Lido and what is fake is something that we try to unpack here in this episode yeah and uh as always of course we have a debrief episode where David I can't wait to talk to you about this there's so many ideas in my brain about this I want to get your raw thoughts that's available to bankless premium subscribers on a premium RSS feed you can click a link in the show notes to access that and as always guys this is uh you know the first step in a conversation about Lido it's not the only step so we'll certainly have future episodes taking the counter position to this and as a reminder guys this is just one episode on Bank list about Lido and I think we'll have future episodes to continue the conversation maybe from some alternate perspectives but first we disclose bankless holds investments in Lido and rocketpool and David I have Angel investments in some smaller staking startups we're long-term investors not journalists we don't do paid content and there's a link to all bankless disclosures in the show notes we were really excited to host this coming conversation with hazu like Ryan said he's been on the show a number of times before I have a ton of respect for the man in the way that he thinks so I think this is going to be a very enjoyable conversation for the broader ethereum ecosystem and hopefully can start many further conversations as well

to welcome hazu an independent researcher in crypto back to bankless he's been affiliated with a number of different organizations pushing the frontier of this industry previously research at Paradigm governance inside of maker Dao and more recently strategy lead at flashbots and also the reason why he's here on the show today is he is also a strategic advisor to the Lido organization Lido of course is a staking as a service dial that holds over 31 of all eats staked making it the largest staking entity in ethereum and has been the focus of a lot of support from certain parts of crypto and also a ton of controversy from others so today on the show we're going to unpack some of the nuances about the Lido organization the perceived risks the reality of risks all about Lido and what it means to be the largest staking as a service organization in ethereum hazu welcome back to banglas I'm very excited to be back David Ryan it's a pleasure yeah I think this is a conversation that I think all of the crypto space I I think generally Lido gets a bad rap and maybe some of it's Justified maybe some of it's not justified but I'd like to actually explore the Contours of that conversation and try to figure out what's reality and what's narrative and what's truth so you ready for that yeah let's Dive In so maybe we can start with this hazu do you think Lido has an unfair rap in crypto like do you think the perception of Lido's um perhaps doesn't it doesn't deserve the perception that it receives I think it's a nuanced question I think that um so just to already kind of lay out what I guess the controversy is um the the argument against Lido is that um it's the biggest stick in protocol and um because of its size it can have a small but nonetheless possible impact on the validators of ethereum to behave in certain ways um and um this I would say a secondary argument that says um stake if is is the uh is kind of the asset that is issued by the Lido protocol that represents stake on the beacon chain in a validator and that asset is also becoming increasingly used and increasingly attractive to users because if you compare it to ethereum you know ethereum is the best asset in the world um but if you have steak Thief then it's ethereum but it's staked so it's also earning four to five percent um in you know if the nominated Network rewards from the beginning chain and the consensus layer so it's it's like Eve but um it's it's also generating some return for you and um so because this asset is becoming increasingly used compared to ethereum I think there's also increasingly uh systemic concerns in the sense that um if it's if it's kind of the unencumbered asset it's you know it's very unlikely that there's ever any problem with it at the Smart contract level um and if there is then it's very clear that you know what ethereum should do about it but it's not so clear about stake Leaf right um because take Eve is a smart contract on ethereum and it's it's kind of a it's it's it's a protocol it's not part of the ethereum stack it's something that is built on top that was developed by the free market right and I think if there's a problem ever with staked Eve then it's much harder a much harder decision that could potentially cause a rift in the ethereum community for what to do about this maybe to explain some of the um some of the reasons why this debate is so big is I think if you re-rolled the dice of ethereum you would have this debate no matter what I just like how you said ether I totally agree with you it's the world's greatest asset but the only thing that's better than ether is of course staked ether and I think in this conversation it is takes the assumption that eventually staked ether will be the dominant currency inside of ethereum the dominant form of collateral simply just because it is ether plus more plus plus more of itself and so this is why this this conversation naturally concludes is like which free market service provider is going to provide that version of staked ether into defy into the ethereum economy would you say that that's an accurate interpretation of the future 100 I and I really like how you said that if you reroll the dice um of ethereum and you'll play through the history a million times then I think in in virtually every case you would have the same debate because you had ether and then you go to proof of Stack you create the ability to have steak Diva and this always always creates the situation where people will of course want to delegate their stake two node operators and while having it on the beating chain they still want to use it at the execution layer you know they want to trade it they want to collateralize it and in general they want the optionality to do with this asset to do like whatever they want and not have to wait a month in the withdrawal queue and so you basically created this situation um and there's no way to get out of it right so you have to deal with the consequences so any chain that has proof of stake a and has kind of aspires for the native token to be money um has the situation right and this will play out in every single blockchain ecosystem that has these properties and so it is a very hard fundamental question and and challenge um that we need to address and there are no easy answers I think presenting it as a as a market challenge is the right way to frame this um too often I feel like uh in crypto clearly sometimes there are bad guys and there are good guys in crypto um but sometimes crypto becomes overly tribal and we attack people and uh individuals and entities at times we should be attacking what we call moloch problems game theoretic type problems what you're illustrating here hasu is a sort of a game theory type problem of um well who who wants this the market wants it why because the market wants to stake their eth if they are etholders in order to receive the yield and they want that eth to be as as fungible and as usable as possible so we have these liquid staking tokens um that are you know staked in each that we want to use across other things and so the problem with that is it creates centralization it creates some sort of network effect for let's say the pool or the apparatus or the entity that that can service that market need most effectively and I this almost resembles when you we're starting to illustrate the problem or the criticism of of Lido it kind of sounds like a too big to fail type of argument it it sounds a little bit like um the problem that ethereum faced in the early days of a lot of ether being concentrated yeah I'm so glad that you said this I just I was ready to make the same in my head I wanted to bring up the same thing because you had you had already had this once in the sense that there was the Dao and I think it had between 15 and 20 percent of all Eve deposited right it was this insanely popular project and then it had a security incident and yes it got resolved and there was a rift of course and I think that that left a lot of scar tissue in the ethereum you know community and the soul of ethereum not to go through a situation like that again um but what then happened afterwards was actually vitalik said you know please guys if you make another Dao or another Ico please cap it at 10 million dollars you know don't raise any more money because we don't want to create any systemic risk 10 10 million dollars or 10 million each I think I think it was I don't know I think it was 10 million I can't remember it was something close to one in the same back then some relatively some relatively small amount like maybe it was one percent of Eve maybe it was 10 million dollars I'm not sure anymore but the point was then the when the Ico boom happened this the first projects were basically following this guidance and they sold out some with and you know one or two blocks and like within minutes basically and so you know yes the kind of they they ended up respecting this wish and prevent um kind of the systemic risk to ethereum initially in the sale but it had all kinds of negative effects so first of all um it was extremely unfair who could contribute you know because only the most sophisticated whales were able to participate because they had to stay in a contribute in the first block and they had to be in a very particular time zone They had to be at their computer at the right times or you know and so on and then once the share started trading in secondary Market of course they went to their where the market would have cleared anyway because the supply was not matching the demand at all and so I think it showed that um it's very hard to kind of make these rules and that the market will always find a way yeah I think that's a a great point hasu and I want to um you know tap into kind of two points you made so one is it seems like you can't enforce this on the social layer right vitalik or the community saying hey out of the goodness of your hearts right we we'd request that you wouldn't pull more than one percent of eth in one smart contract location right well um that's not enforceable at the protocol nobody doesn't listen to that Bullock does not listen to that wrecks all of the plans and of course uh you know the market forces take hold so so that's one of the points you're making the other point I think that um is important to make here is that this pattern of too much eth being pulled in one place plays out and has played out in in other cases so let's say a centralized exchange or a group of centralized exchanges start to pool a lot more eth let's say maybe just for trading purposes so ignore staking for a second let's say a coinbase and Kraken and binance held sixty percent of the eth right and we found out that one of those actors was like a an SBF type character right well then the ethereum community has this dilemma of like wow a large portion of the eth supply is now uh controlled by a single entity and how do we get that back um I mean there have been other cases of this too I remember in the early days of maker Dao when maker Dao was just like a wrecking ball and everyone was like depositing eth inside of maker Dow smart contracts there was this question what happens if make your Dow gets hacked there's a lot of commentary on Twitter saying well now maker Dow is so big it's the king maker right and so if maker Dow smart contracts get hacked well then um that would cause like a fork of ethereum kind of Dao style so this pattern and that now we're talking about this with eigenlayer as well so this pattern you know tends to play out and I just want to illustrate like what the what the problem actually is so let's say um Lida right now has 30 of all staked eth right and so what portion of total Supply is that it's not like you know it's uh it's study time it's it's 30 times 20 because 20 is the number of all Leaf that's currently being staked on the beacon chain okay so it's thirty percent if you find something percent about about five or six percent eight million ether okay 7.9 okay so eight million ether right and so if something bad were to happen to that set of smart contracts like what's the outcome of that let's say an exploiter like a curves say there's there's a evm style issue we've seen that this week there's some kind of exploit or drainage of uh the smart contract like worst case scenario here then some exploit or some black hat has all of this ether potentially I mean that's like worst case scenario what could happen and then the question is okay where does the community go from there is that one of the core problems of kind of accruing so much eth in one place uh yes absolutely so I I think this particular risk that you outlined could not really happen um because the eve cannot be with John from Lido because it is staked on the beacon chain and um the the beaten chain has uh you know very long with joy delay so at least there's time to deliver it uh what to do so you could not have a kind of corrupt situation it would be more like the Dao situation I believe I think the the real Crux of the issue here isn't that there's a Honeypot of ether but it is what happens when a staking organization has a certain amount of uh ether staked specifically there are a couple of thresholds in the mechanics of the way that proof of stake works that gives an operator who has control of enough ether over those thresholds gives them some influence over the protocol and I believe those numbers are 33 and 66 percent can you walk us through what can someone do some entity do if they have 33 or 66 of all ether staked um I don't have all the numbers in my head anymore it has to do with um it has to do with basically preventing the chain from finalizing um there's something about you know the attestation committee I'd have to I'd have to look it up um but I mean the overall rule is is very clear like um all uh consensus protocols rely on um honest Behavior to a certain threshold and how do they encourage that by creating the right incentives for this honest Behavior to occur right in the case of ethereum um they you do it basically um by forcing the stakers to hold um what is almost a form of you know Equity or stake um in the system itself so if the system itself gets attacked there's this implicit implicit assumption that you know Europe your if would also become worth a lot less um the the slashing is almost uh you know like an additional thing on top you know so proof of Stack would work also without slashing and there are some um staking protocols that don't have slashing um but of course if you can also add slashing then you don't just have the carrot you also have the stick um so it is kind of this extra layer of security so that said um you're totally right so someone has someone who who has a stake above a certain threshold they can perform various kinds of attack in theory that doesn't mean they have the incentive to do that of course um and the second thing that I would point out is actually so in the case of Lido I think this doesn't like you have to like really stretch kind of the argument for this to apply in the first place because Lido is a protocol for Distributing stake from stakers to note node operators but under the hood there's 29 different node operators right now and many more that are being onboarded right now and staking modules that are being developed so this number is is going to go up but already today in these 29 orders are not near the same party nor do they hear like nor do they listen to in many cases you know what the lighter protocol says you know what it could lie to even unstake them today so this is something that we can talk about um so this is not a feature that's yet enabled this ability for the Dow to say you know this NoDa breada didn't do what we want so we are going to exit them you know programmatically um today Lido can only say you know you bad node operator um I will not give you any more stake that is coming in um so we have seen in the past in many instances so Mev boost is a great like the Mev policy in general was a great example then there are other examples around what to do about ofek you know when that happened um where we saw a lot of controversy between node operators that had very different views um they actively contributed to what the policy in given situations should be and uh and and so it's it's basically not possible for lighter to say um we are making you know a policy for what node operators should do and for note about us to just you know accept that policy you know so they are very opinionated they are extremely aligned with the help of the network as is the Dao itself um because I mean when you look at the economic model of the dial you know it makes revenue or it makes it makes money in perpetuity um if ethereum is healthy and ethereum thrives and if that's not the case then that's basically suicide for the dial so I think some of these what is kind of really the risk that that that I am most focused on and we can talk about that I think we have some ideas uh here about the Dao how the dial can mitigate that but but there is that I see primarily is actually someone coming into governance from the outside some attacker who maybe Bice up you know a large amount of Leo or I could find some other way to three sneaker proposal through so a code injection like we have seen all kinds of attacks and double governance right um and they actually you know do some something to the smart contract of staked Eve and maybe for example they find that they they print stakely from thin air so there's more stake Eve now than Eve on the beacon chain and there are many safeguards so um for example there's a there's a heart limit on how much that you can be generated per day to really limit you know the the risk that this can happen um but nonetheless I would say this is really uh the biggest Swiss that that I see on a kind of short-term basis and I think that is perhaps the Crux of this conversation and why we're having this conversation it's about the relationship between Lido governance and the staked ether and its node operators I want to really just quickly tie off the conversation about the thresholds and in proof of stake because these two things are coupled of course if one staking entity passes certain thresholds of protocol control then all of a sudden the governance of that entity becomes very important and so that 33 and 66 percent that I was talking about these are the two thresholds for proof of stake uh 33 like you said is um how you get finality so you need you need 66 of all ethers staked uh to um to be in consensus with each other in order to have finality and so if one entity controls 33 they influence and control finality right not too long ago we had this ethereum non-finality event which was a couple of client bugs which was an accidental non-finality event and if one staking uh operating or entity had 33 they would be able to induce this if they so chose they would have and that just means stop the blocks from finalizing David right right the blocks still propagate but they are not um they are not beholden by the weight of ethereum proof of stake they can be reverted without ether being slashed that's what you can do if you have over 33 that if one entity has over 33 that is what they can do um and then if you have 66 percent you basically are ethereum you that is like a 51 attack for proof of work but in proof of sake is 66 so if one entity had 66 of all ether stake they get to basically choose the outcome you mean like reverse blocks or that sort of thing it's like a bit more are we are we getting over recipes here yeah if I start stop parking anymore in this direction of the ethereum devs this is the direction directionally correct they can probably do some kind of reorganization I would agree exactly what you cannot do still is make any kind of invalid State transition because yeah you cannot sign transactions on other people's behalf you can just do a lot else though and so these are these are the risks right and so this is the protocol risk and so importantly to it's worth noting the philosophy that ethereum has about governance which is to not have it on chain at least uh and so uh this is there is no governance attack for ethereum on on chain specifically you would have to process through all the all-core devs calls but if one staking as a service entity perhaps Lido has more than 33 percent all of a sudden that off-chain governance philosophy actually becomes routed around by an on-chain entity called Lido and like you said hazu there's this ldo token which is the governance token of Lido and so perhaps if Lido had over 33 and it currently has 31 percent the off-chain governance philosophy of ethereum becomes um ignored and routed around by an entity that has on-chain governance with this ldo token uh and so this is where the this becomes systemic towards ethereum at large where if one entity had onshine governance like Lido does had over 33 percent uh then all of a sudden Lido gets to govern uh some of the rules of the protocol I think this is part the The Contours of the conversation as it relates to yeah vital critiquers what would you say to this I mean I I I think if we want to be precise then the concrete risk is that the light or Dao makes some kind of governance decision introduces some kind of policy that mandates that all of these independent note operators who you know have their own in completely independent motivations and stories and you know utility functions that they all collude in some way they behave in unison to destroy their own um livelihood basically and the tech ethereum um and I I mean so I think um it's it's I I couldn't imagine how that would happen um just from like knowing them and like how and like none of them individually would do something like that let alone all of them together I would also find it incredibly difficult operationally how you would coordinate something like that right so inside of Lido there are 29 node operators and what you're saying that even if Lido governance voted to like Nuke ethereum yeah you would still need to coordinate the 29 or maybe 27 28 of almost the complete majority of all lito operators that you would need to coordinate them to even follow through on that yes because it is really really important to understand that all of these note operators they run their own local infrastructure they run all of the hardware they run the validators they decide uh you know what block to build they decide um what block to a test they make all of these decisions Lido has some policies so I'd like to encourage people to think about the Lido lighter protocol as this like thin middleware layer that like get staked it it gets E from from stake us and then it has some key for how to distribute that across different node operators and then the node operators basically pay uh they they basically pay the reward back into the protocol and then five percent goes to the user and five percent goes sorry five percent goes to the node operator and five percent goes to the dial and ninety percent of goes to the user um and um and so what's what's kind of really going on here is that this the Lido Dao is the organization that develops and improves the the protocol and makes sure that that it's secure and that it's hardened and so on and what they all they can do is they can make policies for how they think the note operator should behave but the note operators are not compelled to listen right for one they can exit um they can just like not do it you know and later doesn't have um right now any strong uh way to punish that and neither today nor at any future point will they have the ability for a node operator basically to take over their hardware and say you know this is the block that you should build this is you know whether you should attest to another block or not um the most and this is a I think it's an interesting case study to understand the most uh Hands-On that that Lido has been about this is uh the Mev policy and so what the Mev policy says is there was an open there was a period basically where laido said oh proof of stake is coming so we are now upgraded so the the um the beacon Center had already been live right and then there was the merch right and so maybe six months before the merge Lido said okay so we know the merge is going to happen what does that mean so the the beginning chain Valley datas are now going to be responsible not just for the beacon chain but also for the execution there what what does that mean that means there will be you know there will like other actual ethereum transactions and there will be Mev and so we need to have some policy for what to do with this Mev and uh you know should we extract the Mev should we not extract nav if yes what is the mechanism because there are a lot of questions around this for example if you say or every uh every um value that I can do what they want then you get into the problem of Mev hiding where the the the value that can just extract the another word I just extracts the Mev and says to Lido you know they extract you know the block is three Eve and they say oh yeah look at this one Eve block that I mined here you go live here's the one youth block you know and then they pocket two ether that would be stealing from users right so Lido has the responsibility to make sure that uh there's no way for the note operators to kind of break this like 95.5 split of rewards um and they also wanted to um basically look at what ethereum wants and so you know the ethereum foundation and flashbots at the community there was a general kind of acceptance so we want you know nav is something that exists on ethereum you know there's no way to just make it go away and but what is really important is that we keep the barriers to entry into the valid data set as low as possible to encourage solo staking and so we want to make it very easy to join a permissionless and competitive market where you can Outsource the building of your blocks two right and so that was the idea behind proposal Builder separation and Mev boost and so Lido was actually the first of any exchanges of any second Protocols of everyone who publicly said we will support the idea of proposal Builder separation and we were on board Mev boost we are mandating the use of Mev boost for our node operators and here's like five Mev boost relays that you have to include and here's five more that you can include if you want so the first list the must include list that it guaranteed that it set a baseline for um basically the the minimum value of the block that the notepad I was seeing so Mev hiding is not a problem but then there was also the ability for them to include additional additional ones so for example if there was once there was the you know the the office for foreign asset control in the US had put tornado cash on their list of sanctioned transactions then some relays were saying uh I'm fine mining these transactions and others were not and many node operators were saying we do not we do absolutely not agree with the idea of uh of kind of using only relays or primarily relays that do not uh mine these transactions we want to mine all of the transactions right and so they were also given the opportunity to do that and so what Delilah was trying to do in that case is was really you know make a policy that would balance the interests of all the parties you know the steakhouse the ethereum community and the node operators and the research Community as well which was kind of trying to plan kind of what the roadmap of ethereum with regards to Mev was looking like and this is a great example in two ways one I think it shows the thoughtfulness that went into this like trying to really you know having a long discussion period anyone you can make a proposal for a policy and then it got voted on and it was like a couple months process um and the second thing it shows how the lighter dial makes decisions it doesn't make any ad hoc decisions it tries to create policies that have a lot of deliberation and then these policies they kind of exist in perpetuity right and they maybe once per year they can be Revisited and amended and if something doesn't work um then they get updated right but this is kind of the um I think a good example for how kind of light or dial makes decisions and how it thinks about these decisions so I think that's an important point if um like for listeners to understand if really is is Lido is not one kind of entity right so you can't look at Lido the same way you might look at um you know coinbases all of coinbase's stake or a binance estate if Lido gets this right and what you're you're illustrating in this example is it is a loose Confederation of a whole bunch of node operators 30 you said if it gets this right then what you essentially provide is kind of this very lightweight incredibly neutral middleware where for example all node operators inside of the Confederation again 29 of these they have the ability to do the ofax censoring relay or the non-ofax centering relayer right um they can choose and they have full autonomy they can also also withdraw from the Confederacy at any point in time if they feel like Lido you know governance is going in a particular direction so if they get it right that is what they become and the reason I want to contrast this is again I want to go back to kind of the the macro Point here of like we're trying to slate moloch right is a hard thing across crypto I think all of the good actors in the space want more decentralization I think sometimes we get in this more lazy habit of painting things as bad or good it's either bad or it's good right when reality is much more nuanced reality is there's bad there's good there's better and there's best and I want to draw the contrast between so Lido having 31 of stake that's not ideal I would say the ideal is that 100 of stake of steak teeth is all solo staked like that is the like the perfect ideal to maximize decentralization we don't live in a perfect world and perfect ideal so I will say for myself it is better to have a Lido with 31 of stake than to have let's say a not throwing One exchange under the bus but a binance with 31 of the stake I like that better and why the reason I like that better is not best but the reason I like that better is because it's a Confederacy it's kind of looser middleware versus a binance which feels a lot more kind of like a single entity that's a single person control it's CZ right uh so just making that point I think is important at this at this juncture and I mean all of the the decisions and the policies that are being made and the way that the protocol functions and Lido is completely transparent all right and if as a Staker you don't like it then you can leave if there's a note operator you don't like it you can leave right but in finance as a user you have no idea what they're actually doing how much money they are making you only know what they give you right um and they don't even have any node operators right it's just like all of their own infrastructure I think the relationship between a Lido node operator and the Lido Dao is really the Crux of this issue because we talk about like sure it's an independent node operator it's not it is a part of the Dow but it's also independent and I think the question of how much voice does a node operator have independently versus the Dao is like the big issue here so if the Dao makes some organisms make some vote that is harmful to ethereum can a node operator actually achieve independence from that vote and so we you said like yeah they could just leave and they could not not be beholden by that vote but then they but then they stop getting paid they stop getting the reward uh and so there is some sort of enforcement coercion uh coordination that the Dao holds so like Lido it's not decentralized it is an organization it's called blido it has a name it does coordinated things and so yes there are a it's a collection of Parts but it's not it is still we can call it a name it's got a name that means it's a it's a there is an entity here and so like how do we think about the independence between a node operator Raider and the influence of the Dow yeah so you're completely right so the Dao can if a note operator decides to leave then they don't get to take the stake with them right so the stake is with the light of protocol and the lighter protocol distributes take two different node operators and it also Aggregates the the kind of the bargaining power and so on of all of these different stakeouts and really gives them the best terms right so there is a reason why Lido you know lidoor node operators they basically get five percent of the staking reward and on coinbase they get 25 right um so this is um this is kind of the difference right because lidoor bundles the demand and thereby it has a strong bargaining power against the node operators but you completely right bargaining power can also be abused and this is why it is extremely important that the staircase also get a voice in the decisions that would affect them so for example if if the light would dial wanted to say node operators you know only mine empty blocks from now on okay this is something very stupid but it's just an example that would clearly be bad for ethereum because everybody you know now 31 of blocks would be censored um and they would like the capacity of ethereum would go down right and um so this is I mean it's clearly not in the best interest of norda breeders who now make way less money so they would resist but maybe they don't have a way to resist but for stakers it's also clearly bad because they make less money and also they are afraid that you know their Eve will become worthless and so Lido the dial Dao has developed this new um concept that's called dual governance and it basically means that the governance responsibilities would be split between the ldo token holders and the stickers I.E the stake e folders and it's not too dissimilar from other kind of bicameral governance systems that have come I mean around the same time or after that so for example there's you know the Dual house system in optimism where you have talk loaders but then you also have kind of uh like just elected not elected but nominated kind of groups of community participants right who who are kind of trusted right so and these are kind of meant to balance each other out you know so uh maybe the token holders decide something bad but then the elected officials they can still do something right and you yeah something similar you have it in arbitrome for example there's a so-called security concept um that the the the app holders they still have to upgrade but for example the bridge contract um but what the security Council can do is uh it's a group of I think 11 people and if if I think six of them vote together then they can also uh kind of Turbo upgrade also everything and they can also pause the system why because sometimes it's it's necessary to overwrite kind of what um the majority is saying right or the majority can't act fast enough and then it's also important to override them for security reasons so you do have um kind of systems like that and I think um what makes them so powerful is that you really introduce new checks and balances that make the system much more robust so the the LD Auto can hold us could no longer make any policy change that would go against you know the wish of let's say you know more than two percent or more than five percent of the staked efforters and for something that is you know transparently bad or stupid or anything like that it's it's it basically gives the stakers a chance to just veto the proposal and even uh get you know whoever made the proposal and voted for it uh slashed so there's now a big disincentive um to even making kind of a malicious proposal in in Lido in general also so just to clarify does this mean effectively that I think there's like over 14 billion dollars worth of steth as the light of staked each token that's out there does this effectively mean that that that pool of capital all has a vote here is that what that means it cannot change the protocol it can only prevent changes to the protocol you get a veto photo exactly so this is and what's really cool here I will say this is one cool feature uh of crypto um this is almost a like this is why crypto organizations can operate different than corporations that we're used to seeing the real world right so this is akin to like um Apple iPhone users all of them having a vote like veto power at least right over some corporate kind of decision making so it's not just the Apple shareholders that get to dictate all of the rules if you have an iPhone you have some contribution of your governance and I do like you can't do that with iPhone users like our system is not set up to do that but we can design these types of governance systems in crypto economic protocols and that to me is is actually very exciting this feature um has you by the way it hasn't been introduced yet so we're talking about something in the future is that correct yeah so it's a it's something thing that has been in the works for I think nine months now it's now in its Fifth Fifth iteration so it's progressing through the the research stages uh I would expect that it might go live uh before the year is over so it's it's pretty much two already in its kind of research stage but it's not life yet so earlier when we were defining the problem statement one of the problem statements that people um uh give towards Lido is is that ethereum is this no on-chain governance protocol and then if Lido has over 33 or any staking as a service uh system that has governance has over 33 percent of each stake then all of a sudden the non-on-chain governance of philosophy of ethereum uh becomes invalidated and what this mechanism is doing is it is giving the stake to eat holders a veto mechanism to suppress the on-chain governance nature of Lido in the instance that that needs to be expressed by staked ether holders and so it is going closer back towards the no on-chain governance philosophy of ethereum but I will say it doesn't get all the way there it is still it's a it's I'll call it a Band-Aid not a fix uh and so maybe hazi you can kind of talk about you said um two percent or five percent 70 of the steak to eat holders need to vote in order to veto a dow vote my critique here is is that well the product of staked ether is meant to be a hold and ignore type of product and so while it is a feature that staked ether holders have the veto it is also a bug because now they are responsible for checking the Lido governance when they might just want to put staked ether inside of maker Dao and then go have a vacation for five years yeah and so um I'll say that this is a step in the right direction but I won't say the problem is of the fact that lydo now has on-chain governance is fixed how would you respond to this yeah I mean if you compare it to the status quo which is I mean they they also have to monitor Ali or governance but they have no way to stop it it's a clear Improvement because they still have to monitor but they can stop it right and only a small very small Quorum of them would have to watch and do we know what those numbers are so off the top of my head so the reason I give two numbers is um I believe so you want a kind of you want a number that is so low that it's relatively easy to trigger but not so easy that it becomes possible to grieve the protocol and the other stakers yeah so I believe the way that the fifth and latest iteration is designed is you need two percent to trigger a kind of negotiation phase and then this gives time for other sticky folders to both vote up or vote Down The veto so you can also say The veto was unjustified and then your vote would decrease the voting power right so let's walk through an example so let's say uh you know two percent voted you know this is bad and so that's why we entered kind of the negotiation phase um then uh after that someone else comes in you know two more percent comes in and says I agree this is bad so it goes to four percent yeah and at five percent the final veto would be triggered uh but if someone now in the meantime comes in and says no I I think you guys are just trolling you know this is actually good and they voted against and it might go from 4 million you know back to 1 billion or whatever right so it's possible to to vote both up and down and it's possible so I might get the number slightly wrong it's also possible that the mechanism might still change because it is under active development and uh it's being kind of researched and audited by multiple different parties um but I believe uh this is roughly the idea and this this conversation is all in vain of discussing about what happens if Lido governance is oppressive and a individual node operator disagrees and would like to exit this conversation happens first it is a line of defense that allows for the node operators to not have to take that responsibility on themselves we can stop any sort of oppressive governance vote from going through through the veto power of the staked ether token but let's go for let's take this further and take the example of that Shield that protective barrier of the staked ether veto gets broken and all of a sudden we do need to discuss about the uh coercion defection incentives between the Lido governance and a node operator you said that if a node operator wants to leave they can't take their staked eth with them and so they lose their Golden Goose right they they lose their their income can we can we just talk about like kind of the parameters of that say I'm a node operator and there's an up up vote a Lido governance vote that gets passed and I disagree with it and I think it's bad for ethereum I want to leave and do I I do I stop only getting new ether distributed to me by the Dow do I have to give up my entire supply of ether that staked in my node how what are the parameters here yeah so in the future if you wanted to leave then you would basically have to exit or the the dial with the the protocol would programmatically exit um these validators from you the Lido Dao would programmatically exit a single Lido node operator so the Dow can exit a node operator not today not today but it's on the future roadmap that okay that the the the the dial can programmatically exit the note operators and why is this important because otherwise uh you know the flip side of this happens where node operator can misbehave um and just say you know you what what are you going to do you know so in order to hold the note play that's accountable it is important that light or the lighter protocol can also withdraw the stake um and this you know creates an incentive for them to be performed which I believe that would be especially important um once kind of the number of different node operators in the protocol goes way up right because while today we are at 29 division in three years now at least my vision is for there to be over 5000 node operators so the lighter of the future will look a lot different than the light of today so just to really Define the incentives here the re the power that the Lido Dao has over a node operator is the income stream the five percent of staking Revenue that the node operator gets from all staked ether inside of its node and so if if someone is worried about the centralization effect of the Lido governance really the the the power that governance has over node operators is the incentive of the income is there any other variable or is that it no that's pretty much it so it's it's getting access to more stake that is coming in and losing access to the stake

quick question before we talk about entrance because I I'm curious how we get to the the 5000 number that you're just talking about and when that's practical but before we get there okay quick uh I guess a quick question on this is Lido forkable today could people Fork it so I'm wondering about a scenario let's say a a section of you know Lido governance and then a section of the node operators sort of turn evil and they start you know wanting to Center transactions to all of these things and there's a group of defectors who are like we are you know we're the good node operators and so we will exit we will defect and these are you know 10 defectors and so they defect can they defect Fork Lido go play the social game on crypto Twitter and start saying hey these guys are censoring this is evil Lido we are creating a Lido classic and Lido classic which is of course good Lido with you know all of the um you know the more saintly uh and hallowed of node operators they do good Lido and it's a it's a completely forked version and they encourage the community to exit from Lido and to stick with them is this a scenario that could play out and that's why I was asking what is light affordable Lido classic berries um um so let me turn the question around so if if you if you fought the usdc smart contract today would it be no why not well because you have dollars in a bank account okay yes so Lido is the same yeah so it has the if the the on chain the Unchained steak Thief it only represents the state Thief that is also off chain from the perspective of the ethereum execution layer because it's on the beaten chain and it's it's in these you know Hardware machines right that are validating and so yes could you Fork the code and then just uh two-step Fork the code have a different Lido classic over here and then encourage all of the um the stakers inside of Lido to exit withdraw and I I guess there's a penalty there's a cause because everyone has to withdraw so there's some Capital cost in doing that and then redeposit into Lido classic yeah but then aren't you just competing with every other staking as a service Dao startup that is starting from square one yes but yeah but minus right so yes technically that would be possible yeah so um I it would be possible to to kind of write over validate us but it would have to happen voluntarily right from kind of the site that remains quote unquote in power they'd have same as they could you know you could fork usdc and you could say you know please here's my bank account and then um you know soccer sends you half of the money right so if they do that then then that works and maybe you could even program something like that into the smart contract um I think it could be possible I'm not that technical about it you know it sounds like it might be possible well I am not ready to launch lighter classic today uh but maybe at some point who knows um but let's ask about that question of if we have 29 right now and the the concern about 29 node operators right even if it's not one entity there's 29 so this is this confederation is that it becomes kind of an OPEC like kind of a cabal there's some kind of Monopoly Behavior so um we can count to 29. yeah we can count to 29. it's you know 20 29 is better than one but you know it's better than 29 5 000 and you mentioned the number five thousand how can I can't I can't count if I can Lido make it permissionless to be a node operator inside of the the Lido Network and or how do we get to 5000. yeah so I mean first of all I think the instead of kind of creating uh you know like an OPEC like situation or a cartoon and so far I would say light or the Lido Dao has you know the policies that it makes is about breaking this kind of behavior you know and preventing it because that would extract money that otherwise would go to stake us right so for example you know these ideas around preventing Mev hiding making a really robust policy um this all serves kind of the like in fact like the Opposites kind of anti you know anti-compet like stop anti-anti-competitive Behavior to make the market better for the stakers um but yes thank you for the question so uh today light or has 29 note operators in the future I said uh in in maybe three to four years it will have five thousand so where is it coming from um Lido uh introduced uh a new version It's called Lido V2 a couple months ago it had two uh main features so the first was it enabled withdrawals from the beacon chain so someone who holds take Eve today they can actually you know send to stake Eve back to the protocol um and they can trigger an exit and then there you know actually the E from the beacon chain is being unstaked and you know it gets to them right and the second part was quite a staking router so in the past there was basically you know this like one smart contract and um anything that went into these 29 was distributed automatically to these 29 note operators and what happened with the staking router is a fundamentally new architecture where you have kind of a new centerpiece and you can imagine it a little bit similar to like a you know a maker Dow um where you know there is um there's kind of you know money coming in um but then you have two different modules and they can all represent different uh staking strategies or different node operators and so the 29 node operators we call that now that's the permission set and this permission set is curated by a committee that works for the little dial it's called the node operator management committee so nom and maybe you have seen you know izidoros uh Izzy uh so he is the leader of that committee norm and um this uh permission set would become one module in the staking router but you can have many modules all coexisting with a permission module and anyone can add new modules in a permissionless way and then you have money coming in from stakers and there has to be now some new distribution so basically modules would become added to the distribution function of the protocol so if you zoom out three years maybe there's a hundred different modules and they have to be approved by the dial but once they are approved they have a basically a risk limit for how much if can go in and then any if that goes in is distributed across the different modules so what modules are possible so we already said okay there's permission to module this is very good for um for basically professional node operators who have off-chain reputation who have really good performance numbers and so you you it's basically the risk reward is kind of worth it you know you say like we can if you do something bad then we know you know where you live we can sue you we're going to get that you know it's non-custodial but you get the ideas like professional State recourse exactly um and uh but you can have many other modules so there's two modules that I would highlight that uh will most likely be added in the next year one is a permissionless staking module so it's basically rocket pool but in liable yeah so it's uh you can uh stake uh anybody can basically be an auto operator um but they have to put up a bond you know and then they basically get the other half of the stake uh and they can stake that what is that bond denominated in um I don't know it would depend so I don't know that the module is uh has been developed yet so I have no insight into that so um but um I would assume uh that you do it in Eve yeah um so I I when I look at Rocket pool I I always thought it's um you know huge kudos to them basically I'm a huge fan uh I think it's you know it's an incredible project and really good that it exists I don't agree with all of the design decisions I think um it's uh the use of RPA as a collateral to me it feels like you know it's just like shoehorning and kind of the token in order to uh you know pump the value a little bit and make the community happy I think it's not that actually uh the best choice if you just want uh the node operating to be as efficient as possible because we you really do increase kind of the collateral that is needed um and so yeah I think that this is something that Lido could do better um to be honest you know so uh you only require ether collateral that's what I would do um and uh and yeah so other than that I think it could work quite similar so that would be the permissionless pool so we get the permission for the permissionless pool was there another type of um module uh yeah so the third thing would be a blended version between the two and there would be you know a module that has both professional note operators and for example Solo stakers in a permissionless way but secured by distributed validator technology or DVT so what DVT is you know one validator is usually operated by one party but DVT allows one validator to be operated by a committee of many parties so for example you could have a validator that's secured by a committee of five different parties and maybe two of them are permissionless and three of them are professional and so you could kind of have a a module that really Blends you know the Best of Both Worlds anybody can join it um but it has kind of the the uptime and the performance of a professional note operator yeah the the thing I like about DVT we've called it um Squad staking on the show before because it's a fun name and it's an alliteration um is the simple way to put it I say is like say you have one single Central operator who is just extremely good at their job and then you have like four hobbyists well you give all the ether to the professional but then the professional node operator in order to actually propose a block needs to have transactions signed by the hobbyists and so it's a nice way for the little guy to check the power of the big guy and you're saying that these can be blended into a single module a single committee and I think uh I this V2 version of Lido I the pattern of how it's designed fits other patterns that I've seen across the crypto landscape most recently uniswap V4 but then also ethereum's roll-up Centric roadmap where you have this main Hub and then you have things that are free to express themselves hooked into the Hub and the Hub just coordinates the this layer Twos for example or the uniswap hooks or the Lido modules and so rather than having a monolithic Lido which with 29 node operators and you know in node operators have voted in or out instead you just have these modules that can express themselves as they see fit either as a DVT system it is a single operator it's any sort of expression of a staking system and it's just up to Lido governance to vote in and out these modules so this is the pattern that I'm seeing again like expressed across different designs that I'm also now seeing in in Lido V2 yeah I mean it is a design principle in general but in particular in lidoor that we are trying to push complexity to the edges so you want basically the core which is the dial and the protocol you want this to be extremely simple and you know easy to understand easy to audit easy to secure and I mean if you have any operation that is more complex maybe because it needs to be because it's maybe you know more economically efficient you basically want these to happen on top right and that's why I think you see this design pattern now emerge as you know a very form dominant form of kind of design pattern in all across D5 so with with ethereums like roll-up Centric and roadmap a lot of the eth Maxis are like hey all those layer ones are going to just become a layer two on ethereum would you say that all of these like there's a bunch of startups staking as a service systems that are out there there's like the long tail would you say that like if you're a Lido maximalist and since Lido does believe in like being a monopoly over a stake teeth inside of D5 as a token uh would you say that like the if the Lido maximalist take would be hey all these staking as a service orgs are just going to become modules inside of Lido yes I think that Lido is moving now to a platform model uh the staking router is basically perfect for that you know because slido has the most liquid staking token and it has all of these Integrations it is the you know most better hardened trusted staking protocol and what it has with this is basically the power of distribution right because um Lido has this if coming in and this basically solves exactly the problem that if you want to design a staking protocol like or like a staking provider what you need right you need basically to get Eve you know what you have is you know maybe the skill to to use it but what you don't have is the power to get it and so um I think this creates a huge opportunity um for Lido to become a platform where other people who may today choose to you know launch a new staking provider to launch on their own instead you know they will build it on on top of Lido and they can set you know and this is something we haven't touched on but something that the modules also allow is you can set your own economics you know so for example a uh it's something we see in in kind of the uh the bonded model of Rocket pool is um you you need to pay a higher fee uh to the node operator uh in order for them to participate why uh for one reason because they have a they need to put up a bond yes so they have a cost of capital um uh but second because they might overall be you know less professional and smaller in size and so any fixed costs they have they uh you know are harder to amortize and so overall they have basically you know for every block they make they have a higher cost of production so you need to pay them more yes and this is something that for example um can be represented in a module yeah so the module can say this is a permissionless module but instead of five percent it pays you know 15 and somebody else can say oh this is a permission model and it pays 12 you know and then maybe the dial has to choose between the two modules but um so I I think that just this there will be free competition um for how to set the fee and this allows someone to come in and build on Lido as a platform and say you know this is what I do this is the vi charge um please consider me for you know the stake distribution and it allows and new models of staking that basically haven't been possible before uh also to happen on top of Lightroom so one of their main incentives as to why somebody would start a staking as a service Dao or organization a new LSD is because you get to issue the token you get the you get the LDL equivalent for that particular protocol right the RPL equivalent for that particular protocol are you saying that you these orgs would be able to retain their token as well as also being a part of the Dow oh so it depends uh what so you set RPA but do you mean I if no I mean the actual so going back to the comparison between like the ethereum layer two is like why don't all just layer ones become a layer two is because it kind of uh neuters the power of the layer one token if they just become a layer two or at least the perception of it and so what one of the incentives for like why one might start a new staking as a service system is because of they get to issue their own governance token or their own like version of of RPL or their version of ldo but if they just become a module inside of Lido do they is there room for an alternative token because that that's one of the coordination defection incentives between many different lse systems and just one different one lse system yeah you can absolutely have your own token so imagine you have a module where you say you know I am uh I'm a note operator but I use eigen layer and I for example I am a sequencer for this new layer too that's about to launch yeah so I have another income stream so give me some if you know I'm Prof I I will do a good job and I will also generate you know not just the revenue from ethereum but also the the revenue from this new layer too that's about to launch so that's a possibility yes and um I charge 10 for that and so there's ten percent going into the you know going to the node operator and five percent going to Lido and in this case then it's 85 percent going to the user right um and um of course if you are the creator of that module you can for example decide uh to distribute your 10 percent to your token um so in terms of how the modules are designed you have really complete Freedom you can even have governance on top of your own module if you want that I think you know if a module is yeah it would kind of you know increase the trust surface of the module which is a consideration in whether to include the module or not but in theory all of these things are entirely possible and something like having a token that for example has a cash flow from your module that introduces no additional security concerns for Lido so I think this is something that we will absolutely see in the future so I want to go back to uh something you were saying and you know just just now in the this vision of Lido becoming a platform like this is definitely the perception in the ethereum community like light I was going for it right they're they're not throttling themselves they're not stopping at you know 10 stake they're 20 they're not self-cap or a 30 staked or 40 staked they are not stopping they are going for a platform play they are also saying at least the the case you're making is hey this is not as centralized as you think even if we become a dominant the dominant staking platform within ethereum let me ask you though um you know we kind of set this up as a there are some criticisms in the community about Lido right now and I think there's the perception among um critics that this would not be a good thing these changes that you mentioned with the different modules and you know permissionless pools the ability of of Lido stakers to a veto and and have some vote in themselves do you think this addresses the critics critiques like uh or do you think there's still something to them uh Ryan in order to answer that I I want to take kind of a step back we've already kind of said a few in in a few different ways so for example you know really the ethereum community would like for there to be you know maybe 10 different stigma protocols and they all share the stake equity and we would also like for there to be no way uh for example for any to any onshine action to influence the governance of the protocol or anything that happens at you know the Mev layer or the staking layer so in my other role in flashbots I hear the same things right just like in a different color as well all the time and this shows it's not a Lido problem right this is kind of a general problem that ethereum is dealing with and has to deal with because increasingly you know there are things outside the protocol that are affecting how ethereum works and or that I get growing really big um to the point where they can become a systemic uh risk for ethereum right so there are other protocols that also have kind of you know large amounts of stake not steak but kind of tokens in their smart contracts on top of ethereum or that are like majority Gas users or and so on right and so overall I think the first part of my answer is the ATM Community has to find a way of kind of dealing with applications that are built on top of ethereum and that are growing really big because I completely get it like it's really scary and there are no simple answers right so you cannot just like kick them out or somehow throttle them in some way because that would erode the credible neutrality of your platform which I mean if ethereum loses credible neutrality then that would be really bad but at the same time you also feel like you cannot just do nothing you know because you see kind of you know the threat creeping up and really you know the situation is not good and there are real things that can happen right some of which we touched on and so um I think it's basically really complicated you know so when I started thinking about liquid staking then I kind of had a three-part thesis and I want to briefly go through it why because I think it's the really uh relevant today like nothing pretty much has changed about this for the last two years the first part is that there's a kind of a natural desire to divide capital and labor so if I have steak then I want to delegate it you know I just I don't want to do it myself some people do but they kind of you know they are in the minority you know and what that means is that at the limit oil stake will end up being delegated so maybe today so we saw a report excellent report from rated.network and they were saying you know based on their estimates their six percent solo stickers today in the network you know yeah yeah and I mean it was a high guess so the the number might be way lower than this you know um and um and so 94 professional note operators you know so and so what happens kind of as more through like their brokerage accounts um through exchanges ether goes up in value so people already like get more freaked out about self-custody as well and so on I think this number actually goes down more right it doesn't go up I think it goes down at the limit maybe there's one percent solo stickers so this is definitely I mean a trend we have to fight but it's not a trend that you can reverse like you have to deal with the fact that the number of solo operators would be very small and there will be delegation which means you have this principal agent conflict which is just basically a name of describing this whole conversation that we had the second is that of all of the forms of staking that exist liquid sticking is by far the most dominant the superior form of staking and over time crowd out all other forms why because it is effectively is like you know it is like staking but you get all of the liquidity and it's non-custodial and you can basically turn it into any other formal stake and so if you have a liquid staking token and you can still give it someone else to custody and then you have it like non-custodial right but you get all of the the capital efficiency and the optionality of using it however you want and the third one is that these liquid staking tokens actually compete as money why because Isa itself competes as money you know ether is the best asset in the world you know people want to transfer it they want to use it as collateral they want to use it as defy they love using it they love holding it and so the same applies to lsts so any LST that competes in the market competes on the same terms as if and that creates extreme Network effects and when you have an industry with network effects you know what that means is the more people use it the more valuable it becomes for other users also to join so when I want to stake my if today then why should I you know stake with staking protocol number 100 or even number 10 when I can join the biggest one that has the most liquid asset where I can use in the most places it is the most liquid if I ever want to exit it's instant I can sell it I can collateralize it everywhere getting the best rates and industries that have these Network effects they usually have you know very strong kind of winner take most if not when I take all Dynamics and there's virtually no counter examples to this you know and you can say well but not in ethereum and I'll say you know I just don't believe you you know because um the other two Trends are just like they are too strong you know um and it ethereum itself if it was a country then I would say Okay um well you have like the rule of law and you know you have decision making and if some company gets so big that it's like 50 of your economy you know maybe you can exert some pressure over it you know and you can keep it in check um but like the value proposition of a country is not credible neutrality but in ethereum it is and so if you're missing this really hard place about dealing with projects that get too big and this doesn't just apply to lidoor I mean you mentioned it replies I mean it applies to to eigen layer it used to you know open C was really big before blur came along like unisop um uh metamask I think these are like all projects in some way they dominate basically kind of their respective Niche and they are really powerful and if you are like part of ethereum the ethereum community then you basically Wonder what what should I do about them so I remember very distinctly in my role at flashpots uh you know metamask had 70 of all of the transactions of ethereum and these were not mostly sophisticated users these were users who um you know they are kind of you know they don't really know what they're doing many of them they don't really care they wouldn't even know if for example metamask did a block Builder and win wins every block in ethereum you know and extracts all other value and then sets the price wherever they want so they would never do that right so um we know the team like well and you know incredibly ethereum Alliance but I'm just saying you know this exists everywhere like this kind of rationale that you have power somewhere and they are network effects in like every layer uh of ethereum and so I think this is basically if you look at these assumptions then for Lido to grow to keep growing to a place where they are kind of dominant you know it's not just an option that is viable that mechef has to be thought about if you believe in network effects then it's the only option because you know between being big and being nothing there's like like there's nothing in between you know there's no place where you can be like 10 or 20 and you just you too you know it doesn't exist you know because like if you're 20 or 30 if you don't keep growing at some point someone else will grow bigger and then everybody will go to that player and then he will die and this is has been my view for a long time and this is still in my View today so in in some ways hasu that's kind of a dim view but you might also call that a pragmatic View and a realistic View and this this seems like to be the case why um Lido has not self-limited its you know itself it hasn't said we're not going past 30. it's just going to continue to go up and continue to grow and if this kind of moloch trap is true if your thesis is true then really the best outcome the highest utility outcome is for Lido to do everything that it can and for the community to apply as much pressure as possible to Lido to decentralize the elements that are still decentralized in its stack to be as quick as possible uh too safely of course not speed and safety both of those are related to safety roll out some of the permissionless modules you're talking about and some of the governance you're talking about and and yet I want to contrast that to another point because yes competitive forces and Market forces are a force at work here but um there's also a social Force here right and primarily among stakers I think and I remember we had a conversation a very long time ago hasi was the first time I I think I I met you and you had a conversation was actually on the topic of Bitcoin and it was Bitcoin and ether and how these communities would evolve and I remember you saying something that um has stuck with me and continues to stick with me it's like I'm paraphrasing here but the most bullish thing about the Bitcoin Community is how ferocious they are how zealous they are how single-minded they are how much they actually care bitcoiners have articulated this like um you know you could go to the protocol devs and put a gun to their head and say you know change this code in Bitcoin push out a fork they wouldn't do it you know and and so it's this this zealousness this hardcoreness and in order for a layer zero this is kind of the social layer behind all blockchains I think in order for them to actually stay decentralized and fight all of the moloch forms and the traps and the boss that come and fight and try to centralize then you need to maintain this zealous core who says I don't care where the most profitable pool actually is like I care a little bit about that but I'm willing to take you know one percent lower yield and do the right thing and solo stake or stake with this more uh decentralized pool and that Force I think has to exist inside of an entity almost like a spiritual type force a cultural type Force has to exist at the root lever level level of a blockchain in order for it to succeed moving forward and this is actually a force that I see in some of these fights on on crypto about the centralization and decentralization and it's almost like a moral call to like do the right thing solo stake you know buy those T bonds and win this war it's that kind of thing ethereum needs you yeah I don't I don't hate it I actually think we we 100 need that so how do you contrast that kind of public goodness with what you just said and sort of almost like the evil it's not even evil it's just like the uh the factory type nature of the moloch Trap that you just described oh I love I love this question really do um so I I have actually many points that I want to answer I I will try to connect them in some sense that in some way that makes sense you know so in the Bitcoin Community even kind of the Ferocious core could not do anything about the fact that at some point eighty percent of the blocks were built in China and now like 50 55 of the blocks updated by public us companies so there are things that are within the scope of what kind of is like a ferocious minority kind of fact and then there are things that are basically with out of scope and I think if we look at like mining for example I think it's it's autoscope second um I very I remember this conversation uh and was it was a this was on the Block crunch podcast it was a famous bear Market debate oh yeah that was I remember this it was great and um I think that the Bitcoin Community really uh was really ferocious I mean maybe a bit overly so to the point where now it's moving in the other direction because you know their ferociousness ended up you know uh removing so much nuanced debate and so many smart people that kind of the you know the snake ate its own hair and um but I think ethereum is not and shouldn't be like that like ethereum should not comp try to compete with Bitcoin on ferociousness I think the values of ethereum were always you know optimism and Science and you know create creativity and community and stuff like that in one Community not in the in the Bitcoin sense and so I think the ethereum community should try to solve the problem in a way that stays true to its core values which I actually think that the right way of thinking about this is like ethereum is extremely like accelerationist in many ways right like the idea that like on ethereum it's it's kind of you know and we are maximizing any V extraction but democratizing it you have D5 protocols that are like working on bright models where like you know they have a market for for bribing them like curve as an example but like many others as well um this idea that like everything that can go wrong will go wrong and we are building systems that work around that another example italics vitalik's end game post you know he says where there's two or three different ways where we basically cannot change the fact that uh you know block production will centralize but what we can do is we can make sure that block validation stays decentralized and that there are censorship resistance mechanisms for users and this is exactly the kind of pragmatism that really defines the ethereum community for me and that got me you know so addicted to being part of this group and part of this community and it is this is basically the type of thinking that I apply you know in flashbots that I apply in Lido it is this well how can we do both you know how can we keep ethereum decentralized in spite of you know being pragmatic about these Market forces and that is exactly you know it's it's making all of these hard choices that hopefully make both of this possible where in the end State you have a staking protocol and it's a very very thin middleware layer and it is decentralized it has a lot of checks and balances for users where basically no bad governance decision can happen it is like it is formally verified um it has basically you know all of the security guarantees that you can want um but it's the in line like there's no way if you want to attack ethereum if you're a big player who doesn't care about any of these things to be better than that so how's it with that I want to actually return to the question that we started this podcast episode with which is do you think Lido has been unfairly vilified by parts of the ethereum in crypto communities I think if you asked the opinions of the general ethereum OG leader person whatever archetype that that fits into your mind you would that you would get the answer that Lido is centralized Lido isn't ethereum aligned they're not decentralized et cetera et cetera so do you think would you say that lydo has been unfairly vilified I don't think that any ethereum leaders think that light was not ethereum aligned um I think they they think that we have a different view about how things will play out I think they see us as Ultra pragmatists um which is fine because I think we are um and you know they are maybe ultra optimists um I don't know I think so um so I wouldn't say you know later has been vilified I think that or villainized maybe that's the better word um I think that a lot of the criticism is extremely important you know you're completely right you know staking router was only shipped a couple months ago it doesn't have a permissionless sticking module yet it doesn't have a DVT module yet dual governance is not yet live uh the ethereum smart contract is not yet ossified it's not yet formally verified there's no programmable exits yet you know these are all true facts you know and um this is you know like everybody who contributes to lidoor reminds themselves of these things every day and kind of uses it to get better and really work on the roadmap and you know try to ship it as fast as possible and like we use that as motivation you know and so I would say you know really keep pushing us uh so we ship this stuff as fast as possible and also like contribute um because this is you know instead of fighting like let's work together to you know make this happen as soon as possible um so yeah I I mean I I love the discourse I think it's making us all better I think that is a core value of the ethereum communities to have this discourse and to not to shut down conversation so I'm glad we had it today hasu and and before we let you go just one final question because I think this is uh really The Meta question of the episode and maybe the meta question uh for all of crypto in this like 12-year project we've been working on ethereum just hit its eighth birthday too so it's an eight-year-old now the The Meta question really is this can we keep ethereum decentralized do you think we have a hope of that do you think we can achieve that yeah so if we stick to the values of that make ethereum unique then I think we can and that's not just staking you know there's not just Mev there's not just restarting like these are all things that are you know really really similar in nature they're all pushing kind of in the same direction and if we kind of lose these values and we start thinking that we can fight Market forces uh you know by you know just kind of through social action then like we will either fail or they cannot be prepared when it happens or we will succeed but destroy tm's credible neutrality in the process so I think this is actually the only way of you know just Building Systems that are that can win in the free market against players who don't give a about ethereum's values um and that kind of achieved both you know that achieves success and that also protect lithium's decentralization and um yeah this is the way that we win we'll have to leave it there that is the way that we win certainly hasu it's been a pleasure to have you on Bank list thank you so much thank you bankless Nation some action items for you today this isn't the first time haasu's been on Bank list okay we're gonna include some links in the archive of his previous uh visitations which have been Ultra fantastic as well in explaining these Concepts also another action item for you I have heard and I believe this is true that uncommon court is restarting that is that is hasu's podcast maybe it already has restarted I need to get myself caught up on some episodes haasu can you tell us quickly about that and how to tap into your podcast thank you so much Ryan yes you're right uh so I I do host a podcast it's called Uncommon Core um it used to be very popular then we took a one-year break and now it's back with a new co-host uh John Charbonneau so if you're in the ethereum community then I don't know uh how you don't know John if you don't uh he's written some of the most fantastic reports on ethereum I even got a shout out uh from italic from for them so together we are diving basically into some of the things that we're very passionate about which is infrastructure so it's stuff like what we talked about today it's it's Mev um Roll-Ups uh staking restaking um all of the good stuff so if you're interested in kind of very you know technical minded and kind of you know at the frontier discussions about these topics then check it out um it's Uncommon Core in your podcast player or go on our website it's called ucc2 dot XYZ thank you and there will also be a link in the show notes as well big plus one on that guys hasu and John are gonna bring it so make sure you check that out um gotta end with this of course none of this has been Financial advice we're trying to keep ethereum decentralized as much as possible uh watch out for staking you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] thank you
