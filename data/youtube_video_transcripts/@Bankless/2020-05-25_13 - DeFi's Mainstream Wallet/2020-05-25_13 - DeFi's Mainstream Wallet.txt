[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you this week i'm doing great i'm really excited about this episode this is an episode where we dive into a very specific bankless tool and ask the questions that we think are really important both me and ryan are huge fans of the argent wallet and how they are pushing the boundaries with the benefits of crypto while obfuscating and hiding away the friction points and the costs of crypto making a really good ux ui experience for users and then we also talk about really important questions such as you know if the argent wallet is as successful as they want it to be how do we maintain uh neutrality in in the in the wallet how do we make sure that argent is aligned with the ethereum ecosystem into the future so a super valuable episode itamar definitely has the right vision for what argent needs to be and it was just an absolute treat getting him on the pod yeah absolutely i i think the entire bankless community is cheering for this wallet and excited about this wallet because it feels like the first wallet that's almost mainstream accessible uh this is pretty easy to use i mean my parents can easily use this people who aren't are completely new to crypto can use this it's it's really difficult to talk to somebody and you talk to them about die and stable coins and sort of you know the die savings rate and talk about how great it is and then try to explain how to use metamask and how to get their crypto off an exchange easily and what gas fees are right those are all impediments to user adoption and argent has just found a way to remove all of those including i think one of the biggest impediments which is private key management right that that sense that oh my god if if my assets are outside of uh a wallet outside of an exchange like coinbase and if i lose my private keys it all goes away right argent has found a clever way to navigate around this so yeah so we're going to talk to to edamar today about the concept of d5's netscape moment so what they're doing with argent is essentially they're creating a browser an overlay on top of all of these money protocols and allowing those to be easily accessible sort of what happened to the early internet so protocols like tcpip and smtp and ftp those those protocols were kind of still in the the geek culture and not really useful for everyday people until netscape came around and gave you the ability to surf the web as they said back in the day this is the ability to surf the money protocols that really to me is what argent is doing here so we're going to talk with emr about three things first the ethos behind this so like why are they creating a bankless wallet secondly what it is what you can do with it some of the superpowers that are available to you today with it and then the future how this thing gets to maybe a billion users someday at least defy does and what the wallets role is in that process so super exciting super uh interesting episode and we're glad you're tuned in before we get there let's talk about our sponsors today david so the first i want to tell you about is rocket dollar this is primarily for our u.s listeners if you have an ira or a 401k the problem with it is it's jailed inside of your brokerage so it's stuck in your swap account it's stuck in fidelity if you want to buy crypto you have to buy it inside the brokerage at 5x the price don't do that it's a complete rip-off what you need to do instead is break your crypto retirement account out of jail use rocket dollar they can help you set up a self-directed ira a self-directed 401k i do this a ton of folks in the bankless community do this they will take care of the pain and help you break your retirement account out of jail help you buy crypto on the spot market to start a self-directed ira or 401k go to rocketdollar.com when you use the code bank list you'll get 50 off rocketdollar.com use the code bankless dydx is an outstanding decentralized exchange in the crypto world for those that aren't familiar dydx is a place where you can go and swap ethan dye and access some of the deepest liquidity in the crypto space hats off to dydx for really gathering the liquidity they need to make a liquid dex something that is really difficult in this base and the way that they do that is that they offer a complete suite of services that surround eth and die and other assets on their exchange so not only can you go to dydx and spot trade between eath and die but you can also lend and borrow both eath and die as well as being able to take margin long positions or margin short positions so getting 1x 2x 3x leverage in both directions on your ether and something that is brand new to the dui dx platform is the ability to get exposure to bitcoin on their perpetual contract markets this is something that is brand new not only to dydx but the crypto space at large and so with bitcoin perpetual contract markets you can get price exposure to bitcoin on margin in an extremely liquid way this opened up just a few weeks ago and there's already over 14 million dollars worth of liquidity on the dydx protocol it comes from usdc and so when your contract is settled you get paid out in usdc it's a brand new money lego in the crypto world you can go to dydx and get 10 off of trading fees when you sign up with the bankless referral link y d trade.dydx dot exchange slash r slash bank list it's in the show notes so you can just go copy that and go straight to dydx and get 10 off of all trading fees hey david before we dig in with itamar we should talk big picture stuff you know what i've been feeling like lately uh it's felt like it's it's 2016 again i'm 100 with you yeah i've and i even feel that every single morning when i wake up and for i'm just more optimistic about the future of crypto not only just from you know the price appreciation which i totally think is coming but also just the fundamentals in the space that really sets the foundation for for a new wave um i i've always been skeptical of the of the concept that you know there's a new bull market coming there's uh the idea is that uh there's always a new bull market on the horizon and that crypto runs in cycles uh it feels weird to be able to count on these things but i wouldn't actually bet against it um and it does feel like we are on the cusp of a very long slow drawn out appreciation in eath price that will you know probably inevitably turn into another bubble which will be fun to uh to go on the ride yeah i i i think that's the debate in crypto whether there's going to be sort of a slow slog to adoption so if you look at like the dot-com uh bubble and then the pop after that there were there was an interim period years until uh high-flying companies like amazon fully recovered right it took something until like 2008 2009 and the way it recovered uh was through utility so amazon actually delivered on some of its promises and started to to recover uh so some people think that that's what's going to happen in crypto basically it'll sort of seep into our everyday life and there'll be a slow growth slog as it seeps into our life and people realize start realizing more and more utility but i've come to think that what really happens in crypto is we get these crazy boom bust cycles so we get like these periods of irrational exuberance and hockey stick growth followed by you know a crash type period uh followed by some sort of dead period and then the whole cycle repeats i was reading a an andreessen horowitz article so they're a you know crypto vc uh firm and they they talked about the three previous cycles so the first cycle was 2009 to 2012 uh where you had this boom bust occurrence and then 2013 to 2016 was the second and then the third which we're kind of still in or it's just closing up is 2016 up until now and in all of these cycles you you get sort of the the same sort of um the same sort of pattern there's at the very beginning of the cycle this this kind of tinder period where all of this infrastructure is getting built all of this fuel is getting laid down so only the hardcore true believers are really in that in that phase that's where we are now basically and then there's some kind of a spark whether that's a narrative or a use case or a combination of both in 2016 2017 that spark really was smart contracts and ethereum and the bitcoin as a store of value narrative and then you get this explosion that happened in all three of the previous cycles it was almost like more explosive than everyone thought it would be so there's a growth phase and then that turned into like crazy growth and then it melted faces like with the the level of growth that you saw in each of those cycles uh followed by a crash and then after the crash you started to see articles like crypto is dead people started leaving the crypto space the bubbles pop the narratives are wrong that cycle has played out already three times and we are now in the fourth cycle this is the the tinder phase where all of this fuel all of these layers of a building and infrastructure are being put down and i feel like it's 2016 like we're just waiting for that spark yeah there's there's as you said there is so much tinder being laid down there are things and developments happening that if they had happened in 2017 2018 would have just absolutely just pumped the market especially out of some developments in the last two weeks reddit using ethereum an ethereum test net to experiment with community tokens uh is absolutely huge after just like three days there were five thousand different wallets just using one of the two tokens that they issued uh and i think that number's up to like 14 or 15 000 now uh and that's just the fact that the i think number four world's most popular website is using ethereum to host some sort of uh community engagement infrastructure mechanism is is insanely bullish and then there's also visa explicitly uh citing ethereum as infrastructure for stable coin payments um and and then also citing how stable coins are additive to a payment network not um not competitive uh and so like if those things had happened in 2017 like the crypto markets would have pumped by like 25 alone uh and they didn't you didn't even see a blip in the these markets today because we're still we still have you know trauma we still have fear uh we're still like very hesitant dipping our toes but uh the things like argent wallet which we're about to get into and the infrastructure that our argent represents to host a bankless revolution is is part of the kindling that is being laid down uh bitcoin just went through a happening during a period where the fed just printed a bunch of money that is also huge kindling the the whole paul tudor jones who has two percent of his assets which is an insane amount i give two percent maybe sounds like a a little bit but when you're a billionaire like paul tudor jones like i would have expected point two percent not two full percent like stuff like this the kindling is just found everywhere uh and it's gonna be a fun day when when that match drops yeah totally it you know that what's funny is everything you just named that happened like in the last week and a half to two weeks like we're not even talking about like cool stuff that's happened since the beginning of 2020. this is all in the past week and a half two weeks that's like new layers of kindling this is a dry forest floor with like leaves and you know twigs and there hasn't been rain in months that's what we're talking about here and even the the reddit news alone so 430 million daily active users on reddit 64 of those are gen z right so and one of the the subreddits that they're releasing the community token on is a fortnight subreddit and they're even more excited about the token and about using uh the ethereum wallet and this community point system than the crypto subreddit is they have already more vaults uh signed up there so like this is um a massive amount of uh kindling someone asked me the other day it's like well just the reddit news why didn't price go up and i i think the answer that question is the these events aren't the spark they're the fuel right this is the the kindling and the spark is yet to come uh feels very much like 2016. that's not to say that next year is going to feel like 2017. um it could still take some time i mean there still could be some some more tinder that is is laid before we see the spark but it feels like that spark is just a matter of of time and and probability something's going to set this this forest floor off uh and when it does it's going to be quite explosive at least that's kind of what i think i don't think that crypto works because of the scarcity games we've talked about those in previous episodes david i don't think crypto is just going to like slowly seep into our life and there's not ever going to be a speculative mania because the next 500 million people that enter this space are going to need to learn the same lessons as the first 50. it's the same human psychology that drives these these scarcity games i wouldn't bet against another speculative explosive growth phase that seems to be how this whole crypto thing grows in these cycles and after every cycle uh the good news is 10x the amount of builders and users and holders remain even after the crash so every cycle ends with a higher floor than the last one i think we're an exciting time yeah in your article you talked about fractals and you you just said that you know just because this feels like 2016 doesn't mean that next year is 2017. like and what a fractal is it's a pattern that looks the same at different scale and so what when we say that this feels like 2016 like all those patterns are there but that doesn't necessarily mean that the next pattern is 2017 right so like obviously this is not financial advice 20 21 is not the year of 100x you know 100x growth in all crypto assets but it's what it feels like like with the foundations are being set uh so patterns do change like that nothing is guaranteed uh but i do like the the illustration that you know these things are are repetitive cycles that look like each other each each time but that doesn't mean that this next cycle is going to be a you know a one-to-one repeat of the last one yeah exactly like one one fractal that we see in nature all the time is mountain ranges right and uh mountains sort of look the same if you look at sort of a mountain range but but some mountains are are higher than others and that's what we might see here some kind of a difference from the last fractal pattern but a similar pattern and i do think that pattern is one of um fast speculative growth don't know when it'll happen uh but um i definitely put my money on that i don't think it's going to be something something slow and uh gradual not in crypto man it's too crazy for that david we should talk about uh something else that happened um recently and that's the block fi there's a data breach at blockfi and for those that that don't know maybe you can tell um tell listeners what blockfly is and what happened here yeah blockfi is a company that you can deposit your bitcoin with uh and then they also do other assets like ether but i'm pretty sure it's mostly bitcoin customers uh centralized company you deposit your bitcoin there they lend it out and give you a bitcoin denominated return so it's a way to receive alpha on your bitcoin so they're offering somewhere between like three and four percent on your bitcoin and and your eth which is pretty good like you can't really get those rates inside of defy uh and there's no really other way to get alpha on your bitcoin so that's really the the business proposition of block fi uh and why one would deposit your their bitcoin there the problem is uh you know when any website like this has user information and uh whenever a website centrally collects user information there is an incentive to to snag that and that's exactly what happened and i think this is really good juxtaposition between why a similar product which there are plenty of on on ethereum and inside of defy kind of fixes this problem because public permissionless protocols don't care about your government-issued id and don't care about who you are and don't require your email address or password or any other identifying information to use them uh and so i i think this the whole block fight idea is a legacy business model that is being imprinted upon crypto using crypto assets uh to fuel them but they don't actually make any to anything new like the real innovation here is permissionless uh you know identity free uh protocols and and the this this hack just kind of illustrates why that is important yeah blockfly would be what we generally call a crypto bank so they um you know they specialize in in lending and borrowing but they do it through a custodial service so you actually have to give up your assets your private keys to block fi they secure it and along with that comes some regulations as you said like aml kyc in in the us and that's you know money laundering essentially laws where block fi is a crypto bank they're taking custody of assets they have to get your identity so they have to log your email your your name your id and that's what was breached um in this in this in this hack in this in this issue it was email address uh it was physical address it was transaction history which bitcoiners care a lot about by the way oh yeah it's that's very private information because uh it can be dangerous obviously to to leak that if that gets in the dark web which inevitably it will that list will be resold then somebody knows potentially uh all of your bitcoin addresses or the addresses that were linked to uh block fi they know uh how much you have they know where you live uh they have your email address i mean it's pretty sensitive information eric voorhees actually he tweeted this out he said the problem is with aml kyc it's like why are we uh collecting this why do we have to collect it you know and that's that's one take definitely but i think another take is is going along the lines of what you just said which is d5 fixes this so if it's just a protocol if they don't take custody of your assets then aml kyc doesn't apply if you deposit your eth or your wrapped bitcoin on something like that the compound protocol you don't need to supply your street address you don't need to supply your passport or your driver's license the protocol just just kind of works because you're not giving up your assets um so it feels like d5 fixes this is that is that a take you share abs absolutely and just to harp on kyc one more time the the reason why kyc is required is because the government and and the nation state wants as much insight as to who who owns all the money and where the money is because that having that access to that information is power that is power and so what they're doing is is they are forcing everyone to say like okay i own this much amount of money and here it is and the fact that the nation state knows this is extremely beneficial for them they basically sit at the center of the most important information ever in the world which is where is all the money and who owns it and so you know eric voorhees a famous libertarian when he says the problem isn't block fi the problem for the problem is aml kyc that's what he's talking about he's saying that the government has this undue incentive to understand where who owns what money and that's what defy does not care about uh they don't care who you are they just care that you have the money and that that's the end of the story uh and this kind of just goes into why agnostic protocols that are minimally extractive always win like we have always seen throughout history the transition from subjective protocols with undue costs and influence be replaced by less subjective more objective protocols that just need the minimum amount of information to to operate and and that's really what defy is d5 is the next evolution of money and finance protocols that only require the minimum amount of information for their for them to function that's that's an an an alternative definition for d5 well it sounds a lot like the protocol sync thesis episode 12 right oh yeah so i think you're right so guys if you've been tracking with us this is our 13th episode so hopefully nothing goes wrong david like unlucky number 13 but um the previous 12 episodes really lead up to this bankless the podcast is really best if listened to you sequentially so you know one episode builds on the last and now we're going to be talking about um the the first almost mainstream defy wallet that acts as kind of a an overlay to all of the the protocols and all of the the money economics and scarcity economics that we've talked about in previous episodes so uh episode 13 fits right in there so before we get there with itamar david we should talk about our second round of sponsors the first is ave so ave is a d5 protocol you absolutely have to check out we mentioned it in today's episode you can actually now access ave by way of the argent wallet in just a few taps so what does that mean it means you can put your die into it you can put your eath into it once you do it magically transforms those assets into interest-bearing assets so you're actually earning interest on the assets that you put into the protocol you can also borrow from it so these aren't just variable rate loans these are fixed rate loans which is something unique to the ave protocol i just saw earlier this week that ave had passed 70 million in assets locked inside of the protocol so it's not the fourth largest d5 protocol now it's getting a lot of traction a lot of growth and i think that's because they've constructed a pretty interesting protocol if you're a developer you've got to check out their flashline protocol as well if you are a user and you want to access interest through ave you can go to ave.com that's aave.com or even just access it in the arjun app in order for ethereum to be stitched into the traditional world of money and payments we need it to have roots into the outside world and that's exactly what monolith does monolith offers you your defy card which is a visa card that allows you to spend your die but at any store that accepts visa which is like basically the whole world so this is a really useful tool for people that would like to go bankless but not really compromise their ability to live their life in a normal way the way that everyone else lives their life and so the defy card from monolith allows you to be a bankless individual while still being able to access traditional payment rails through the visa network so monolith is a smart contract wallet where you deposit your die into and when you swipe your visa card in any store it just spends that same amount of dye from your wallet through monolith you can focus on spending the things that make sense to spend like dye instead of your ether and this is just a great one-to-one replacement for hsbc or revolut you can download the app at monolith.xyz and sign up and get your bankless visa card today without further ado let's get to our interview with itamar lasuis the co-founder of argent all right david and i are here with itamar la suisse itamar is the co-founder of the argent wallet and we're excited to talk to you today itamar it's been a crazy busy week for you guys can you give us some of the highlights sure thing thanks ryan thanks david for having me uh in the big big week at argent uh results of after almost two years of hard work uh launching arjun v1 many people in the community knew the product but it's really the day where uh we are removing that waitlist and we really open arjun to to everyone uh anyone in the world with with a mobile phone so we are we are super excited on monday we announced it to the crypto community and then on tuesday we did our launch on on product hunt made it to the top three uh so it's pretty good to put a a crypto d5 product at the very top there yeah so you know what i've been super excited about is the defy community the bankless community has really turned out for you guys for argent and i think it's because we've always wanted a mainstream bankless wallet i think that's why you're getting such a turnout from the ethereum community and such uh excitement what's your take on that why are why are folks so excited about this i think i think you said it very well i think we started the day where it was you know our app our product let's let's vote for it and by the middle of the day people were not voting for arjun anymore they were just voting to put defy mainstream to push the fight to more people to show to the world that crypto d5 could be super simple uh safe uh and still decentralized on custodial so the i think the the language and the the intent really changed uh as the hours pass during that day i think this is a really interesting uh telling example of how crypto works differently businesses and companies in this space have communities that you just don't find in the typical world and the other company on product time that you guys were in neck and neck neck and neck with with votes was this marketing agency who obviously had skills in garnering votes because that's the whole point of their company but you guys as a as a you know a d5 wallet you're not a marketing company but you get marketing all the same from the evangelists of the crypto world because we all believe in arjun and we all want arjun to do well and so it's just it's just free marketing from the the support that comes around from the banquets community i think it's really powerful agree first time really i i see that in action i mean in this company at arjun i didn't get the same vibe in my previous companies uh there's really something unique here yeah you know i think part of the reason why is because this is more than just an app uh this entire space and what you guys are doing are part of a larger movement and that's kind of where dave and i want to start with with the why so itamar why are you doing this why are you in the crypto space are you here for you know the the entrepreneurship the the money the fame the movement what really motivates you so we you know it's it's not my first company um all the founders have had several companies so yes we've been entrepreneur for for a very long time and that's what we would like to do and i think everyone has a different story on how they uh they get in touch with crypto for the first time um for for me i so when i saw there was few elements i think i sold my previous company uh it was probably no more than three years ago uh when when we sold it there was actually enough flag on the on the purchase so the dollars money is sent from a uk company to another uk company but it was in dollars so some bank in the u.s could freeze the transfer put an affair flag on it uh it was obviously a mistake but it was a month where you know everyone was super stressed we couldn't access the funds and we were like okay that's it's your money you decide to send it to me but actually you can't really send it to me you need to ask authorization of someone some bank in the u.s um so that was the first event then i unrelated to that i discovered crypto um i bought my first east probably it was on kraken uh early 2017. if i'm correct in my years i send it to a hardware wallet and i would say that's where i could feel the technology for the first time gerald and julian my co-founders talked about blockchain for many years but for me that was my first user user experience with crypto and i could see that that ability to send money like you send an email and text message it was really my moment and so i think what motivates us is this idea of a future where you have uh well money and the internet is just totally open fair you have that global platform that is totally permissionless where everyone uh can innovate and i think that can lead to uh basically everyone on the planet being connected to that same system everyone with a quality economic opportunity and this ability to exchange value literally instantly across the world like you would do with a text message i think that's that's really so it started in some way from the tech and this we felt wow that that tech can just be can can really have such an impact and it's probably the biggest thing i think we have lived and we will see in our life since this invention of the internet was probably the first and then i think for us blockchain and crypto is probably the the next wave so so is that it edamar is like is that the point of crypto you mentioned openness sort of this this open finance open money layer is that why we're doing this is that the entire point here we attach on this vision of web3 with decentralized internet something we we feel strongly about but we we think it's really connected to this layer of value so yes blockchain is about adding a new layer to the current internet uh with native value transfer when we started when the web started value transfer was not part of it it was complex and that's why i think we ended up with massive businesses that monetize attention uh rather than using transfer of value uh so i do think this can have a massive impact to the the internet as we see it and you need that value transfer to enable also a more decentralized internet where we all have full ownership of our of our money but also of our data so that leads into the next question i want to ask what are the main core goals of argent like what are the metrics that you guys look towards to measure if you guys are being successful or not so the way we we define internally at least our mission uh or our purpose at arjun is really to empower everyone to control and prosper from their digital assets and identity that's something i mentioned a lot internally sometime in some presentation and i think it's the everyone control and prosper are three very important world words uh which means first we are there to uh to be a a consumer product uh that uh target at over time a large number of people so we are not there to serve a small number of whales uh for highly speculative use cases uh which is where blockchain is that today i think we are there uh to remove friction to make it secure and simple for anyone to interact with that space so that's everyone the control is really being non-custodial and staying that way and giving user control of their of these assets and their identity uh and then prosper i think is the result for us it's really anyone being hooked up to the same global system can have an amazing impact uh probably even more for some for the few billions of people out there that are currently uh not connected to any kind of financial system so that aligns pretty nicely i think with the bankless ethos which is really about self-sovereignty over your money it's a liberating movement and you mentioned a a few attributes of uh self sovereignty there the idea of having not a non-custodial wallet which means you guys don't can take control of the assets so a crypto bank an exchange they would take control of the assets they would have custody over it but with the argent wallet you know a user never has to relinquish custody of their assets to you so that is a bankless feature i would say in what other ways is the argent wallet bankless in what other ways is it you know self-sovereign money control would you say so when you look at self-sovereignty uh i think there are several um i think several characteristics i'm i'm thinking about what you just said and so there's obviously the first step they don't uh give away control to us we are non-custodial um and it's not just uh that's not just that a philosophical approach to things we generally think that in the long term that's better for users from a security perspective it will have impact as we improve on privacy and also from a business perspective it's very hard to innovate uh and move fast if you have to be a bank basically because that's what big custodial because custodial exchanges are they are big banks and it's very hard to innovate for us once we had really secure and battle tested the smart contracts we could move then much more much faster on other elements of the product uh the one difference is before you had the choice of either you go to a bank or you manage it yourself and you are alone you have no safety net so arjun brings a safety net without being custodial meaning uh you are protected if you maybe send a large amount of money to a wrong address or if someone uh someone tries to steal your funds the same way that the banks protects you but it's really the at the smart contract level that it happens um and you you have methods of recovery that are simple uh you know on out of the box as soon as you install argent uh i would say the censorship resistance is another element of um of uh your bankless ethos i believe uh so it's not just that we cannot take your money i think there are a lot of wallets uh which have the same feature it's also uh we cannot prevent you from accessing your money uh the typical non-custodial wallet would work that way some are in between they can they might not take you not be able to take your money but they could prevent you from accessing your money and that's why we build specific features so that the emergency kit etc to answer the question of what if arjun disappears and what if arjun disappears a big part of i think being bank classes you can still manage your money and access your money without that entity so it mar i think a lot of people's first wallet in the ethereum space was metamask and metamask does a really good job with matching the values of a crypto system like ethereum as in it never ever does anything that the user doesn't explicitly request it and so it gives the user full autonomy and full control like it's a very agnostic wallet it doesn't doesn't uh treat any specific app on ethereum uh you know there's no native use of an app on ethereum but that's actually different with argent wallet argent wallet you guys have actually selected specific apps on ethereum like pooled together or compound and integrated that into your wallet now with your guys you guys have stated that you want to onboard like the next 1 billion people into defy but i was hoping to get your opinion on arjun's neutrality so when you guys choose to integrate a an app onto your wallet it becomes a political choice of sorts especially when you have one billion people on your wallet accessing some apps that you've decided to integrate versus other apps that you haven't so i was hoping to get your opinion on the neutrality or or political neutrality of argent wall and how you guys plan to you know add future applications and then what your criteria is for adding some or perhaps denying others that's a very good very good question um so arjun is definitely a more opinionated product we have a vision a direction uh where we want to go and we want to build this great experience and we are we're less of a developer tool where you can control every single aspect move every little knobs and settings and customize all of that first but first on your very first point i think there's something important there a transaction in origin never happens without the user explicitly pushing a buttons taking triggering that action uh so it's not like in the background we will send a few transaction uh that would have been the very easy way for example to skip the esc 20 approve uh is just send the transaction the background that you and or to transaction at once we never do that as a user you push on a button and therefore that triggers a transaction that was just a command on your very early point then indeed in the new defy hub we we chose um specific integration i think the first thing to know is that through wallet connect any dub can be connected to arjun so true wallet connect uh any dap can implement it it's very quick uh you have this web3 provider and suddenly you can have a user using arjun interacting with that dapps with that dap and we are doing a lot more work with the on that on front so making the arjun experience better when interacting with a with a dab on a website or on your browser is really something we we're investing more we want people to be able to use a traditional browser right now on the on desktop soon on mobile or even another native app and use arjun to authorize this transfer uh or to in to secure their assets so arjun being open is definitely where we are heading within the app we have to be a bit more careful um it's a mix of ux uh security and also user uh a certain expectation uh of so we are looking at uh there are some criteria but i think it's not the one you would think so obviously we are looking at um at things like is it a big protocol battle tested maybe with a a few you know what the level of their audit etc on their contract but in this really first launch we looked more at the user experience that would be simple enough across uh protocols so the interacting with the protocol in dfi hub is in fact just buying or maintaining a token the same way that in a stock trading app you can invest in uh in mobile apps in washing machine in a nut company or in a real estate company that's what all these stocks represent we saw it as the same here you would get a specific token and that specific token would be actually a lending activity or robot trading or actually a liquid liquidity provider provider token and it's really the same flow every dapp in defy app follows the same flow very simple you take a yeast or you take a hundred die and you put it in that so it was actually more led by a simple user experience and we are definitely open uh on that model and there will be much more protocols in the future in in defy hub we had to start somewhere we wanted to look at each integration one by one to make it to make it uh at the right level of quality and there's a lot of improvement coming there you know so while we're we're talking about the why and while we're on the argent ethos um one thing that i love about argent is that it is finally a wallet that my parents can use you know that you know they ask me all the time about this crypto thing i'm doing and it's very difficult to get them to use a browser extension like metamask or a hardware ledger wallet you know the best they're able to do is kind of keep you know some crypto on an exchange a coin base but it's very intimidating to move from a coin base into this defy wallet world what you guys have done is you've taken a venmo like experience so people in the us will probably be familiar with venmo or revolut like experience and you have incorporated all of the bankless d5 protocols inside of that app experience i've got to ask is that part of the core ethos and the core mission i've heard you talk about onboarding helping to onboard one billion people in this space is that all part of the design here totally so when we started i mentioned me sending money from kraken to my to my ledger uh and found this experience magic but it also came with the conclusion that a billion people will never write down a seed phrase on paper uh so it was either we end up with a world of uh now few exchange holding everyone's money and therefore we are back to square one um and there is no point in what we are doing or we have to fix that problem that's really the the starting point and that's that has driven a lot of our design from i mean ux but also technical design choices um in in what became now no argent absolutely so let's talk a little bit more about the the what so what sorts of things can we do with this and the the the way i kind of think about the see tomorrow is about the the money verbs that can be accomplished so think about crypto in in previous iterations of crypto there wasn't a lot you could do with it so on the bitcoin network natively you can hold bitcoin of course and you can transfer bitcoin from one place to another you can you know pay with it everything else on the bitcoin network basically requires a sidechain a a custodial bank of some sort if you want to trade if you want to lend if you want to borrow but in this bankless world in this ethereum and defy world those money verbs are actually manifested in protocols themselves so can we talk about some of the cool things that you can actually do in argent with those with those verbs so you can hold different assets you can transfer uh what else can you do with argent you you i mean you can do i mean you could store save send borrow earn interest invest i think we're with this launch of defy hub we are reaching uh i believe every of the money verb as you mentioned i think i like that expression so you know you you hold your ease or your tokens but i think holding is not just uh seeing it seeing them up there it's secure them make it extremely secure extremely recoverable and i think that's that's actually the first innovation of arjun your money is there it's in your pocket you take your phone you have access to it you can interact with it but it is protected um like you you have daily limits you can freeze and freeze your account uh you can recover it with guardians the same way the same mental model than you would have today with a good bank like like revolut for example all these great features are part a part of it uh you can transfer obviously not only we do gas abstractions so right now it's just free to come to transfer but you could imagine also paying fees in ease or in tokens but transfer is not just that it's the fact that you don't need to type a massive xerox address you can uh just send money to um ryan the target.xyz usns so that was part of fixing transfer also uh so savings or lending uh so we had compound at start we have dsr we have now ave and and pulled together i could put it in that category again these are probably we started with those use cases they are very simple uh it's very clear mental model for users i put money there and i earned some interest rate um trade you mentioned it i believe that was there also earlier on we we work with skyber and we're doing actually a lot of work in the coming months to have much more uh to to ensure a user gets the better the best possible price whether they invest uh or trade sorry ten dollar or whether they trade a hundred thousand dollar uh investment or consent i think is really a very good uh use case uh that we launched it really on monday i think the idea of robo trading is actually quite common in the traditional financial world so i really like what token set is doing there and then we added also uni swap liquidity pools i think it's maybe a bit more complex for users but there is a opportunity here to earn uh in a different way we made the experience very simple you literally say i want to put a 5 100 die and you push on one button but i think um there's still more work to do on really explaining what what does it mean to be a liquidity provider yeah absolutely and that's kind of what i love about what you've done with arjun is you've stitched together all of these various d5 protocols inside of an app that feels very much like a venmo like a like a bank experience but the difference is you know a user is not giving up custody of their assets there's no intermediary there's no bank involved it's all purely protocols but it's been packaged in such a seamless way that it it feels like a banking ui so i've got the argent app open right now and i'm looking at the the defy hub and what i could do is when you know you mentioned token sets but um i can click on token sets and what this is is it's basically like a uh folks are familiar with traditional finance it's like a brokerage uh in your pocket but it's a protocol brokerage with like etfs with like index funds that you can you know invest in in just a few taps so you have that power you haven't given up custody of your assets you've done it purely through protocol and you've got like a venmo level experience here and you could do that with trading you could do that with with earning of interest i think well i i guess a question for you then itamar is now that we have something like this like a mainstream type of of app um what's preventing us from getting to the next million users or even beyond that 100 million and like what impediments are are still sort of uh left for us what do we got to sort through is it is it education is it something else now i have a quite opinionated view on the fact that crypto didn't yet uh crack product market fit to be honest i think yes ux was one of the blocker uh ux and security make it very secure while keep it simple scalability of course will is coming uh is becoming a bottleneck gas fees are high but i think we are very very close to to pretty good solutions there uh i think we we need uh we still need more work on cracking use case at our mass market enough uh most of the current use case we see are still um high risk investments in speculation uh there's a pool of users there's a lot of money in that market also in the traditional world um which is you know it's fine to start there uh but i think we still have to to do some work to really really kind of as you said my mom my dad they can use arjun it's much easier than their current bank they don't use monzo revolut they don't use venmo they have some old-school bang arjun is easier that's done it's easier for them to send money with arjun than with their current bank but i think the use case is just not strong enough uh sending money for obvious reason acceptance is still limited uh investments products are still relatively high risk and if you put a million uh people into a simple product like lending uh the rates would are quite low today but i assume they were back at five six seven percent if you put a million people there the rate would be back to close to zero so i think we still have more work uh to do on creating uh the right use cases but i think it's moving insanely fast and our job at arjun was really deal with security and user experience and dubs can just for ignore that and focus on on building this use case and doesn't mean it's one use case that brings a million or 10 million people it might be an accumulation of smaller niches and where where where this this use case appear and where we solve a real problem i might be a bit harshing no product market fit i think the entire region of the world where just holding die rather than the local currency is an amazing use case and and literally something they are uh they are fighting for and it's uh it's not just a nice to have it's critical to their uh to their life uh but it's not yet a completely global use case that everyone can would benefit tomorrow i think i got it so if i were to kind of encapsulate what you're saying is uh you're saying that maybe in countries without a very well-developed financial system or poor financial system this is maybe something that's that's revolutionary right um you know and maybe there's there's large pockets of adoption there but in sort of the western world where we've got some developed uh financial infrastructure in banks the d5 space and even argent and everything that that you've done so far and crypto with its you know 10 years of building on top of it we've gotten maybe to the place where we are at parity or getting closer to parity with the existing financial system but there's still not enough reason for somebody who is happy with their wells fargo account uh to to make the switch you know self-sovereign um self-sovereign like kind of take control of your money that appeals to a certain demographic but for mainstream that's not enough and we're looking for like that 10x improvement something really magical a superpower that you can do in d5 that you can't do in traditional finance and that hasn't come yet i think that's what you're saying where do you think where do you think the next big growth area might come in defy where is the superpower going to come is it in interest rates is it something new that we haven't seen yet i wouldn't be able to answer what what's next if not if not i wouldn't be here i would be building it right now um i think um but i think the the choice is simple as you said you have two platforms one that's still a bit ahead i mean in in the uk payment is instant i can send money from one bank account to the other the notification arrives in real time uh it's fantastic experience but if you have to bet between a platform that is completely closed uh usually quite local uh you can't work it's hard to work between countries and where a few hundred entities in the world have the right to innovate because of all the requirements to be connected to the system versus a platform that is completely global that is fully permissionless where most of the work is even open source uh and anyone can start building whether they're in a basement or in a nice glass tower in new york and i mean i think the choice is very easy uh the rate of innovation uh there's no point even trying to compare uh i love i love i love my revolut app i love i think venmo is probably a great product but i've only seen it doesn't exist in europe so i've never used it but it looks great uh rubynode looks great but all these are this just a layer of makeup on the exact same financial system it's it's the same than my old school banking app with a bit better uix a bit better flaws it's still the same and here we're talking about reinventing from scratch a system that that thing will will evolve at an order of magnitude faster so are there any countries where downloading and accessing an argent wallet is restricted or have you guys had any frictions with making arjun as globally available as you know most of the apps that you would find on an app store so right now we it's simple we put arjun on the app store uh and that's it we done we don't control where apple and google uh can distribute it it's it's globally on the app store uh but that means it's not actually perfect it's not that global um because we only right now publish on the google app store uh to be honest it's not that we avoided others it's just you know it's it's a we all think it is no western world android within google we put it on the play store uh but that i believe there means uh some markets where it's not available um for and for example in china i believe you would need other other app store for other play at their android store or apple is in china with app stores i'm not sure google is but for example on android we could work on making sure uh we provide apks directly to the website so there are other ways to distribute philosophically we are really a software and interface we don't need to onboard users to do kyc or anything uh so it's a piece of software you can download anywhere so what what puppets of the world has you have you guys seen success with like what countries have really uh adopted arjun more than others so we when we started we you know we never targeted a specific group we really put the app out there didn't do much marketing just being there on twitter the but the natural countries would be really uk and the us first because we were an english-speaking app working with protocols that were popular in these markets then we it started growing a little bit more in europe uh maybe because that's where we are a lot of our all our team members are in europe so word of mouth etc but then we see some time interesting behavior so for the last 30 days uh our second biggest market is argentina uh we we don't really know why uh we didn't the app is not available uh in in spanish and suddenly argentina started to pick up uh maybe to our may uh maker thou friends uh i know there are a few team members there that might be uh sharing arjun around uh but so yeah i think we really like to to understand this behavior to understand where can we where can we solve problems basically well argentina so uh we we just had mariano conte on um i think a few episodes it might might have been episode nine and he talked about the um the the uh state-controlled financial system from the money all the way to the to the banking system and how that is a daily pressure and a daily quality of life uh issue for the folks in argentina so that might be an example you know more of what you're just talking about that while in western countries arjun isn't yet a 10x improvement in countries like argentina it's already a 10x improvement because they don't have any access to even you know western u.s european based financial infrastructure so this is already far better because it can't be confiscated by their local governments totally and uh and our in those in those markets we're often also holding stable coin like die is is a very interesting use case we are probably the dream stablecon wallet uh you can have an urgent wallet with only die nothing else you don't need to pay for your gas fees you can put die and then and start doing payments you can put die and start savings in compound or in the dsr so we are really the i would say that we have the dream experience for uh for stablecoin only wallet so i think that's definitely something attractive in some of these markets and if people are looking to get an understanding of die and the die savings rate that's the dsr acronym that edamar mentioned which is basically a savings account where you can deposit your die your staple coin and start earning interest instantly uh check out the episode 9 with mariana it's got all that detail so edamar with with arjun being globally accessible and globally used you guys have the option of onboarding fiat transfers into the argent wallets but the the traditional payment rails across the world are not all the same depending on where in the world you are so how does argent plan to enable everyone to transfer value into the argent wallet because while the argent wallets ux is great and it integrates with all the d5 protocols it's useless if people can't get their money into argent wallet so how do you guys plan on scaling up the ability to transfer value into arjun so it's a good question because when when i think ryan asked earlier about uh frictions what prevents us for having a million uh or a billion people i didn't mention on-ramp of ram that's actually still uh i think a strong point of friction uh we so we took the decision to really focus on on partnership there um the there was there is an it was um an interesting question for us because especially since there are recent funding where we have much more uh out resource we can invest heavily in more in more project we could have decided okay we should uh let's build the right on ram let's build this perfect experience and you could have some regulated on ram within arjun that we fully control that would have that the experience we want um we think we think if we do that we cannot be on both sides we cannot innovate there on what is a completely traditional uh financial business and at the same time in innovate on defy and on the web revision where there is so much to build so our choice is we will keep innovating when it comes to defined dapps webtree and let third parties uh work on the more traditional finance part which is the on-ramp in the afram and so we partner so part of the work we'll do is to add more partners to cover more region uh that's the first step and then if we are happy with the experience with the partners start integrating deeper so you could go to with some of them to an integration where it's really seamless uh and and part of the flow i think the you know the the usual suspects but there are some great products whether it's wire moon pay ramp here in the in the uk was expanded to all over europe is a great product so there are some really good products there they are improving it's not easy i think their challenge is is significant but it's our strategy will be to work with with those partners so for anybody who's ever used a crypto wallet in the past um they may be sort of burnt out on how clunky the experience is and how limited some of the the experience is but when i log into argent i'm doing that right now and i go to my profile for instance i can do really cool things i can set up guardians to actually socially recover my private key so there's no need to remember a seed word i can have trusted folks in my in my circle who can act as recovery addresses and you know get get me access to the wallet i've got things like a daily transfer limit similar to my credit card so if i want to set a security parameter and say only you know 100 die should be spent per day i can do that all of this feels like a big step upgrade to things we've seen in the past and crypto is you know 10 years old or so i think maybe folks might be wondering who aren't as familiar with the developments here like how is this possible now like and why is it possible now maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the technologies that went into this particularly the the smart contract wallet uh without getting too geeky emr just give us give us sort of the summary of of how this sort of functionality is now possible and previously wasn't first i would say on ethereum it was probably always possible um just wasn't exactly built that way but i'm saying on ethereum because it's a fully programmatic blockchain and therefore you can write any logic so let's first start by how it works um the traditionally wallets have all followed a similar model you have a private key the funds are attached that private key and then you have to to store that private key in some way that's the seed phrase that people make you write on a piece of paper with arjun and you can compare that to having a wallet in your pocket with cash if you lose that wallet it's lost forever if someone takes it takes your wallet they have your cash it's last forever arjun when you download arjun what's what's happening is a smart contract gets created uh for you um i don't like the analogy but in some way it's like you have an account a bank account in the middle but it's not a bank account it's a piece of code that's yours only you control it arjun cannot change it cannot upgrade it only you can do it the funds are on that on that smart contract and then that smart contract as an owner and that's the key that is it stored in your phone and only that key can control that wallet but then you can define what we call guardians and you give power to these guardians not not to access your funds you give them power to tell uh your smart contract hey there is a new owner this owner your phone is just the remote control the guardians can tell the smart contract hey itamar lost this phone set up a new owner that's a tamar new phone new phone this will take 36 hours it's enforced on chain no one can change it it's it's engraved in that smart contract uh someone cannot hack it and change that value uh and so for 36 hours that's the security period um you you 36 hours later you will have access uh what is nice is your guardian can also put a lock on your wallet for five days so for example you are worried that you um you can't find your phone maybe it's not lost maybe it's somewhere in your house but you can't find it you could put a five days lock on your wallet the same way that you can freeze your card uh through uh to some of the new banking apps what's important is this guardian mechanism although often people call it social recovery it doesn't have to be other people so uh it can be literally friends and family and i think there are markets where that works where really people once friends and family and if they are as savvy as them i would say technology technically uh it can work there are markets where people want pure self uh full control so they are their own guardians and by that it means another wallet can be another phone can be metamask can be a hardware wallet that's usually for more advanced user or they can trust third party services so arjun has a guardian service you do two-factor authentication with us and will trigger that transaction but the beauty of the model this is just some a framework it's an ethereum address anyone can create a guardian service and so maybe maybe the world is not fully bankless maybe banks will be great at doing this process and have keys to start a recovery uh who knows so it could be your lawyers it could be it could be really anything anyone any any system can act as a guardian and you as a user you decide to trust them uh or that device to to to do that that recovery process so speaking of recovery what happens if arjun just disappears what happens if the company folds or goes away like how does that meaningfully impact the people that still use arjun to store their funds so arjun is built to be non-custodial that doesn't mean that everything stays exactly the same the origin our infrastructure is there to make your life easier to make it smooth to send you alerts to coordinate complex orchestration between parties when you have several guardians etc but at heart there is a private key in your phone there is a smart contract on the blockchain so you have control so what we built is quite simple is what we call the emergency kit which is uh it's been live on ios for a while uh only more recently fundraised you you have funds in your in your wallet you you open you you unlock the arjun app all that is is on the on the client on your phone uh the you send your ease to an address the difference is that we can't use our relayer infrastructure because we have disappeared so we have a conservation infrastructure meaning you sign a transaction will relate to the blockchain and that's how we abstract the gas we you can't do that so instead you will push the send button but leave your finger on that button for 10 seconds that's it so instead of pushing the button you leave your finger on it for 10 seconds there's a piece of data that appears on your screen you copy that you paste it in your browser in uh in any type of wallet it can metamask you need to enable uh to try data could be my wallet my crypto you paste that piece of data you send the transaction so you will need some ease to pay for the gas you send the transaction the transaction now is rooted to your your smart contract your wallet and and things uh go ahead as normal it's obviously not that slick but you have access to your funds my the current stage of our emergency kit is that if we disappear people would have access to their funds but they would likely drain their wallet meaning arjun is fully decentralized and everything is is beautiful and great now they would probably change remove all their funds and move on to a new wallet uh the only grail would be that even if we disappear they can use different services for relayer different you we already let you for example pick a a different node on ios uh and the holy grail would be that they keep life as usual just by picking uh other services for these different building blocks and i think we can get there but right now everyone can remove their funds it's safe it's in their under the control so if argent goes away everyone still has access to their phone their funds as long as ethereum is still in existence as long as ethereum is still running yes so you mentioned something there you said you guys you're a centralized company and so there there are risks there one of the things that go along with being a centralized company is that you guys require an email address and a phone number to sign up uh is that the way that it's going to be and why do you guys need that information i'm surprised you waited that long to ask the question so and it's a very fair question so when we started we had fun straight up mandatory phone number email this phone number and these emails were used for uh i would say three reasons one simple resistance we didn't want to someone creating a million wallet uh and certainly draining all our gas because we pay for each wallet for the gas that was one element to security notification so if there is a large transfer if there is a recovery if anything happens on your wallet you are anything security related you are alerted through these channels second thing and three these are used for the argent guard service that uh at the beginning it was not by default not everyone anyone who download the app by default has the argent guard service they can fully recover their wallet then they can customize that so the the civil resistance is something where it's fair to say there were other solutions and one of the solution we we we worked on was implementing what we call create two so we don't have to create the wallet in real time so you need to put funds for the wallet to be created you already have an address once the funds are there the wallet is created it starts to give a cost to someone if someone wants to create a million wallet they need to pay gas for a million transaction therefore uh it would cost them a lot so i would say we are starting to be at the point where we have uh we have some decent protection there yes you can create three four wallets but probably not uh a lot and you you could limit rate limit to different ways so we we are getting there where we are very opinionated um is still on the email so the phone now we are the place where you can skip it it's not obvious we are debating that regularly we don't want to encourage people to not use it because it would make by default things a bit less secure so for us privacy is about consent you need to have control uh of what data you give to who and what is done with your data we are very transparent uh i'm sure we can improve but we don't use your phone your email for uh marketing selling it to third parties there is no such thing as data are vesting to profile you but we have accepted that phone is quite different than email uh after mostly talking to users in very different countries where um the uk where really they they said every phone number is tied to my i can buy a sim card on amazon here but for them it was no every phone number is is strongly tied to an identity uh i can't have two numbers on my phone uh and they were generally worried and they wouldn't want that so now we started to make that optional but you still need to tap on the privacy icon and then uh read the text and skip it um but we didn't make it the default because also it makes uh arjun god um uh less less secure giving us this two factor of email and phone is still a much better experience especially because arjun is not subject to sim swap attack that's not how our model works the email i would say we are much more opinionated um our an email is there you are you are creating a relationship with arjun you want a certain service uh and for that we need a communication channel saying push notification is not the same not everyone enables them it's not as reliable you we in a part of our model is being able to warn you if there are problems uh if a large transfer is initiated on your account if a recovery is initiated on your account and that's why users come to arjun we have i would say security uh we want a fully recoverable model we want to be able to alert you and we have a line we don't want to cross from a security perspective if you want a less secure wallet then that's not with arjun we we we will not compromise on that and email is easy it's it's so easy to create another email i think it's also again important and we want people to push on privacy and we had people on twitter yelling at us for uh screaming at about the phone number and then we improve we did some work uh but we are not storing uh for example an email and a password and some id data it's a communication channel and this communication channel is important bring security and there it's so easy to create uh an email with protonmail uh or others so we do not want a less an unsecured product because we can't communicate with our users yeah totally i was um actually uh i tweeted it just a challenge to the you know crypto community it's just you know if um if maybe you're in the bitcoin community you haven't yet uh taken a look at some stuff on ethereum um you take a look at argent you have five minutes right like just download it and um see what you can do with it and some folks said you know really excited ui looks great but they got me on the the uh phone number and email and i think a great response to that like a way around that is uh as you said you can skip the phone number and you can create a um an anonymous pseudo-anonymous email like prodon mail or something and you can sign up that way so i feel like that sort of preserves what you might need as far as privacy while getting around um like some of the the concerns that folks might have um do you think we'll get more uptake in the um in the bitcoin community i don't so no i don't think it will make any difference to be honest uh i think uh that that element is not the blocker the um i think i think it's very i appreciate the criticism phone number if we make it optional i think it should be clearer how we make it optional it's too buried it's too unclear and we will just alert and warn the users uh that it's it's less secure we just don't want a person that doesn't have good upset that doesn't understand the implication of not using the phone number to do it um on the but i don't think to be honest we were we can count on the figure of our of my hand the number of uh of complain there i don't think that's what will make bitcoin certainly uh suddenly explore that uh i mean a bit confusingly jump on on arjun i think the um the most bitcoin users are savvy enough to know that they can create a absolute anonymous email uh so i think that's fine and we i think it's maybe more the issue of do we have a good uh be a trustless bitcoin token uh in the ethereum ecosystem and we have some very interesting project coming soon hopefully um but right now we have rabbit con that is still custodial and i don't think that might be more of a philosophical issue uh or a genuine security concern for for bitcoin the bitcoin community yeah absolutely i think that is key getting some good decentralized trustless as trustless as possible uh bitcoin asset options on the ethereum network will probably be pretty important around that one other question that's just been asked in the bankless community is how argent is monetizing and plans to sustain itself over time so right now we do very little on that front uh we we get affiliate fees on on kyber trades uh so you get can when you centrate to kyber you get cancer token uh back uh and that's you know a small i mean it can grow we are starting to trade several millions uh in value every every month so that that's a revenue stream the that's any that's the only thing we are monetizing right now in arjun and it's monetization is not something we'll be working on this year to be very honest uh we see ourselves disrupting uh tens of trillion of dollar size market i mean it's the entire financial industry there will be room for monetization the only criteria for us is uh transparent monetization meaning you don't uh we don't like for example advertising or take something that is free and uh suddenly maybe make it paid because so in some way you capture the user in your platform they are stuck and suddenly they have to pay but the area we are considering they are transactional monetization and the exchange is a perfect example there is um uh and there is direct consumer subscription uh so you know revolut uh robin hood etc they have premium features where users pay a monthly subscription so i think this definitely something that can work again where the user has a clear choice what i get for free versus what i get for a monthly subscription it's something we might start thinking about it end of next year or maybe the the year after we we are not in a rush there the this space is so small we need to be so much bigger uh before any kind of monetization is worth it the only session that really works now in that space is to take massive uh trading fees or on-ramp fees and it's not something we uh we we want to do right now can you illustrate for us what argent would look like if it was maximally successful if everything went right and in five years from now you guys had the perfect product that you envisioned today what does that look like uh time frame is always the the question mark but i think what elements will we have we will have instant payment i think that's a given in five years so we need to have instant payment payment privacy uh being able to see every every uh third party to who you send money uh it's probably a big blocker also for massive scale um so payment privacy instant payment core uh i would say financial primitives um and that's something we are getting there and then what i would call identity solution not from a legal identity but being able to log in with your gen wallet to any website i would say these are core core elements you will also have the ability to have arjun anywhere meaning uh any dub developer any third party should be able to create an urgent wallet uh disconnected from our app you a game console should be able to create an urgent wallet or a point of sales device that a merchant should be able to create an urgent wallet so that the merchant has secure uh storage for their crypto and can receive payment but doesn't mean they need to use the urgent app so um i think five years it starts to be an interesting time frame but i think that's the kind of time frame we need to think of for entire communities to use crypto i don't think it matters with if it's arjun everything should be fully interoperable but entire community using crypto for their day-to-day needs payment investment and there's no more question of on-ramp off-ramp this is this is money yeah there's and there's really it seems like a symbiotic relationship with everything that the ethereum economy is is producing all of these d5 protocols because what i see argent doing is essentially acting as a user interface on top of that in a nice seamless app experience on top of that so to a certain extent in five years doesn't it really depend on what the the d5 and ethereum and community uh uh the crypto community cook up oh totally we are totally dependent on uh on the ecosystem we are a bit like the browser we are netscape you know we make it accessible and safe to interact with this product uh at the end uh everyone needs to contribute and our job is to make it possible for dapps to focus on on use case and that's why we are betting on an ecosystem that is fully global that is fully open source and permissionless where anyone can come and innovate so we are not too worried about that i think uh when a few billions people have the right to to innovate on a platform you tend to have amazing outcomes absolutely so itamar it has been an absolute pleasure i i think you you mentioned uh d5's netscape moment you talked about argent being sort of like a netscape browser uh you know and netscape came about in the early internet in you know 1993 1994 and just sort of shook everything up because it layered on top of these all of these really interesting communication protocols something that was much more mainstream accessible and that's what you're doing with with argent is you're making these money protocols mainstream accessible so i want to thank you and your team for your work in doing that i guess my my final question is this how can the bankless community help you on your mission to mainstream open finance so i think specifically for the bankcast community that tends to be i think a lot of early adopters i would say talk to us find us on twitter come in our discord tell us uh about your experience what works but especially what doesn't work we know we have so much more to improve so we want to know that there's a lot of work coming whether it's on-ramp whether it's performance tracking of your define investment more more defy protocols coming so the best you can do is cr criticize us uh be nice with the team but tell us what's wrong tell us what to improve uh and then spread the word i think that's uh that would be amazing and you have already done it uh the last 48 hours have been amazing the bankless community has been has been really awesome you've heard of bankless community itamar wants your feedback uh he wants to know how he can and his team can improve the product and then he wants you to spread the word edamar it has been an absolute pleasure thanks for joining david and i today on bankless david ryan thanks so much and keep keep doing the amazing work you do fantastic guys uh as far as action goes we we have a few for you in this episode the first thing you should do is go download the argent wallet and give it a try that will be in your show notes a link will be in your show notes uh try a money protocol pull together is a good one to start with that's a no loss lottery if you want to add some funds some die funds to the die savings rate you can do that too try one out and then thirdly tell a friend about this maybe it's that crypto skeptic in your life that thinks crypto is just about speculation uh maybe it is a parent who previously has kept all of their funds on an exchange and uh it hasn't really embraced the entire bankless lifestyle this is a great place for them to start you can start slow they could download the app and you can send some some dye back and forth or some back and forth and have some fun with it guys risks and disclaimers this of course is not financial advice youth is risky crypto is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everybody but we are excited that you are with us on the bankless journey thanks [Music] [Music] you
