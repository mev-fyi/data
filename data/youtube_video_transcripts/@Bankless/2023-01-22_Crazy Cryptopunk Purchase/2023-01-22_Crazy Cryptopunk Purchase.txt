crypto Punk nfts Discord screenshot this was in 2017. this account named cyborg says in the Discord I'm about to do something either extremely stupid or wonderfully smart wish me luck and then just a few moments later the crypto Punk bot shows up and goes a zombie punk was sold for a whopping 1.89 ether for 564 dollars and some other person in the Discord goes whoa because that was a big sale effort or a JPEG or a JPEG 560 for a JPEG who's spending this much money in 2017 on jpegs of course that zombie punk is probably worth 1 000 times more in ether terms yeah
