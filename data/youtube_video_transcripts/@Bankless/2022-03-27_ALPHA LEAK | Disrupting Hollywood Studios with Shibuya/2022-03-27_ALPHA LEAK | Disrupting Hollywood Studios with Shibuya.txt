welcome bankless nation to this edition of alpha leak formerly known as meet the nation but we are now calling it alpha league because it's just a hotter name today we are talking about shimbuya shambuya is a brand new content platform out of the hands of people pleaser the famous nft artist behind the x times y equals k nft from unit swap v3 and many many many more nfts beyond that we've also brought along two other co-founders of shambuya mache and jackie and we tell and i get them to tell the story of shambuya itself and shambuya is a kind of a content production studio but instead of a director instead there's a dao and that is where this story gets really really interesting uh emily and her fellow co-founders are are devs and and artists and they have been charged with the creation of the story but who determines the outcome of the story or where this story goes is up to the discretion of the dow members of the token holders who stake and make make the producers actually have the express the choices that the community wants and so this is decentralized storytelling this is storytelling by the community and then the uh the producers actually tell the story uh and so if you want to check this out while we're going through the show you can go to the website it's shibuya.xyz that's u y s-h-i-b-u-y-a dot x y z you can go watch the first chapter of this story and then you can stay tuned to watch the remaining chapters of the story after token holders determine what the story actually is this is like a kind of a choose your own adventure type story but built for the web3 metaverse world and we've talked about this concept before on bankless where previously you would have the artists on stage producing creativity producing music producing art and then it being consumed by the community but with the power of tokens tokens give gives the community voice and the ability to actually give back sp uh uh reverberate their interests back to the artist and say hey we liked this but less so of this so you should go in that direction and this uh this back and forth content creation this back and forth creativity between artists and community is i think going to be a very fundamental part of web3 a fundamental part of the metaverse and its platforms like shibuya that are enabling this to come into the future uh so we're gonna go and talk to people pleaser and the t and mache and jackie uh from shibuya uh but if you are interested you can definitely go to that website again it's s h i b u y a dot x y z and then the twitter account is s h i b u y a x y z without the dot on twitter so you can you guys can go follow those directly there as well there will be a link in the show notes so you can just go click that if that makes things easier for you so let's go again ahead and get right into the conversation but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're going bankless you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet you can now trade tokens on

defy things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out web3 wouldn't be the same without it download menopause for desktop and mobile at metamask.io and load up your trezor ledger lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web 3. polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of

playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon welcome bankless nation to this edition of alpha leak where we are going to explore shibuya and so with us on today's episode we have three of the co-founders three of the five co-founders of shibuya you guys probably recognize people pleaser she's the person behind the x times y equals k nft that rocketed her into fame and she also has brought along her two other two other co-founders we have mache and jackie from the boot shambuya project guys welcome to alpha leak thanks for thanks for joining me i appreciate it thanks for having me thanks for having us thank you uh so people pleaser i think people recognize you the most so i'm going to start with you can you just give us the high level pitch of what shibuya is what are we going to be talking about today sure and i think for the rest of the podcast we can just not even acknowledge the existence of our other two guests um no i mean yeah like so we're building this new thing that we're calling shibuya it's named after shibuya crossing and you know what it really is is sort of like a decentralized video platform um but we hope to also expand to other uh media forms outside of video and i think probably the easiest way to explain it is um if we have sort of like a first animated web series that we're launching on shibuya it's called white rabbit and it's kind of just taking the sort of pick your own path um like style of storytelling and bringing it to web3 and so for example our first chapter that we're calling it uh you see you watch this little animation and then at the end of the chapter uh our main character comes in front of two doors and then behind each door is an alternate ending to the chapter and to watch each alternate ending you have to mint what we're calling these erc 1155 nfts that we're calling producer passes and so when you mint one you can then use that producer pass to stake it in the uh you know the outcome that you want to see so you know you pick a door and then you can watch the ending and then you know when we give sort of like a grace period for everybody to kind of give everybody a chance to stake their producer passes and then you know when that voting period ends then whatever is the majority um vote which uh already happened for our first chapter um would be uh sort of dictate the plot going forward and so um in this way everybody who has a producer pass and has also staked it feels like you know they have a part in sort of the development and the storytelling of this uh web series that's currently being built and at the same time they'll also you know get to keep that nft as like a paper trail of their like participation in the project and also in return are rewarded um the valueless governance tokens that we're calling white rabbit tokens and currently you know they can be using these tokens to do things like uh vote on you know the main character's name in the show or also like um we uh right right now we have a leaderboard as well and um sort of what we're calling dynamic credits at the end so um you know when like the credits roll and it's like uh artists executive producers producers and it's all based on um people's uh token holdings basically and there's also a leaderboard on our site so you can see who kind of like our our top producers and so forth and um so that's kind of like a very high level explanation uh we're really what we're trying to do here is just to sort of change the way that the stagnant um state of the nft market is like sort of like stuck at these pfp projects and we're just kind of coming in and already building something and we already have content to show and be like this is what you're getting into and this is what you're supporting instead of like doing a draw a drop first and then promising some kind of like road maps later you know and also just to kind of change the way that people are thinking about how utility is actually used in nfts beyond it just being a jpeg or some kind of membership or you know and also trying to decentralize and democratize the way that um independent film projects could be funded so i'm reminded of these uh choose your own adventure books back when i was a child where you would come to the end of a chapter and there were some choices and you could pick which page you would flip to based off what choices you wanted wanted to go and then the other thing that this reminded me of is a twitch plays pokemon where you have like so many people having inputs into the choices that the main character makes uh and so um uh i think i'll throw it to mache uh why do you think that this is going to be exciting like why do you think this is a product market fit what do you think is really going to get the creative juices going on this project it's well first of all in terms of like a long-form filmmaking this is something that rarely ever happens like usually when it comes to long-form filmmaking there's a there's a production that's set up it takes quite a bit of time to find a team to get get things built you have obviously passionate artists and directors who do short films all the time but that's like very rare and just takes out your soul basically i i can tell that from experience working on a couple of like my own short films where it's it's it's really difficult to make them and combine that with your like life choices in general um also a lot of us are video game enthusiasts as well like you know there's the gaming industries is huge it's actually bigger than the film industry that tells you that people like to play the characters or or have their own choices and see where the stories or the gameplay will develop so i think it was a no-brainer like as you mentioned um those old books where you choose your own path and you choose your own way of how you want to develop the story that's been always exciting and uh there maybe have been only a handful examples where where that kind of type of content has been used in in animation or film so we we felt like you know it would be very interesting to try this but also just because the way web3 works in general and the technology itself allows you to do so many different things on so many different levels it almost became for us like uh like a playground where it's like how can we make uh an interesting storytelling an interesting story overall but get the community involved in how this story develops or and where it goes and from that point you know we kind of started with uh choose your own path like you have two different doors each of them lead to a completely different storyline obviously the one that people choose is going to be the one that that's going to develop so that gets community involved but from there it's just like we we sat down and started thinking like what else can be done okay you can vote for the character name and then just opens up okay when we have that utility there is so much more that can be done that never has never been done before and that's i think that's the exciting part uh in this project specifically in white rabbit where it's like yeah we can we can kind of like do whatever we want and get the whole community engaged without asking for some producers studios and you know high level executives that are basically funding the project to see if our idea jives with where the studio wants to go instead it's just like it becomes like a grassroots film project where it's just creatives in the community and we kind of decide what it's going to be um and i don't think that's has ever been tried before i might be mistaken obviously there are so many projects out there it's very difficult to track the whole internet obviously um but i haven't seen anything on like a really high creative level with high-end animation where that kind of plays out and that's probably the most exciting part about this project specifically but but just also like the utility of it of itself um the leaderboard credits you know credit is something that is very easy to come to compile um if you get people involved in the project but this is like a dynamic credit too which is which is also exciting because now that also gives us an ability to play with different things play with like different ideas okay depending on the level you are whether you're like executive producer or a producer or associate producer fun fact actually last place is the production assistant just as a funny thing we found it it can give you like a different um experiences throughout as well so there's just a lot of a lot of creative things not only just just level of tag but just level of uh animation where we we can kind of get to decide okay we can add like the extra interactive layer to to a medium that normally isn't really interactive at all so that's definitely like the the biggest part of it so with all things this sounds like the gist of this is like decentralized storytelling you're allowing storytelling to kind of be pushed to the margins allowing the users to have say in the outcomes but also at the same time uh sometimes decentralization can be bad there are a lot of dows out there that are just like chickens running around with their heads cut off and so they actually do kind of need that like centralized leadership and even with like the choose your own adventure books like you couldn't make the characters do anything there were only certain predetermined outcomes on this and so i'm wondering like what on the spectrum of just like complete community control versus some guided outcomes how much is like what does the infrastructure actually look like like when what when you guys like start the story did you guys start like the gist of the story and then you want the community to finish it or like how are you guys giving power to the community but not too much power how are you like navigating that balance so i think the best way to kind of think about this is um referencing if anybody has seen that one black mirror episode on netflix um it's a one-off called vandersnatch and they adopted this sort of choose-your-own-path kind of storytelling model where they pre-shot a bunch of different sequences um and then split it up so you know your character could be like having cereal and then between choosing the two different types of cereal which they're allowing the audience to do um it leads down to a completely different storyline and then down the path it could you know sort of like loop back into the same storyline again or it could just go down you know um there's people who have like mapped out the entire thing and so we've done something similar where obviously we have complete sort of like artistic um direction that's already been you know dictated already so uh we show it to the people and then you know it's kind of like based on their engagement and their interest levels and you know obviously um if anybody has seen mache's artwork it's incredibly um he's incredibly talented and so you know most people respond extremely well to this kind of art style right and so um and you know the community doesn't want to actually do the artistic work you know they're not they're not like sitting there like oh i want to animate either like they want to be fed content and entertainment but um so you know we have like sat down and kind of written out you know and we start are still doing this every day actually you know writing out sort of like the general um different possible plot lines like you can think of as a node graph and all the different paths that it can take and just so that we sort of like take the front seat and kind of direct um driving the community down this what we think would be you know good storytelling and things like that but having the community you know be a part of you know sort of less um detrimental decisions like um so kind of like giving them an option or like a palette tasting right and not having them create the meal from scratch is how you can think about it i love i love that uh metaphor it's like a it's like a tasting menu uh and that also it makes it so that you guys don't have to go do like five story lines of work just for the community to pick one of them and then you just wasted four story lines of you know production value that you are not ever going to use but is that the final form of what this kind of vision looks like like in how in what ways are you interested in like kind of opening it up even more so it's not always a binary choice actually um future chapters there's going to be um ones where it's not just binary choices but on top of that you know because it is a native web 3 media that we're you know broadcasting this on it's a web series right like and so um we are really trying to take advantage of the fact that um it's web free native and so you know an example of this is we're like partnering with d-gen score and you know they're the guys who are building um technology related to scanning you know on-chain identity and wallet history and so you can imagine like one of the chapters where you know somebody like david who's interacted let's say with unisof a bunch of times you know based on your wallet history you're seeing a different uh version of the episode than what i'm seeing um and so that's kind of like you know things that we're experimenting with and adding you know depth to how this kind of storytelling is possible and making it even more interactive beyond just it being sort of like a binary option in choice yeah i could add maybe uh what you touched upon in terms of like how scalable that would be in terms of like the the taste palette and like pre-scripted decision-making one of the one of the interesting things we already found out uh working on chapter two and chapter one is that we ask we actually talk with community and ask like what what they feel the story is going to be like where where they think the direction is going and why they made one decision over other and that kind of like informs us to look at the plot line we have and sort of like the story structure and and and be experimental in terms of okay maybe there's a specific visual cue that we're going to add that is a reaction to what communities expression to what they saw already was so in terms yes it's it's sort of like a curated experience because obviously when you're filmmaking you kind of have to do that to make a cohesive story that that holds together glues together the characters make sense they they talk and that makes sense obviously and the story concludes one way or another but there's always like side elements or even just main plot elements that could be changed whether it's visually or through the audio or through the music or even through the dialogue where the story still holds holds together but it's a it's a pure reaction to how people who engaged the content and wanted to participate on the level of voting and and uh and voting and with tokens and whatnot to a point where those decisions can have like like a domino effect on what's going to happen later so as emily mentioned we pretty much every day we're kind of sitting and writing it's because like we do have the story we do have a structure of what the scene is going to play out but there's also like okay how can we kind of spice it up based on what's happening and that's that's the interesting part too because it's very challenging in the persp from the perspective of directing and editing but it's also like super exciting because you get to like almost crowd source the outcome with the community which is which is great i feel like projects artistic projects that combine community input and really like cater to the community itself as almost like a love letter of like hey here's a piece of entertainment but you're also part of it are probably the most interesting projects in my opinion rather than just like hey here's here's the content watch it like it like it or leave it that works too but it's very rare you find find real gems uh when that happens so yeah i feel like you know sort of so many like hollywood productions or things like that are in such like closed doors like you know they're always like boxed into some studio and people like don't see what's going on but everybody's curious right and so this is sort of like a more transparent way for us to be like this is how we're making it and you know everybody who's in on this early like clearly because it's just started production right you guys are all part of like the storytelling aspect of it yeah i just want to add that our discord community uh has been pretty amazing like people are crazy about potential plots uh different scenarios have all these different theories of what the story actually means to see that organically grow and people participating and be really really invested into the show it's pretty amazing so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll

want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between eth optimism arbitrary or boba networks yeah i remember during the when um game of thrones was in its its peak the game of thrones subreddit was like one of the most lively spots on the internet and there was just so much ideating on theory and and conspiracy theories and like you know what's gonna happen in the future uh and just and then also just kind of its own culture and its own vibes as well and what i'm getting out of this is very much aligned with the whole web 3 narrative where you know previously in the trad web 2 world you have exactly what people pleaser was just saying you're kind of just like spoon fed content like here's the story like i hope you like it uh and you either like it or you don't but in the web 3 world the the possibility that tokens have to return voice to echo back towards the leadership saying oh hey we like that versus oh hey we don't like that or actually just giving them user autonomy to actually be a part of the creative process i think it's actually a really big challenge because in the web 2 tradify world you had the benefits of just like centralized talent just producing it and it just worked and in the web 3 world we see this potential where we have you know the talent which is you guys the co-founders uh but also trying to figure out how to also empower the community which might be people that you know are explicitly not talented people and so i think the challenge that you guys have is well how do you uh guys as artists how do you uh enable the good expression to come out of your community have you guys thought about this angle and how you guys plan on doing that i think we're pretty pleasantly surprised actually you know i think i sort of started in well first we have these like token gated discord channels um where we think of it like more of like a writer's room or producer's roommate and i sort of um really encourage people in there to start you know talking about their theories and you know their analyzations of um the plot and things going forward and easter eggs and such and yeah it was honestly a pleasant surprise of how sort of much attention to detail that people actually are and they're surprisingly really good writers too so maybe we've been really lucky in that regard that we haven't received sort of any super terrible ideas um on top of that there's always sort of like a comedic element to it so anything that's like really terrible has has always been sarcastic and intended to be a joke like oh we should name the main character kevin you know like things like that but nobody is actually you know giving out really really bad ideas um and in fact we really encourage that too and obviously we have some kind of like filtration system too where if somebody's like we want to you know make a you know not pg-13 film or something then obviously we can you know sort of uh veto that of course i think the the other dynamic here is where a lot of like defy web 3 protocols they need governance for a means to an end as in they need governance to prove like produce the outcome but i think with this like the product itself is the governance as in like this is a governance platform what are we governing over this story but it's about the governance the governance is the product and the value of the governance is a function of like how interesting and valuable this story is um i want to put listeners into the shoes of what they would actually expect if they were participating here what what is it actually like if they want to go and consume this story well what's the form what's the format we're talking about like you know five minute short form videos like what what what should listeners expect if they wanted to actually go watch the story and and then maybe we can actually start talking about the website so um our users would go on shibuya.xyz the first chapter that we made i would say is you know probably around like just a little over a minute long um and it's um probably a little bit shorter because it's sort of the initial proof of concept that uh we um are releasing to the world right and also keep in mind we did this with zero funding it was completely grass-rooted like um our first round of sort of um you know any kind of support that came in came in from uh us um you know selling producer passes but before that everything we just sat here and you know sort of like built it and made the animation without it was literally just um the shea and i um and so what you can expect is you go on the website and you see this super beautiful animation um in the style of mache's artwork and then um yeah and then i would say each sort of like alternate ending has they're like are a little bit different in length too but yeah roughly just a little over one minute um and we're obviously already working on the second chapter um that is expected to be around uh just over two minutes long and um maybe more yeah maybe more because you know it's constantly evolving and changing and you know basically you know literally every day we're like um adding or subtracting things into the plot and things like that uh but um yeah we're hoping uh you know if anybody has seen love death of robots those are really really high quality animated shorts and each of them are between let's say like six to 15 minutes long and we are hoping for a white rabbit at the end of every chapter stitched together to be probably an over 15 minute high quality short film animation so with that first episode that was just you guys uh setting the scene setting the stage not too much governance in that first episode more more governance into the second episode and then how many like how many governance decisions do you think is going to be happening per episode like uh how how like how many decisions does the community need to make or is it just is it just the ending well for starting from chapter two already we have the voting of the name of the main character and um yeah i i would expect that we have a lot more um coming in you know some of them that we're sort of still working on right now and uh maybe sometimes like meant to be a surprise as well and um you know there's a sort of other things like in the first chapter already and we're probably going to do this for many many chapters is we have this these what we're calling japanese good luck bags um which was actually a wallet that we seeded with some nfts so in that in the first one there was a one-on-one people pleaser a 101 mache nft a cryptoed and a crypto dick butt um and we so after seeding that wallet actually you know so this was all already right very early on you know we've planned this from the beginning um and then so we generated the seed phrase for that wallet and they're actually um each word in the seed phrase was hidden in a very specific in various different parts across chapter one and then we actually you know upon release we just tweeted we didn't even say that there was a seed phrase we just tweeted um the nfts that are in the goody bag and then we said uh somewhere in this episode you know uh flies some goodies to be found finders keepers and then to our surprise actually within two hours um somebody had figured it out and transferred out the nfts which is really crazy and so we are also thinking that in the future maybe the governance will also include people voting on what goes in the goodie bags um for future chapters for example how do you make sure i know we i mentioned how like governance is the product so people should be expecting to go in and make a lot of decisions but also how do you you guys thought about like things like voter fatigue or just like oh i only really care about these things i don't really care about the other things how are you guys managing that i think voter fatigue will always um exist and maybe for sort of like d5 protocols they're a little bit more sort of um how do you say this like hindering towards um furthering governance but actually i feel like for what we're doing on you know white rabbit or just in shibuya in general it might not be a bad thing because then it will really show you kind of who is truly engaged in the content that's being made right we don't want people who don't care and so the people who really care and are really sort of like devoted you can think of them as super fans so just like you said you know not everybody's gonna go on those game of thrones subreddits and go comment you know their thoughts about everything but the people that are doing that are people who care a lot and this is obviously the kind of community that we are trying to um give our uh content towards you know the content is actually essentially going to be free for anybody to watch even if you don't have you know metamask wallet and stuff it will always be free to watch up to the point where there's a vote happening but the kind of people that we want to be you know minting the producer passes staking it and getting the governance tokens are the kind of super fans who really like it because they you know really love the content and not just because they're a passive viewer so one of my um favorite stories from the internet is the story of when i can't remember who did it but they let the internet decide who was going to name this one boat i can't remember i can't remember where this was but the the internet decided that the name of the boat was going to be uh bode mcboat face just because like that's what happens when you let some you know internet dj's internet trolls like name your stuff are you guys worried that like somebody like the people are just going to come in and start naming things or just br just basically breaking things with governance or is that actually a feature because you know they're unable to do that i think we're we're almost uh it's part of the charm of white rabbit and this whole project is that we're not taking ourselves too seriously you know we have some silly easter eggs in there like it starts with in the year 2069 um and you know kind of the gist of it or you know sort of playing on this whole culture of web 3 in general is just you know this kind of mindset of it looks good or it's super high quality but at the same time we're not taking ourselves so seriously like everything in hollywood actually and um so i think we're just gonna have fun with it obviously we're not gonna you know we're gonna prevent things like naming our character hitler or something like that but otherwise i i i don't see it as you know much of a minus but rather like an interesting experiment that we're conducting right now jackie i want to get into some of the the dev technical questions of this um which is hard for me because i'm not a developer so sometimes i don't know what questions i want i need to ask but i think the first question is like uh in your experience as a dev how has this particular project been like unique or challenging to you like what are the unique aspects about this project that really stand out from a developer's perspective yeah so this is my actually my first um web 3 project so it's really fun to kind of learn you know smart contracts all these different things and i think the part that i actually stopped the most was the tokenomics so like you know you can easily write a small contract you know to generate pfps and a lot of these things that people have done already but to design a system with tokenomics to kind of dictate the behavior of your users was very interesting so like for example when people vote we have a mechanism where um if you vote on the winning side you actually get a 10 bonus of tokens um so these different designs where we can kind of leverage to incentivize different behavior is very fun and we thought like what if people just wait till the end and not vote and then see you know which side is the winning vote and then just over on that side so then we also implemented like uh early staking bonus where the earlier you vote um you know the more tokens you get so in a way where voting early and getting it wrong is actually more profitable than voting uh late and getting it right so so i think other than the technical smart contracts with the website the tokenomics part really stood out to me as very fun and interesting to design so there's two tokens in this ecosystem i believe there's the producer passes which is uh the nft 1155 i think is the right eip and then there's also the the white rabbit token the erc20 token uh how many producer passes are there uh and uh is that and that's that that producer pass is basically like the funding for the project right that's like how you guys are are paying for development is that right yeah so there's five thousand producer passes for the first chapter okay um and we actually have a bonding curve implemented for the entire show so like the next chapter we might have more producer passes uh for food and mint so in a way uh the erc20 the white rubber token is a fixed supply uh 69 million 420 420. um but for every chapter people get the same amount of tokens so when there's more producer passes actually you can um you get the most tokens from minting early so we also want to reward people who support the show from the beginning and then the white rabbit tokens talk about the the value of the white rapid and rapid tokens why would people want those so they're basically valueless they're governance tokens right so having those tokens allow you to um you know participate in devoting all the stuff we talked about be on the leaderboard and you know be a negated discord then get a telegram and talk to us give us your input your theories about the show um yeah so basically a valueless governance token i see on the website that uh once the film is completed it will be turned into a fractionalized nft maybe you guys are using fractional for that or something maybe not um yeah but then we're using fractional art for this yeah so actually in the beginning we created this vault that minted this fixed amount supply of tokens and we seated it with two nfcs to create this basket that can hold multiple entities so what we will do is in the end of the show when you know all the chapters are completed and connected together we will then transfer the entity into that fractional vault um so essentially the erc20 is a fraction of ownership of the nft the nft of the the full-length movie of the full-length show do they the token owners also own the ip to that show or where does the ip is the ipa relevant um variable here it's a good it's a good question um right now we're we're basically looking at all the possibilities really uh there's also like just uh general implications in terms of like what decisions you make in terms of ip rights as anyone who lives in u.s you probably understand how complex i.p rights copyrights and trademark trademarks are and uh so so we're very closely looking at what that is and if that's going to be part of the of the project or not uh we usually the the way we look at the project in general just shibuya in general and white rabbit specifically as well is uh we like to not promise things that we're not sure we can deliver and instead focus on the things that we know we can deliver and promise those instead and then everything that comes after would be an extra bonus uh literally literally kind of like that uh kind of approach and that stems from the fact that if you follow any of the web 2 projects uh like specifically kickstarters there's just so many stories of kickstarters promising amazing ideas and never delivering and there's obviously examples where they deliver and it's an amazing product but for every example of something that worked out and it's amazing there's a hundred examples of something that didn't work out and turned into a you know a [ __ ] show let's say and we we by by virtue of creating this thing we completely want to avoid that we don't want to promise things that we we don't believe in uh we don't want to build stuff we don't believe in we don't want to be on the hook of like hey give us a and we'll potentially maybe sometime in the future give you a b um it's it's just not the way we we like to operate uh we just want to build we just want to build this platform and the film to be an interactive experience something new that that is just not uh haven't haven't existed before and take everyone on the right everyone who's interested and wants to participate and wants to become part of not only just community but like as you said the governance of it all uh where it's like you're not just participating and consuming content you're actually actively uh you know participating in making the content better than it would it would have been if it was like spoon fed to you so i would just say um instead of looking at the tokens as you know ip i would more look at it as like a dao so like every potential future shows we have on on the platform could be its own dao where the community can make decisions together push the film forward and all have skin in the game and i think you know obviously this is an original ip by um you know myself and shea in terms of like fully creatively you know we've created this from scratch right and so uh but you know we're thinking of this differently from let's say a pfp project where people might be thinking oh if i buy this pfp can i you know put it on a tote bag and start like selling those tote bags and this is kind of the usual discussions around ip and things like that um but our native media is just different right it's a film and it's meant to be consumed and the main purpose of it is entertainment and so we're kind of trying to bring it back to the whole concept of people going to movie movie theater and they're not thinking oh my gosh how am i going to profit off this movie like they're buying a movie ticket because i want to exchange my time and you know however much this ticket costs for some um two hours of entertainment um things like that and so this is really what we're trying to bring it back to so let's take the perspective of uh a wide variety of potential users slash consumers of of shambuya there's there's the you know the nine to five worker who wants to just come back and relax and see what shimbuya is up to or there's the internet nft d-gen who's in their basement playing with nfts all the time and they want actually to have deep involvement just what are all the ways that people can enjoy this platform either with just consuming it or actually participating let's go through the just the full spectrum of how one would engage with shambuya yes so if you're you know tradify bob and there's nothing wrong with that but you just like work a nine to five and you're super tired right you don't have time to be on the internet all day and you come home and want to just consume content uh i do this too then you just go on to um shibuya right now which only has white rabbit um as the main ip but we are on boarding more um very quickly actually and so uh you would just log on to it um you don't even need to connect your wallet or anything uh you can just hit the play button and it will just play up until the point where um there's governance uh happening so for example if we're on chapter five already you can watch the first five chapters uh and be entertained that way if you are you know internet uh chad and you wanna be super duper duper involved since the very beginning um then you would obviously you know hopefully we already have you know found out about this super early and then participated since chapter one but you know even on chapter two then you would go on um and whenever there's a governance you know and the plot happening uh the website will actually just tell you you know whether you're connected to metamask or not if you click on something um where there's you know sort of a plot or a governance vote happening then uh there will be a dialog box that will pop up and be like connect your wallet and then say do you want to mint a producer pass if you don't have any and if you already have producer passes and be like do you want to stake it and you know whichever option that you decide and then after you stake it there will be some confetti that's thrown in the air and they'll be like here you just earned you know x amount of uh white rabbit token and yeah and then you know after that their involvement will look something like you know going to the discords to participate in token gated channels or just yeah it's kind of like a dao where people are just really passionate about discussing the plot of this going forward and you know what their theories are and what things that they want to see being voted on and you know what they want the government's tokens to be used for and um so i would say you know those are sort of like the two extreme levels of involvement there's also the people who are just minting producer passes and who don't stake it um i don't know why you would do that because you should just get some governance tokens anyway um but that's totally fine too some people are just like oh i think these producer passes look cool and it's kind of like collecting you know because because we are we will have a new one for each chapter so you know and we do actually have some things very special planned for people who collect all the producer passes from each chapter so it's just kind of like a stamp book right you're like oh i've collected them all and so those are the sort of different levels of engagement and involvement that we uh are seeing are there any like really grandiose ideas that you guys have when you like daydream about the future of this model as in like i don't know maybe some some short story short form movie maybe not so short uh is become so popular that it starts to air in movie theaters and the the token holders have some sort of like participation in the creation of that value that is now eeking out of the web three world and back into the traditional world i don't know that's just an idea that i had uh like what what some grandiose ideas if this this platform is like maximally successful in like three five ten years you guys thought like ideated around this i think actually maybe one of the really big dreams for us and it seems like you know it is quite possible is for example when the whole thing is finished um we can have like a premier event or maybe multiple in different cities and um so there's like kind of like premier screenings um and also uh we're thinking you know sort of like different ways to do this but either people who have collected the full set or a certain amount of rad token can exchange a premier ticket um that you can attend and things like this and so um you know basically just thinking of anything in the traditional sense that what are sort of like the highlights of you know the evolution of making a film right usually it's like the premiere and you know just like the a premiere is essentially a celebration of um the completion of a film i always like to think of movies as like they're essentially pop-up companies if you think about it it's incredible that you know when movies get made all these people assemble to sort of like work through towards the same goal you know and then at the end of it it gets disassembled but before that they all have sort of a really happy premier event um and it is a very grandiose celebration and so i think that's one of the things that we're really excited about and you know people who are producers or anything are obviously all welcome to the town i'll just add on the level of of credits you know i mean me like both myself and emily we work in in hollywood and on films and video games and usually what happens when you watch credits like the first like the director producers writers actors that's kind of given and then whoever drove them to the set and then whoever catered the food whoever like delivered the mail and and the list goes on and on and on and that at the very end is like actually people who made it like artists and designers and animators and all those other like workers and there's hundreds of them usually and it's just like you watch that and it's like it's obviously an amazing experience especially if you worked on the movie to sit in the theater and like actually experience it and see yourself in the credits so like that's what we're kind of expecting to have the community like if we if in our dreams let's say we have a premiere of white rabbit uh in chinese theater for instance in la or or in some like really nice place where people can go and participate like imagine being a person who voted for the name of the character and made multiple votes that actually shaped the story and you watch it with friends until like yeah i voted for that that's that's that's why this this this went that direction and at the end it's like look that's my name in the credits i'm the executive producer and it's just like it creates a it's create creates a memory that just sticks around forever it's like you're a part of some of a project that that is just fun and you know obviously we cannot predict the outcome of where the right right rabbit's gonna go how successful it's going to be but that's not not the point for making it and for someone who worked in the movies for past 10 years you usually learn that you work on the project and you don't really know if the movie is going to be really successful or not i'll tell you that from my personal experience the film that i was expecting oh my god this is going to be a hit flopped and then the films i was working i was like ah it's just another film just blew up to a point as like i i don't even want to post work because i'm getting mobbed for doing like mobbed in a positive way for for doing that right um so it's definitely like experience building and we have like really grand ideas and daydreaming obviously it's just it's just very difficult to conceive uh like how to get there so we're kind of taking it step by step we're gonna have like the starting point uh we know what we're building right now and what are the immediate steps uh to to continue number one priority right now is continuing the story obviously of the white rabbit and we want to make this as the most excellent experience uh and then just experiment with it and i think those experimentations will also carve different ways in terms of where shibuya itself could go so i think for me like the big idea is i love seeing um platforms giving creators more options and make it easier for creators to actually put their content out there and get get seen i think for now it's like really hard for independent filmmakers to actually get funding go through the whole process in hollywood and get their film made and then premiered so i hope like if shibuya does grow further further into a you know a bigger platform then it'll make it a lot easier um for creators filmmakers to actually produce their their shows yeah like almost like we we kind of also i think we talked about it like becoming almost on ramp for really talented artists that maybe don't have funding to actually start developing anything and we can help them with that so that's that's like the the dream um it's like it's like what with artists who learned craft without going to art schools a lot of them teach after they achieved a certain level as a as a like giveaway to community that helped them to become what they become sort of we're thinking the similar way but again it's it's so far from the the peripheral view that it's very difficult to conceive how to get the earth but there's always a path so i think moving into the uh the metaverse sci-fi web 3 future using this as like a model we kind of see in the current way that hollywood is structured as you just have these like very superstar director names like you know m knight shyamalan or you know insert insert your favorite director here quentin tarantino i think maybe in the metaverse uh the new version of this the web 3 version of this is instead guilds like the shimbuya guild like this shimbuya director except instead of one person it's just this nebulous set of people that are contributors and maybe they have such a strong track record of building really cool stories that they're they are renowned as a guild as a dao as an org for producing and directing really really good shows and i think that would make you guys something like the production company or um uh i don't know like uh warner brothers i think maybe is the right branding i don't know but basically you have like you're decentralizing the director but keeping a relatively centralized production company i think this is the right model but the the final question i think that i think is really important is what are the key things that you guys need to do as sort of like a leadership team of sorts to really make sure that this project is successful like how do you maximally enable your guys's community to make sure that the outcome of this is is you know some something that is actually the right time for this very uh ambitious project and not something that's like five or ten years too soon but what are the key things that you guys understand that the key obstacles that you guys over need to overcome in order to make this a success i think uh the first one is probably distribution but we are having sort of very interesting conversations with potential people that can collaborate with us on that field and the second one i think and always the last um line of it is the content needs to be really good and so uh you know with white rabbit you know we're hoping obviously to make an anime that's very interesting but also right now we are working you know to onboard other sort of content that we find uh at the end of the day you know when you think of all the really really good uh you know tv shows out there and stuff i think really what stands the test of time is good content right like breaking bad has like a cult following game of thrones has a cult following these shows didn't develop a cult following just for no reason it's because the content is good same with squid game you know who knew like they were not you know they didn't have any sort of hollywood connections or anything um they're you know a korean drama that probably most westerners maybe before squid game had never even watched a korean drama before and then it became a worldwide sensation uh why because the content is good and so you know that's something that we really truly firmly believe in as one of our core values and is what we're um laying the foundation for right now and that is our main priority is just to make the content really good and hopefully you know when people see that they will naturally be sort of more interested to get engaged and you know and then on top of that we're making it you know a different type of uh model where it is free for people to watch um but you know if you want to decide what goes on the screens you have to pay same concept and times square should be a crossing and so that's kind of yeah what we're gearing ourselves towards so guys i think people by now are definitely ready to finally go and experience this for themselves so if they want to go watch the first episode where should they go uh they should head over to shibuya.xyz it's a pretty straightforward website there's a play button just hit play and um you know obviously we'll be rolling out chapter two uh fairly soon or fairly soon i mean you know within um the next month or two for sure and um yeah so stay tuned and we also have a twitter that people can follow and then you're there you'll find you know where you can find our discord and also just uh things that we're posting
