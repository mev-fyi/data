we thought that we'd have a lot more time to get proof of stake and you know get out of the energy wasteful proof of work because we wouldn't get this big to where we're actually contributing to the demise of the earth interesting yeah that's that's kind of a take that i hear a lot of early ethereum people have which is no we had no idea it would get to this magnitude and because of that bad things are happening and we feel bad but you can't stop it once it starts this is the first time i've heard that no one expected ethereum to become so gargantuan so quickly and that was actually a big reason as to why it got so complex me personally and i've heard this for other people too i thought we'd have more time to like really hammer out everything but the proof-of-stake transition has a long and sordid history because we want to do our best to get it right timely but more importantly get it right so that it lasts for a long time which is i think a lot of the motivation for ditching the casper proof-of-stake chain that danny finalized as an eip a few years ago
