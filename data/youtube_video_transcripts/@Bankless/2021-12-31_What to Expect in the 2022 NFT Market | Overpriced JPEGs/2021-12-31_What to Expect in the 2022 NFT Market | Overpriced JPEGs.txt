may also be a little spotty and i apologize for that but it is for an exciting reason which is we are bringing on several friends of the podcast for this one for a 2022 nft predictions episode i'm a huge fan of predictions episodes on the podcast that i like when they make predictions about you know the year to come so i figured for our last episode that is what we would do here at overpriced jpegs i have to give a huge thanks to the guests who came on today i'm going to shout y'all out individually in just a minute but broadly speaking thank you so much uh just to give folks a little insight here i had a totally different episode planned for today and at the truly 11th hour it was literally 11 p.m i called an audible and decided that i wanted to do this predictions episode i reached out to some folks who have been on the podcast before who are going to come come on the podcast sometime in 2022 and asked if they would come on and share their predictions for the new year and i think overwhelmingly everyone said yes and made this happen at the very last minute so thank you thank you and also want to thank the team at bank list dave luke you all in particular who will now be editing and putting this episode together also at the last minute thank you for all of the flexibility but i think i'm hopeful that we have a really awesome episode here because just great

comes from william pister he is a writer and an editor over at the bankless team on on the bankless team over with us the bankless team anyhow you get it he is a an editor and a writer with the bankless team he writes our metaversal newsletter which is the nft newsletter that that we put out every week he's fantastic and he could not join me for a recorded call but he did share a prediction with me that i will share with you all now so from william pister he says the big prediction i have for 2022 is that cool cats pets will help catapult cool cats into a top three nft collection behind punks and apes for a time i love this prediction because it's so specific and that's bold you're bold william most people don't make super specific predictions like that because they make like vaguer macro predictions myself included so that's no shade on any of the guests who did that but i love that william's sticking his neck out making a very specific prediction and we will check in next december and see how our predictions did and whether or not this came true we'll see what happens with cool cats if you're a cool cats holder i'm sure you're loving this prediction uh we had klon the artist behind cool cats on for an earlier episode of the show so you can go check that out if you want to learn more about cool cats anyways thank you william that is his prediction cool cat pets catapulting cool cats into a top three nft project okay we have in the studio sort of roy bassine aka zenica33 the person i think i mentioned on every episode of my podcast here to give us his 2022 nft market predictions what do you got zenika whoo i mean 2020 2021 was like a century it like the amount of stuff that happened this year is crazy to try and you know predict ford another year it was tough when you you know you told me yesterday that you were going to record this and if i wanted to give you a lot of time i don't have a lot of predictions but let me think i came up with a list i actually wrote it down um i think gaming nfts like we've sort of seen them explode towards the end of this year 2021. that's just going to continue happening like it's just such a huge industry 100 multi-hundred billion dollar industry and it's just like barely touched the nfc space yet so i mean i don't have a specific prediction in terms of like you know what project is necessarily gonna pop off i just think we're gonna see a lot more from the gaming space like it really it's only just getting started i think do you think it'll be play to earn games or you think it'll run the gamut like non-play to earn games having nfts is part of their yeah i actually i think it'll run the gamut i think at the moment we're going through this phase where everyone is like play to earn is like the hot topic the buzz word basically and everyone is trying for it but it's very difficult to create a sustainable play to earn ecosystem just because if people are earning then that's money coming out of the ecosystem money needs to be put in somehow and just figuring that out it's very very difficult so i think what might happen is that the next the first few months is a lot of people launch these plato and games and then they just we start to see them fizzling out because you know money dries up and then we go to some other sort of system where it's like i've heard people described as play and earn where like earnings isn't the yeah the great um like it isn't the main goal it's just like the game is really fun and there's some way to earn but it's like it's capped it's limited it's not like no one's making a living off these games but it's like you know and i myself have thought of it from the perspective of it might not even need to be playing earn it's just play and not lose or play and own your assets like currently people play games a lot and they pay for these skins but and it's kind of like they're losing the money you know they have no ownership of it but if it's play and own your assets then you could you know sell it and move to another game or whatever it is i think dowels are going to be huge like we've started to see them take off a bit more in 2021 like it was sort of like a phase a few months ago which is still going now where people say hey we're going to launch a project with a dow you know we're going to now we're seeing these air drops you know sos dow gas down like people are dropping and the dows still haven't really been fully fleshed out in terms of like a legal framework and just like using them to their full potential i think that there are a few that are doing really well but like we're going to see a lot more take off this might even be like 2023 2024 but i think we're going to see them really take off starting from 2022. what do you think are some of the dows right now that are more fully reaching the dow potential that you think others will will start to aspire to we've so like you've you've got a couple of different approaches there's like the investment type dowels like flamingo which are you know they're small capped i think at 99 members just because of uh regulation and stuff and they're doing really well but it's sort of it's limited because of the number of members on the other hand you have things like olympus dow which is you know the ohm coin this massive protocol d5 protocol that's now like consuming the the defy space um i think that's doing a really good job of you know it's on chain it's governance it's decentralized so yeah i mean those are two examples of dows that i think are doing really well i think i could probably name two dozen of that aren't doing well but i don't want to name and shame perhaps honestly constitution dao really just spurred on a lot of just innovation and like ideas people were like hey this this can work like look at what happened they've raised this much money and mobilized people to raise 40 million in exactly yeah it was i think five days and you know it wasn't it could be done better it wasn't like the most well organized but you know they did a lot in just a short amount of time imagine if you spend a few months planning and then you know really flesh something out it's the potential is you know enormous dow's that was my second prediction another thing that i think we're going to see more of which we're only starting to see a bit more of now is like ai nfts like artificial intelligence related nfts we've seen ai art sort of take off a bit this year like eponymous avastars also did uh did like they did an ai avastar who could like convert yeah yeah yeah yes yeah yeah that i think that's with um alithea which is another uh ai protocol it's a company they've actually been around for like two years but what they're doing is they want to bring your nfts to life so they're calling them infts where like you train this pod with an artificial intelligence personality and then you can infuse your nfts with that and just again have a conversation with an avistar with a board 8 with a you know cool cat or whatever one more well i have two more things but great one was just added right before this which was um vr i think we were just chatting because i got two well i got an oculus and my partner rachel got an oculus for christmas well we got yeah and we've just been having so much fun exploring and being in this like virtual reality world it's just it's really mind-blowing and you can't comprehend it i think unless you've tried it and experienced it for yourself uh and we're gonna see i think 2022 might be too early for that to really go mainstream and explode uh but i think more projects are sort of maybe ar augmented reality is what we're going to really see take place like you bring your nfts to life not necessarily in vr because that's probably technologically a little more challenging but um everyone has a smartphone basically you can download an app and then augment reality with your nfts and i think we're going to see more of that so that's going to be i'd say towards the end of 2022 we're going to see like we'll go through a phase of ar nfts like like we go through dowels and like we went through um i don't know yield tokens and and loot derivatives and you know how this phase is in the nft space yeah one of the phases is going to be ar we talked to parallel i talked to parallel a couple weeks ago the project and they do like ar pack reveals and they're they're ramping that up so i i think you're right on that i think we'll start seeing a lot more uh incorporation with ar potentially into you know reveals or or things of that nature the the meta presentation that mark zuckerberg put on yeah mapped very closely to what it is like to yeah that's surprising because it's you know oculus facebook etc it's the same company it surprised me though because i kind of saw that presentation and i did think that he was painting a future picture i did not realize that these oculuses were so good that it sort of felt like that right now and that's what's really going to try them and i was asking you and maybe it's worth you articulating maybe why they haven't gotten bigger up to this point why they aren't mainstream yet if they're sort of that cool i thought i think you had some interesting insights on that yeah i mean one might be the price i mean it was 500 for a set uh i think the other one is probably a bigger issue it's just like at least so far it's not the most like comfortable experience it's not like it's still it's a big it's a clunky headset you know it's heavy on your head after like 45 minutes to an hour basically i like i got to take it off gotta take a break my head hurts it's just like a little blurry sometimes it's finicky to get it to look right so it's not it's not there yet so in terms of user experience but and i think that's probably the thing holding it back like price and usability taking uh another direction in terms of like mental health therapy i think in the vr is something that could be so powerful because it can be difficult for a lot of people to go to a therapist it can be difficult to face their fears like things like that but doing it knowing like that you're in a safe space you're in your house at home wherever you are feeling comfortable but you could either a be talking to a therapist or just going through something like i'm severely arachnophobic i hate spiders i wouldn't like and i know that one of the best ways to get over it is like immersion therapy like get accustomed to being around spiders but i've just never wanted to do that but i i can imagine being in like a vr space where like spiders are crawling on me i'm freaking out a bit but like in my head i know this is not real and then i just get more and more used to it so yeah i mean honestly the potential is enormous and and we're going to see them explode eventually maybe not 2022 though amazing okay final prediction you said you had one more i did have one more it's it's all right it's generative art i think it's going to like see another resurgence it's yeah yeah i mean i think we've seen them seen generator off like explode in 2021 like it really took off obviously art blocks had a crazy year and then we in the last few months we've seen a lot of like you can call them competitors or just other options for generative art between uh gen dot art i think uh proof released to their own platform um and on the taizos network there's fx hash which is getting a ton of attention and that's awesome and collectors and creators are loving it so i think that it's just such a perfect use case of blockchain technology and and art that i think we really are still just at the very early stages of it so it's gonna be a huge year for generative art uh i don't know specifically what it looks like like i don't know if the artbox market is gonna pop off again i don't know if all the attention is gonna shift to fx hash or something but i i don't think generative art is going anywhere and i think we're just at the beginning so i think what we've seen in 2021 is just like a tiny percentage of what we're gonna see in the next decade and it's gonna you know just 2022 is going to be a big year for generative art again do you have any macro level predictions of like nfts will do well or poorly in in 2022. good question in terms of predictions i should have thought about the whole market i don't know no pressure yeah no i think that because we're still so early i mean we all love to see how early we are and that's true but that doesn't mean that all the projects and nf that exist today are going to be worth more in the future like most of them are not but i do think that the market is going to be good and healthy in 2022 like i i don't i mean i'm gonna i may end up eating my words but i don't foresee like an eight-month bear market where it's just like doom and gloom and you know short of like some catastrophic regulatory issue i just think that there's so many new people entering the space still and it's just the perfect hot spot of like it's not just crypto and tech and finance it's art and it's culture and it's music and it's celebrity and it's just movies and brands and fashion and it's literally everything and everyone is starting to get involved and like testing like these big companies and now testing the waters and getting involved and they're going to want to be more involved celebrities are getting involved and and just it really is just taking the world by storm just slowly like it seems fast if you're in the middle of it but from the outside there's still a lot of people who don't know what entities are don't understand what entities are or know and understand and hate them like they have their reasons against it and i think it's just going to take time as people slowly come around to it and get educated and informed more and more people will come to see what you and i and most of the listeners i presume see that this is really revolutionary and like life-changing just it's just a game-changer changer on so many different levels so i don't really foresee the market during poorly i think nfts are going to have another another great year in 2022 um but that doesn't mean that the collections that exist now will do well in 2022. most some of them will most of them will not yeah i think you're looking at it of course very smartly which is you were kind of looking your initial predictions were looking by sector so you're saying i think gaming is going to do very well i think vr is going to do very well you know and i think generative artworks very well and i totally agree with all of that my prediction has been that we will have a few month period where there's like total panic probably sometime around after like eth 2.0 comes out and maybe like the coinbase marketplace hasn't created the flood of pfp buyers that people are expecting and i think that the kind of the noisy part of the market and it'll be sort of a pfp noisy part of the market that'll be freaking out but that the underlying fundamentals whether it be within art or within gaming will continue to chug along and just get better and better so it it won't be cause for for macro concern but i do think we'll have a few month period of just panic and collapse in certain project prices i think that we haven't really seen a true blow off top and collapse yet and so i'm probably going to walk back my prediction now about it being not a bear market in 2022 i think what we're going to see is um as d5 and nfts integrate more and as protocols emerge where just retail investors can take out loans against their nfts on a really easy level like currently you can do it on things like uh nft phi and and stata where it's like peer to peer lending where someone makes you an offer you say all right i will you i'll put my nft and you put your ethe in escrow uh i'll give you you know 20 for you know 30 days etc and that's done and then you pay gas for the transaction it's very clunky it doesn't work and tons of people still use it and and there's this thing everyone in the nft space knows it's like juggling liquidity like there's so many projects that we all think are amazing and cool and we're like hey i want to get in that hey that looks cheap i want to mint that that looks cool i i need these nfps we no one has like no one has infinite money like it's just like even the biggest whales still have liquidity issues um because they're like well all right i have 100 bot apes but i want 300 cool cuts you know whatever it is there's always some sort of thing like that and so having the ability to collateralize and take loans out of your nfts people are going to flock to it and like these these platforms are coming i know that i know several that are in the works and like you know a couple of months ago they were say six to eight months away so sometime in 2022 i think we're going to see them people are going to flock to them they're going to take out liquidity against their um existing nfts that they think are blue chips and like they're fine and then they're going to go and buy and invest irresponsibly you know and gamble which is sad and unfortunate but people will always do that um some of them will do it and make lots of money and it'll be great for them but eventually people will start getting wrecked as soon as the market starts to turn oh yeah just like in regular crypto it's like this liquidity just just everyone's just going to get liquidated and cr like it's just going to be chaos like we're going to see this blow off top when people can extract liquidity and then we're going to see this collapse like we haven't seen yet in the market i think that's a a really interesting point because i think we talk about this when you look at the cryptocurrencies right i think sometimes when you see huge bitcoin sell-offs or huge eat sell-offs and things it's like it's the leverage getting flushed out of the system and we haven't at least talked about it or i guess really seen it in the nft world because you haven't been over leveraged using nfts in the past what you're describing is basically that right like a newfound ability to get over leveraged using nfts and that's going to create you know bus cycles that that we haven't really seen thus far along the lines of what we've occasionally seen with bitcoin when it goes from 60 to 30k you know feel seemingly overnight yeah i'm gonna say somewhat famously but that's way too self-aggrandizing but i did last year i was on the yankspeaks podcast in december looking into 2021 and predicted that we would have that robin hood would cause a financial crisis which if you remember like two months later a month and a half later you had the melvin capital gamestop situation happen and i got a lot of credit on twitter people being like oh my god but it was because i saw i'd for a variety of reasons i've been looking into robin hood and other people were too certainly and and just seeing how easy they were making it for folks to options trade or to trade on margin to these retail investors that were getting these stimulus checks and just like clearly like trading on margin in ways that they couldn't afford and i was like this is terrifying and robin hood is making it way too kind of easy to leverage yourself and and you know for young people and i was saying myself included like i don't think of myself as a sophisticated stock investor right like i shouldn't be trading on margin you know it it played out slightly differently with the gamestop melvin capital situation but it was sort of what i was describing right and so i i'm i i tend to be doomsday about these things and i think d5 yeah for such a terrifying crash at some point i don't know if it'll be 2022 but when i look at how starting to get interconnected these protocols are or these stable coins and the way they're you know you have you have stable you have stable coins that are backed by other stable coins who are backed by chinese commercial paper and it it just feels like this whole industry is so uh it's getting so deeply entwined that you know when one domino falls you'll start to see others implode with it yeah it's going to be a crazy year like no matter what it's hard to imagine and not just being absolutely insane final question any thoughts or predictions on the coinbase marketplace what that will be what the effects will be i don't think it will be the openc killer that people think it's going to be i'll just say that i do know that there are other marketplaces coming out that might be that so that's my diplomatic way of answering and not answering it um i think it'll be great i think it'll be really great for for newcomers and for maybe a select few projects but i think so many of us have gotten accustomed to using openc and just like searching through any project and just having it listed and i don't think the coinbase marketplace would be quite like that experience and i think people will be and i hope i'm wrong but i think people will be a little disappointed with it but it's sort of kind of they have to do things a certain way because they're a republican this is company and all this kind of other stuff um and yeah i i don't know exactly what it will look like but i don't think i think people have expectations that can't possibly be met basically one more prediction sorry i think uh we're going to see like marketplaces that segment into like niches so we've already seen that with art like we've got one of one art and stuff like that we've got foundation we've got super rare we've got generative art on fx hash and art blocks um i i think we're going to see sort of marketplaces come out that are just for gaming nfts or just for ai nfts or just for you know just niches and then they'll just do what they like they'll do their niche better and that's going to be another way that the market chips away at this monopoly that opens open c has oh i didn't even mention layer two like layer twos are gonna be huge in 2022 so that's another prediction like there's just a lot that's happening in in the nft and crypto space but i think uh yeah layer two adoption and like the bridges back and forth from them will just become more user-friendly and when that happens more projects will launch on them gas fees on earth will potentially go down and it'll just be like more affordable for newcomers to enter because currently eth mainnet not very affordable for welcoming for newcomers and like solana tazos cardano whatever like the user experience isn't quite there they don't have the great apps they don't have the great marketplaces so it's just layer two's on ether i think is is gonna be big next year as well perfect next up we have jean-paul farage head of community and partnerships at influence and a member of the bankless inner circle here at bankless with his predictions on gaming and nft marketplaces in 2022. yeah um first prediction is going to be that aaa gaming studios start to implement nfts into their games uh in a bigger way i think this is probably going to be towards the end of 2022 but i think it's going to make some some big splashes in in the gaming community and then the second one about nft marketplaces is that openc will have a rival uh whether or not it's coinbase we're not sure yet why would it be coinbase why wouldn't it be coinbase yeah um i think uh the crypto community really wants to have coinbase prove that it's going to be uh like non-custodial decentralized um nft platform so you can truly own your assets uh if it's not that then i think we're still waiting on something that's more decentralized that people can really feel like there's no one controlling their assets any other contenders that you see out there other than coinbase or this will be a yet to be seen contender that will come into the space in 2022. yeah i don't think there's anything out there that i am aware of right now that has the potential to really uh i'll call it flip coinbase uh which would be a crazy feat but that's my crazy prediction for 2022 is that we'll have a new uh challenger in the ring and what defines a aaa game studio when you say you've got these triple a game studios that are going to start incorporating nfts say a little more on that yeah so aaa gaming studios traditionally have really really big budgets for their games they work with uh very well-known publishers and they spend like upwards to 50 of their budget on marketing so it's gonna be like a major game that's going to start having nfts in it for the first time is that the prediction yeah i think we're both we're gonna see both a new game that has nfts implemented into it and then we're also going to see i think a uh existing game like call of duty or something along that lines that implements nfts as well so you said you had a couple other ideas what are your other ideas yeah so i think that we're gonna see like um billions upon billions of dollars upwards to like 50 to 100 billion dollars of nfts being on layer twos how much how many nfts or how much value is currently on layer 2 do you know it's a wildly like changing number every week but they're it's it's for a lot of different things so like there's there's you know decentralized exchanges there's swapping mechanisms there's a lot of money flowing through those um products a lot of it has to do with like lending right now uh not a lot of like nfts because um you know openc right now hasn't implemented a lot of these layer twos onto their platform so like starknet zk sync all these things are not on openc yet which makes it difficult for people to really want to be um like on like selling a a an ft on that platform because why why would you do that right now if no one has access to actually purchasing it i think immutablex has plans to incorporate with openc yeah i don't know when it's happening i know openc and imx have both said like yeah it's happening but i'm not sure when it is right now um imx is built on starkx not stark net so i'm curious to see if they're porting over to starknet but there will also likely be another well there definitely is another nft like trading platform that is being built on starknet as well um i don't know about zk sync just because of the game that i work on uh we're working with startnet cool what else you got okay so i think we're going to have uh this is a scary one but i think we're gonna have like quite a few months of like our nft's dead talk um that's for sure like if if i have to pick one of my predictions that i think is gonna happen i think we might have a scare time in 2022 of like oh no or is this all just a scam like and and it's not because like the true power of nfts is incredible it's not just images or jpegs they're not just overpriced [Laughter] they're they're incredibly complex um you know token systems that can be linked to real-world assets like uh houses uh mortgages uh a lot of things so that's another prediction that leads me to my next one is that we're going in 2022 to start seeing traditional assets being uh put onto blockchain utilizing nfts so uh one that i always like to use because it's pretty easy to grasp is like the deed to your house or your mortgage or something like that is going to be set up through blockchain and and then you will be able to have uh you know like escrow or something there's really no need for escrow if you have a smart contract that says if you have money in x account you can buy a house worth x amount and and like you can do that all through blockchain and so i think nfts will be utilized in in that flow um it's probably going to be late 2022 and this could be something that's like i'm five years off but i'm hopeful i'm crossing my fingers 20 22 on that on your point about we're gonna have is our nft's dead talks in 2022 i really agree with that i'm betting it's like may june july i feel like it's gonna be like may through the summer is the time period on that what is your guess on the time frame yeah i've been i've actually been thinking a lot about this of like and this isn't for all nfts but this is for like the pfp 10 000 like quick sell like let's make some money type nfts i i think it's going to be sooner than that i think it's really going to be like april through like june and you're like a month ahead of my prediction yeah and the only reason i think that is that like the ethereum two merge is happening hopefully in june july and and so i think we're going to see a lull of some sort and in nfts because my prediction is that the price of ethereum is going to just like be very volatile both up and down in in uh the coming months and because of that usually when ethereum is wild nfts are like oh god i don't know what to do like so it's so funny we have the exact same reasoning but i guess i'm now behind on the eth timeline because i thought they were shooting for like april may for that so my guess was april may eth2 happens i think there's probably a run-up in the price of eth whatever in the months ahead after after eth2 comes out price tanks and kind of remains volatile and so nfts also tank as a result of that plus i think with coinbase marketplace launching again i think in the early half of the year is their goal i think there'll be some like initial immediate excitement and then i don't think it'll like totally move the needle on the pfp market the way some people hope or expect like i don't think we suddenly now have like everybody and their mother using pfps instead of their regular face and i think when that reality sets in for people that causes a lull and i was thinking those those factors conflating or you know converging i think we see a total panic in nfts so it felt like it would be like may june but if eth2 isn't now happening until later in the summer then maybe that messes with my timeline you also have in theory student loan payments uh needing to be made again in i think it's may now they just pushed it back from june to may they very well might push it again but i think student loan payments coming back into effect will actually hurt the crypto market yeah i will see there's so many different meta factors that could affect our our market that like you have to pay attention to but you also have to ignore at the same time like it's it's so a weird world um it's it's like okay so if i were a marketing genius with coinbase um i would and i want everyone and their grandmother to have a pfp link to their twitter to their reddit these are all things that are happening on twitter reddit like all these platforms instagram is thinking about you know utilizing pfps and and so like there is a lot of um potential there but we also have to realize like if you go outside the crypto market and you tell someone like oh you can pay for an overpriced jpeg and use that as your profile picture and that's yours like most people were like why don't i just put a picture of my face like they they like i don't have a i don't have an nft as my pfp i want to use me i like being very and i want my own fan face on there like i think people in the in the nft space potentially do seriously underestimate the desire that will ever exist among people to use an image that's not them like yeah i don't think that's going to be as widespread as some people maybe think yeah and that's why like gaming for me is such a big thing um there's 2.7 billion gamers in this world that play a game like almost every day and so when you think about that those are the type of people who like to take on the roles of like someone else they like to pretend to be some other character the role-playing aspect of like this is my person in the game that i play those people are really drawn i think to the idea of having an avatar that is different than what they look like but for a large majority of the world they're not that interested in that but you know with 2.7 billion gamers and then you have like what i would consider the streetwear folk you know like the people who are into like the cool the underground like these are all people that are going to be interested in this so there's a lot a lot of hype but i think to successfully pull this off for like coinbase and and to have pfps be a big part of the nft world in long term i you're gonna need um free like literally free nfts that people can like get and it's like from their favorite brand or something like that yeah and or it's your beyonce concert ticket and you get to be like uh cool i went to beyonce's concert and it's a picture of bay or whatever exactly like if if coinbase could partner with like ticketmaster or something like that and every concert ticket that you bought like you got automatically sent a digital nft into your wallet uh of the concert that you went to like that would just be like really really cool yeah and you know the if you think about like and i'm i'm a total concert head and my dad and like was he lived uh near or in san francisco during like the time in which like the fillmore was super big and like every famous artist ever went through there and he went to every concert like all the time and his collection of fillmore tickets and everything were like incredible and then one day they were moving and in the middle of summer they put their dresser out with all of the tickets that he had had for years and years like hundreds of tickets it rained like for 30 minutes and it destroyed all of them and like to this day if you say that to him there will be a tear in his like he will cry my dad does not cry like ever but like when you say his fillmore handbills are all gone like he wants to punch a wall and cry in a corner for a long time so like the power of having an nft that is truly you know like people have to realize that nfts yes they're not physical but they are tokenized and therefore yours and and provable that like they are yours um would mean a lot because like all these artworks that were done uh by the fillmore handbills and all these tickets like they're gone for my dad but if they if like they go into the digital realm and you have these same little artworks and tickets and things like that and you can collect them and maybe there's a cool site to view them then like that like i'm i'm already getting like giddy i want to go to like red rocks and collect their stuff and i'd like i i i could talk all day long about this for sure so then your your other idea around deeds housing deeds being put on blockchain i think there's a there's a couple elements to that i think we could totally see that i think our legal infrastructure isn't really caught up to recognize that in a way that actually meaningfully improves the experience of buying or selling a house via blockchain so you're talking about you don't need to put money in escrow if you have some sort of smart contract where the money lives and there's it's coded to automatically be released if xyz happens that's what you're describing in your escrow example correct is like hey i put a million dollars into this smart contract and the smart contract is authorized to automatically release those funds to another smart contract if xyz happens we make this deal the money goes through right yeah exactly it's it's a pretty complex thing that needs um we need uh regulation clarity uh in the crypto market which like i come to this question all the time it's like when is it gonna happen because it's not a question of if it's just when like when are we going to get like clarity and and i think what we've seen in the past with regulation in crypto is like it comes out of the gate like pretty terrible like they don't have any idea and then that recognition yeah like they they don't understand this technology so it's hard for them to regulate and so we have to do a lot of work to educate them um but that means like the first pass on all these laws because they'll be like oh crypto we can get tax money from it and so they're just like trying to figure out how to get money from us and and that's fine like but they need to figure out a way to not stifle innovation and and uh there's a lot of existing uh you know like traditional institutions like the the banking industry the mortgage lending industry which is very much tied to traditional finance and things like that that don't want to give up that like they don't want to give up their ability to like lend out mortgages or anything or even get like a small percentage of that taken away from them but it's coming it's just when and and what kind of regulation we're gonna get and so that's another prediction for 2022 is i think regulation around crypto while it might not go into effect there's going to be a lot of discussion on crypto regulation and nfts will be a part of that awesome next up we have jeremy jensen and tempo co-founders of the deadheads project with their 2022 nft slash crypto predictions take it away jeremy you want to kick us off uh yeah so next year i predict the wave will swap into quality which is a common prediction but i think when we go back in this past year and think about the fundamentals that we saw it was really not that many pfp projects until board apes we saw bastard punks v2 which not a lot of people remember uh we saw hash masks um but nothing really kicked off that pfp revolution until board apes but i don't know how sustainable that is given how great nft technology is so my predictions for 2022 is true ip and great use of the tech will triumph love it move away from superficial pfps into projects that are building on or utilizing blockchain fundamentals is that it yeah yeah you're either using this at the medium properly as an artist like pac uh not or you're using the medium property as a gaming company like you know zed or whatnot or or you're building great ip um like you know cool cats might be doing now like deadheads i don't know just thinking of a project just thinking of uh just spitballing here uh [Music] exactly and i yeah so i think people investing the right things the medium or the ip are really the they're gonna be the movement in 2022. tempo what do you got i i 100 agree and i think i think that's one of the issues in the space right now with and it's such a big barrier to entry for a lot of newcomers and it's why a lot of a lot of people are calling um calling nfts like scams and money laundering and and all these other names that are kind of causing them not to enter the space i think it's just because it's it's a bunch of kind of shitty art that doesn't really have much utility it doesn't really make a lot of sense to anyone that's not deep inside of the nft world or just flipping without any real belief because whenever i tell my friends about deadheads and they might have some kind of a predilection against um against nfts just from what they've heard but whenever i describe deadheads and how the ip works and how we're just we're brand leveraging the technology of nfts to decentralize ip it makes so much more sense then and so i think as we move away from these sort of pfp mimi type projects that don't really make a lot of sense and we move towards projects that have real ip and real use cases for the technology i think we're going to see a massive next wave of people coming into space and i think everyone's going to be singing a little bit of a different tune about nfts as they start to finally understand why it's so powerful and why it's so revolutionary above just like a picture of a cat that is worth you know 300 000 or you know you have it and you think that will start that new wave will kick off in 2022. that new wave will kick off at some point in 2022 and i think with that we're gonna start seeing like as sort of the perception of nft's change we're gonna see a lot of really really big names start to enter the space one of the biggest issues right now with with these big names like mr beast for example entering the space is that probably 95 of his followers would just absolutely hate it and make fun of it and say that he's just being a cash grabber when in reality he's he's he sees the potential in the technology and is probably just waiting for waiting for the perception of nfgs to shift a little bit in at least the general public's size um so i think with that it's just going to be an absolute explosion of brands big influencers um and projects that are that are a lot higher quality entering the space and i think it's just going to cause sort of like a secondary nft boom at some point during the year i don't know exactly when it's going to be but i think it'll be yeah at some point 2022 is my guess do you think there is what we would all probably consider a major pfp project right now or a major project right now because all of these pfp projects are claiming that ultimately they're going to vip or whatever that we will see fall that will that would shock people in 2022. i do if i may love it the people won't the holders won't i won't love it when it turns out to be one of the projects that i hold i think just like the same way things go up based on price action and fever pitch when they fall that same level of fever pitch seems to follow as evidenced by bitcoin or any asset that's pumped very quickly over a short period of time the same energy that goes in when they go up can occur when they go down um and so i think as the if the pfp wave were to fall down a little bit we'll see the board apr club um have a 50 or greater drop uh if the macros no longer favorite that's a bold one i didn't even ask you to name a specific project but that definitely ups the annie here all right board apes are coming for us after this awesome i may have made a huge mistake we also share them and i'm in them and i went to all the events and i like them a lot i just think right now they have maximum good news cycle it's it's hard to imagine anything better for them but it always seems to happen so you know love it that wouldn't be anything new in the space like punks just had a more than 50 percent drop and and there was a flipping apes flipped punks for yeah a couple of times for apes do seem to have more of a builder community though their community seems to be a little bit more out there shilling the punks are have a quieter confidence 100 100 yeah awesome okay thank you guys so much on juno is your new crypto enabled financial services company on juno lets you get your direct

deadfellows nft project and our very first guest on overpriced jpegs so you have a very special place in my heart and i think in some of the listener hearts so thank you for being back here and i cannot wait to hear your 2022 nft crypto in general market predictions what do you have betty thank you thank you for having me back first of all um i love your podcast um it was a real joy to be on on here and chatting to you but also um listening to your subsequent episodes i really love what you're doing and you as a person so just say that first um my nft predictions are i feel like 2021 has been the year that we've seen all of these initial uh you know like the first wave of well i guess second wave we could call it but the first wave of nft projects as we know it you know like as they have started and we've seen them solidify themselves their communities and you know we've developed a real culture and i think that 2022 is going to bounce off of that and see those projects um expand and explore into new directions and to really apply that culture and you know and that community and and the experience and all of those things into new endeavors and to really discover new applications for what we're doing because i think we're all very much focused as as an industry on the art which is because obviously it's been the first application of of nft technology but um i think that as we move into next year we're going to see everyone really develop themselves into other avenues as well and explore the utility side of things um in a more fleshed out way which is exciting to me because it's something that uh we're gonna be doing with dead fellas as well you know and i speak to other founders and i know that they're exploring so many exciting things too i also think that well this is a hope more than a prediction but it's a prediction because i trust that the nft community knows what's up um i think that as mass adoption starts to um spread and we see more of these big players from the corporate world join i hope to see a bit of a restructure in how their relationships are with their consumers so i hope that they shift things to a more bilateral relationship so you know as we have in the nft community where it's more of a co-creation and a mutual beneficial relationship between the creator and the consumer it's you know those lines are blurred um i hope that we start to see that spread into the corporate world you know you were outspoken when nike bought artifact i think you you had a very nice nuanced take which is you know you don't always find on twitter saying like hey i'm reserving full judgment here to see how it plays out but i would have loved if if nike had instead formed some sort of collaborative agreement with with artifact instead of just subsuming them entirely is that sort of what you're talking about like ways to kind of maintain the web 3 ethos either through just doing collaborations with corporations or in a case where a big brand like nike does take over artifact they allow artifact to maintain the web 3 sort of more decentralized listen to your community approach would that be an example of what you're hoping and in this case predicting to see in 2022 yeah look i don't so that that take is is it was nuanced because i just don't have i don't like to put out super strong opinions on things when i don't have all of the information and with that situation i just didn't have enough information to have um you know a real commitment to uh to either side of the of the spectrum there in in terms of an opinion but um for me it feels like you know that sort of thing is an opportunity for a company like them to to learn from what has been built and the way we're doing things here and it is so mutually beneficial and it is what the masses are going to be looking for in companies moving forward whether or not it's got anything to do with nfts i think that for a long time people are you know we're over it it's it's being used as uh people to sell to it's like the value thing so what value can i give rather than what value can i extract from a person um how can we benefit mutually i think that those companies are going to be looking at that and hopefully taking that on board i have spoken to quite a few executives in in you know large companies in the corporate world um especially through linkedin um there's a lot of interest there and people trying to learn and i do see there's there is a lot of interest so i'm hoping that that trickles through and has a real impact in terms of um nike and artifact really my concern was the holders of that collection didn't know fully what they were buying into if you know what i mean i think you know whether whether that's a good thing or a bad thing isn't isn't mine to say because it could be an amazing thing you know we don't know and maybe it is now but i think those lessons are there to be learned and it is up to us as a community um to question to continually question because we are moving this forward together you know it's not the company's moving this forward it's us and we have the power together collectively um to sway things so demand more from corporations who are entering the space in terms of you have to play by our rules which is create a community give value back to that community think about your customers which is really what you probably should have been doing all along right first and how you can create value for them rather than just how do i get them to spend more money in a way that benefits me that's that's at the heart of what you're saying it sounds like yeah it is and we see this so there's been um you know people enter the space like you've you've seen um time and adidas and you know even um arizona iced tea um has been around in the space buying up nfts for a long time and just being involved you know they're on twitter spaces and stuff um and it's they're giving value and they're working with people that are already here and yeah that it's a different relationship it's a it's a more bilateral relationship but an equal playing field whereas and that you know they're focused on inserting value into the space as well to what level i don't know because i again don't have all the information but then you see other players like we saw pepsi and and that join and it was it just felt like a really rushed i'm sure you saw that that chat that they had it was like pepsi and meta and who else yeah it was funny pepsi like we see like pepsi and meta saying we're all gonna make it it's like guys you made it you're the reason everyone else didn't make it you know it was like it made me feel so sick to say that um but i think the general reaction from the community at large was the same deep reaction that i had was deeply cringe watching meta respond to that oh my god i want to find a better word even than cringe but it because there was an element of like you know it's like your parents trying to be use like hip lingo you know but then it feels more diabolical it was totally bad it was totally that because it felt sinister because it was like you know these these are the sorts of giants that have not provided enough opportunity or done enough in the world to to make things equal into that whole analogy of there's no seat at the table for people and so we have created our own table and then all of a sudden they're coming over to our table like hey guys lfg [Laughter] no yeah it's more than just a couple catchphrases uh i i i you know i know some people who are helping to to advise pepsi and so i want to be sympathetic to them i know i think pepsi is trying to you know work their way through the space and and before they launch i think sometimes but definitely there were moments that missed the mark in this attempted launch and that's the point like i don't deny the fact that we are going to need large companies like that i think personally my take for this space to grow in a way that allows mass adoption and that sort of thing but we need to be critical of how those companies are entering into the space and if mistakes are made they need to be made aware of those mistakes so that we can remedy them and really create something of value that's true to the space and continues to develop um to have a real impact that you know we all have that vision of well and that's exactly i think what you're you're calling for here right which is okay you know pepsi had a weird introduction to the community and so let's call them out you know you don't have to be a total jerk about it right but say like hey this is how let's hold them to a higher standards that when they come back for round two they've put in the legwork in advance of really getting to know the community and adding value to the community before uh before trying to extract from the community that's yeah that's absolutely it and looking at people that are doing it well you know like i think just taking a seat back and realizing that you can't just enter into a space like this and you know see it as a money making thing i don't know or i'm not sure again the intentions because i'm i don't have enough information to have a definitive opinion on it but i know that entering into the space without fully embracing the ethos is not going to be good for anyone because it is going to dilute it over time if we continue to allow that to happen without fully calling it out so yeah i hope that as because it's going to happen more this year or this you know this next year i hope that we're able to as a community come together and um yeah hold people to a certain standard i think awesome i hope it's true it's your prediction because we're going to be optimists going into 2022. we're going to hope that this time will be different yeah yeah and and i believe it too i think there's any new technology comes with good and comes with bad uh but i think it's great to kind of focus on the good and i think there's a lot of of good principles that web 3 has today that hopefully we maintain as the space grows and we totally got new people we're making this all up as we go along as well at the end of the day aren't we like who knows uh the actual vision of this we're all kind of um exploring it at the front like we don't know what things are going to look like so yeah it's interesting it's going to be cool to see things unfold i think absolutely well thank you so much betty thanks for coming back i'm sure we'll i'd love to do a full conversation again in the future we'll also check back in this time next year see how we all did with predictions we can look back at what corporate action happened over the year prior [Laughter] what cringe conversations twitter exchanges yeah yeah exactly uh and thanks as always it's always such a pleasure to talk to you and and i appreciate you making the time during the holiday and given our wild time zones that was another highlight of yours on twitter i thought was uh i am once again asking for a universal nft time zone i think we can all relate to that yeah all right well thank you for having me on it was nice to chat to you carly as usual all right talk to you soon max lavelle welcome back to the pod return of the mac and on your birthday no less so happy holidays happy birthday thanks for being here and uh you are we talked about this last time you were here sort of notoriously good at predictions so here i am teeing you up setting expectations way too high hit me with your 2022 nft crypto industry market predictions here's what i think i think that nfts are here to stay i think the nfds are part of identity i think the nfts need to change i don't think that nfts as they are are palatable to most people i think they're really fun and really neat and really exciting i think they are a permanent ink with which we are writing the future but i think that they are going to evolve so they need to become more accessible i'm not going to tell you how i'm not going to tell you which blockchain you're going to use or which l2 solution or the ethereum's going to figure out i have no idea i'm not like smart enough technically definitely not to know which path is the future but that it must be better uh i know and that it will be better i believe uh i think that the degenerate gambling rush that you get from minting most nfts will not become the predominant story of how nfts are acquired uh i don't i don't necessarily think it will go away there is this like rush of people being foolish uh and some of them having a great time and a bunch of them not having a good time at all uh when it's all said and done when you kind of wake up and look around again like that's cool if that's what you're here for and some people aren't and all power to you uh but i don't think that's what everybody wants and again i think nfts are going to go mainstream i think these are going to become part of a digital identity i think that most people are going to be digital lives uh it's just for them to become that they must evolve from where they are and that means a different form of accessibility uh more readily form of accessibility where you don't have to have a deep expertise or be willing to gamble excessively in order to find value in these entities uh so to be honest i was talking to one of the guys on my team like right before you called and i was like you know what i want to try doing so it's my prediction like we're going to do this i think other people because things don't work so well i wanted god i'm going to regret saying this but i want to do an nft where we permanently guarantee we will buy back the nft for the floor price for the for the minting price for all time you can just come back and we'll we'll write that in the smart contract like we you don't have to trust me that this is the blockchain trust smart contract because because everybody else is making nfts is doing a single project if that project makes a bunch of money they win and they're rich and like they live happily reference they fail then we just work out they go away we're a business we're going to be here for a long time we can afford to run this kind of experiment and i this is this i'm glad that we're doing this call to be honest because i've been struggling over the holidays with like i need to twist our business a little bit it's not quite right i need to twist the shape it's close the gear is almost fitting into the machine but it's not quite i think that's a and guaranteed floor nfts yeah yeah totally we can do that and so why not if you believe in the project why not again i'm going to regret this i think it's awesome the real power of nfts is inaccessible because of this  circus show distraction which is the like highly liquid highly fun almost gambling i'm not calling it gambling almost gambling that most people are doing on middays uh so when that fades away and and what i mean yeah what i mean by accessibility is somebody sees something that they like and they're like oh i would like to buy that because that looks important i want to say that that represents me i want to attach my sense of self my identity to ownership of that interesting piece of artwork and i can afford to do that because i know that if i need my rent in three months i could sell this back to people who made it i know that there's like not a gambler's madness the world does not need more gambling i love gambling to be clear i'm a degenerate gambler i will bet on which fly is going to leave the wall first i don't get i just like whatever i'll gamble on it i think it's fun but the world doesn't need more gambling the world doesn't like that's not what the world i'm not helping the world but i don't think we're i don't think i'm building gambling things i sure shouldn't want to be i want to build communities and art that people love and identify with and stand by and define themselves by and when we have accessibility to that then we have the future of nfts and i think we can get there when you look at the most popular nfts at the end of 2022 and you say is this a collectible art or a gaming uh piece it would be very difficult to put it in one of those circles and not the other the venn diagram is becoming a circle the venn diagram is becoming a clover not three separate shots that's good that's good and the successful nfts of 2022 you want your bold predictions we'll sit in the middle of that venn diagram top three projects at the end of 2022 that we're talking about will sit in the middle of that venn diagram valuable prediction i like this and uh i'm predicting that somebody may do an nft project in which there's a guaranteed floor a guaranteed mint price floor we shall see we shall see all right great predictions from our five guests thank you all six guests seven guests i don't know who can count uh thank you all so much for coming on i will now give what i'm calling the general bull case general bear case for nfts in 2022 so that y'all can make up your own mind about what's gonna happen in the nft market in the year to come okay in the bull corner you have a couple of things happening several things happening i'm sure i will miss some but here are the big ones as far as i'm concerned you have all these social media platforms talking about verifying nfts on their platforms twitter is of course the big one who's doing this tick tock has talked about doing this i think instagram has has floated the idea of doing this so you're gonna have social media platforms really endorsing the concept of nfts i guess endorsing their sort of fundamental value prop which is that you can verify digital ownership in a way that you never previously could that's obviously really good for the space you have new nft marketplaces launching which hopefully will solve part of the ux problem we have here in nfts zenika talked about it uh i think john paul started talking about it a little bit which is that open c right now is the dominant player in the nft marketplace space but there there's a lot of flaws with them people love to hate on openc but in many cases it's for good reason so you have coinbase launching that could be a huge on-ramp for new people into the nft space but you have a number of other platforms that are launching as well that may help improve the user experience and therefore draw new people into the space unlike a macroeconomic picture inflation is high right now and it looks like it may stay that way for a while the build back better plan did not get passed by the administration but has been sort of kicked down the road to some time in 2022 who knows if it'll really make it through point being there could be more renewed super high government spending worsening inflation and in general driving people towards assets like stocks but especially like cryptocurrency places like bitcoin places like eath places like nfts we have eth 2.0 coming in 2022. this should make things more sustainable maybe it makes eth mainnet work a little bit faster in either case it should help quell some of the concerns that folks have around nfts and around this space in general if they pull it off seamlessly in theory that should be a good bull case for nfts though i will say i do think that once eth2 goes through we will actually see a a bit of a drop a drop in in the price of ethan some volatility which could temporarily cause there to be sort of a slowdown in the nft market l2s have been building like crazy in 2021 i think that will continue in 2022 and we will start to see the fruits of some of their labors just in terms of more action happening on l2s and we'll really see how scalable eth is that could be a huge boon for the space if you're talking about l2s that have lower gas fees that are able to really come into the nft market in a more significant way than we've seen so far and don't come at me i know solana and other platforms have cool nfts we will talk about them i'm not i'm not an ethmaxy but i i uh obviously eth is where most of the action has been happening up to this point ethereum is where most the action has been happening up to this point l2s doing well in 2022 could make for a a really good time for nfts in general uh finally regulation if we get clearer regulation in the crypto space in general in 2022 i think you'll see more institutional players diving into crypto in general that just means more money in the ecosystem more money to be put into nfts you couple that with better user experiences with platforms like coinbase etc etc and suddenly there's a huge bull run of nfts and hopefully we are all benefiting from it so that's it those are your sort of high level factors that if it goes right i think make an excellent bowl case for nfts in 2022 but i want to give you the counter arguments to these points because it could go the other way i will say on par i'm bullish i think the bullish outweighs the bearish but i also think it may be sector specific sort of within nfts certain sectors succeeding far more than others i mentioned that in my conversations with some of the guests today so you've heard that i'll say a bit more on it after i give you the bear case on the bear side of things as we've heard from i think a number of people today clearly the market got too frothy in 2021 specifically around pfp projects so many generative 10 000 pfp projects promising the moon promising games promising huge ip that truly will never be able to deliver on it and 2022 could be the year that the music stops for a number of those projects and if that's the case that could be a huge distraction that causes a general market downturn in a really big way it could for a brief time kind of bring down the ecosystem be the main chatter create a panic if you see the dominoes start to fall among pfp projects that really can't deliver on their broader roadmaps and there are a lot of those also have what zenika talked about which is the potentially the ability to borrow against nfts and really over leverage yourself using nfts and if that happens i think again as those dominoes start falling as nfts start going down in value people start losing a lot of money there's less money to be put in the ecosystem and you have this just spiraling factor of everything coming crumbling down even some good projects so if you're not i don't think that if that's to happen i don't think it will last forever because there will be good projects that will rise up again but i think it could cause a bit of a bear market for a good chunk of 2022 in a worst-case scenario another factor to consider if you tend to be a bear for 2022 if you're bearish on nfts in 2022 there was so much money pumped into crypto and pumped into nfts in 2022 in 2021 and we're a fan in this space of saying that it's early and it is we are very early in terms of the number of people who are in this space now versus the number of people who will ultimately be in this space and by in this space i mean will ultimately own an nft i'm i've on the record saying i think that everyone will own nfts at some point because they will just be so ubiquitous they will be receipts they will be concert tickets etc so everyone at some point will own nfts but the group of people that are in this space right now we are such zealots it is entirely possible that we have already priced in later market adoption now just because the space is early in terms of user adoption doesn't mean the prices reflect the early stage that we are at at all times because of how enthusiastic we are it is entirely possible we are sort of making up the difference between what the true value for these projects are now and what the value will be down the line when more people are in the space i'm saying things could be overvalued based on where we are right now because they're pricing in that future growth that we all expect and some of that could come to the forefront in 2022 if the if the industry doesn't grow at the feverish pace at which it grew in 2021 if it doesn't grow at that pace in 2022 some people may say we overvalued this ecosystem at large they could start dumping again you create a domino effect the whole system comes crashing down at least for a period of time in 2022 i should say you all know i'm very bullish on nfts in the long run so i think if we do see a crash in 2022 it's actually just a great buying opportunity but i do think that's that's one way in which it could happen is people realizing that growth was already priced in that it was overpriced in and that there needs to be some price corrections happening finally if l2s and other l1 don't deliver as much as maybe we're all expecting them to given the building that's happening on those platforms this past year that could be really disappointing for folks if we're not able to solve the scalability problem on eth even another l2 or another l1 isn't able to really pose a solid challenge to eth main net or the ethereum main net i think you could see that disappointment really causing a a bear market to set in that one's really hard for me to imagine you know having talked to some of the l2 builders i know people are really bullish on l1s i'll be talking more about them in 2022. i think it's hard to imagine that nobody none of the players really rise up to expectations i think they really will but you never know if they don't that could cause a bear market in 2022 finally the counter to what i said earlier on the regulation side if we continue to fail to get clear regulations or worse get continue to get like objectively horrible regulations like what we saw with the broker definition that could scare institutional bigger players away and just leave the market smaller than it might otherwise be so again could could be more of the bearish case for 2022. long term i'm super bullish i think who knows if it takes a year or three years or five years or 10 years or you know well i don't think it'll be 100 years for this to really become a mature industry but it will happen eventually and those of us who are learning it understanding it taking the time now i think we'll be really glad that we have because there's this is going to shape so much in the future finally i want to say a word on the metaverse because i think we didn't touch on that as much in this episode we did a little bit i think with zenika talking about vr i think we are very much still in the infrastructure building phase of the metaverse so you know it started to get a fair amount of mainstream attention because of the facebook meta announcement and so you had all these other corporations coming out disney plus etc saying hey yeah we're metaverse platforms as well but i think it'll continue to be a lot of talk in 2022 outside of some very niche circles which we will of course be covering and because there's still a lot of the infrastructure that's being built and this stuff really won't start hitting the mainstream in a way that that we feel for another several years so 2022 perhaps a little disappointing on the metaverse side depending on what your expectations are but i think under the surface there's going to be a lot of amazing building happening and we will be covering it all here at overpriced jpegs i want to close with a huge huge thank you to everyone who has supported

you know we'll we'll kind of do a deep dive into the world of gaming one month and and the art investing world another month and i think we have some i have some really cool things in store if you want to learn and go deep which is which is really what i want to do i want to go deep on the several verticals that i think are emerging as as the big important verticals in nfts and in the metaverse so i hope you'll stay with me and and be on this journey with me in 2022 we've got a lot of cool stuff in store and just thank you thank you immensely grateful for anyone who's listening to this now
