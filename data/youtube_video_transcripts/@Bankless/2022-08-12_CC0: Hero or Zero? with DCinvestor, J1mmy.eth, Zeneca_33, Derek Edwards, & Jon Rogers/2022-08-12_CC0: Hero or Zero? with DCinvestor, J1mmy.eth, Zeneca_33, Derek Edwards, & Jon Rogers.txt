[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs instead of our usual weekly recap episode here this friday i have an extra special episode for y'all we are joined by a whole cohort of incredible thought leaders in the space of nfts and web3 to talk about and debate and as i've been joking really battle about cc0 which is arguably the most in vogue conversation happening in the nft space right now to help me in this conversation i have derek edwards to my left partner at collab currency did i get that right derek and advisor to proof can i say that advisor to proof fantastic zeneca33 if you listen to the show you absolutely know xenica he is on every other week with me thought leader writer collector etc founder of zen academy dc investor the man with the best nft collection around uh frequent contributor to bankless as well john rogers you know him from my podcast former head of franchise development at disney so we'll have some interesting perspectives there on the ip front and then of course jimmy.eth founder of namelessnft42 you know i'm on twitter maybe the man with the strongest opinions on this topic but i don't know we'll find out dc zenico might give you a run for your money we'll see um okay i said this to y'all beforehand but i think i wanted each of you on here because i think you all have you have some daylight between you in terms of your beliefs on this but i also think you all have really reasonable opinions i'm gonna go out and say it i think like super strong maxis in either direction like everything should be cc zero or absolutely nothing should ever be cc0 i don't think there's really reasonable arguments to be made on those extremes everyone here falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum so i think this conversation is going to be about really giving people guidance and giving your perspectives on when ccz is the best option when non-ccc is a better option how people should be thinking about this if they're running their own projects thinking about launching a project but also let's have some like fun debate here and figure out really where the daylight between you guys lives and uh and

possible frame up how you would describe your position on cc0 derek again you're to my left here i see you first why don't you kick us off cool yeah yeah so i'll just kick it off and carly i think you did a great job of kind of um explaining the the middle ground here and i think i probably come in somewhere somewhere around there um cco tightly controlled ip every variation of licensing that will exist in between those two spectrums it's my view that these are just tools in the toolkit for all types of artists and creators that are interacting with this technology and my view is that as long as there's some marginal value that a creator can derive out of leveraging one of those tools in the toolkit it should deserve to exist right like this technology really should be agnostic and how creators approach it and my view is that there's going to be some value that comes out of tightly controlled ip very loosely controlled ip complete cco over the coming decades with that said i do have a pretty strong conviction that over the coming decades we're gonna see absolutely monster monster massive outcomes for projects that are purely cco and those could be objects that are purely artistic they could be objects that are pfps but i do feel very strongly that some of the biggest outcomes that that come out of leveraging uh this creative this technology in very creative ways many of them many of those outcomes are going to be powered by us by ccl zenika roy you're next on my screen kick us off yeah next i kind of want to role play and be like very vehemently against uh cc0 just for fun and because the reality is like i'm just sitting here nodding my head and like i basically agree and echo everything derek just said uh you know play devil's advocate yeah uh well that's harder because it's not my position uh i i'll say that uh i think i think it's too early to like it it's so s early in this experiment of cc0 ip for like creative intellectual property we've seen it play out for decades centuries with you know disney and mickey mouse and all sorts of other ip and we've seen how that works i don't think we've at least not to my knowledge really seeing how it works where a community is formed or or the this ip is out there and it's in the public domain like from really early on without having a big brand sort of steer it and create a direction uh i would say yeah so it's all an experiment i'm i'm generally pro cc0 as a concept and but i think again it has a time and a place and we don't know what is going to be best and what's not sort of a concept that i think is really interesting is some idea where the ip is owned by a centralized entity and they steer the narrative for a while and then maybe five ten years in the future maybe not a hundred years in the future but five ten three years make a decision a community vote to say hey all right so we've built a brand around this now there's awareness we've steered the ship now do we want to go cc0 i think that's an interesting thought to have but yeah generally pro cc0 i guess john you're next to my screen all right well derek kind of said what i was going to say but the licensing is a tool to it means to an end that you know it's up to the creator to decide where they want their project to go and how it should go and they should choose the right license that will facilitate that outcome um i think it's important for creators to be clear what their goals are up front at least in terms of communicating there with their community and if they don't know where it's going to go making a choice that allows for greater flexibility that said in the near term and i'll say near term is the next say three to five years i'm a bigger fan of restricted licensing if your goal is to build a content brand if you want to run a grand experiment and see where a community can take a content brand and see what the outcome can be looking at it long term then i love zero i love where nouns are going for instance i'll use nouns today a couple of times because i've been getting deeper in their ecosystem recently um but that's like that's an experiment that's going to be a long term play and the reality is for me and where i am in the space i'm looking to build content brands in the near term i'm looking to build a business in the la in the short term and so i need to focus the majority of my attention on the restricted side of of the equation but i'm going to have a foot in the in the cc0 side as well is nouns the exception to you or do you think are there other cc0 projects right now that you think really make sense of cc0 i think there are a lot of projects that make sense of cc0 the reason why i'm spending those to my time in downs it's just because i have limited attention i have limited availability and i just have to pick a place to play and i've chosen to pick the nouns as the playground i want to experiment in jimmy you're next on my screen hit us cool i like the way john framed it up um in general but i'm gonna take a little bit longer and tell the story of how i got to where i am as to why i believe that ip rights are important and uh i believe they're powerful uh tool for narrative just as the folks here believe cco is um i started as a collector of cryptokitties and we were creating these cryptokitties and making new cryptokitties out of a genetic and we had some intent in what we were trying to create it would create some undesired results but it would create different results and when they first came out um we had no rights other than um as an artist would give rights to uh their buyers uh those were the rights we had for a cryptocurrency we could display it we could sell it um which was a new kind of thing with the on on chain stuff uh with nfts in general but we didn't have the right to like use them um for uh our own commercial means really and then we as a community kind of started to advocate for that i was one of the early advocates in you know february march of 2018 trying to say hey we should have some ability to use these things and have commercial rights to them so they came out with the nft license eventually a year later um dapper labs did for cryptokitties and then i thought that was an interesting thing but they restricted commercial use and you couldn't use it for your brand or anything else you could basically make bugs and t-shirts which was a nice step and some projects still like to use that today it's somewhere on the spectrum and so when i eventually wanted to do my own project avastar's i modified that license basically and gave full commercial rights exclusivity um to the holders to use their app stars in any way they wanted so for me this journey has been you know from starting out and seeing no rights at all to getting the commercial rights and seeing the power of being able to apply existing laws and existing mechanisms of value creation there's immense value in ip um and i'm sure john could probably demonstrate and illustrate that with his experiences in the industry um being able to have a way to convey that to people i believe is powerful and that aligns the incentive of the holder directly to the building of the brand and value creation in a way that cco doesn't necessarily so i also am a fan and what i want the reason i brought up avastar's isn't because we did the one of an early commercial license necessarily but it's interesting because when i was designing it i had to debate with um the developer that i was designing with to get things into the project even though it was my project um it was a very democratic process and one of the debates i didn't win was i actually wanted to make the traits themselves a public good i wasn't cco wasn't a familiar term to me at the time but i wanted to make the trait themselves a public good available for anybody to use in any way they wanted um for free with a license for i guess it would be a cco license to be quite honest with you um but the original collection would be the first collection in the official collection to utilize those traits thus for you know providing the initial providence and the uniqueness of that collection itself so i was i didn't win that debate unfortunately and the traits are actually locked behind admin access and we've looked at ways and explored ways to open that up but it's not an easy thing unfortunately um so i just want to say that like i do see applications for this in the space very much so and i am excited about like native projects like nouns but i also have limited time and funds to you know invest in a thesis really and my thesis is based around ip rights and that's why i'm advocating strongly in the favor of those things and trying to find examples of that to highlight and illustrate for other people to be inspired because at the end of the day i feel like i don't mean to pit it this way but perhaps i'm framing it up this way a little bit i feel like cco's communism and ip rights is capitalism and you know capitalists need this is the heat we need in this debate examples capitals needs examples of things to aspire to be and to go after and if i hold this nft then i can potentially create enough value in this and become a millionaire successful person um with the cco thing it's like everybody's going to work towards the same objective and goals and try to make this thing better so that's where i'll kind of cap things off for myself and probably lead in perfectly to uh mr dc investor himself here i just want to add one thing i just suddenly became a socialist well i don't consider i don't consider myself a socialist but i'll share i'll share my thoughts on this and i'll start with the premise of look i do like public goods and i like public domain stuff in general and as someone who grew up with seeing like the rise of the consumer internet it's been really interesting for me to see like the rise of and the power of open source software um going becoming this thing that is powering a lot of the internet in so many ways and it's become a tool that has really accelerated um software development because anyone can see the code anyone can extend it i just think that's been a really powerful drive over the past 30 years i also think when we talk about public well when we talk about cc0 we're really talking about public domain so i'll use the terms interchangeably for this discussion but public domain is obviously not a new concept but i think when you pair it with nfts it potentially gets really interesting because nfts possibly i'm going to say possibly because we're not really sure yet but they possibly allow for value accrual through asset provenance so now before in the past the way that you would make money off of an intellectual property is you create things that you are selling based on that you are licensing out that intellectual property to others and so obviously with public domain assets you don't have that licensing aspect do i think cc0 public domain is right for everything definitely not i think though it is an important tool in creators toolkits and i think now that people have that tool it's going to get really interesting i think there's a lot of new paradigms that are going to be explored that we haven't really had the opportunity to explore now that we can do this alongside nfts and you know to take my thoughts a little bit further i like on-chain assets okay i like public blockchains i like on-chain laws um in general just as a premise i don't love the idea of marrying that with like off-chain baggage and legal rights which might vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction when this is really a global movement however i do think that there is a place for that i think there's a place for experimentation i'm very open to seeing how this melding and experimentation works because this is not going to be the last time we see off-chain legal rights being paired alongside on-chain assets and so i am interested to see what happens i'm interest especially to see some of these hybrid models i think my concern is that when we see centralized owners of intellectual capital who are basically making promises to their holders hey you got this right link and nod but at the end of the day they're actually controlling the intellectual property or they're they're not really giving up their rights they're just licensing someone else to use it and they can revoke at any time that is my concern and i don't think these things have been tested in courts yet and they they will be tested right i mean there will come a point when one of these ip rights issuers you know let's say hugo labs licenses gives all their ape holders rights to use their their um assets um and they might not like what somebody does at some point with it and then there's gonna be a lawsuit and then we're gonna test these things and i think that is healthy for the ecosystem because we need to see how those things play out but i think my final point on cc zero public domain as an opening for this discussion is i think it has the potential to create this really interesting library of contemporary public domain content and it's going to contribute to this idea of composable culture and there's already tons of stuff that's public domain most of it is like hundreds of years old but i think having like contemporary stuff from like contemporary famous artists contributing to public domain has the potential to serve as a big culture accelerant and i think finally uh you know i think it's important to remember that in the long run uh everything becomes cc0 public domain anyway so whether we want it to or not i want to ask on the on-chain law piece it sounds like you think the solve here is inevitably going to be a blending of like on chain with off-chain legal rights does this get solved or is one solution to this just having our rights better ascribed and better outlined and putting those legal documents on chain and having more of this get litigated by a smart contract for example i mean i don't think it's the solution i think it's a solution that's going to happen i don't actually think it'll be the most efficient or effective one and i think a lot of people are going to avoid those models because they don't want to deal with courts because jurisdictions are so different so whether it i think those if those things are put on chain it definitely provides probably additional legal backing around certain claims but like i said a lot of this stuff has just not been tested in course like we haven't tested as far as i know we haven't tested like an on-chain declaration of rights that a user has in a court to see if that holds up so but but i do think we're going to see every we're going to see cc0 public domain centralized controlled ip and everything in between in the next 10 years and i think it's going to be a really interesting time for the industry all of you mentioned can i add a couple of thoughts to that carly because i think it's really interesting i totally agree just like uh there's two things i take away from dc's response that i i tend to agree with the first is when you start reintroducing jurisdiction-based law for a global technology things get really messy like we have the ability to send value at the speed of the internet 24 7 jurisdiction to jurisdiction anywhere around the world any time of day um and then we also have you know hundreds of countries laws that apply in very jurisdictional bounds and trying to take that global technology where all of this economic activity is getting created and trying to uh let's call it like shoehorn that technology into like each jurisdiction wholesale becomes a very difficult proposition so i i definitely think we're handicapping like our ability i think we're numbing this tech the real power of this technology when we start to do that and i'd love to hear from john and jim on this the second thing is actually slightly different which is not the difficulty of introducing the reintroducing the leo layer to this technology which i think is a big unsolved problem the second is that i just think um we're handicapping the technology net net when we have the ability to prove that individuals now own these digital objects and we have that perfect provenance and instead of leaning into that design space to bring value back to the object owner we're reintroducing these legal rights that don't really play well with this technology instead of designing products and like increasing the surface area by which value can connote to the fact that um cosimo owns the right click and save piece or that dc owns this specific ringer or that roy owns this specific asset on the blockchain i think what will end up happening from innovation perspective is that the winning technology projects are going to lean into the fact that we now can prove provenance and ownership of these objects and start to simulate some of what the legal layer has done historically over the last hundred years in terms of like establishing probability of partnerships or establishing partnership over you know these rights that you can codify into smart contracts and i think that's where like the most interesting design space for innovation is going to exist instead of trying to map this trust minimized technology to something that's very wildly inefficient so the internet you described the internet by the way um earlier when you were talking about the issues to like you know this world changing technology that has to have all these different rules involved in regional silos and things and that's the internet um so that is like part of what's going on here too even in the nft space is that where you operate the just jurisdiction in which you operate you're beholden to those laws and rules and you can see with openc having to do things that web three purists maxies do not want to see happen things keep getting listed marked as stolen dcma takedowns all those rules applies if you want to do an nft drop and you live in the united states or your jurisdictions the united states then there's specific countries that you have to restrict from being able to mint um if you want to be able to turn that ethereum into cash you have to be able to kyc all of that ethereum and in many cases nft projects actually can't convert that ethereum into cash at all and there's multiple steps in order to do that we live in a world of walls that exist and will continue to exist and will need to operate with this nuance in a international landscape however i totally agree that there is problem or there are probably ways to simplify a lot of these things and to make it a lot easier for different jurisdictions to adopt and say this is valid um you know you know smart contracts are valid in the legal sense and can enforce these things properly but i also think that it's a really powerful mechanism that we can use to strengthen our rights around ip and everything else and by virtue of going cc0 an entity is giving up their intellectual property rights to something that they you would hope was building value in behind it and it's a big bet for that entity let's say for example like nouns has their own individuals getting you know these downs and there is some like value incentive for them to continue to build there but that's that's the only incentive they have like where's moon bird's incentive now right for example um in continuing to do that and by the way dc brought up the idea that maybe we'll see like something happen where like some sort of triggering event like occurs where people challenge some things i mean moon words just went from giving ip rights to taking them away completely um and didn't involve the community in any sort of web three way it was a very draconian web two we're going to do what we want and we know it's best move rather than involving the community and the community doesn't seem to be against the idea of cc0 as much as the move that and how that was done there but anyways i think that really we live in a place where there are laws in different places and no matter what we want to be the case you know i i am an adoption maxi i'm not even an nft maxi i'm not an ethnic so you have an adoption magazine i believe this is a new layer of the internet that we're just tacking on top that improves everything that we're doing worldwide in a lot of different ways from you know currency to nfts to property rights to leases to identity and everything else i want to see it all happen and i as you guys know i'm sure along with you know everybody else here i love on chain the idea of unchain and the way that there's providence and it can confirm rights and things like that so that's why i'm here for for this side of the nft thing i think we all want the same end here at the end of the day but i i don't think that the solution is to ignore these rules and regulations i think the idea is to like find a way to make them favorable like i think the bottom line is the only reason we can use uniswap today is because we're allowed to it's been decided that we can not because it's decentralized all the way and everything else we just saw tornado gap get sanctioned there's a big lol movement by a lot of the web 3 folks but it's a really real thing and there's implications now to using that service potentially it opens up a lot of things it can scare the out of people that's not going to get adoption in play here so like trying to go all the way web 3 and the same you laws i don't think is going to get us to where i want us to go and i don't think we all want to go but i don't i also think that's a kind of a different argument than cco and uh and ip writes like i think both can be along the journey of getting us there in a great way um just like from talking about like uh adoption or a maximalization of the applications of web 3 here i think it's still going to be a middle road here i want to riff on that for a second sorry i'll be in coach um so i want to take it out of the legal context for a second and talk about the distribution context and so we still are dealing in the current world today with centralized entities for distribution if you create a physical product based on a on an ip you have to deal with target you have to deal with walmart you have to deal with amazon if you want to create music based on an ip you have to deal with universal or sony you still do and there's very centralized or if you want to create an original animation for instance on an ip you're dealing with um netflix you're dealing with apple you're dealing with disney um and these are centralized entities so we're still in this world of centralized distribution now there's teams like feature who are working on decentralized distribution for content but that solution's still a little bit on the horizon um but so in the world world today if someone wants to develop a brand that starts on the blockchain and take it to that real into the real world in various applications you're dealing with centralized entities and so we're not quite there yet and you need to build in that space and just operate that we accept that we're operating with laws in the eu or in asia or in the us that are different is an extension to that point john that is this an anti-cc0 argument which is that these big brands and these big centralized entities are going to be hesitant to engage with a project or a brand that is in their mind a little bit free for all and could get associated with a fringe political party they don't want associated with their brand i would say at a very general level yes now a lot of people online are saying well disney will never do cc0 partner with cc0 don't underestimate a disney's willingness to experiment but as a general rule yes there that will be a detriment to getting partnerships in place and deals done because disney can't take the risk that their brand would be impacted if let's say someone took a moon bird and made toilet paper out of it or cannabis when we do licensing deals at disney europe in the past when we did those deals there were restricted categories and it's a short list but that was to protect the disney brand firearms were restricted um cannabis and alcohol were restricted certain food products were um and underwear diapers and undergarments and with some limitations not only that i mean and you can speak to this john like disney's been pretty litigious about anybody like a freaking preschool trying to use like a mickey mouse on the wall they'll go after like they have they're very staunch about nobody gets to use our characters other than us yeah i will say i was at lucasfilm before disney and the same accusation was made around star wars that's the public perception and of course they do some things to shoot themselves on the foot in that regard the reality that no one ever saw and i was the one who had make these phone calls is that more times than not you get a friendly phone call from someone like me and not a lawyer and i would say hey sarah i understand you're making mittens in your dorm room it's cool just don't advertise in this location because now you're in trouble but keep doing it sling it to your friends it's okay we're not going to care about that so more times than not you never see that aspect of it but you're going to get a friendly phone call from someone who's not a lawyer just but the point being that's still you protecting vip that's still saying no you can't just go out and advertise it anywhere and go anywhere with it that's still disney like taking steps to hyper control their characters and their things dc i want to throw it to you to maybe respond to some of the moon birds specific comments that jimmy made i think you you had some thoughts you wanted to talk about in in yeah because i think the moon birds example is actually really interesting and and first off i i don't want to i personally don't want to dwell too much on um is that the right move for moon birds or not because i i honestly don't know the answer to that i think my default my default point of view is that um i think i can see that there's a value proposition for community tokens having being cc0 public domain i can also see an argument the site of the argument where it says hey it's better to you know give people rights but i think what is interesting is that they were able to do what they did okay and i'm sure they consulted lawyers before they did it because what in as far as i know their license before to holders was you have commercial rights for your nft so not too different from what hugo labs has done for board apes and and other other companies have done for other assets but then they basically said hey you no longer have those rights it's now public domain what that reinforces for me is that the holders of the mft actually did not have durable rights that's what concerns me it's kind of like how are they able to do that and how can how we know that won't happen in the future and the other take this example further another thing that moon birds or any of these holders could have done is sold the ip rights to somebody else they could have sold to facebook and said okay now you've got it and then facebook could change those terms and competitions potentially so i go back to i'm not satisfied with how these representations are provided legally and i'm not and especially if you're building like a multi-million dollar brand or whatever on top of these my concern is that you're actually building on a shifting sand more shifting than just knowing hey these are public domain cc0 yeah i can jump in and just add a couple of comments there and i'd love to riff on john and jim's point as well because this is a super fascinating and very fun conversation so far uh as it relates to the plethora of ip rights that we see in the space that are given to these communities um the truth is is that if it's not cco if there is some uh if there if if these projects are on some part of the spectrum that is not giving full rights to the community to do whatever they would like or commercialize in any direction what is often being given is a revocable license which is why you know uh the larval labs folks were able to sell crypto punks and me bits to yuga and why yuga is able to modify the licensing rights that they're giving to these communities over time and so without cco you're actually creating an environment across the space where everything that these community members think they have is actually based on a centralized third party which is the the true owner of that ip giving them a revocable license to commercialize or to not commercialize in very specific targeted directions so i would say once you've gone cco that that genie can't be put back in the bottle you can't rug your community and say we're now changing in a different direction but up until that point virtually every single project in the space that's ip has given their community members a revocable license that could be changed at any time so oh so yeah go ahead uh go ahead and then i want to do something sure there's some practicalities as to why that's the case it's a great point um it's a necessity at this time because of the way that copyright law is handled in the united states you have to provide in writing transfer of copyright to anybody that you wish to put that to and it's a more elegant approach to actually license it out and you can confer a license perhaps directly through the ownership of an nft so that's one of the reasons that that's in place as well as it gives the holder the right to enforce um other things on behalf of the community that are copyright related um and i believe you could probably write into the terms and error irrevocability of those things also though if it becomes later is through a course of all of this discussion and everything if it later is determined that you can perhaps transfer a copyright to an individual by transferring an nft and not have to license it then nft projects would have the option to have an irrevocable process as well here where they could not take back there's no take back seas once you've transferred that it is a written transfer of copyright so that's one outcome we could potentially see through all of this as well that could actually make both cco and copyright transfer very strong as far as blockchain technology is concerned sorry i didn't mean interrupt i want to ask one follow-up question there for you jimmy and then derek we'll go back to you which is with cc0 and i was talking to some heavy hitter ip lawyers yesterday who confirmed this for me right you could uh like jimmy you have kingship you have you have real projects you've done with your apes and because you have businesses that you can show you're building around them you could apply for a trademark they could be cc zero you could still apply for a trademark from those apes and this is like an identifier for your business is that not a more stable position to be in than one of these currently revocable licenses that you have for example with you collabs i don't think it would put me in any different position as far as like the context of that necessarily i think my incentives would be different um because other people could go out and do the same things with this ape and also universal's incentives would be different because similar to disney they have things that they don't want to represent and they want to make sure they protect their band's brand as well so uh it would be less likely that i would be able to make that deal in today's business landscape um but it's possible i guess that there are still similar benefits if it was cco just not the same and for me it's less so it's less clear to me what these amazing opportunities are that are like part of like the cco is sliced bread narrative like i i can see potential and i really like what nouns is doing and maybe like someone here who's announced could give some really brief context because we've mentioned it a couple times and maybe there's people who are listening who haven't heard about nouns but i do think a native community-based like incentive like where the ip's out in the open to begin with and like there's assets creation and project creation and that's where the true potential lies for cco i'm not sure that like it necessarily fits with traditional like pfp projects um and with um you know really with a lot of what the nft projects that we see today anyways i probably said a lot in there but no that's great and i think again we come back to that brand risk piece which to me is a really big piece to if you want to fight against cc0 it's like you couldn't have made a deal with universal at this point if it was a cc0 project in all likelihood okay derek we we cut you off finish here at the point you were originally making no jim brought some excellent points i'm happy we double clicked there the one thing i will just say super quickly before i talk about rev gen is this idea that you brought up carly which is cco allows anybody the right to commercialize in any direction that they'd like um what i think people fail to recognize and you brought up carly is that those opportunities that you start to commercialize can actually enjoy the protection of the laws of the jurisdiction that you want them to and so there's nothing saying that once you've created this base layer this platform where anybody can take the ip and commercialize it in any direction under cco that the derivative work that you're commercializing can't be protected it certainly can and so whether it's kingship or whether it's another opportunity that people want to use with very specific board apes or if board apps with cco or moon birds or nouns or whatever it may be those can actually avail themselves of the protections of copyright in any jurisdiction that they want to operate within it's a very important point that i just want to like double click on before i move on to uh like rev gen which i think is like the bigger piece here well not necessarily copyright but that's exactly what i was going to say sorry apologies trademark and i and i i think another as i play devil's advocate on both sides here again had a conversation with a number of ip lawyers yesterday and where trademark gets tricky in this context of building a business with a moon bird for example is trademark is about not confusing the consumer so if you have an identifier source that is your mark for your business people aren't confused that there's six other businesses like yours that are using it moon birds all look somewhat similar so it's not necessarily clear that every individual moon bird holder can trademark their individual bird for their businesses now you get complicated here because if you're building a totally different business than i'm building we probably both can use a moon bird like there's nuance upon nuance here but i do think it's important to note that like in some ways you're actually competing for that trademark with your fellow moon bird holders potentially depending on what kind of business you're trying to operate in there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started on your nft journey you need metamask and if you need to fund your metamask account in order to buy that nft that you've been eyeing well now you can do that directly through metamask just click the blue buy button on the home screen personally i'm mad that i've spent extra gas fees transferring money from coinbase to metamask in order to buy nfts i've been using metamask directly and it is so much better you can also buy stable coins and native tokens from ethereum polygon avalanche silo and others and you can do it directly with your debit card your credit card through apple pay or google pay and there is now an improved buying experience on metamask mobile you'll only see tokens that are in your region so it's personalized to you and you'll get real-time quotes so you know you're always getting the best deal if you haven't downloaded metamask yet what are you waiting for go try it out you can learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with metamask at metamask dot io slash buy dash crypto yep i think these are all great points um i think the the time i want to spend more time and like i'd love to hear from others as well less on um like parsing through like the legalities of what you get or don't get with cco but why i actually think cco is powerful and will create some big outcomes in the future i think this is where the most interesting service areas so i'll just say i'll kick it off with like a few just general thoughts right now um if i had to say like are the biggest communities going to be the ones and certainly cco will work for some non-cco will work for others um but if i had to say like if the goal is to optimize for being coming like this global brand where potentially millions of people can interact with the ip build and commercialize in all sorts of different directions can that is that environment ripe for very tightly controlled iep or are there going to be is that going to act as a mitigating factor knowing what we know about the internet and how information flows very freely and attention being the scarce resource is that going to stifle the type of innovation that we would see for a brand going from 6 800 moon bird holders to potentially hundreds of millions of people building on top of this this ip platform and my view is that if you are not engineering your work if that is the goal to be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people and become a dominant global brand if you're not engineering your work or your community or your product to be as networked as possible knowing what we know about the flow of information on the internet you're probably doing it wrong and so what cco does is it gives you a platform by which anyone can start to interact and commercialize and enjoy this technology enjoy the ip that exists and leverage the technology of the internet and of web3 to start commercializing and bringing value back to that platform much like people were able to do with ethereum which acts as this agnostic platform by which people can build on top of and over time there was ethereum uh was able to find ways to bring value back to the native asset of that economy like ether by virtue of financial protocols being built on top culture protocols being built on top um social protocols being built on top and value flows back to this credibly neutral infrastructure that anybody can build on top without feeling like they're going to get rugged for their product or asset of their platform at any time and i think that's only unlocked with the power of the internet and that's only unlocked in marriage with the power of web 3 at least historically what we've seen we keep folks keep talking about cc zero and all these questions around ip rights as tools and i would love to get specific what you're getting to hear derek about like okay if i'm a project founder like what are the factors i should be thinking about to make me decide this should be cc0 versus this i should give ip rights what are the you know what are the goals that would map to each of those john i would love to hear maybe your response to derek and i know you've you've shared with me things about again if you're trying to build a big media or entertainment brand and with tv shows and and whatever else like you probably shouldn't go cc zero these days maybe talk a little bit about that john and in response to what derek just said yeah there's a couple points the first is yeah absolutely there is a power in having thousands of people building on a common platform and seeing where they take it the challenge is that without a creative direction and this is sort of kind of against the spirit of decentralization but without some sort of creative visionary or to give the guidance of where that should go it can spin off in a lot of different directions and some of them might most of them will eventually ultimately be positive i think but some of them are going to be negative and there's going to be hiccups along the way the challenge comes back to that what's the distribution mechanism because these entities just aren't going to take that risk or make that investment to work with them and so you're almost having to build a second piece of the puzzle and that's another long-term sort of build now ultimately long-term i think that's going to be some amazing things are going to come from that but short term trying to build a business today it's just going to be tough you know disney disney has more brands collecting dust on the shelf than they can actually monetize and bring to market and it's a challenge you have these internal discussions of should we bring that brand back in in what form and or should we invest in something new and they're not going to make those investments they're not going to take those challenges unless they have the rights available to them so that they know that they can monetize and if you know if they were to say to go to nouns and say hey we want to develop content around nouns but we can't monetize it because there's consumer products already being developed on nouns that's going to be a disincentive to making that decision you know i'm going to hold up and for the folks listening just on audio and not seeing so i'm holding up these this is some lapel pins that was created by uh big shot toy works on the nouns these are nouns glasses the beautiful lapel pins it's i'm gonna wear this when i sit in front of the us congress next year and um you know i love these these are amazing i'm actually gonna buy more of them but you know and so it's nice that nouns that someone can go and this company can go and make these but this isn't a big business this is a nice side hustle i'll call it it's the beginning of a business but if you want to go out and make a big brand today you have to have those rights that you can start off with big businesses and and partnerships well and and it's not even just about the partnership angle which we've obviously touched on here but john when you were at lucasfilm like star wars had to battle to not get star wars on like toilet paper like you actually might want to tightly control your brand for your own very valid reasons i think doodles is making this play like they don't want doodles on cannabis and toilet paper because it actually does erode the core of what their brand is trying to be yeah star wars toilet paper did happen it was actually a project i inherited um it was an accident it was part of a promotional partnership and someone didn't look at the fine details of the contract and so we honored we honored the agreement and the partner was really a really good partner about handling it but because they understood the sensitivities but it did happen in the world how did that end up in the fun what's that fine print say that rushing to get russian to get a deal done and someone didn't look at the fine print but it said you can use it in toilet paper it was a company called ziwa out of um germany austria switzerland and they had they're like the scott paper company of europe and uh yeah that happened fascinating but anyhow yeah so that's why we have restricted categories and i've advised projects in the space about adding restricted categories in their licenses you know i would love to see a cc0 license with restricted categories i think that'd be really interesting just because it was cannabis alcohol firearms and so on are going to be a problem for projects when those eventually happen you know it's interesting because i've seen ford apes actually uh be used in the cannabis industry already so i wonder you know in the long term how that will erode other brands uh you know a desire to yeah also did a cannabis they were cbd uh is that is that i think anything with commercial rights is probably safe to say is getting some sort of cannabis deal at this point and that goes back to this like what factors you could be should you be considering like if you're really trying to be a family friendly brand because your doodles or your cool cats it feels like this stuff clearly shouldn't be the route you go because there will inevitably be something like this and if you're bored apes and you're like renegade and kind of like middle finger to the world anyway this probably all just like helps your brand in a lot of ways i would say like if you're bored apes alcohol partnership cannabis probably feels right diapers i think people are going to get kind of pissed if they see more date diapers we're watching jimmy's business mind at work that's true his next step in 24 7. fake diapers you never have to leave your desk hey if anybody's interested in doing that quickly he's on twitter uh dc your your screen is a little out of focus but i would love to to have you chime in here on like moments when you think this is appropriate or not i think the art world is is clearly an exception here where we see less cc zero in the artworld x copy obviously kind of changing that maybe but dc chime in on that and then zenika i want to get you in here too yeah i think i mean i think i think thinking about cc zero public domain for these community tokens versus art is an interesting um it's an interesting way to compare and contrast potential use cases so i think just focusing on community tokens for a second i think if you're trying to create an entertainment brand then i think non-cc0 probably makes more sense because you want to retain those rights you're trying to use them in different ways i get that i think if you're trying to create a memetic internet community that takes on a life of its own then i think cc0 can make sense potentially i mean and we're still seeing how some of this plays out i think the most interesting right now example right now is nouns but when we think about it from the art perspective i think if you're an artist you really have to think about what you're trying to achieve as an artist and i've talked to a lot of artists about hey what do you think about cc0 and they tell me the number one thing they tell me is they're afraid of their art being used for some kind of hate speech and i do understand that i'm not sure all of that fear is like a hundred percent rational because they're looking at a couple of extreme examples where things have been used negatively but i think most use of collect domain assets is not for hate speech i mean that's just reality there's a small minority but yeah your work could end up as that okay but i think also some want to retain control of their ip because they want to be able to benefit from it later and i understand that too like you create something maybe you want to create as a brand maybe you want to create you want to get your artwork on coach wallets and you want to make money from that one day i mean look there's a hundred different with a thousand different ways to do art and to have your rights and your work represented in different ways but i think also what if you have the basis for a really great meme or mimetic asset and it never becomes valuable because you've controlled how far it can spread effectively and i think that's what cc0 is going to challenge so i think that when i think about um x copy is the most prominent example recently he made a lot of his previous works see or all of his previous works cc0 public domain i think the long-term relevance of that is going to be very interesting to watch because if that adds value back to xcopy's mfts and he's earning royalty income from that then i think we can view that potentially as a success okay and if and if people are making money off of his work by printing t-shirts and creating x-copy wallets and coach wants to create an x-copy wallet and he doesn't get paid from that that might be okay because here's the thing x-copy because of the nature of his work he's probably not going to engage in partnerships like that himself it's going to come across as unauthentic it's going to come across as kind of weird and a lot of times this stuff happens it happens the estate is taking the work of an artist who has passed away and is putting it on bags and wallets and lunch boxes and stuff like that so i think that and so i think that a lot of artists are not naturally going to partnership partner with corporations but anyway if people start taking x copies work and basically spread the meme and his art style across the entire world it's hard to for me to imagine that his nfts are not going to become more valuable it's hard for me to imagine that he's not going to become a more famous artist maybe one of the most famous living artists as a result of that so anyway like i said this is all an experiment in flight and progress but those are some of the things i'm watching seneca you purchase a lot of cc0 projects how will we know if cc0 the cc0 experiment succeeds what are you looking for to be able to say yes this achieved what i thought it would i think we won't know for many many years but it will be able to look back and see the again the proliferation of these the memes at the end of that all comes down to memes and if you understand memes and the memetic nature of how culture spreads throughout society and the internet i think yeah if real alpha is looking to memes that's what these things are at the end of the day and you know in five years from now and if we see that moon birds is this massive i'm using rainbows because of the recent decision this massive global brand that a lot of people have built on top of i would say that's probably a success and and could that have happened while it was under the previous commercial license maybe probably like the reality is it's very difficult to compare and contrast and say you know we can't look at two timelines where moon birds was cc0 and and wasn't we can look at moon birds versus something like bought apes or doodles or cool cats and compare and see how those play out uh but in terms of success it's just going to be really difficult to tell without looking at just basic metrics a few years from now is the pricier bags one of those metrics it probably is like if these underlying either that's what you know at the end of the day if the if cco is to succeed i think one of the most important metrics will be whether the original assets are deemed valuable in the future you know because because the i that we're taking the value out of the ip and hoping that it accrues to the underlying assets uh i want to talk about uh in a slightly different direction blitmap because they went cc0 in august last year this is a project by dom hoffman and they launched and they weren't cc0 and then they put it to a community vote and overwhelmingly the support was there and then they released the ip into the public domain and one of the examples given in like the blog post about it was imagine if you could own excalibur's sword would that not have value today if you could prove collectors i think would value that and there'd be some sort of value whether it's more or less than owning the ip and and again to i think it was dc's point earlier at the end of the day all of everything is going cc0 anyway uh after a certain amount of time so this is this gets to an important question to me which is like timing of cc0 i forget who said it earlier but the idea i think it was you roy who said like maybe after five years ago cc0 because it's this incentive piece that jimmy is pointing out which is that i mean look i don't know the exact story history of whatever sir lancelot and that story getting written but it seems like the getting to own this piece of work like the incentive to create creative work is tied with ownership and then sure down the line it's super valuable and somebody wants excalibur sword but are you gonna get these sir lancelot stories can you get the next shakespeare if it starts cc0 is the incentive there yeah so a topic a point that came up before is that if something cc0 you know you don't have this centralized entity building out the ip and controlling the narrative and i'm not convinced that they're mutually exclusive and again using the blipmap example the team there they're building out the world the law they've got the blitverse they've got uh rivals i think they're called they're working and spending significant money on building out this entire ecosystem and ip even though they don't own the ip for it and the community also has the freedom to go off and do whatever they want and we've seen instances of people taking blitmap assets or incorporating them into other projects the built map logo is probably like the not the red and blue foursquare logo you know we've seen that in um chain runners and we've seen that in other cco projects and it's sort of like proliferating where the community is like all right cool we can use this stuff let's go and expand it but the team is still working and building out this like centralized narrative so of course there's some friction where if someone goes off and creates toilet paper and diapers then it doesn't quite make sense and be cohesive but the team is still going all right so this is what like we have a narrative we're going to create it and then the community can riff off of that and the wider community anyone in the space like this again this open source narrative anyone can come and build on top of it and just let's see what happens whereas you know there is a narrative but it's also cc0 could star wars have been created john i know you want to get in here so i'm going to direct this question to you and then you can say what we want could star wars have been created if in parallel to george lucas creating it a community was running wild with the same characters no chance never would have happened um he i i think for a lot of franchise type ip you need some sort of a creative visionary and that's what what you're buying into now there certainly are projects in development right now that are more community driven storytelling and i think there'll be some interesting projects to come out of that and the the jury's still out on how those are going to perform but we buying into the vision of a creative person a george lucas a steven spielberg and i think that's great that we want to do that i want to hear a voice and hear a story from a voice and over time some of those voices become a brand like george lucas has a style steven spielberg has a style and that's a brand that i want to see and pay money to to experience um but i'm going to go back real quick on the cc zero what roy was saying and about the ex the kind of this experiment that it's still too soon i actually think we are seeing success in cc0 it's just not the place yet where big businesses are going to be built but the signs i'm seeing and this is why i'm experimenting and working in the space is that it looks good it looks like this could turn into something it's just not going to be this year and i need to build a business this year but it's worth my time and attention because it's going to be big eventually yeah i'd love to jump in and respond to roy and john uh first i'll just say um that is not without drawbacks this idea of like the centralized creative decision maker um episodes four five and six the original star wars were amazing episodes one two and three not as good um and so i would argue that there is a don't mean stab your job i'm just merely articulating that i wish it was as black and white as this but it isn't um i would say more importantly uh just some of the things that roy were talking about i i um i actually very strongly believe that um i you know if i were to reduce down like the optimal organization to really make cco work it probably comes down to three things it's open permissive rights that allow people to build on top it's some revenue engine that exists to to incentivize through the community others who are not owners of those objects to build on top so it doesn't have to be you know an object-based incentive like they don't have to own the object the underlying object to build on top but there is some other incentive that exists maybe through uh dollars or eth or some other incentive that can exist by which to build on top of that and then third to the point about optimizing for those first two buckets some centralized decision maker that's running in parallel with those first two buckets that brings persistent value back to the project over and over and over again over the course of many decades now i think if you could have those three buckets and fine-tune the parameters my view is that it will lead to some very interesting results that if you're not structurally set up to do well like well your project can get handicapped in ways that are unintentional if you're not really leaning into the principles of web3 and information flow and this ability for us to just send value and information at the speed of light on these trust minimized ledgers and i think if you can figure out how to weight each of those three buckets optimally i think we'll find that some massive massive outcomes will get created here the last thing i'll say is just um it's just around this idea of uh of incentives and um where we're at currently in the cycle i really do think incentives really are the key here and i do think that there is ways to turn these knobs to create incentives for a global audience to interact with cco ip and it's just a matter this to me is an optimization question less than it is like will this happen or not and i think it will definitely happen and i think the best organizations are going to figure out a way to open up the ip create uh if the goal is to monitor is to monetize in ways that aren't conducive to like what you you've been describing john which is like a you know web 2 you know media brand open up the ip allow people to build on top of it incentivize them to do so regardless of if you're a holder and have some centralized decision maker that's taking the input of the community to add fuel to the fire that's getting created in these first two buckets but i'll pause here dc i want to let you say something about composability jimmy would love to let you have a closing word here if you have anything you want to say and then i might round it out with my takeaway from this conversation yeah thanks carly and i think you know my first point on this is if you look at some of these metaverse apps that are evolving um i think we're going to hit some interesting flash points on how certain ip can be used in those metaverses and when i say metaverses i mean like other side i mean the om open metaverse that punk uh 6529 is pushing out there and it was interesting to me actually in the yuga announcement when they showed toads and nouns and they showed them alongside in that little spaceship with the others and part of i have to think part of that reason was because they could just use that ip for free without asking anybody and i think that's a pretty powerful value proposition when you think about that um i think just another point that i wanted to offer up was when we think about these centralized coordinated communities where a centralized actor is pushing it forward i definitely see the value proposition of that and i can see why some people are really interested in participating in those communities but one of the things that cc0 allows participants of those communities to do if your ip custodian sucks or if your ip rights holder sucks if they become someone evil that you don't like you actually have the opportunity to liberate your community from them to some extent now that now you're not going to have access to the community treasury or the royalties but you can take the idea if your community agrees that hey this idea is bigger than the custodian you have an opportunity to fork it or do other interesting things potentially that you might not be able to do with owned ip rights so we haven't seen like a lot of flash points where that would be like super interesting yet but if these community tokens continue to be important over the next five to ten years we're definitely going to see some situations where this comes into play i think it's interesting on the community side i was going to say one piece where i feel like both sides of these arguments maybe go wrong is i think folks who are on the super strong ip right side maybe overestimate how often people will really be able to get licensing deals for their their you know nfts jimmy i think you're sort of an exception to this so you want to jump in yeah i mean i do have a comment there a recent deal i did with a content licensing company is they're taking all of my commercial ip nfts and they're content tagging them on youtube so anytime it's used in any sort of video where there's monetization involved i will get an appropriate cut of that and uh youtube's uh ceo i believe recently came on and talked discussed how um content id and content tagging that youtube is actually built perfectly for this and being able to prove like the original origination of that content at least on their platform and then appropriately giving rights to the content creators for that and so i've started to apply that for my nfts as well and and it's not to say that i expect any significant income from any of that at all but you could register you there could be a mechanism where you could easily like web 3 connect your wallet to youtube for example it would go through scan the appropriate on-chain mechanisms that said you had ip rights to these things and then could basically give you a revenue stream however small or large that might be without much effort or the necessity of a network or anything in place to make these deals so that's interesting and i know there's i know there's people working on products like like a shutterstock shutterfly on chain equivalent so like any time if it was used in a news story for example it could automatically have a license in place so you can make money okay that's interesting i would that being not that not withstanding you made the point like sure right lost on me that yes right now you need relationships you need something desirable and more it seems more people uh don't have the as desirable assets or the where without where with the the ability to go out and make these deals themselves um that is a tougher uh hill to climb at the moment um so it makes ip writes maybe less important to most collectors the flip side of this is i was going to say i think similarly the cc zero community overestimates how much people are going to go off and do like amazing things with the ip now that it's cc zero and that the next beethoven's coming along to make his masterpiece with blitmaps or like whatever the case may be so you know we're talking about probably niche scenarios in both cases um and something to to consider if you're launching a project okay john you have some really interesting insight i think to share around things that are happening on the uh the senate side that the senate is investigating things around ip and nfts and you've been involved in that so we'd love to have you share that with folks yeah i just as we're wrapping up um you know it's a very important topic that regardless of where you sit on the spectrum and what your feelings are and some things are going to start changing in the next year or so and what that's whether it's coming from is the united states senate so about a month ago earlier this summer the u.s senate asked the u.s copyright and trademarks offices to work together and conduct a study over the next year about how nfts and web 3 are going to impact intellectual property rights the work of that study is going to impact the legislation coming out of the u.s congress for years to come this will impact the space that we're all working in or folks who aren't working but still love the space for for years it's incredibly important that we get our voices heard and participate in the study so they're about to kick this off maybe another month or two and when that happens there'll be periods along the way for public comments where you can submit they do take those public comments seriously and so i want to finish with is saying we'll make sure whatever best i can i'm sure carly will too to communicate hey there's an opportunity for public comment regardless of how you feel make sure you're heard because if you're not heard a bunch of people in washington who don't even know what an nft is are going to start writing laws that affect you and so we need to make sure that we're participating in that and i did have an opportunity to pre-brief the committee about a month ago as they were kicking this off and i do know that they are really focused on consumer protection they're feeling that consumers buying nfts are not fully informed as to what they're buying they're obviously worried about the rug pulls and the scams as we all are but they're also worried about licensing so this topic is directly relevant to what the senate's going to be working on so please participate get engaged and um let's be heard love it okay i was going to close this out and then if somebody has one final thought they can try to i want to say one quick thing first of all john i think that's amazing that you're you know you're talking with them and absolutely we should all get behind you know have our voices heard and i think that's a really important thing and in terms of like protecting the public one of the dangers for cc0 that i've sort of seen and been thinking about is as it becomes like this narrative everyone's talking about it there's like buzz around it and hype around it i think because it's still so widely misunderstood there's a real danger where artists creators project founders they might rush into a decision that decision and make their ip or their creations cc0 without fully understanding it's irreversible it's permanent and the full ramifications and i think that uh you know just because you see some some tweet from you know any any of us up here or you see a decision from moon birds going c60 that does not mean your project should be cc0 and i think that you know it's the thing that we've all mentioned 10 times is this chat it's like cc0 and different ip writes are a tool toolkit a tools in a toolkit and and you know really think hard about what you're going to do especially if you want to go to cc0 because it is permanent yeah i just want to end with that that's a great point and essentially what i was going to do is just kind of summarize i think where we've landed with some of this and and maybe we can all like have a little like yes we sign off this is what we think is true um which is if you are somebody who is creating art whether that be like individual art or you're trying to build you want a tv show with netflix you want to build the next marvel series you are not the candidate to rush into cc0 you know you are probably somebody who wants to be much more restrictive about it a little bit more essentially controlled building your vision if you're trying to partner with big brands for what you want to do if you want your art if you want to make a licensing deal yourself with with a coach down the line so that your artwork can feature on one of their t-shirts cc zero is probably not for you certainly at this stage if however your art feels like it's around community building and the play you're trying to make is to just proliferate your symbol so that you have a cultural cachet so that a lot of people see it and think like oh that's interesting what is that i want to be a part of that group i want to be in that in crowd whatever it might be because it's something funny or it's kind of satirical that might be a really awesome time to use cc0 because that proliferation could come out of it goblin town i think a perfect example of that that feels to me like a really resonant time to use cc0 because it's just it's so memetic to use the word that dc investor has taught me um so that would be my summary of this how do people feel about that as a general overview i say it's great but i i always put an asterisk because it's like there's always and it depends with each scenario and sure yeah but i definitely agree yeah cool well thank you all so much for this see not too not too fiery not too uh nothing too crazy everyone kept it pretty civil and uh i will i'm sure i'll see all of you again at some point individually on the show i would hope and and otherwise thanks for joining me [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of
