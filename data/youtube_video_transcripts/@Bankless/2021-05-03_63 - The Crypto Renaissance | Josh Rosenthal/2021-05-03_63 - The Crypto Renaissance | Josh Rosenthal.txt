[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm brian sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an episode i know it's an awesome podcast because as soon as we finish recording i just want to listen to it again that's what happened with this recording yeah this is to me this is the through line of crypto if you want to figure out what crypto is you need to go all the way back not just back into the 70s where cryptography was created we are going all the way back to the 1300s the late dark ages because that's where the renaissance happened that's where double entry bookkeeping happened that's where a cultural revolution happened and this uh this the inspiration for this podcast came when i was trying to figure out uh when we were right after the nft mania and there was some sort of loose thread about some connection between ether as a money blockchain as a system nfts as a technology art as new culture and so i asked on twitter it's like hey uh who who has a professor that is teaching them about like early early european like history when it comes to wealth art and culture and this guy josh uh just raised his hand is like i'm not a student i am the professor uh and he's got a phd in in medieval history and in european history uh and he's also also working in the in the realm of crypto investments and so josh rosen rosenthal is a fantastic steward of this message that is the same underlying core advances of humanity starting in the renaissance all the way through crypto uh where we are today and the the power of what josh was able to lay down is still ringing in my ears david i don't think i've heard a podcast like this ever in crypto across any any podcast i don't think anyone has looked at it through this technical historical lens and brought these themes out uh and this is really like the first maybe the first podcast on what what we call in this podcast the crypto renaissance and we talk about like all sorts of strange and interesting things like what was the life like for a peasant in the middle ages how does that relate to our life today how did that change in the renaissance how will our life change from the world we live in today into the crypto renaissance we even talked about demons pooping and like art and like like crazy things the medici class uh the popes and all sorts of things so this is a tour de force of um culture and societal revolution i feel i feel like at some level i was in the most interesting history class i've ever attended because it related all the most interesting things about um you know the wheel of history to like all of the most interesting things about technology and society and the internet and cryptography today and it was all jam-packed in like an hour and a half so what it what a cool podcast man yeah i was telling a banquet some marketing guru meme lord michael wong about this podcast and he says it sounds like some intersection of ap european history and ap ethereum and i think that's exactly right that's exactly what's going on um and and i think we should just go ahead and get right into the episode but first a message from these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswaptow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest this is josh rosenthal he holds a phd in medieval and early modern european history so he's a historian he also received a fulbright scholarship to sorbonne's institute for advanced studies he's worked at a think tank mixing culture history and technology which is what we're going to talk about today but he's no longer a practicing historian he is now a partner at sixth event cataclysmic capital which supports early stage founders targeting cataclysmic impact one of those impact areas is certainly in the crypto arena josh welcome to bank list it's fantastic to have you how are you doing hey i'm doing very well pleasure to be here guys thank you very much josh this is a lens we have not yet explored on bank list but david and i are super excited to do so this is like the historical lens before we get into this podcast i want to ground the listener with sort of a mental road map of where we're going because i think we're hitting four important aspect areas in our conversation with you today josh and we're going to weave in and out of them the first is we're going to talk about the middle ages an era of centralization uh and then the renaissance and reformation an era of decentralization and compare that to the era that we're in call it the nation state era and this new crypto renaissance that is upon us that's one of the through lines here the second is how technology is a catalyst so we're going to talk about the communication technology that made the renaissance happen the printing press we're going to talk about double entry bookkeeping the ledger and how those are similar to the internet a new communication protocol for the world and crypto which is a ledger for the world and then we're going to talk about how these changes affect society from an economic cultural perspective to an institutional shift that's number three and fourthly i think we're going to leave the listener with some action items how they can position themselves for this cataclysmic change that is upon us you ready for all this josh yeah thank you very much ryan i think that's a a great summary i'd i'd like to take us back to a moment in time that we might not typically think about that's in the later middle ages um and you know sometimes you hear it spoken of as if it's the middle ages or a dark period that's probably not the best word i think the best word to describe it is aggregated and so i'd like to walk through two different three lines value and information and then look at how new technology new financial technology and information technology essentially unraveled these power hierarchies and what happened next so starting with the middle ages if we were to describe the middle ages in one word aggregated would probably be a good word to use and so if we were to think about value value was really aggregated and by that i mean that wealth was concentrated you know wealth is fundamentally land and the roman catholic church is the largest land owner owning up to through the land in europe and options for economic output are were you know primarily agricultural you know there's land and animals and crops and there's some guild-based manufacturing but that's a that tends to be you know fairly small people tended to follow in family vocations whether it was farming or craftsmanship and so on the whole wealth was super concentrated and it tended to be displayed in precious metals you know there's some patronage of the arts but these were subject to sanctuary laws where the power structures were regulating how money could be spent you did have decent amount of finance but that likewise was subject to usury laws um interest limited the the powers that be controlling how money actually flowed and so wealth was accumulated through generational consolidation you know generation after generation slowly concentrating wealth and as you might expect power likewise was consolidated in the middle ages there was a contest for power there were two hierarchies uh one was political and one was religious and they were at odds for for a number of centuries and this ultimately ended up with a clear win in this contest for authority with uh with the religious coming out on top where the holy roman emperor was ritualistically humiliated by the pope in the 11th century that was largely because religion wasn't a private affair it was the social and cultural institutional ties that united economic power and so when the pope had excommunicated the holy roman emperor all the economic contracts and political fidelity that was obligated to them where it was all rendered you know instantly uh mute and so the holy roman emperor begged the pope's forgiveness and at that point the religious hierarchy really took dominance and they achieved a type of stasis for for several hundred years up until the birth of the reformation where it was symbiotic stasis and so in the middle ages if you have concentrated wealth and consolidated power naturally as you might expect culture was largely top down and so that flowed from the church in the nobility and there were limited number of fine artists and they were commissioned by a super concentrated elite it's mostly painting some music very limited amount of text there was definitely popular culture that was bottom up but it was controlled and channeled through through approved means things like morality plays and carnival most of the culture was extra textual which means it was based on oral interaction and so if that's an idea of value being concentrated where wealth is consolidated and power is consolidated and the culture flows top down the way that the power structures achieve that type of stasis the way they held on to to power was fundamentally by centralizing information and controlling who had access to what information and how they're able to share it and so the other through line i'd like to look at for just a minute before we look at what changed in the the reformation and renaissance is around this idea of centralized information in the latter middle ages just before the birth of the reformation and renaissance information wasn't just centralized it was it was fundamentally guarded by authority and so political and religious uh entities were mutually reinforcing uh creating documents that were controlled by a scribal class they're encoded in a language that most people couldn't read very few people could read and most of them couldn't read latin and the documents themselves were in a particular siglia a type of shorthand that very few people could read they're stored in archives they're hard to access they're hard to keep safe and even if you did have rights quote unquote in the documents there's very limited remediation the courts were at the service of the the nobles and the clerical estate getting access to those documents was incredibly difficult partially because the transmission of them was limited so if literacy is around five percent most people stay within 10 miles of their home throughout a lifetime these manuscripts are incredibly rare and scarce and inaccessible they cost more than the annual salary of a person and typically the manuscripts are created at institutions which are centralized for their creation this is the rise of the university and you know the monasteries and the nunnery so just to take a step back and summarize what we've talked about you know in the latter middle ages you know there were two particular two particular power dynamics that served to create these hierarchies the first was aggregating value and concentrating wealth and controlling who had access to money and how it was used and the second was centralizing information controlling how ideas about money wealth and culture could be shared and these were fundamentally centralized and it's against that backdrop that we can now take a turn and look at the renaissance and reformation and and what changed and what fundamentally changed was the advent of two new types of technology which gave rise to a new class and a new expression of art and identity but let me take a moment and pause here before we go on to the next chapter in the story yeah so josh let me uh reiterate to you the through lines that i'm seeing here whereas uh it's really the church that dictated the world right and they were able to dictate the world because they had all the wealth and wealth was largely defined by land and and then also through that power they also had a monopoly on information or what was true what was true was dictated by the church and uh and you you alluded to that there was some bottom up cultural manifestations right like uh some bottom up celebration of culture but it was through perhaps what we would call permissioned uh vehicles right like it was only bottom up in so far as the church allowed that culture to manifest and the reason why the the church was able to do that was because they had all the power they had um they had the wealth they had the land uh and they had uh the they had all the the data if you will in forms of of knowledge where does um physical power come into this conversation does might and and the sword uh fit into this conversation as well yeah absolutely that's a that's a that's a great question and so uh yeah these power hierarchies are land and economic but also uh also uh military um and so that was that was the great tension in the early part of the middle ages where the uh the political estate which would be the holy roman empire was at odds with the church and so there was a question for for who would ultimately control temporal or physical or military authority and the church had claimed that they had uh they had authority to wield that temporal power and as you might expect the political apparatus disagreed and so in that great contest that lasted uh that lasted a number of centuries ultimately the church won that they won that at uh at canasa where the holy roman empire that the head of the entire political state and all the military apparatus was in the ground on the snow wearing penitential rags begging the pope's forgiveness because the pope had excommunicated him so all the ties of military allegiance between the emperor to his knights and to everyone else in the neo-blast was all predicated it was all linked in a causal chain around being a christian and being baptized so when the pope excommunicated the individual all of those contracts including not just economic contracts but military contracts were rendered null and void and so at that point you know most historians would say that the church took you know supreme dominance in terms of that hierarchy but then you know that was around you know the 12th century after that for the next two or 300 years the church and the if you want to call it the state achieved a type of symbiotic stasis where they're both power hierarchies and they became more and more and more inextricably linked can we talk a little bit about the the day in the life of an average member of society so what what you just set up for us in in the middle ages time period was kind of the life of i don't know if i call it a peasant let's say the life of the the average person was very much uh permissioned was very much um you know top down was very much the the opposite of what bankless preaches which is self-sovereignty and freedom and and very much restricted in the ways you could participate in the culture in the ways that you could participate in the economy i mean no such thing i'm sure as a an entrepreneur what would an entrepreneur do in in this era very hard to rise above it seems paint the picture of a day in the life of an average peasant and average family an average unit of society now that's a great question i think that's i think that's right on all accounts the vast majority of individuals were farmers and uh it was fundamentally agricultural subsistence-based farming and so you had you had never been more than a few miles from your farm you probably didn't own your farm your farm was owned by a land owner you might not be allowed to leave without permission this hierarchy isn't just hierarchy in terms of economics and military but it's hierarchy in terms of permission around identity what you can do how you can move what you can acquire how you can use the things you acquire how you can express yourself what you can say what you can think and so in these two great hierarchies you start off with the emperor and then go down into the the various princes and cities and then into the knights and then all the way down into you know agricultural workers you're at the bottom of the pyramid and on the spiritual hierarchy it's the same thing you start off with you know the pope and then you move into bishops and various curates and then down your local breeze then down to yourself so the short answer is you're working in the fields from dawn till dusk every single day and that's literally all you're thinking about there isn't additional capital you know at your disposal and you do have exceptions where you have some build-based manufacturing and you might be able to be a blacksmith or something like that but you can't just set up shop and hang out a shingle your father had to be a blacksmith or you had to have permission from the guild to be able to set up shop and you had to have permission from the the the noble authority to be able to have a title which allowed you to actually practice so at every fundamental junction of life things were permission not just economically but also around identity and the way they controlled that was through the permissioning of information you couldn't share anything that popped into your head in terms of speech and and documents were were the sources of control and those were carefully guarded those weren't at least in the in the population you know whatsoever is that helpful it's a little difficult for us to imagine today i think the the the image that's being conjured in my brain is that there's there's a very strong lack of churn in this world right the if you are a aspiring young lad who wants to do something cool with your life it's just you're just not in the environment that facilitates such an aspiration right you and perhaps you don't even have the the capabilities to even think about something to aspire to because you're just not in an environment that caters to such creative new thinking you are kind of locked in this in this world that seems very fixed and i i also want to put an image of into the listeners heads because i think this is going to be one of perhaps the overarching through line for this entire podcast of the difference between the tower and the square or the hierarchy and the network right and where you know hierarchies over time grow larger and larger and more rigid and and versus the network or the town square which is a flat uh flat topology where everyone is treated equally and there seems to be a pendulum shift that goes between these two ends of the spectrum and right now in in the late dark ages we have an extremely high hierarchical religious structure that dictates the world top down using their power of wealth culture knowledge and influence and that's where this story starts or at least this podcast starts which is the late middle ages with a very hierarchical structure that really determines what the individual can really do with their lives i don't want to get ahead of our story but it's it's important to understand that those ideas probably wouldn't have even popped into their head right it was the water the air they breathe the water in which they swam and so you know we're in a very similar situation today where you know political and ideological hierarchy is merged into a nation state and and we're at the subject of its permission and all sorts of facets of our life and we we tend not to think about that on a daily basis just like the average you know medieval farmer wouldn't have been thinking about that you know for example i tried to i tried to uh purchase a bitcoin conference pass for a team member right and uh you know i purchased that you know down in miami and uh the payment was declined and when i spoke to american express they said yeah we know it's not fraudulent we just we don't like the subject matter and we don't want to process that so we won't let you spend your money in that way that's the policy of their permission on that um so so we're in a very similar situation just like it didn't enter their head it tends not to enter our hat and when we say an entrepreneur starting something that wouldn't have been a category they had and you know very similar you know we'll see the rise of the mercantile class where people do set up shops it was very difficult for them to take a step back and appreciate the historical significance and say perhaps i can do something other than be a farmer just like it's it's difficult for us to take a step back and say perhaps i can do something other than work for a company perhaps i can work for a dow that would have been that would have been something that wasn't quite on their mental map at that point in time and josh this was excellent for shadowing of topics that we're going to address uh later in the in the podcast and i i get i hope the listener gets the sense of what it's like for the average agrarian peasant i mean you were literate you were poor basically every day was just trying to survive um this undercurrent that leads to elements we're going to talk about in the renaissance and reformation is the sense of disillusionment with power structure um i i can you talk a little bit about how that was bubbling up because you were talking about how well you know a lot of people in this situation wouldn't have known better it was kind of the air they they breathed they wouldn't have known there was another possibility and yet the seeds of the renaissance and reformation were starting to be planted and there was this sense of disillusionment with the power structure can you talk about that before we lead into the next chapter of our story yeah absolutely there's definitely a sense of of disillusionment and and you know death was a way of life um and hierarchy was a way of life and so when you think about mortality rates uh you know the the primary popular culture was uh death is among us it was it was morbid it's ours moriani you know skeletons dancing and it's not just because you see you know members of your family dying in front of you on a regular basis it's partially because you have a lack of agency um and so what what are you gonna do um what choice do you have but to accept the hierarchy you can you can revolt and at times you did have you know peasant revolt some those are quickly swiftly and effectively put down and so essentially you're operating in an ether where you didn't have information to other people in a community and when you're isolated that tends to create a marked sense of disillusionment it was in everyone's best interest to keep things in a status quo and so um in some sense it was probably fortuitous that you know life was you know nasty hard and brutish and that your subsistence farming because uh if you had too much time to think you you wouldn't have liked your chances for improving your situation and as you mentioned before the bottom-up culture that you do have bubbling up is largely around celebration and blowing off steam around harvest and carnival and it was it was very uh very functional and very utilitarian you know the nature of the change you know there's definite cultural undercurrents where occasionally people people question the hierarchy but that uh that tends to be put down very effectively and the reason why that was put down whenever that would bubble up it would bubble out throughout the middle ages but it was put down with great precision speed and and an effect partially because the power structures controlled the information those ideas couldn't spread they're able to quarantine them very effectively and so that's one of the fundamental transitions that happens with a reformation the ideas that were always latent in the latter middle ages actually actually had a way to express themselves in a way that was not only permissionless but that was very difficult for the institutional power hierarchies to uh to put down so i think we've set up what the middle ages was like for the average commoner what this how the society was structured how the economy was structured but then came this change and that gets us kind of to the second chapter that we mentioned this age of enlightenment this renaissance and reformation so can you talk about how that change came to be and what it represented for people yeah that was that was a fundamental change it was absolutely cataclysmic and i think we under-appreciate the nature of that change that's why i i definitely appreciate taking a moment and sketching out the kind of bleak uh switch situation of an average individual in the middle ages is we take for granted now the ability to to act without permission to a certain degree or to share information or to communicate value but that was that was only a result of the renaissance and reformation and so what happened was there was an advent of two types of technology one around sharing value and another round of sharing information and both of them were decentralized or distributed or permissionless and them coming together created a situation that a number of individuals participated in it gave rise to new whole class of of people a working class mercantile class entrepreneurial class and that class of people it wasn't just that they were something new it was the idea that something could be new after a thousand years of stasis there was new technology which gave rise to a new community and they expressed itself through a through a native type of art which was likewise a technology so just to take a step back in the the renaissance and reformation if we follow these two through lines value in the middle ages was aggregated and that becomes distributed in the renaissance and reformation and that happened through around the advent of a new type of financial technology something called double entry bookkeeping or ledger based technology and for your audience they may be familiar with this but uh in in the 14th century this was this was radical it was magic the idea of a ledger where assets equaled liabilities and equities with the left side of a book being you know debit and right side credit it was popularized in the 14th century by a florentine merchant in the south of france and the renaissance is really a rebirth or a rediscovery or return to the sources ad fontes and this double entry booking was used in the roman empire plenty of elder mentions in the 70 a.d and there's jewish communities in north africa using it but essentially the medici family in the medici bank went back to the sources discovered the technology and popularized it and used double entry booking to completely rework the financial system it it allowed previously you had to stop everything and have a centralized accounting if you can imagine not knowing you know where your dollars are flowing at any given point in time i'll leave the parallels off for now but it was it was like magic to be able to have an accurate accounting at any point in time and it massively uh increased the power leverage velocity composability and granularity of money preventing duplicitous books and false forks and it gave rise to you know credit in a very specific system as well as a new host of financial products and the medici and not just the medici but the whole host of families and banks that that use this uh really became new players on the scene it was a new group vying for power for a thousand years it had been church or military political and now there's another group of financiers um and so they they bought their way into noble estates by buying titles and they also bought their way into ecclesiastical or church estates but fundamentally it was an economic rise to power powered by this ledger based technology which uh which uh which essentially turbo charged their economic fortunes and allowed them to buy their way into status and then you know following this line of value these new players express their status through a new type of art and it wasn't just machiavellian i have money and i want to buy art to reshape and recraft my narrative on how i establish my money and what it means for the society that's true but it's a bit deeper than that they cemented their status around using a new type of art and so in the middle ages everything was flat and symbolic you can think of it as 2d people didn't look like people they look like caricatures and if you're in the middle ages you've never seen a window or a mirror and so the idea of seeing a reflection of you or a representation of an image that looks realistic was unheard of and as the renaissance artist turned back to the roman and classical sources they were able to create hyper realistic renditions it was it was their vr and ar of the time where they're able to go back and paint pictures and do sculptures where it was just like being there and where you saw someone else in an image it was like magic and so the renaissance art was really an exercise in technology around this rediscovery of source material and these are names which we still know today it's botticelli and leonardo and michelangelo and this is how florence becomes the the cultural center of europe and so part of it's a flex around this new mercantile class but part of it is a qualitative and quantitative alignment of identity around not just the idea of their status but the idea that someone else could be new um the idea that it wasn't just you know church and political power as it had been for a thousand years but that uh but that uh a new player could enter the game as we chatted about the middle ages the idea of something new when it had entered their minds now here was something new and it had entered not just their minds but manifested in the world through this technology and so the medici ran with that they actually ended up taking the papacy as you know leo the tenth was medici and took the throne of france with catherine married in so this became de facto they essentially took over this power hierarchy this financial class and when they took it over they changed the nature of what was meaningful whereas in the middle ages there was sacred and profane there was holy and religious and there was everything else with this advent of the class you know tied to some of the doctrines that martin luther and the reformation were espousing at the time this new financial class re-thought what it meant to uh to be holy and to be doing god's work uh it wasn't just in a monastery it was actually doing your job even engaging in finance in the world and so while the holy roman empire was was in the fits and throws of international conflict with the turks and you know seizing land across in the new world they essentially were using this new proto-capitalism and this new financial ledger based technology to uh to fund themselves and as the reformation essentially dissolved the monasteries where people are cloistered in for the transmission of these documents this new huge you know up to 10 percent of the population are let loose from the monasteries and they tend to be literate and they don't want to go back to farming and so it introduced a whole new type of people into the workforce and they they found things that were good to do in and of the world itself instead of being cloistered away so you know books that you may be familiar with are like max weber and the protestant ethic and spirit of capitalism the point is that the common itself became something worth doing and doing your job in the world whether that was entrepreneurship or just interacting with your family and with your community became a good thing to do so that expressed itself in the art of the times these are names like rimband and vermeer and ruben this is why you have the ubiquitous fruit bowl right that the something as simple as a piece of fruit is is meaningful in itself and popular culture becomes significant as opposed to just sacred so i'll stop there that would be the three line where we move from aggregated value to distributed value really powered by this financial technology which gives rise to a new class of individual who express themselves through a new type of technology endemic through any type of art endemic to the same technology so the through lines that i'm seeing i think are so salient with what we are seeing today with the crypto world and so i just want to just uh rehash them and go through them again we we invent this new thing as humanity invents this new thing called double entry bookkeeping and it's this new technology it's actually it's not one thing it's not like we discovered a gold or we discovered this new item it's an idea it's something that we can all share we can we can pass around this idea of double entry bookkeeping and that is like it's like a mind virus it passes from person to person and uh and then all of a sudden this technology just becomes instantiated and this technology itself both creates value and allows for value to churn at the same time and so we're finally seeing churn in the world and this allows wealth to not only be created but also to proliferate around the people who didn't previously have wealth they were just farmers now that they now that they can access wealth and when people and the the other through line that i'm seeing is like when there is wealth that is created art starts to be created and culture starts to be created and specifically new forms of art what seems to whereas old art was 2d new art is 3d it's a it's a new it's a new um a new magnitude of what art can be and not only can we create new art but people can participate in that art not only in his creation but in is also its appreciation and it was all started with double entry bookkeeping and in the crypto world we have these new blockchains which are new ledger systems and we also have new art forms in nfts and digital art expression people are like getting head over heels about like are nfts valuable why are people paying for them are they cool and to some degree it just does not matter because people are paying for them and appreciating this new art form that is just blowing the minds of people who are not yet up to speed with this new culture that is being created and finally as a result of all this new things like all the the creation of all this new wealth this creation of all this new art is really changing how people perceive their own individual role in the world it's like i can make a difference i can do something for me for myself for i and it fits into the rest of the world uh and so like the the drawing the connections between the renaissance and what we are seeing come out of you know crypto networks ethereum defy i think is so incredibly strong and really made very saliently by the transition from a hierarchical late middle ages society into a more distributed more networked world that we saw in the renaissance and reformation uh joshua anything that you want to clarify or add on to that analysis no i think that's very well stated we could go in a couple different directions and there's there's even there's even analogies and some of the details that we could go into the type of art you know whether it's generative art versus there's a bunch of different ways we can take that but i think let's just keep it focused for the audience because that's that's absolutely salient and those are those are the main points to make you know very well said so absolutely so that's the that's the through line of value and you know the fundamental change to that was you know the hierarchy it wasn't just in stasis anymore there's a new player in the game and and they were expressing themselves they're able to enter the game by engaging in finance and that created mobility and velocity and then they fused their identity they they used as a lens through which to view you know the world in themselves around this art and the art had a particular type of expression which was tied to the way that they had made their money it was a rebirth and re uh returned to the sources around double entry bookkeeping just as it was returned to the sources around you know this hyper realistic you know fresco based you know detailed type of art versus 2d um the way that they so one question someone might ask and this is what you had asked earlier ryan you know as this was bubbling up throughout the middle ages you know what happened this was crushed again and again and again and again and so why wasn't the renaissance and reformation crashed in the way that the previous uh the previous attempts at this sort of reform were crushed and part of the answer to that question is around now they have money and there's a new player in the game now they're able to really coalesce around identity through this art but the third league of the stool that's incredibly salient is there's a new type of not just financial technology but information technology that essentially is likewise permissionless and prevents it from prevents it from being boxed in and quarantined and so whereas in the middle ages you know information was centralized in the reformation information was fundamentally decentralized and it was really around this permissionless tech which was uh which was just arguably just as important as the advent of financial ledger based tech and so with uh with the middle with you know the 14th century gutenberg popularized this new type of technology which had radical decentralization you know the printing press didn't have a kill switch and it was this fundamental it challenged the institutions of power and transformed them it placed him in a conundrum and uh and eventually won them over and then generally endured this whole class of meme artists that happened at topple an empire so on permissionless tech you know ideas could be could be you didn't need permission to share an idea whereas in the middle ages information was recorded on a manuscript which is a piece of parchment or or a piece of paper where things are written by hand it's incredibly expensive more than a year's worth of salary it's limited it's slow it's difficult to archive and protect with the printing press um they could anyone could print you know uh nobles and roman catholic church attempted to regulate the industry and required people printers to register you can think about it like kyc almost and some people of course complied but all it took was a rogue printer and a room off the grid in a few hours and somebody had documents they could they could send everywhere at such speed that they were almost redundant and you can think about it in terms of permalab and so this new culture was born with an explosion and in the number of texts in it it created new formats as well where originally the print based culture was a replication of what had been done in manuscript meaning if you know you had an academic dispute between closed doors and somebody took notes on it the first generation of printing would print that and it would be in a very similar format the second generation of printing and the reformation created a new medium which was endemic to the nature of the technology meaning instead of just reproducing things as they were before they created these pamphlets they're called flute trifton it was a it was you know a big broad sheet which had an image on it and big bold you know type and just limited words and even if you weren't literate you could understand what was going on and if you were semi-literate you could get the gist of it and someone could read it to you and so you know one way you can think about it is a shift of what happened with newspapers eventually putting starting out by putting pdfs online and then moving to an interactive format that's what happened with this this print based format um where they pushed these fluke drift under these pamphlets which had images on them and conveyed radical ideas and a family could now afford one or a traveler could pack his bag full of them and and share them all over and it wasn't just that the ideas themselves were radical which they were and we can get into but the idea that anyone could share an idea you didn't need permission to share this idea that was a fundamental breakthrough and so it posed a real challenge to the institutional power structures you know if you're if you're the roman catholic church or a political regime which isn't favorable to this and you've always claimed that you have the sole authority to create an idea much less share an idea and now ideas are being shared through this new print culture what are you going to do are you going to just sit back and let it gain ground and let it gain popularity that's one option the only other option is to engage in that print culture itself and to engage in the the back and forth to print your own material but if you do that you can see the point that you're the only one who has authority to create and distribute information you legitimize the competition and so uh so that's ultimately what they ended up doing the latter option and thereby legitimizing the competition and uh and this created an explosion of information at scale which made it very difficult to put back and uh put back in the bottle and there's a whole there's a whole genesis of audit chains and creation and transmission and a new marketplace of remixes and compendiums and copies without permission and so this this advent of print-based technology which was fundamentally permissionless was one of the reasons why it was very difficult for for anyone to uh to keep the stasis that had dominated the middle ages and part of that was the nature of the printing press itself that people were generating ideas and then part of it was the ideas they generated and the ideas they generated were were very radical in terms of the challenging those claims of authority and so so i can kind of go on into a couple examples of those before we take a position you know what i want to i want to put myself in the place of a bankless listener because if you're a typical bankless listener absorbing bankless content what josh is just talking about probably sent some some shivers down your back right because you're immediately seeing the parallels with crypto right so we have the middle ages which was an era of of centralization top-down authority limited self-sovereignty uh very permissioned lot not permissionless now we have the advent of something new they didn't know it was called it was going to be later called a renaissance at the time um but there were two incredibly important technologies permissionless technologies open technologies distributed decentralized technologies that came about the first was a value transfer protocol we used the term protocol as kind of a you know technology sort of a shared coordination tool for society that was double entry bookkeeping so a new permissionless ledger technology if you will for a value transfer and you've got the second piece of technology that comes about at the same time and that is a new communication protocol a new permissionless communication protocol wow interesting we've got this rise of the medici maybe a a ledger native a crypto native class that starts to change the society from from the bottom to the top starts to gain influence starts to influence culture uh in art in all sorts of ways and the really the the reason the argument that you're making josh the reason for the reformation and the renaissance this new era was actually uh technology in nature and it's interesting because but i'm not you know i'm gone down amateur historian i enjoy history all of these things but i haven't heard that argument emphasized as much that the renaissance itself was actually the catalyst for the renaissance was these two permissionless technologies a new communication protocol it sounds similar to the internet now a new ledger protocol sounds maybe similar to to crypto i'm sure we'll get to those things but why do you why is your position josh that um it was really these technologies that brought about the renaissance and influenced everything else uh why were those the catalysts yeah that's that's a really good question i think it's a it's somewhat one of the reasons why i'm not a historian anymore just because the lack of a practical applicability in terms of applying the tools of history to uh to the current state um that's why uh it's like when crypto first came on the scene and we had you know sold the previous company which we did to publicly trade company and started investing crypto back in 17 i was immediately struck by the idea that crypto wasn't just a technology or new type of technology it was a new way of social organization and the parallels to what i had studied in history were immediate and salient and and that was such a large transformation that uh that i couldn't not get in on it and i think part of it is because historians are our people in their time sometimes we forget about that um just as if you looked at a medieval historian at that point in time they wouldn't have been able to articulate uh they would have looked at the things on the surface of the ocean they would have said well this emperor died and this next temper took over and this pope did this and the next pope did that they're looking at kind of great men in history but underneath with the currents those are those are fundamentally driven by by by what you might call transmission vectors and those become technological in the early modern era around the reformation and so it's not a it's not a trendy thing to look at in history in terms of today but i think i think it's not just that it's technology it's that it's permissionless and distributed technology and that fundamentally changes the nature of history and that it it allows ideas to to be communicated without coordination which means there is no kill switch where previously an emperor pope could put their finger here and stop a movement that didn't happen this time with the renaissance and reformation partially because of this technology and in fairness i mean there are we could go on we could do philosophical or theological kind of context or all of this you know in some sense this was a return to the sources right ad fontes renaissance the the ledger based technology wasn't de nova it wasn't new it was a return to what had been done in the roman empire the art and the hyper realism although it had been lost for a thousand years it was a return to what had been done the printing press the printing press largely was new but it was it was popularized and met that moment at the precise time when the financial technology unlocked that and so why do i think this drives history partially because you know rather than saying there's great men of history taking agency i think communities actually create history but the historical problem for communities to actually act in a coordinated effort has been how do you achieve that coordination both in terms of value and money and information for for orchestrating it and so these these aren't just technologies for the sake of technologies they get at the the two particular things that drive history how do you motivate people and compensate them and how you share uh ideas in a way that can't be locked i don't know that's a good answer to question but that's at least how i think about it it's a great answer oh my god communities create history that is uh that that is tweetable sir and i i think i think bankless listeners are continuing to see the parallels here i i wanna before we leave you know the two technologies the new distributed ledger technology and the new communication uh protocol the the printing press i want to talk maybe a little bit about how those how those intersect because both of those technologies not only are they permissionless but they're also unstoppable and as you hint it at um you know authorities did try to stop them in various ways like let's let's try to put a restriction aml kyc on these printing presses that didn't work out so well but it was also not just one technology but both of them to together sort of the confluence of them and uh bankless listener if you were beginning to see the confluence of our new distributed communication protocol which which is tcp which is which is the internet which is a meme and coordination uh propagation layer and that's that we've said often uh before that crypto uh and this new distributed ledger technology would not have been possible of course with without the internet but also because the internet serves as a meme propagation layer and a narrative propagation layer that allows a new distributed self-sovereign money system to grow from the bottom up and that's kind of what we're seeing with the confluence of this new distributed ledger double entry bookkeeping system and and the printing press because people could communicate using modern parlance they could communicate memes and spin narratives and distribute them to the people at a rate that the authorities couldn't stop and so this enabled bottom-up revolutions let's talk about that a little more no that's great it's yeah the speed and velocity i mean essentially just taking a step back you know we because we're in this historical moment we we see the internet as different from crypto right we think uh you know the internet happened and now it's coming into its legs and and now crypto has started but but really you know one way to look at it is they're they're part and parcel of the same thing i mean the cypherpunks wanted information without kill switches and value without kill switches and we saw the advent of the internet um but it's always had a kill switch and so only right now with permaweb what i mean is you know are weave or blockchain based you know communication technology which is cryptographic in nature that really is the the fulfillment of the internet and so in that sense communicating bytes of information or bytes information that represent value are fundamentally the same thing you know it's only been a few years we'll look back on this in a period of history and say this was all cryptography the internet was was cryptography when it finally came into its own right um and so yeah your point is well taken that allow both of those being permissionless it allows a speed and velocity bottom up always wins and self-organization always wins it's bizarre over the cathedral every single time because uh when you have ten thousand people you know engaging and organizing it's very difficult to tamp that down with command and control and that was essentially what happened in the in the middle ages the authorities weren't able to do that and so they had to they couldn't ignore the medium so they had to participate in it and by participating in it they thereby legitimized it um uh you can make all sorts of analogies for for fiat and digital currency if you felt like doing that the other thing i guess i would say is that the ideas that they were sharing you know they're definitely not just kind of memes and silliness for the sake of silliness but memes as we know have this semiotic function where they're they communicate something broader and more important than themselves and so the ideas that they were sharing you know were fundamentally uh challenging to the power structures right so people like martin luther they looked back and they they used these same tools and techniques and audited this source code of power you know where the roman catholic church had built an economic system around penance you know doing penance giving alms purchasing indulgences you know luther and company looked back you know from the latin into the greek and you know penitentiary magite do penance becomes metanoia which is repent and so the the power system it isn't accident anymore and so all the economics go crashing down around that or you know you had asked earlier ryan about uh you know the political and military arm and and layer in the middle ages well the roman catholic church had won that won that power struggle partially because they were able to get the emperor to to to repent and do penance but partially because they had this document this document was called the donation of constantine and it was the roman emperor constantine giving temporal and military authority to the church well um that was shown to be a middle uh a forgery from the middle ages using these new forensic source code technologies oh my god it happened that not only caused massive you know instability to the roman catholic uh claim on temporal authority but to the core claim of people without infallibility and so if you're a farmer and you're hearing about this sort of stuff it causes you to say hey what else might i question or if you're a german you know city trying to figure out should i join this reformation thing and should we get rid of the monasteries and seize that land for itself and take the money and perhaps redistribute it to the people it uh it causes me to question other things and so very similar to the idea of not just speed and velocity of sharing ideas but the nature was not only something new but it caused me to question the core claims of authority and you could make all sorts of parallels to core claims of nation state authority that we're starting to see through the internet um right now but the thing i'd like to i guess a salient point of that whole piece of context is that when we look at how these these are profound they're complex they're super heady difficult ideas and they had always been challenged historically through closed-door academic debate and dispute but now they could be printed and when they're printed as you're pointing out they achieved this velocity and the velocity of the spread of ideas they achieved wasn't around reproducing the old media it was around a new form of media and so the best way to communicate that core challenge to people infallibility you know martin luther was you know uh was a professor of the bible and philosophy right but instead of printing instead of printing core academic disputations he printed these the only way to describe them accurately is to call them memes there were these fluke drift and pamphlets which just had images right and a couple of the images that he used were seared into the popular imagination it was you know one was uh one well-known one from on the the depiction of the papacy in 1534 is around you know peasants uh flatulating that's a fancy academic word for farting in the general direction another one is where they're defecating or pooping into the papal tiara and probably most wildlife josh for our youtube listeners i'm gonna actually pull these up because you you sent these to us and i was super intrigued these are like images of of demon spooping of peasants um uh farting in the presence of the pope um we've described these pictures despicable yeah unholy to my modern sensibilities absolutely profane and they're saying hey we we know that this institution has no real power it's making claims of authority that doesn't have and so the whole thing comes crashing down and the best way to express that wasn't in a fancy latin uh disputation that only a few people could read and it wasn't even in vernacular german that more people could read it was by this woodcut or this copper etching where it shows you know 16th century german farmers essentially pulling down their pants and you know farting out clouds of gas towards the pope basically and saying this is how we this is how we deal with these false claims of authority we don't recognize these or another one is where they're literally pooping in the the three-tiered table tierra saying that the claims you've made are false and that's unholy it's actually antichrist it's one of the reasons they thought the world was going to end and so the best way to repay that is you're pooping almost as a holy act you're doing that to show people how uh how ridiculous the nature of the claim is and then the image on the left if you're looking at that you see a variety of demons and it's called the birth of the papal curia the demons are pooping out the uh the various bishops and cardinals and there's one usa demon with snakes in her hair and she's suckling the the pope and you know he's the pope because he has the the three-tiered papal tear on there and so this is what martin luther you know he engaged in a great deal of you know fancy academic disputation but essentially he was saying hey this spiritual hierarchy is illegitimate these claims of authority are not legitimate and he flattened it with a doctrine called priesthood of all believers which essentially said there's there's no mediation in this philosophical or theological realm and so instead of making that argument disputation he made it with this image with a pooping demon pooping out the pope and uh that as you might expect was much more pot anytime you engage in like mass you know culture it always degenerates in eschatology right and so it only matters um but the point of the story is these images were wildly popular and once and for a reason once they're in your head you can't unsee them they're viral they're viral so so martin luther was like just like printing out these images these memes and then distributing them to you to the peasant class and the peasant class though they were illiterate though they were poor they instantly caught the message that he was sending and caught the narrative yep yep and actually he operated within a network kind of an informal community which had different ties of affinity and value and information i mean you could almost think of it in terms of a guild's not i mean the best historical analogy of it is a dow it's this informal self-organizing network ground value and information and so this was his this was so he was working with a printer the illustrator was an artist that he commissioned called lucas chronic the elder um there are specific printers in the network that printed off grid and skirted kyc they were incredibly popular and they were there were these communal events you know people opened them up in taverns and they read them and even if you weren't literate you got the idea and we underestimate the the individual at that time they didn't just get the idea that ha ha it's funny to be pooping in a papal hat or that the demons given birth to the pope they understood the core idea that this spiritual hierarchy was illegitimate and you need to flatten that and sometimes you need to you need to use profanity even even eschatology is a very intentional weapon that's very similar to the i mean the memes you see today everybody no one likes the unicorn because it's pretty it means something else right the unicorn means you know ethereum or it means decentralized or ultimately it means you know agency and autonomy that's why people resonate with it not just because they like the colors if if any bankless listener thinks that meme culture started with the internet uh let's let's zoom out here and realize that meme culture perhaps started with a printing press right and the the reason why these little little graphics of demons pooping work so well was because they you didn't need to be literate you could see the image and you could feel it it was an emotional response and inside of this very primitive disgusting image was deep deep meaning about the world that in that these people lived inside and it was spreadable it was viral everyone resonated with it and the reason that everyone resonated with it was why it worked in the first place and when we talked about early in the in the uh the dark middle ages the late middle ages about why revolutions were so easily stamped out is because they didn't have viral technologies and the printing of these memes allowed people to band together under a common banner of the establishment the hierarchy it's illegitimate and it's this technology that allowed people to band together under this shared banner like unveiling that the unveiling the cloak or drawing the the curtain back and showing that the emperor has no clothes but also showing that everyone else also sees the emperor without no clothes which is which is incredibly important josh i want to take us down a side quest uh real quick after this but i want to i want to give you the floor one last time before i do that oh sure yeah let me just uh finish this and there's actually another layer to it too in that uh and that even these internet memes that you're talking about you know they're silly and it's you know kind of common material that was also something you know if you go back to the reformation typically you're printing you're printing kind of holy text or sacred text that was what had dominated the middle ages you're not you're not you're printing things that are are religious or sacred and meanings defined within that sphere and so when you have the rise of this double-entry bookkeeping and a rise of a new class and they're sharing these ideas the ideas they're sharing aren't just profane but they're also they're also common in a technical sense meaning the the the job you do the finance you undertake the things you do in the world are are worthy in and of themselves for uh to be rendered as ideas that you share as art that you might uh that you might commemorate and so this rise of the common outside the the approved was uh was an incredibly important and powerful notion and that was also luther on this this doctrine of vocation where you just serve god by being locked away in a monastery you could be out in the world with your family and your friends and your community and undertaking commerce and that was a good and honorable thing to do and and worthy of being commemorated and so as that took rise you know as you trace the story and you know throughout the 16th and 17th century you have the the rise of uh proto-capitalism and the low countries that powers the whole empire and so likewise again you get art which is endemic to the nature of the technology these you know these these fruit bowls that are everywhere because the common itself is worth rendering and it's it's holy and so um this is all driven by the meme and it's really important to understand that as you're you're flattening that hierarchy um you know that's a that's a sophisticated argument that never took hold before and essentially you know woodcuts of demons pooping did something that the the emperor and all his armies couldn't do they took down the roman catholic church and you know each time the the art and community expression is endemic to the nature of the technology you know in the 14th century you have you have you know frescoes with hyper realism coming out of you know new fintech you have meme based woodcuts coming out of information technology and then you have rise of mercantile class with you know hyper realistic you know common is actually being holy and dutch realism and so that's sort of where the story typically ends if this were if this were a lecture and you started out in centralization and you've looked at these technologies which decentralize and radicalize value and information in terms of rendering them without permission what happens next that's my real area of expertise which is wars of religion and you know chaos and armageddon breaks out for a while and then the pendulum swings back and it swung back into rise of the nation state and that that characterizes our age down until today um and then i guess my argument or the parallel that at least i see is instead of having separate religious and political hierarchies or cultural and religious hierarchies that are that have become that are going to unwind over time into a period of chaos through ledger-based tech and information tech we have a nation-state where these two things are fused together and that's the exact parallel moment we're in now so hopefully that kind of ties off the story and sets us up for a side quest just to draw one last comparison for for the listeners is there are two memes for me that come to mind two modern day memes that come to mind that are intentionally meant to make the the receiver of the meme question authority uh and one is money printer go bur where that is a direct assault on the legitimacy of the dollar and the value of the dollar perhaps the world's largest institution these days money printer go bur the dollar is not sound another meme that comes to mind is that uh jeffrey epstein didn't kill himself uh that's another one where it's where people are saying hey like we don't know what happened but you we also know what happened like we know that jeffrey epstein didn't kill himself uh there are powers that be that are masking that are masking the truth in reality and we don't know what they are but it doesn't matter because we know something is going on here and these are and the reason why these memes are shared is because everyone the populist resonates with them uh and and so i just wanted to to drive that one last connection before we move on from memes i love just uh on the mean topic too that i just did a google search for money printer go bur and there are so many variations so like permissionless homemade variations of the same meme that this cannot be stopped it cannot be deleted from the internet if it ever was i mean the people would just create new ones and propagate it and it's something that is completely unstoppable by authorities even if they wanted to stop it it's a it's a perfect historical parallel that's what once the once authorities engaged in that sort of uh exchange uh things went they went viral they remixed you had compendiums he had once it was permissionless everybody was doing different versions of of demon's pooping i mean essentially money printer gober is a historical analogy of you know demons pooping in a papal tierra it's a it's taking a sharp knife and pricking you know at the source of authority in the middle ages it was the pope for us it's the dollar and the fiat based dollar the nation state i think it's perfectly historically valid right and josh something you said earlier was that all of the armies of you know all of uh pope competitors couldn't do anything that a demon pooping uh that a pooping demon could do right and like we all know that the power of the dollars is uh upheld by the power of the u.s military yet it is pricked by a money printer go burr meme uh absolutely absolutely fascinating hey guys i hope you are enjoying the podcast episode with josh so far this is such a fun episode and i'm really happy that we were able to draw some of these really crazy cool connections what comes next in the second half of this podcast is we talk about the comparing and contrasting of martin luther and satoshi nakamoto and what happens when somebody did something without asking for permission that really questioned the ability of the establishment to maintain control and also was a very intentful political statement that took down the authorities and then josh does a fantastic job guiding us through the rest of these comparisons while also leaving the bankless nation with a bunch of very specific actionable items now if you believe this narrative if you believe that this comparison is true how do you take on the revolution rather than the revolution dictating your life what can you do to front run the revolution and have that revolution work for you rather than against you really really appreciated josh coming on to the podcast and sharing this perspective and also leaving bankless listeners with some actionable takeaways so stay tuned for the second half of this podcast but first we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency

released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option

have backing them check out the power of ave at dot com that's a aave dot com josh i want to take us down a quick rabbit hole here because i i think we would be remiss if we didn't finish up the conversation on the renaissance talking about the protestant uh reformation the protestant revolution and martin luther's pinning of the theses onto the the church uh and so just as a just as a backstory martin luther really kicked off the the protestant revolution by uh basically publicly uh doing something to publicly acknowledge the illegitimacy of the church talking about how the uh the the tithes that are being paid is just it's really just corruption and what martin luther was doing was saying the church is corrupt it's illegitimate i'm i'm pinning my nailing my theses to the door and to me i see a lot of parallels between martin luther and satoshi nakamoto and so i want to i want to drive these comparisons uh behind you and ask ask you how well do these two figures resonate with each other and the three lines that i see is that neither satoshi nor martin luther asked for permission both of them took it upon themselves to make a political statement and to also empower a revolution both had both sparked a process of creative destruction of old corrupt institutions in order to create a decentralized network of new institutions where the catholic church is a centralized top-down hierarchy and the protestant religion is a decentralized bottom-up organization and they also both created a cambrian explosion of forks where as soon as we forked away from the catholic church and the catholic revolution the protestant one of the the reasons why the protestant religion never took over is because people forked that and then forked that and forked that and forked that and just like how we went from three canonical television channels to three million youtubers the mar and also what satoshi did was go from one canonical blockchain or one canonical uh you know the dollar to an infinite explosion of blockchains all of these parallels are coming together to me how does that land with you that's that's i i couldn't have said that better i think that's spot on on a number of levels i would have i would have i would have taken longer to get to that point i think no i mean i also i personally like my personal thesis is also that satoshi like luther was a deep industry insider who knew in his conscience that this had to be done even begrudgingly knowing what deep consequences it would bring from you know unintended consequences as you long-term destabilize these power hierarchies and it's necessary and exciting but not something to be taken lightly and so regardless of where you fall out on that both he and luther were able to kick start this network effect and and really convert people and create a zealous following partially because the thing they unleashed had a power to itself with luther no one could read the bible he rendered it into common vernacular so people who actually have direct access to the source code and that took on a life itself the same thing with satoshi like by having economic value through code which doesn't require permission um that that allows you that that thing has a power in and of itself and so i think that's that's i think we'll look back on satoshi the way we look at luther you know 500 years from now quite honestly maybe we'll know who who or what he is the analogies are incredible and we have already covered so much so i'm going to return to the to the road map the that we set out to uh at the beginning of this episode so we we talked about really this this pendulum uh switch where in the middle ages we had this era of um economic disempowerment lack of self-sovereignty lack of freedom this this era of centralization top-down authority and then the pendulum swung in the other direction in the renaissance in the reformation to self-sovereignty to the rise of the medici class the the crypto natives of their time if you will and all of this was catalyzed by uh two really important technologies the first was a ledger technology double entry bookkeeping and the propagation of that standard of that shared myth if you will and the second was the printing press protocol this new communication protocol these two technologies together sort of shook the world and i think that like if you know as we transition to uh the era that we're in now which maybe we'll call this i don't know what historians will call it into the future josh but let's just call it the nation state era the era that we're in i just want to take a minute to say that the nation state era is a much it's a more centralized um era i think we we've swung the pendulum to the other in the other direction this is a bit more like the the middle ages than uh an an era of decentralization and freedom but maybe we're on the cusp of something new and we'll get to that but i just want to mention that um we have so much to be thankful for all of the freedoms that we now enjoy the fact that we are not um agrarian peasants with absolutely no rights the fact that we have a bill of rights in fact we have constitution and um democratic processes we can thank the renaissance and reformation for those things so i i don't want us to put ourselves in the position of you know a 12th century peasant we're doing much better than a 12th century peasant yet at the same time i think many who are listening to the bankless podcast many who live life uh today in in western society feel this sense of um disenchantment feel the sense of um i'm not in control feel the sense of something has to change the power structures are illegitimate and um this is not good right so so we feel in some ways like that 11th like that 12th century uh peasant um so so tee us up we are now and the pendulum has switched in the other direction though we are we are building on some of the freedoms that we established in the renaissance and reformation we have centralized in these top-down nation-state type structures and we are on the cusp of something new a new renaissance maybe a crypto renaissance tee that up for us now josh where are we at this juncture in history yeah i think that's spot on and that's really that's a great way to to describe it um you know it's not as overt that we have you know a medieval lord telling us how what we can do and what we can say and what we can share but you definitely have the pendulum swinging back and forth and it may make you know ticks and talks moving in a direction you know the the theorists talk about thesis and antithesis and synthesis but the the point of the story is that uh is that yeah we absolutely have moved back to centralization and so in the middle ages you know hyper centralization uh renaissance and reformation this unwinding there's a period of chaos after that which is characterized by wars of religion and all sorts of uh all sorts of chaos um and in that vacuum the nation state found itself the nation state ultimately co-opted so many of those same tools double-entry bookkeeping and you know printing press um and that was how they that was uh that was essentially what characterized the rise of the nation state is we're here today it's it's very similar you can think of history it's a heuristic construct meaning don't confuse the model with the thing itself but it's very good in terms of explanatory power um saying that we're in a centralized you know period right now just maybe more subvert or covert and not as obvious as it was before and then even within the micro the the micro you know dynamic of it where technology had started out more decentralized and is now increasingly uh centralized whether it's ai or fang um there's there's a micro ticking and talking back so yeah i think the moment is very similar to what we saw in the latter middle ages people didn't know what's going on there's general sense of unease they knew that things were higher like hierarchically orchestrated and that they didn't have the agency that they wanted to have nonetheless there was a burgeoning of different types of technology which uh which were fundamentally different than we had seen before and i think that's the exact point we're at right now can we talk about those technologies then it is still early and i think people don't realize to your point earlier josh how early we are in the trajectory of these technologies and the trajectory of the internet the internet's what you know two three decades old you know maybe four at most and certainly hasn't been mainstream for nearly that long uh crypto is a decade old these technologies are just being born today but already we see the seeds of change that they might bring and one is interestingly enough a communication protocol the modern printing press an unstoppable permissionless protocol that allows us to communicate all around the world and the second is this double entry bookkeeping solution this immutable cryptographic ledger that they've created what seeds of of change do you think uh we will see as a result of these technologies is this are we at kind of a junction point in history where we're about to enter a a new thing a different kind of renaissance a digital renaissance a crypto renaissance if you will yeah no i think that's absolutely the case and so that point's very well made that's historians will look back you know 500 when we think of the early modern era we think of the printing press and that's what characterizes that age and we think that's what uh that's what gave us a number of the liberties and individual rights we have and that was the high point of technology and up until recently up until a couple decades ago that still was the high point of technology right the printing press it lasted for hundreds of years and characterized the the ability to share information and engage information and mass media you know the newspaper for hundreds of years and so historians a thousand years from now or 500 years from now will will look back and say things changed fundamentally with two different distributed technologies just like they did in the renaissance and reformation coming into finding their feet in the early 21st century and they'll they'll they'll have academic debates and conferences trying to parse out the exact year was it 2021 or was it 2020 maybe it was 2019 we don't exactly know but now that that's that's that's absolutely the case that uh that being able to share information in mass we did that previously through printing things on paper you know the internet itself yeah i think are weave is a great example of this right like this perma web where you know the the arab spring won't happen again because there's kill switches on that that's not the case with this next generation of communication protocols which are cryptographically hashed and so we've never had from a historical perspective the opportunity or technology that allows the the rise of the sovereign individual as a sovereign unit of value much less information that hasn't ever been the case before we approximated it in historical analogy in the reformation but this time i think we're going to do it at scale and in a magnitude of order the change from the latter middle ages to what we have today is it's going to be a magnitude of order larger the change that we're in the middle of now between what's going to come when we look back that sounds kind of odd to say but ironically paradoxically historically when you're in the middle of a middle change the bigger the change the more difficult it is to understand the significance of it at that point in time until you reach a breaking point and so uh i think we're in a massive change that's why we only have these these kind of hints and riddles about that general disillusionment an idea that value can be communicated without permission in our gut we know it's important and we know it's big that we we can't yet imagine the societal transformation this transformative impact just like the the medieval farmer couldn't yet imagine the idea of bookkeeping and what a mercantile class would actually mean um and et cetera et cetera i think there's one significant difference that i see between the the renaissance the the now we have to differentiate between the renaissances so the the renaissance is in the 13th and 1400s in europe and the crypto renaissance that we believe that we are embarking upon is that the original renaissance the renaissance of italy and florence uh that had an epicenter where it bled out from and it it the ripples bled out from europe out to the rest of the world with the crypto renaissance there is no epicenter it exists on the internet you can tap into the renaissance wherever you are on the world which means that the magnitude is perhaps greater but also the velocity and speed of this revolution can happen instantaneously because we don't have to wait for this renaissance to ripple out to other rest of the world everyone can access it equally from across the whole entire world that's the now that's an absolutely great point i mean in the in academic circles you can actually map out the nodes on the network with the printing press and how ideas are disseminated and you see it geographically kind of spreading slowly over time year after year decade after decade yeah that's a great point the velocity this time is hyperbolic it's a yeah magnitude of order faster greater velocity and i think fundamentally societal impact as well where previously you had the rise of a new class and that's great but the majority of the population is still agricultural but at least you could do something new if you wanted to this time literacy isn't just five percent it's it's uh it's much more significant and so i think we you know if the reformation was this crucible where you had all these pieces in the pot at the right time you know powered by technology um which prevented it from being tamped down i think we have you know a very similar situation just with with uh we're doing it with plutonium this time so josh i want you i'm hoping you can paint a picture for the the bankless listener and um and perhaps even specifically the the younger people who listen who are part of this digital revolution i think most of this digital crypto revolution are younger people but specifically talking about the zoomers and the millennials who i feel are feel complete more specifically um rejected from modern institutions and are specifically looking for uh optimism and opportunity in a world where there doesn't seem to be churn and so if we can extrapolate what it was like to be like a farmer in the dark ages versus a a renaissance man in the 1400s and extrapolate that into you know young people coming out of college who are looking to find their place in the world and they're not seeing the opportunity that they really want to see how can we get how can we give these people this optimism about the future that uh i i think is coming with this whole crypto renaissance drawing drawing the parallels back from the old renaissance of course yeah no i think that's i think that's uh i i think they're right not to rely on institutions of the time the people who made out the best during their last renaissance and reformation were those who who intentionally broke from the institutions of power and forged out on their own way and embraced the technology both communication and financial to uh to improve their own social situation they they essentially opted out of the of the system of hierarchy that was the first time they had the the opportunity to do that so it's always it's always difficult and scary anytime you're in that situation and you're breaking away from what has happened before and what your friends and family are doing those who moved first had a disproportionate and asymmetric advantage advantage to do so so the overall optimism would be that it's very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle historically once these types of technologies are out in the world they tend to unravel power hierarchies it's just how it that's just how it works over time and so you want to be on the right side of that by all means don't don't latch yourself to one of these power hierarchies particularly at this moment in time step out and uh and engage with the technology uh itself explore the frontier as we say on the bankless podcast explore the front and there's some very specific things that they can do around that rather than just being like totally philosophical around it um you generally want yeah let's get so let's get into them josh because i think a lot of people at this point in the podcast might be persuaded that you know they've listened to enough bankless they've listen they've seen enough that's going on in crypto they know the current situation um they're they're believing the story right that we are in this junction uh in history this point in history where we are transitioning from an old set of institutions in a centralized set of institutions to a new set of institutions that are decentral decentralized and so they're wondering how to be ready for that right how to how to position themselves in the the medici uh group rather than um you know those that are are kind of left behind by the technology yeah so we want to be part of martin luther's crew and par part of the future and not part of the past so you put together some action items for us and this is the last um piece of our road map that uh that we want to run through which is some concrete ways that people can uh get get involved and get ready for this crypto renaissance that might be coming um the first that you mentioned is engaging in crypto art and it's so interesting that you put art as number one talk about what people can do and why engaging in art crypto art is important no that's yeah that's that's absolutely right and and back to your earlier point about you know optimism on this in case i didn't hammer this clearly enough all three of these action items kind of flow from the idea that you know rarely do you get an opportunity to to participate in something you know so meaningful on a historical scale where all the cards are being reshuffled right and so take advantage of the opportunity by all means and so i know you guys like action items so here are some here are some uh some particular ideas so crypto art so if you believe this historical narrative then then you would conclude that nfts are real and they're here to stay and that really art is the culmination of and actually they're the culmination of popular art using distributed technology and historically each culture expresses its identity as an art endemic to the nature of that transformation right and so you know aka new tech goes hand in glove with cultural transformation and emerging art so in the 14th century you had this ledger based tech you know finding its feet with a version of ar and vr this hyper-realistic renaissance fresco 16th century information tech uh you know found its identity and using this uh this art and a version of me warfare the demon blue pooping fluke drifting right 17th century financial trades and ryzen mercantile and proto-capitalism found beauty in the mundane around the sacred with dutch masters doing these fruit bowls at each time the art seems at odd it just seems odd to the power holders right but they eventually adopt and then appropriate it and so you want to get in on the right side of it not just for rallying around community but uh but uh purchase it participate in it you know buy early it's it's not it's not it's not something to be taken lightly as silly as some of the things may seem it's very funny uh david and i on uh one bankless podcast weekly recap actually just replayed sort of the reaction from the the good morning america crew and they were trying to describe what nfts were and they were laughing about it it's like so somebody is pick purchasing an image on the internet how ridiculous is that this is a fad this is kind of just going to go by the wayside you're saying ignore that noise ignore the old legacy media institutions because if this crypto renaissance is coming um this art is going to be important it makes sense that people art nfts would sell for for millions of dollars and you're encouraging people to to get involved and figure out this crypto art movement yeah the art actually might be more important than the finance which sounds crazy to say um but i think there might be something to that or at least at least they might they might be the same thing at the end of the day if if crypto is really a means societal transformation you know the value access and information access is important but being able to communicate that object of value not as a byte representing a mark on a ledger but as something that has meaning and of itself might be more important you know said differently like look if you're you're you're millennial you're a zoomer and you're like what am i going to do right maybe i'll i'll buy some stock okay i'll buy a fidelity account a robinhood account once you realize you don't actually own that stock anyway but you just have an iou then you know what am i going to do maybe coke or ge nah tesla might be more interesting well maybe instead of test like and i can use these nfts and cross-collateralize them right and actually yield from that well now i can you know find whatever floats my boat i can do that with you know teenage mutant ninja turtles if i want to and so maybe an nft about tesla and elon musk no exactly exactly right so now i'm now i'm finding something if it's all arbitrary anyway and turtles all the way down at shared consensus technology that allows you to do it why not find something that has meaning for you and for the community so it actually might be the same thing particularly when you start doing things like nft phi and you're able to cross-collateralize off an nft instead of a protocol i think this just might be a historical aberration where we see these things as different things i think nfts actually might be the real thing itself long term lingerie so fascinating okay that's number one get involved in the crypto art scene the nft scene if you will and of course all of these technologies combined so nfts as finance are the same as as defy as well you can get involved through a dow there's all sorts of ways to plug in all of these things have a certain amount of confluence let's talk about number two uh this is super interesting it's something we also preach on bankless which is your action item is for people to prep with crypto what do you mean by prep yeah this is this is uh you know in a nutshell just expect some serious upheaval cultural and geopolitical um and on one hand you know that seems like an easy prediction to make but it's especially salient in from this historical perspective each time you see a technological and cultural shift from aggregation to disaggregation things get really interesting really dicey you know it's not just fourth turning type of stuff but this long deray or these mega century trends or super trends colliding it's not based on generational turning or calendars but on technological impact with which the pendulum swings from aggregation to disaggregation and then back centralized again and during that swing back from chaos to co-option things tend to get really dicey and so you know i'm based in in kentucky and so prepping's kind of a way of life here i guess um but the point is you know prep with some digital assets instead of just canned corn this time so you know put get some digital assets put some in cold storage make sure your nfts are on permaweb right this is a way to get ready for political upheaval societal upheaval is having these assets in a place being in control of your private keys that's what you're talking about here yeah absolutely i mean even taking it as far as being able to hash things out with paper and remember a seed phrase i mean it's uh i i wouldn't i know it sounds kind of crazy in tinfoil haddish but i i definitely give some serious thought to that it's a side bet which i think you'd be on the right side of history making um especially you know if you're a zoomer and you're talking about the next 30 40 years um yeah i'd expect some serious upheaval at that point so i definitely use crypto as the means of crapping that is definitely not a fringe idea on bankless thank you for articulating it in the way you did with it concrete action step i hope people are listening let's get to the third this is important as well and this is working for crypto maybe working for for dows are you talking about uh yeah what are you talking about here josh yeah so essentially find a new way to make a living um and so if you think about the late middle ages you're a farmer maybe you're a monk and then when the monasteries are dissolved everybody's meaning the cities take back over them and the reformation takes it back over and they're they're open back up and people go back into the workforce you know what are you going to do some people went back to farming but some tried to find new ways to make living and essentially availed themselves the new technology of the day they became printers or they engaged in that double-entry bookkeeping and became financiers and so you know if this mega trend is aggregation to disaggregation the mini trend is really around financialization versus disintermediation of things um and so you know gen x doesn't know what a 401k is and millennials never left elementary school without one um so the the basic idea is that the dialectic between social acceptance of building wealth versus datas and of sharing experiences is kind of a false construct you want to do both at the same time and try to without relying on institutions so find a new way to make a living endemic to the new technology so work for protocol create nfts or get good at appraising them there's things coming online now around just knowing subject matter and beginning and appraising if you don't own that stock anyway you know find something that you find interesting and get good at that whether it's game-based price discovering or if you can't code uh you know work for a dow right and if or you know if you aren't timely enough for poker markets then you know listen to audience or run a helium node or or you get the idea we're going to start seeing crypto moving from entities like daos that employ people around finance to being core business models around things in the real world and so if web 2.0 is about rendering people as products this crypto turn is about turning people into from community members into co-owners of the things and so when you see things like audios and helium i think it's a that's that's kind of a a foretaste of what we're going to start to see if you're listening to music do it on a platform where you own part of the platform through a token right or if you're if you're running a node you might not just a hashing node but running a wi-fi or loroan node run a node or set up a little side business around doing that as a side hustle um where you're playing around with things i guess the overall point is you don't just have to code and you don't just have to stake yes you can work for a dow and you should absolutely do that that's like working for a financial house for the first time like uh part of the crypto first medici but also explore these other things in the real world that are backed by crypto you guys talk about you know a defy mullet there's also a real world mullet where crypto is the back end the business model of these other things whether they're music or iot notes my take my my big takeaway for them from this is that i first got into crypto just as a side gig along my normal drop right where i could keep my foundations i didn't have to just like do i didn't have to just wipe the floor clean and commit to something that was risky i was able to build out my first podcast pov crypto in parallel just like how ryan started actually the bankless newsletter in parallel with his main gig and then we actually started the bankless podcast again in parallel and all of a sudden bankless became ready for us to commit full-time right and we never actually had to commit to it full-time originally and so you don't have to jump in with two feet you can put a toe in first and go from there and the other takeaway that i've gotten from these three action items you know engage in crypto art prep and work for crypto is that you could actually do all of these things all at once right there are some platforms that really cohere all of these things together it's just like you were talking about like with audio for example if you like to make music and deploy on audio not only are you just doing the thing that you like to do if you like to make music but you're also earning tokens for doing so and you can hold on to those tokens and therefore you are both working for crypto and prepping with crypto and also doing something that inspires you it's the amount of surface area there is for people to figure out how to do these things is almost infinite right and it's just a matter of you figuring it out and thankfully the bankless newsletter puts out tactics tuesdays every single tuesday so you there just go into the bankless archive and find something that works for you because the reason why the bankless newsletter exists is to help democratize access we before we even knew how to articulate it democratize access to undergoing this new crypto renaissance rather than having it undergo you no that's great absolutely well said well said do you know what it feels like josh is uh this is not in your action united but it feels like the worst thing you could do is just like bet that the past will be the same as the future and just go with the flow of what the institutions and those who generations who came before you say is the path that seems like it could be particularly hazardous at this juncture in history uh that's so good now that's that's absolutely right if you widen your gaze i mean the the problem with history is that you're always subject to your own experience right so you're a zoomer and you're saying hey this is all i've known and it's going to be this way in the future so i'm going to continue to be disillusioned blah blah but if you widen your gaze back and say no no this this tends to happen historically um these these institutions become undone a new opportunity opens up and and people benefit from that and it's a very bright future that's what the past actually teaches us one of the other things that teaches us is that change doesn't happen all at once it's a slow culmination that reaches a breaking point right and it happens very quickly and so when you're in the middle of something where water is flowing very quickly around you it might be a fad but it actually might be something fundamental in societal transformation and so that's what happened last time in the renaissance and reformation we talked about it over the period of 100 years but that's a it was immediate it was one year after another year after another year fintech was coming on at the same time printing press was coming on and luther was nailing this up and you know the monasteries were dissolved that's it happens very quickly and so you always want to be asking yourself is this something fundamental or is it a little fat and i believe you have more than enough evidence now to look back and say this pattern fits a historical pattern where the pendulum swings back and so you know even if you think even if you don't believe a word of this podcast you say all these guys are cracked it's still worth making a side bet on it right because it's like asymmetric returns if you're wrong you're silly you learn a new technology you think differently about the way you work and about art and identity but if you're right getting in early on something at this scale is uh is fundamentally transformative to your position as well as your community so don't don't miss the opportunity josh this has been phenomenal uh we just we just i think i told a story that has never been told in crypto at least i've never heard it this uh techno-historical perspective on the crypto renaissance this new movement maybe that's the title of the podcast dave we haven't talked about that yet but this this is such a pivotal time in human history and i really appreciate you articulating this and even even leaving us with some action steps so people don't feel like helpless like just victims of the next thing that's going to happen there are actual concrete action steps that that we have in this this episode to help you uh thanks so much for spending your time with us and sharing this story josh no this is an absolute pleasure and if i could leave the listeners just with one thought it'd be that you know a thousand years from now historians are going to look back on this point in time today and say this was this is the moment the world that was was changed into the world that that is to become and it's going to be a date just like 1492 everybody knows the year we're going to look back on 2020 or 2021 and say that was the moment at which our horizons fundamentally broadened to include this new world so so thanks for taking a breath and appreciating the moment guys really appreciate it josh i think people yeah thank you and i think people who listen this podcast might be hungry for some more information or more thoughts from josh uh where can they follow you where can they keep up with your work are you even publishing this type of work what are you involved in these days no this was new so we've been doing a crypto investment this is things that have been rattling around since my my dissertation a number of years ago as it's been unfolding in real time so i haven't really clarified the thought outside of this conversation with you guys but i i do dabble in it here and there twitter at joshua rosenthal is probably the easiest way to get a hold of me fantastic well thank you josh bankless listeners the action items were actually included in the show this time so we don't have to go over them once again just re-listen to that last section where we talked about the three action items that josh left us what a fantastic episode of course risks and disclaimers crypto is risky ethan's risky bitcoin is risky so in d5 so is defy but staying with the status quo also seems like it could be risky of course you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on the bankless program hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right
