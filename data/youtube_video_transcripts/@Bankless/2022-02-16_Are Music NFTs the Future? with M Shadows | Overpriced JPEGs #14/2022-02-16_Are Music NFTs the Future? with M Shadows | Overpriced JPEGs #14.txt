the cool thing is if you want to participate then you can buy these bands tokens and if the bands are cool they could cut off a little piece for you and i think that's going to be the interesting thing coming forward who are the hardcore fans who are building the community and who's going to evangelize this band who are the token holders and how do we want to reward them [Music] hello everyone gmgm i'm carly riley this is overpriced jpegs and today on the show i have m shadows also known as matt sanders also known as the front man for avenged sevenfold very popular rock metal band 20 million downloads worldwide i think that's right i'm sorry matt if i got that wrong i think i heard you said that somewhere anyhow i've become a new fan to this band in my research for this show but the reason i had that on is because he is really innovating in the nft space when it comes to the fan artist relationship it's something he's passionate about and he with his band are building out in the metaverse they're building on an nft program and they're doing it right this is the opposite of a celebrity cash grab this is somebody who cares deeply about his relationship to his fans and also about this blockchain technology he's been in the space for a long time and i have to say i love this conversation i always feel like it takes me a beat to like get into the swing of things you know my first two questions i'm feeling a little rusty i'm feeling a little tight and then as soon as we got into it matt's just such a pleasure to talk to he's so knowledgeable about the space even beyond music and i just had a a a lot of fun having this conversation i think you'll have a lot of fun listening to it and i really got an education we started to get into it sort of at the end around how the music industry works i really did not fully understand it and i have to say i don't know that i even now fully understand it but i'm definitely a lot closer to understanding what a thorny what a thorny industry this is and how many pieces there are to it so when we all talk about the future on blockchain and what music nfts could be it's complicated and matt m shadows he really walks us through why that is and maybe where the future might be and the approach that he is taking which i think is a really sensible one to help the fans and to create a new experience so we're not quite there yet we are not quite living in the world of like fans will own the music but we're starting to see that path matt talks about a whole whole bunch of stuff in terms of what the future could look like what he's building great advice for anybody who's launching a project who maybe has fans and um really just a general chat about the space and about what he's learned his investment strategy etc so i hope you enjoy listening to this conversation as much as i enjoyed having it i'm sure we'll have matt on again sometime in the future as we see how this music industry unfolds and with that i

into the metaverse hello everyone gmgm welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i have matt sanders better known as m shadows the front man for the band avenged sevenfold which i have now gotten into in prepping for this episode so thank you for that matt and uh we're here to talk all things music nfts the way that matt and avenge sevenfold are innovating in the nft space for music i did a poll on twitter asking what industry folks most wanted me to talk about in conjunction with nfts and music one out so this is our first like music nft centered episode matt i'm so glad to have you here and so happy that you'll be the one uh sort of getting our toes wet in this uh this big space of music nfts thank you for having me i appreciate it let's start off with like i think the the piece that everyone is is really excited about with nfts and music and the blockchain which is like from your vantage point what is the vision for how blockchain is and can really change the music industry and revolutionize you could say the music industry well i think there's a bunch of different um ways to attack it um there's communities um based on you know your fan base and then your your your um personal relationship with them there's your relationship with the record label there's your relationship with how the music gets to the fan base and all the intermediates that have to kind of that has to go through um so we should break apart i guess um at first let's break apart the community aspect i feel that the old fan club is a broken model um pay 900 bucks to meet the band shake their hand and you're on your way um and you hire a company to do that or they build out like a museum in your backstage and you do a little vip and they get drinks and hire a company to do that but there's nothing that's all inclusive in terms of um the vision i have is like the discord with everybody in there and the bots that are creating these fun games and um a metaverse where people can join and um hang out and ideate and start their own bands and um then these things kind of leak over into the real world which would be tickets and giveaways and poe apps for ticket stubs and the vips can be run through this nft sort of ecosystem so that's one thing that bands have to be looking out for then the other is how they the relationship with the record label right the record label model is a model that made a lot of sense in the 70s 80s 90s and early 2000s and then streaming came along and you could upload everything right onto the internet and go straight to your fans and the idea of getting records made and put into stores like best buy and target and walmart and the idea of sending out a marketing person to get you on mtv or radio stations the labels don't have to do that anymore there's the whole thing is changing so when you look at the cut that they get from those earlier models it's you know up near 75 80 percent of an artist's you know income now if you change that revenue stream around and then the artist can share that back with the fans um maybe the people that collect their tokens or the people that are in these vip fan clubs you you start finding some really cool ways to play with these things and i think from what i've seen the blockchain and nfts are really the only way to get that done because you need accountability you need accounting to be immutable where it doesn't go behind all these sort of um where there's paper trails and there's lawyers that are auditing labels and you get paid 24 months after you a song was streamed so there's a lot of ideas i dispute out right there but there's a lot of um there's a lot of rabbit holes to go down with with how a band is going to interact with their fans and how they're going to interact with their label yeah i think there's like kind of three threads that i feel like i heard you pulling on there which was this the the streaming music and decentralizing the streaming system versus right now where you still have these record labels you know taking a huge percent of your streaming revenue is my understanding there's sort of the the ticketing piece that i think is interesting and the live touring and where nfts could play into that and then this this community and this relationship between the band and the fans uh on the let's just start with this decentralized streaming concept i know like blau is is doing stuff on this with royal i heard you i think say in um i've heard you say a couple different things about how this applies to rock bands like yourselves like where on the one hand you feel like you're you're kind of benefiting you're not benefiting in this current system in the sense that like the radio isn't playing you anyway particularly and you know you're not taylor swift you're not like whatever being played on the radio all the time you're not necessarily being you know pumped or or promoted by spotify particularly so like you really have nothing to lose by switching into a new world on the other hand i've heard you talk about you are still somewhat you need the distribution of a spotify to a certain extent because you have an older fan base talk to me about like in your particular situation and with rock bands in general um how you see this playing out where it is right now and and and where you see it going yeah there's um there was always there's this great writer for music his name is bob lussetz and he always talks about the content is keying meaning that you have to put it on the platforms that people are listening to i always think about this scenario where you're on you know a road trip with your family and you've got you know spotify and shuffle most people aren't gonna turn off spotify go to this weird janky app that only you're on and stream your song and then jump back into spotify and listen to this kind of problem with title right it was like you have jay-z the biggest artist in the world and even he couldn't really fully people pull people off of yeah you can't it's like a it's a deeper embedded kind of problem and it has to happen more as a groundswell and then once people use those because listen people weren't streaming the first day streaming was available it was a slow build of napster and it was a slow build of people getting these files and then it was like oh we don't really need you know well we still needed an ipod and you kind of needed your walkman still and then slowly things start going away and then everyone goes like oh it's a no-brainer let's all just stream and the cloud is easy and we can do all these things and so we want to push towards that future but you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot so quickly and just get too cute with it right so we have this situation where we want to be distributed to people we want people to be able to listen to music easily but we want to promote these ideas so that when this new world does come people are used to it and also we want to push the spotifies of the world and push the labels of the world that it's going to be better for everybody in the long run they're probably going to get more trust and more artists if they if they do jump over to more of a um a tokenized royalty system or something on chain where artists can see exactly what's happening and the money can be given to them within nine hours right um actually quicker than that but that's going to be a healthier ecosystem i think for all musicians and then give the money to the musicians in a way that's more fair instead of all these um you know these uh what would you call it they're like services that the labels provide that they don't actually provide anymore right so what are we paying you know that same price for when it used to cost you three dollars to make a cd you'd sell 1599 cds at best buy but you had to go to best buy and you had to work them and you had to work target you had to work and you had to pay money to be on the end caps and you had to pay money to have commercials on mtv all those things have gone away so what are they really doing with all that money um so it's kind of the the question of like let's get these better deals let's get things more accountable could you see a spotify like a major platform that has a particular business model that right now sends a lot of money to these agents and these middlemen like could they make this shift or is it going to have to be an entirely new platform that rises up i see both things could happen i think there's a whole legacy um component of anything 2022 and earlier is all music in the old world right and so how do you get that music onto the blockchain and into a ecosystem where we can easily stream it easily it's easily accountable and then you have all the stuff moving forward i think people like blau and chainsmokers and steve aoki and what we're going to be doing in the future all the stuff moving forward will be in a new ecosystem but what do you do with all the old stuff so yeah unless at some point something's going to have to happen where the old stuff can get put into this new world and so it's either going to have to come from the labels if they want to survive in my opinion or a spotify could implement something easily um or it's like uh or someone rises from the from the you know from the um from the fringes which is usually what happens in you know the the innovator's dilemma it's one of those things that you know the new technology comes out and that's all the new artists are there and everyone kind of laughs at it and pooh-poohs it and then they stay on their spotify and then one day they realize that they're out of date and they upgrade instantly and they're in this new world um the the reality is it shouldn't change for the consumer right to stream on a decentralized app should not if all you want to do is simply stream music you'd still be paying your 9.99 a month and you'd get all the music it wouldn't change anything for you now the cool thing is if you want to participate then you can buy these bands tokens and if the bands are cool they could you know cut off a little piece for you and i think that's going to be the interesting thing coming forward like who are the hardcore fans who are building the community and who's going to evangelize this band who are the token holders and how do we want to reward them and this if i'm understanding right is what really blau is trying to do with royal which is you can own you know part of songs of certain artists nas i think is doing this right now you can own part of his songs and then you're entitled to a certain royalty stream moving forward on that song which is incredible and like on the on the face of it the idea of being an up-and-coming artist who's able to crowdfund from your fans as opposed to from the label and therefore to reward your fans who now have an incentive to go and you know evangelize you and your band like that makes all the sense in the world security laws do these play a role in complicating actually being able to make this real does it is that playing a role and not to put in the position of being a lawyer trying to explain this but like curious uh what's happening on that side of things if you have an answer yeah so one let's go back to blah real quick i think what he's doing is incredible but but the reality is that model is cool but it's to me you're buying publishing at a very high price right like you're you're these a noz piece of publishing is worth a lot of money and there's a lot of publishing deals that happen already outside of the blockchain right like they've tokenized it's very cool and i think it's important i think what we're trying to do more is bringing the everyday fan of the 10 000 collection and be able to give them something on the back end where it's not necessarily a promise of a piece of backcountry it's just kind of a promise of an overall catalog right where the bigger the band gets the more you guys are going to get and it's kind of just flowing but i don't think the token actually gives you the right to claim that publishing it's just something that we're doing um where the blou thing is they're clearly buying a piece of the publishing they're giving it up i don't know what the percentages are if it's like 50 still stays with nas or whatever but it's a different model in a way um and then the security things are interesting so i brought up an idea the other day of buying this guy vinnie paul's house who's like a legend in the pants yeah you were getting a lot of like on reddit i feel like yeah yeah of course because and it's the reddit is just it just purely does not like they they think i'm trying to get the house myself right like oh he's gonna sell nfts and he it's his house but but the funny thing is like you brought the securities thing and and so where does it where where is the line drawn right and i think you know when you have a real world asset and you're um fractionalizing out portions of a house but somebody's going to have to sign for the house right the deed's going to have to say somebody's name there's going to have to be some sort of multi-sig wallet how does that all work and it's funny that we had this conversation today because i invest with a crypto hedge fund called polychain and i use them a lot to bounce ideas off of this guy ben in particular there you know it's olaf carlson wii's hedge fund but um you know we're tomorrow we are going to have a deep dive about how do we manage these sorts of things and what does it mean is it a security what does sec think and i think people like the board apes who are obviously going down this path as well they're going to release a token soon it's apecoin they said they're going to be going um they're talking to the government they're going to be making sure i think the path is going to be clearer in a in like six eight months that's why all these things like number one the tech's not ready number one streaming on chain is not ready yet um these smart contracts that would fractionalize out aren't ready these are just ideas that we want people ideating on and knowing that this could be something in the future now we might just follow the board ape path once they figure out what the sec says right and like there's there's people doing it already that you know we both know that but is it legal we don't know but i but i want to follow the leaders in the space and then we'll kind of be right behind them and and figure out what we can do with it so the answer to your question is i just don't know but it's not ready yet anyways yeah yeah well so and i think what you're describing and obviously we'll deep dive into what you guys are doing but like there's there's kind of different models here that the blou model it sounds like is more like upfront it's a very transactional i'm paying for some sort of tokenized music asset the text probably not really up to it being everything that we'd like it to be the laws are vague there's a really cool vision there but like we're not quite ready for it what you're describing is more like hey you're you're coming into an ecosystem you're hopefully a huge fan you're getting all of these like fan club like perks but like you said on steroids and then once you're in this one of the rewards that may you know come back to you maybe there is sort of streaming royalties there's other ways we'll try and reward you that may or may not involve that that sort of like streaming royalty piece but it's it's that way of going about things as opposed to really upfront and transactional is that yeah you nailed it you're just you're you're buying into the community and you're building out the community by being there and you're and you're um evangelizing the community and you're you're privy to all the things that we were never able to really do easily before without a lot of people involved and a lot of hands in our pockets and now we can do it directly with you which makes it a much cooler thing because we have all the control and also we can do crazy things we can we can just do crazy stuff like drop tickets on everybody or free concert tickets and do all these crazy things now there's another element once this gets you know we're in a position where we can go to live nation and we can say hey we want a hundred tickets locked out per show for deathbats club now it doesn't have to be unchained because we're also in a position where we're playing big enough places where we can put 100 people on our guest list and they can walk up and we can have somebody checking and they have like a qr code or whatever they have and then we hand them a tick and they walk in right but on smaller levels or larger levels or if every artist starts doing this they might go like okay like we need to figure this out like you know and i did notice that you know slipknot and a bunch of artists recently have live nation tickets on polygon i saw like a bunch of wallets that were holding tickets so they're obviously thinking this my biggest thing is i don't want to walk into somebody else's system i want to create the systems that we play in and so but we want to be powerful enough at the time that this all comes down that we don't that live nation can't just come to us and go that's the ticketing you're doing like we're gonna say no no no we have our own ticketing oh this is getting into so much that i want to talk about you know the live nation side the the nft ticketing folks who've listened to the show know that i'm like really bullish on that and so excited and feels like that's how we trojan horse the rest of the world into web 3 is like taking like tickets and concert tickets um and those are the other kind of two pillars of this like how is this all going to revolutionize music why don't we why don't you give the the sort of spiel on on what deathbats club is for folks who don't know what the inspiration for what you're doing is and that'll lead us into a more detailed conversation about all the rest of this yeah so deathbats club um is basically the 10 000 nft model where we released 10 000 tokens that was a membership card into the into the club it also plays as a rarity token the same way the board apes does where you might have a gold bat or you know or a ghost bat and those are bigger flexes for your um you know your it's like your calling card uh across the internet across twitter and across your reddit platforms or whatever it is that you do um so there's that kind of small fun layer it's like it's your avenged sevenfold lambo and uh then and then uh and then on top of that um we've um added a bunch of fun perks where there's one of ones that you could go golfing with the band or you go to dinner with us or zoom calls we have the the typical um discord setup where there's poker nights and movie nights and we do giveaways every month and then we you also have no lines in any shows we have a web 3 site being built out where the new record will start being teased through uh token gate where you kind of have to have your meta mask and you're just gonna check your wallet um we're building out into the sandbox we've we've already dumped about a million dollars into building out that land um and building out a social hub a streaming platform um video small video games we are doing everything that you can do in web3 and the deathbats club is the token in that's incredible so let me ask for your initial drop you talk about being able to play golf with members of the band or get guitar lessons and i i think of like gary vee sort of being early in the model of like real utility you know and he did the you can do a face time with him you were you were buying that specifically in his model right you you went in sort of knowing you were trying to buy the lunch with gary vee for yours to crack me for wrong but it was it it was you didn't know what you were getting right you bought in sort of all at the same level and then like maybe the reveal was that you were getting a guitar lesson is that how you guys did it and talk to me about really why you wanted to do to do this and why you did it the way you did well you know i've been in the space for about a year and i've i've spent too much time in the discords and too much time watching these things play out and i remember when the apes launched and they did this model where it was you know .08 eth it was more of like um you know you know hit the slot machine you you know you want to be in the club all tokens are going to be great but i might get something even better and i saw the reaction between me bits which was a dutch auction and i saw the way the community really reacted with the apes because um it gave everybody like an equal footing and it didn't just go to rich people that can afford to play golf right and what i loved about it i met a kid in the discord and he bought like he saved up like 2 500 um and he minted all of his life savings and apes and board apes and the kid's like a multi-millionaire now because he wasn't going to sell him he wasn't gonna he's from argentina it's all the money he had but he believed in the project and he got like a trippy ape with a hat and he got like all these cool things and i remember i was trying to buy one off him for like 10 eth on day one it was crazy and he wouldn't sell it to me but we started talking on discord and i and i realized like how cool it was that this kid believed in the project and he was being rewarded at not a high price but like a low price and so i think a lot of our fans are in third world countries a lot of our fans aren't in the best economic situations and also a lot of our fans don't even know nfts are so it's really hard to get them to say hey you want to go to dinner with us it's going to start at 25 grand and go down from there i think i think it was kind of we had to be really careful with letting the true fans in and i think the the price we had was a was a good one so we wanted it to be fair and i think you guys were really smart about your approach i know you did like a dipping the toe in the water first and and i want you to talk about it to kind of see who in your audience even already knew about nfts or didn't talk about how you kind of approached and rolled out this program because i think it's really helpful for others who might be thinking about starting something like this who maybe have a fan base but that isn't necessarily nft native yeah so we we basically um we we wanted to and it was actually a big learning experience for us too because we had this idea that we were going to put pieces of music on there and i was having these talks with mike shinoda about it and he's like the music's actually irrelevant it's all about the you know what's in the hash it's all about what's on the blockchain or whatever we want to call it and um and i say that because i'm well aware that these a lot of these are hyperlinks to other things right so um but i just want to get the terminology right but the reality is it wasn't about the music the music's always going to be listenable to everybody and so the first nf2 we did we released 101 of these things called into the ether which was a piece of art that we did with our a guy who does a lot of our art cam rackham and we put a piece of music on it and so what we did is we went to the fans and said um if you want one of these nfts get a meta mask and just send us your address and we'll pick 101 people so we got 5 000 addresses sent to us and we ended up giving out 101 and they just kind of sat there and the people that didn't get them were like whatever it's a stupid jpeg anyways and the people that did get them were like whatever i got this jpeg but then we started ideating with the the board apes had come out since then and then gary v what he was doing and then we're like oh it's a club it's a membership so that little beginning was like a little false start for us but it was like i'm glad we did it and we knew we were going to do it just to dip our toe in the water and i'm glad we did it because it sparked the idea of the death bats club so but what we've done now is taking those original 101 or 101 and those are actually the most rare like sought after nfts at this point because we've actually added utility to those and so depending on the eye color they all get certain things they correlate with the death bats club so those actually trade at a much higher premium now because a lot of our fans understand nfts now but i will say that when we started deathbats club we did a whitelist in the beginning and we only had 300 people sign up and so we pushed the date back because we realized that people just simply didn't get it and there was so much fun about it right there was so much online like this is a scam the bands do enough cash grab there's nothing they can offer us they should do patreon they should do a gofundme and we're like guys we don't need the money that's not what this is about you know like we're we're we're really trying to build an ecosystem here out and so we made all those tutorial videos and then we pushed the date back and then by the end of it we had 9 000 people on the white list but then we realized that a lot of people signed up on the white list but they never were able to get either and so that's another thing we figured out was that when we actually because on day one we had nine thousand people on the white list we thought it would sell out instantly we only did three thousand sold and the white list was over and we're like what happened so then we wrote a piece of code and we looked at all the addresses and 97 of them had never got ether in them and so at some point they got denied by their bank they it was one step too far they got scared they got denied by coinbase they run away who knows but it was bringing all these new people in they simply didn't get the ether and so we had a slow healthy rollout and everything sold out eventually but there was a lot of things that we learned in that process which was like this is really the new world and it's it's not as easy as it was for me because i've been in it since 2016 right yeah you realize you're in a bubble when you like start to try to get somebody else in and what was at that point what was like the communication like are you emailing folks like when you're like oh the hold up here was that folks don't have their eth we need to probably educate folks around that or help them through that like do you have all you was it on discord like where are you communicating out then to continue to educate folks so the first thing we did in the very beginning back in june or before june we started a discord and most bands don't have a discord and if they do it's usually dead because there's nothing to talk about right right right reddit's a perfect reddit's a perfect example of a platform that works for bands because you write a big post i love this guitar solos the song makes me feel this way and people can to respond to it the ephemera chat of a discord doesn't really play into that unless you're pinning stuff and this and that but what discord does great is it talks about ever-changing markets it talks about other projects it has bots it has excitement it has you know all these things that you can do so early on i started seeing that in art blocks and i saw it in the punks chat which is where i really cut my teeth and the board apes chat and so luckily back in june we i think it was before june but we started a discord and we got everybody to come over we started showing people if you have these nfts your name changes you've got these abilities to do this you can do links here's we're going to talk about the band but here's you know a section about merch a section about guitar playing session about music and then nfts you know and then we just kept like kind of feeding people information and we had a lot of people in the space that were coming in to help other people so it was really just a very gradual onboarding process and now we're in a situation where if you go into our nfvt chat there's a bunch of people that simply know more about it than i do you know when when you when you see like on the cutting edge of what they're getting into may may not be things i'm interested in but they're into all these different projects and it's i'm learning from them just as much as they're learning from us so you did have pretty good adoption then on discord luckily from your fans that was an easier lift than metamask and a wallet and coinbase and all the rest of that i also i'll highlight something i heard you say in another conversation which was that i thought was interesting was around when you did those 101 i think and you you had 5 000 people you said sign up and suddenly have wallets and you were able to to kind of look and see that i think it was only like 17 of the 5 000 wallets held any other nfts or clearly like clearly all of these had had just started up in order to get your nft that was so smart to me because it shows you okay this is the educa we really are gonna have to do education here we you know our fan base does need this and that sort of slow bit by bit realizing what the next step of education to really get your fans into it like that that struck me as um as a wise way to go about things yeah you know we we got those 5 000 wallets and you know it's very easy to look up on um ether scan e-scan or or on meta or openc to see what's going on and so i was like hey you know let's like we're putting them in by hand right because we want to make sure that they didn't go to people that were going to lose their keys didn't have any experience it was really important to us to get them to people that like had some sort of you know they'd proven to us that they'd had a wallet before and whatever so we started going through the names and we must have gone through a hundred and we saw nothing and so i was like dude are these real wallets like what is this in our in our in our dev was like let me write a program and i'm just gonna be able to look in all their wallets and it will give us a color if there is something in the wallet and so the next day we came back he'd written the program and he presses go and it's just 17 people had nfts and everything else were empty wallets that had never been no ether had ever been moved no coins no transactions no nfts and so we're like okay so we gave 17 we gave one out to each of those 17 people and then we're like well what do we do with the rest of these things right like and so then we said okay we'll write a program to see if they even change their name on openc and so if they put a name then we knew that they cared enough that we gave those people and we found 101. so it was like if you put like mr wiggles we would give you an nft because it was like more than anyone else had done right which was just an empty wallet that just said account one with nothing yeah i want to talk about the economics of this you were like hey we're not doing this for money we're not going to patreon it's like this isn't about the money for us and this is something that i've thought about as i think about artists and bands partaking in this like is there an economic loss factor here because you're giving somebody lifetime rights to back a backstage pass or tickets or things that ordinarily you would sell as one-off things for a particular concert like break it down because i understand this is not why you're doing it but like are you making more money or losing more money on this on this uh club so i believe that if we create in the next two to three years like an ecosystem that everybody is completely happy with and they're very happy to be there i believe we will make a lot of money i believe the fans will make a lot of money on their tokens i believe the whole thing will be extremely valuable like the the experience will be valuable and so if you break down like things like tickets and things like um meet and greets we've never charged for those anyways tickets we have but we can always add another person on the guest list it's not when you're when you go play somewhere it's ten thousand twelve thousand tickets sold if we have a hundred guest lists it's not we're never gonna feel it right but it's a very cool thing for the fan um we've always done meet and greets but we've always done blind raffles with our street like our street team um so now we'll just have the people that have the nfts get the first choice and then we'll still do blind raffles these are things that aren't that hard to put together um we obviously raised uh i think it was like three and a half million on the token um but then we bought land in sandbox we have a team building on that which is you know not to i mean we are on a podcast we're getting a little bit of the economics but it's about 30 to 40 grand per lot to build that out right so it's going to cost us over a million dollars to build out something that we feel is you know to the statue we want to have it at we've also given out tons of things we've paid for artists to do collaborations we're doing these we're doing these shook boxes which are gonna they're it's gonna cost us 10 to 15 000 every time we send those out right just to get everybody the stuff they have but i believe in the end if people are happy in this world we've built and they're playing in the sandbox and they're having these relationships and we're going to be able to sell them you know an avenged sevenfold t-shirt in the metaverse or sell them a couple tokens to see a live show in there or to do all these things that aren't egregious they're just simply parts of you know this ecosystem that all works together and i believe in the end it'll be beneficial for everybody um but right now we're just not worried about the economics of it we just we want to do cool stuff and we know it's the future and maybe a model will appear that's listen you can make a lot of money if you want if you want to gouge everyone that's the bottom line you could but we're just not doing that yeah well i think you're taking a smart approach and it's reminding me i had a conversation with avery akanani who's the president of vayner nft and they obviously work with a ton of brands pepsi etc etc and and she was sort of echoing that sentiment in that she was like most of these big companies are doing something that's they're trying to be kind of cost neutral right now or they're spending money on it right they're losing money on it with the goal that then it's sort of a cost neutral program where they're reinvesting it all with the long-term vision that it makes you money in the in the long term and and to your point also makes your early supporters money right so it's the love is being kind of shared around there and that's what i hear you saying which strikes me the people who are doing the smart that's exactly how they're thinking about it of course and taking that long-term orientation yeah we have a lot um we have our reputation on the line and we have a lot um you know we've been a band for 22 years and you know there's a lot of different aspects there's the music and there's the live shows um and then there's our back end of you know economics music 101 and then there's then there's this and they all have to exist and they can't really there's gonna be people that don't understand it there's gonna be people that think it's a money grab or this or that but you could call us money grabbers by selling t-shirts and putting on concerts i mean the world works in a way that um i want to see you provide that service for me i'm going to go to your show and you know every beer that you drink actually helps the band because it's more money in the promoter's pockets and they do analytics on all this stuff it's not this as simple as people make it out to be and when you do this nft thing i believe that if you can bring your fans into this new world um and the concerts i think is important for people that don't want to go to shows the people that don't feel comfortable you know being in public people that have ptsd people that have anxiety people that don't like the way they look um i think this is going to open up a whole nother revenue stream but also and a whole other perk for people that never had it before and i don't think it's fair to just act like everyone should be doing everything for free just because they're in a band um but that's a lot of the attitude we get sometimes you know where you know if you actually look at the music industry it's funny um they used to they used to buy 1599 cds all day and then it became streaming and now it's 9.99 and the artist get paid nothing but if you try to charge anyone for anything you're you're like egregious for doing it and it's like whoa like 15 years ago like you were paying you know for a little disc 15.99 and vip tickets it's just a funny way that the world is turned into this everything should be free and you know if you charge for anything you're a jerk um so it's it's a weird line we tell yeah i think it is changing back though like i feel like when when the internet was first exploding not even first right like decades into it you know all my news i i i got entitled and felt like i could see articles for free like and now i'm paying for substance art like you know writers that i like like i think we're starting to move back into as as the world kind of fragments right like in people are are burrowing into their niche and their particular taste like i'm and you know i probably more disposable income now than i did in college when i was trying to get my free articles or whatever but i do think people are starting to get more comfortable with the idea of paying for their particular creators that they love or the particular content that they love and this is sort of part of that are there i agree because if you think about it there's too much out there and then we find the things that we respect and then we're okay with paying for it like i do for the new york times right and like like i i pay for sam harris's podcast because i love me too sam harris right and so like i would never be able to live with just the black version where it's you know yeah i totally get it but i don't want to put myself in everyone's shoes because i just don't know but at the same time if everything's free you're getting a lot of crap you know you're getting a lot of bad information you're also getting a lot of bad apps and you're getting hammered with ads i think this whole ecosystem solves a lot of those problems at first you have to see how it plays out you know and and it's going to be it's going to be a little while but you need people with good intentions in the space building it out this may be obvious for for some of the listeners or many of the listeners but i think it's worth having you kind of articulate which is why not just do a patreon why is this obviously so much better and better for the fans and better in general than you know what you could do in a non-web3 world i when i when i talk about like our email list we had this this fan club called um deathbat nation and we had i think it was 600 000 people on it right and people were like why don't you just send 10 000 tickets out to them and it was like first off what is an email address who knows if they're even good who knows if someone didn't sign up a million of them who knows if all these things there was no proof of work there's no proof of somebody putting in the time and the money to own one of these tokens right imagine sending out 10 000 free tickets and on what the tickets we sent out are on the blockchain right are we going to send out a paper that says here's a qr code to any show and just have it fly all over there were so many things that didn't make sense but that was their argument right and then there's the argument of like just do a patreon well no we're trying to let you own your patreon we're trying to give you the ability to resell it back if you don't want to be a part of this anymore instead of just giving us 30 bucks a month and being happy with the content why not just buy this thing once and then as the community grows it either goes up or down a valley but the reality is you can sell it either for a loss or gain um you have control of your token now you can't do that with patreon you can't do that with gofundme all these things to me are predatory and people call us the predatory ones which is crazy um i want people to have the control and we have the control to airdrop we have the control to to to gate things off in a way that let's have a party tonight ten thousand of you are invited you all have put so much work into this club you're in the discords every day you're building this thing out here's how you're rewarded let's go to the sandbox tonight you can only get in with a token to me that is a much more efficient way to run every single part of your business um and so patreon to me is just simply give me cash and i give you it's like it's like it almost feels dirty i think the whole thing is dirty and i and people would say the same thing about nfts and if they do think that about nfts i would say you need to dig a little deeper it's not what you think it is i think people have this impression that it's like we're commoditizing or you know we're making everything a financial market and they're like that's my nightmare you know like that's just a way for poor people to get screwed further or something but it's missing the piece which is like we're already paying for and we don't get to we don't get any lingering lasting value from that that like all the money that i'm putting out that i then don't own the thing in the end and and that spin doesn't get sort of understood by um by i think people who are like no because they've been they've been conditioned to do it right they've been conditioned to sign up on facebook get a bunch of people instagram get a bunch of people they pay you in likes and hearts they say thank you very much for all your data you're paying in one way or another until they hammer you with ads and then you're paying for all these things anyways you're right you're gonna pay for the concert ticket you're gonna go like are you telling me that you would rather have um you know kiss charge you seventeen hundred dollars every time you wanna do a vip thing but what we're doing is egregious right like it's it's just so bad they're like oh now you're making music music a financial market you know that you can trade and speculate on like it's already a financial market you're just not getting to participate yes everyone else is part you're just not a part of the labels are participating and you're not participating right okay it's crazy well i i was having this conversation yesterday around accreditation laws because i'm like on the surface the the the line is that that's supposed to protect unsophisticated investors which really just ends up being a proxy for poor people because you don't have to take a financial test to be accredited you just have to have seven figures or or whatever and you know that's uh it's it's just kind of protecting really like rich people forgetting to you know have these opportunities that a lot of other people aren't getting to have and i feel like this web 3 world is cracking those doors open and saying hey like you know music really well you see what's hot and coming up like you now have the opportunity to participate in that market in a way that you never previously had and that's like it's it's amazing to me how that gets missed yeah and it goes back to the vinnie paul dow right yeah yeah like people are like some of the arguments were the really the dumbest one was they just want matt's trying to get you to buy the house farm okay like that doesn't even make sense but you know it's like one of the most liked comments and it's like how are people liking this like are you using your brain and then the other one was why don't you just let someone else why don't you just buy it and turn it into a museum because i'm trying to give you an opportunity yes i know i can go buy that house i have jpegs that can pay for that house okay like i'm not trying to do that like you i'm trying to get people that would never otherwise be able to be involved have a vote and some sort of governance on what we do with this thing because it's important to people and just these ideas that like we're trying to grip them and scam them is just so crazy like it's like you would never be able to go in the bank and get a hundred dollar piece of vinnie paul's house right right but if but if we break this thing up in a 10 000 tokens or we do 1500 tokens let's vote on it let's see what you guys want to do we'll do anything you want to do but you will own a piece of this pending the laws we're talking about but the reality is that's the idea the idea isn't to make anybody any one person richer like well what if what if one person buys too many tokens well then they own part of that they own most the house that's the way the world works like then they get more votes the same way they could go buy the house with cash right now and they will do whatever they want they will bulldoze it if they want like what is what is the misconception here it's reminding me very strange not to belabor this too much but i am having fun with this i it reminds me so i worked as a finance director for andrew yang's presidential campaign back in like 2018 2019 and when he was like yeah cool it was before he was like you know before he would get well known we would go and we would talk to these groups and he would talk about ubi and they'd be like well you know what about this group or like you know the one that came up and now i'm gonna shoot myself in the foot for saying this because why am i stepping into control stuff but they'd be like well you know if you're an undocumented immigrant like why aren't you getting the ubi and we're like guys nobody's offering you any money right now and all you can focus on is hate the idea because more people aren't getting it like we're at least offering something like it's those weird arguments that you're like you know at least this is better than what what what you know what was coming before well it's the fringes that shoot themselves in the foot right it's like you this is way better than what we had but you're gonna fight for even more and you're gonna get nothing right exactly and you're gonna end up you know in web 2 where it's all the old guards who have all the money in the world axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures

applications that are available on polygon i want to get into this ticketing piece you obviously work with live nation give folks a sense like i'm very bullish on nft ticketing but i feel like what we've seen right now is things like what the mavericks are doing where it's much more like okay we'll give you an nft as a receipt so you have this collectible moment from it but the ticket itself is not an nft and my basic understanding of this is it's hard for a live nation or ticketmaster to sort of adopt such sort of a new model for things where are we on the path in your view to nft ticketing it's it's a spotify thing right it's like the giants are going to have to decide if they're going to go down that path right and it's is it going to be something from the outside or is it going to be live nation waits until a big company builds and they buy it or are they gonna go away altogether um what we're doing which i think is extremely cool is um we're gonna have poeps live right you can scan stuff live and we're gonna rsvps where you can prove if you have an nft and you go to the show then we're gonna airdrop you a gif from that night right so it's gonna be like a live version of that show that particular show that you watched and it's gonna be a collectible and then we're also gonna add a token to it so that you can actually redeem multiples that will give you prizes in on the website right so maybe if you get 120 of these things they could be um collectible covers they could be how many shows you went to they could be um pop wonder collectibles they could be whatever it is right but these tokens are going to be like almost a gamified way to get more things almost like going to dave and busters and getting a bunch of tickets like i'm going to go and play anyways so it's cool that i have these tickets because now i get a prize before i leave um i think that is the coolest thing to do give people incentives to want to hold on to their nfts and make them do something and i think like the idea of like having like kobe's last game or lebron scores you know 70 or kd gets hurt that game i think having that memorabilia as a ticket is extremely valuable and important and cool um so i think ticketing it obviously makes total sense at some point to be on the blockchain i don't know where we're at in it i know that we're just going to go ahead and do it anyways yeah and we're going to be doing our own thing um and then i i assume at some point live nation is going to come to us and go either stop that or can we work together or what do you guys want to do here but right now they are so far behind what we're doing we just simply went to our booking agent said carve us out these tickets we're doing this if you want to book us you're gonna have to deal with it and i hope more artists do that because then it might wake live nation up and and do it but but you don't want people doing it in the wrong way right like i'm so skeptical of big companies getting into blockchain i do as much as i believe in web3 and i believe in everything we're building i do see the the merlin elon jack argument of web 3 and letting the wrong people in building out these things wrong um and i am keeping my eye on that and being skeptical and i i don't want to be in a position where we have to start working for somebody again yeah the did you have you been tracking the punk 6529 thread around the the fund he just launched no 529 is launching this art fund and anyways he's got a number of really good threads of like the odds are this goes the wrong way right like the odds are that meta comes in and with just like a little bit of apathy on the part of like our community like we lose this thing because meta's incentives and zuckerberg's incentives and the vc's incentives are very high to make this about them and centralize this and and you know it sort of requires like constant vigilance on the part of like the early community to like care about it enough to not let it go that way because otherwise the incentives are so high on their end to make it go and you don't want to become those people right this is a transfer of wealth it's a transfer of power and you don't and i you already see people that were in this thing early and then they start getting a little bit of power and then they're trying to start their own companies that do the same thing that the big companies are doing yeah and it's like you know i understand we're in a position where we're building this thing out ourselves and most bands don't want to do that like the web 2 model is easier for them like hand over the do it like build it for us right yeah but i like the idea of having the power to have an option that was actually going to be a question for me which is like would you say there's like a lot of artists that probably shouldn't do this like should justin bieber go this route like if i'm justin bieber i'm like you know depends on how intellectually curious you are about this fundamentally otherwise just like sit it out until it's like you know more built and easier and you don't have to be such a trailblazer like i don't know how you feel about it i have a lot of respect for justin's manager scooter braun oh that's true yeah there's a lot of people that i would you know i hang around with a lot of djs they're people i roll with not only because of nfts but we we respect each other's music a lot of them grew up listening to us and then you know things like nft new york or art basel we all kind of roll together right now their managers are smart people they may be letting the bad guy in a little too much in some cases they want to be cool with everybody um but i would never tell anybody they can't be involved i think the more people that do it correctly the better right and i sure listen there's gonna be a battle and there's gonna be bands that shouldn't be doing this but as long as there's always the option to do it yourself and go it alone but yeah you're right like think about the next spotify is owned by spotify and then everyone's doing it and then they still get and spotify is not the enemy here and even the labels aren't these are just old deals right yeah they're good people that work at these things but totally the next spotify might still put in you know if you if you're we're on we're decentralized you get your royalties quick but we still take 80 you know like you don't want that sort of thing to happen and then all of a sudden everyone's streaming there because it's easier for them because they made this really nice um you know platform that's easy to use and everyone uses and tip but they still destroy the the artist's like ability to make any money and actually do cool things with it so yeah it's gonna be interesting i mean we've taken our power and we're going to run with it i'll tell you that we're not signing back on and i think my my point with justin is not even him specifically necessarily but it's like we're in a phase right now not that this shouldn't always be the case but like especially right now it feels like if you if you're in this because you want to build you want to improve your relationship with your community you want to like you know put on steroids your community relationship or your fan experience like that's why you should get in right now because it is a it's a lot of work to be doing this in the well in these early days so if you're if you're somebody who's just getting in because you think you can make a lot more money but like you're tired and you're busy and you like don't really have a need to like further your fan relationship like that to me feels like sit it out until it's maybe at a more evolved place because these the people who are pioneering these people like yourselves like i imagine it's a ton of work that you're putting into this and thinking about this like this is a full-time job it's all day we had to hire you know we hired a girl that's been with us um her name is courtney and she's she created our first web uh z like our website like that was not official but it was a fan site back in 2004 and she's been with us and the day she quit we hired her as to run all of our social media and web but we never did much on it because it always just felt weird on instagram and facebook tests it was always cheesy but when we took this on she jumped in the space learned it lives it breathes it and we made her the project manager right awesome so it's something that we've dove into but it was like we had to delegate a bunch of stuff like and she went out and found the most amazing discord mods and people that can build bots and then we went on the side of building out our team on the dev team like who's going to build these contracts for us um who's another childhood friend who left web 2 left he was a cyber security guy at um barracuda but he quit his job to do web 3. and so we're building this team up but you need a lot of people and you need to be on it right it's like you it's just it will just sit there and do nothing if you're not constantly innovating and constantly seeing what everyone else is doing yeah i want to ask a follow-up on the ticketing side we we veered off there but one of the things that i'm understanding is one of the obstacles here is like obviously your ticket master and your live nation my sense is like they like the gig they like the deal they have right now they have a lot of control a lot of power so they're not necessarily like chomping at the bit to switch to a ticketing system where the royalties are going to the artist or you know not to them so to speak um and one of the challenges to changing this is i've come to understand i think like these platforms actually own a lot of these big venues so if you're a big enough brand yeah if you're if you're you and you're these you're these big bands you need some of you literally can't tour properly without the venues that they own so they have a tremendous amount of power because like even if you wanted to like go off and you get protocol and issue your ticketing through their platform and do something totally different like you literally wouldn't be able to book your concerts am i right on that is that how this works on the inside uh what is that so years ago we used we would find different promoters that were specializing in every individual market right um these two guys named the franks were two legendary guys they always had metallica we always use them certain markets and then other things we do use live nation and there's all these like individual promoters but they would always fight with each other and get the best um deals for the bands and then they had to work for their money right they had to like prove out that they could sell out this venue and give you the best deal as an artist and make sure your writer was perfect and make sure everything was great um and one thing our manager at the time was always concerned with was live nation was obviously not only buying the venues but they were buying out all the promoters right and um one of the last great promoters that we've ever used the franks the the last metallica tour we did with metallica's stadium tour in 2017. um the live nation bought them out right it was that was it they were done and it was like one of the last ones that like now it was like we're gonna play live nation venues and we're gonna get what they're gonna pay us because you have no other choice now live nation has been extremely fair to us and they've been extremely fair to a lot of artists they haven't done anything egregious yet but with all that power it definitely makes you raise an eyebrow right because you really don't have an option and and then this comes up you know five years later and it's like okay yeah like they don't need to change they don't need to do anything because how are the how is anyone else going to get their foot in the door yeah live nation even went as far as buying my friends benji and joel's company veeps which is a streaming company which during covet it was just taking off right and they came in and said well we're gonna wire all of our venues to be stream ready so any band that comes through can instantly stream their stuff and then work we own the company so now they own the streaming they own the venue and they own the ticketing so how do we change it it's very hard because again they've never done anything bad to us they've always treated us fair and they've given us great deals and everyone in rock they've done great stuff right i don't think rapino or any of those guys are bad guys at all but i think we obviously would like to see it divvied up a bit where we can have the discussion of blockchain ticketing now the idea that i can go on openc right now and find a live nation ticket on polygon means they're they they know this is going on and you wonder what they're gonna do but again it's the old argument of who's on the blockchain and who has the power like if we're giving out if we're doing our tickets on the blockchain and were you know doing this thing with deathbats club um the obvious you know connection would be like we would team up with live nation right but how much power do we want to give them and do we want to even go down that path right we're going to be doing it anyways but are they going to be distributing the other tickets that we give out that people aren't in the deathbeds club that are at the show is that going to still be avenged sevenfold but on polygon and then yeah like who owns the rights when those things start trading right like who is that who's writing the smart contract piece right like because that's the thing that's that feels like such a no-brainer to me what's so exciting about it right is of course like the royalty side of this right which is now you put on an epic show and every time that ticket resells avenged sevenfold can have a cut of that resale or you know robots or you know come and buy up a bunch of tickets and resell them or scalpers or whoever and now at least to me it's about the artist still getting to see a piece of that um but the concern and look i'm it's not it's your point like it's not like any somebody running live nation is evil and i don't want them to get a piece of it but like that does that's not the point of it for me like totally you know i want those royalty sales going to the artists themselves but it's like how do you make that happen with a an actor that has so much power yeah and there's also another side to it right like imagine maybe not kid rock's not a good example because he's got like the hardcore fan base but imagine you're i don't know let's say you're kid rock and you're gonna put on a show in a venue that's not a live nation venue and you're not going to use their ticketing and you're not like that might go for a while but live nation does bring a lot of value they've got they've got their powerhouse right and so it's it's an interesting thing where what will probably happen is there will be an average of what sells aftermarket and the smart managers are going to go to live nation and go this is what the secondary ticket sales are worth you need to cut us in on that now it might not be in a smart contract it might just be through the platform or like it like an open c platform yeah yeah yeah so who knows what it is i'd rather have it be on a smart contract obviously like i want to know where my money's at i want to know that it's funneling into the wallet as soon as someone makes a purchase right these are things that can exist so they should exist um but yeah i think it will be some sort of like middle ground for a while i'm sure because because listen if i see our st our tickets selling on the secondary market with our name on it and live nation on top of it and i see a bunch of action happening on openc i'm gonna go to our manager and go like yeah yeah yeah where's my piece on that yeah yeah what's going on here yeah like what contract did we sign for that show like what's going on here yeah yeah cool i want to talk about like your personal collection and trading strategy and this can can maybe guess a little bit into your your background which you know you've you kind of alluded to this you've been in this space since like very early days i was saying this before we hopped on here but like you seem like you have a real pulse on things right like you talk about seeing a crypto punk early on and just like being like oh yeah this is cool like i like this if i feel this way other people are gonna feel this way and so buying up a bunch of crypto punks um what has your journey been you know what what nfts are you excited about right now and and what really is your your kind of trading strategy if you're if you're doing that so i've learned a lot right i've i've bought into the fomo i've bought the top i've bought the bottom i've done it all right yeah and i've and i've and to be honest the one the one nft that i feel the the nfts that i will never sell it's crypto punks i feel they mean too much to what we're all building i i believe i love the idea that larval labs does nothing i didn't sign up for them to give me utility or put a crypto punk on a louis vuitton bag i love it as a collectible of what this space means and what the potential is um and then i also like a lot of other things but i also believe they run cycles they run cycles of being cool and then they're not and i i believe that protocols are very hard and they take a long time to build out if somebody's promising you that there's gonna be a video game and there's gonna be this and that then just stay away because the reality is i've built a video game it took two years and my best friend in the world makes call of duty he's made every call of duty that's ever made and it takes hundreds of millions of dollars and lots of people to make something worthwhile so the nfts that i like have great communities i i try to get into them low i don't try to pump them i try to like grab a few of them and if i'm trading purely on financials i grab three i'll sell one back to make my money back i'll have a rare usually that's early on and i'll hold that and then i'll sell the other one for a nice profit and then i'll hold like the rare one there's always different strategies i just got into nft worlds today um because i believe there's something very cool to be built out with that how they how they've kind of connected with minecraft and um the same way that sandbox is like a whole different world of protocols where you have to it's there's no code involved you have to learn the sandbox thing i think there's something very interesting about nft worlds where you can build on a land with minecraft which there's a million people around the world that are really good at building minecraft so to me that's a useful nft i'm very excited about gaming nfts um this company shrapnel that's building out um a aaa game that it's like an extraction game where it's paid a or a play to earn and but it's also like you own all the skins and all this and that but the nft is like i just kind of follow the culture you know like alien friends or cool cats i think cool cats are so innovative it's so fun to have a cool cat the way their website works and the music and the vibe i love the vibe i love the kryptoads vibe i love like when like the old school punk dudes get into something i kind of follow that i've got a lot of alpha groups on like um telegram where we're all kind of talking about what we're into but mostly it's based around punks so i don't know it's just kind of feeling things out i'm good friends with banks and he moves the market a lot you know but i definitely don't want to be involved in things that people get rugged on you know it's like that's not something that i think helps the space i think using nfts purely as a speculative tool to make money is a little gross i like the idea of like getting in things that i want to be a part of and um and then things people that are innovating right like i watched some of the like i looked at the cool cat's new website i'm like i want that so bad so i called our guys i was literally just on it today too yeah yeah i'm like it's so cool like my little my little cat wallet thing and like oh here's your pets and here's your house and here's i'm like oh we need something like that so you know like go back to the drawing board night so i like seeing the innovation you know because they're obviously building something bigger than a pump and dump it's not you know it's something different yeah i was on the website today and and i guess i don't know if i hadn't been on it since they added the music but i was like oh yeah i'm into this like it's just like this is so cool calm lilting music and it like you know in the middle of my hectic workday i'm like okay nice uh yeah it feels like you're like in zelda or something like you're like top down like old nintendo zelda and it's like listen like how much value do those things have in our lives and to me they've had immense value zelda like is one of the most prominent things in my childhood and so when i get a feeling like that like a sense of adventure like oh there's an apple falling from the tree what does that mean or there's a graveyard like oh let's go dig dig up some graves maybe there's some treasure like things like that like i'm 40 years old and i'll never that will never leave me you know that's like and i want to create that experience for fans and i think it kind of rolls into well what does it mean to be a band these days well you can be all those things you can be a full ecosystem for adventure um finance shows music community it can all world roll into one as long as you don't have bad intentions i think it's cool yeah it's the jim mcneilless i think his like his pin tweet right is like nfts have brought like child like wonder back into like adulthood or something like that you know um and it's sort of what you're describing like the you know you feel like you're a kid again playing a video game for the first time absolutely so a couple last questions i know we're running up at time here but uh so you say you invest via poly chain this like a crypto specific hedge fund talk a little bit about what that means or looks like is it is it sort of like traditional but they just only invest in crypto like how does that fund work i'm not familiar yeah so i i originally bought my bitcoin around the 2015-16 era and then when ethereum came out i bought ethereum so i'm one of those jerks that has a lot of that from earlier right when it wasn't crypto rich we got it we got it yeah but but a lot of people like they see me buying crypto punks it's like how can you afford this like i don't know if i would write that check right these days right like it's a it's something that is different when you're using coins that you've had for seven eight years right and it's like so um the the whole idea of the space at the time was like i believed in internet money i didn't really understand the white list or the the white paper of like what it was exactly and then as time went on i started understanding it more and more and then smart contracts was like oh i get it and so then i became obsessed with crypto and then i was buying v chain and cardano and solana but then there was so many things and then i became like the guy that everyone texted like you got to get this you got to get that you got to get this and i was like i can't keep up with all this you know i can't because the market kind of rises and falls with bitcoin anyways right yeah unless you're going to have some sort of protocol that it just totally breaks the mold and you've seen some of them like polka dots and these different ones that have done different things that have kind of broken out from this like um like this incubator seed phrase stage and so when we got the invite to invest with polychain i was like this is genius because now i can just hold bitcoin and ethereum i don't have to worry about all the other crap i'm gonna let olaf worry about the crap and so what i did was i just took funds and i i sent them to them and and what they do is they have i don't know how much i can give away but they have like a a coin fund and then they have like a more of a a traditional crypto hedge fund where they go and they help companies that have great ideas build out these protocols but they obviously get money in early and so you put half your money in the tokens which they're investing in so they might have polygon and bitcoin and ethereum and every coin you can think of yeah and then they have these other ones where they're building out polka dot or they're building out um the internet of things or they're building out like all these things that they're early on and they're helping with and they have engineers there and so what i've done is i've just said i'll hold my two coins you guys do everything else and then we're gonna but they've been great for other things like we brought them um some other things that they looked at and they ended up investing in and so we kind of when i talk about the vinnie paul thing i'll call ben or i'll you know i've called him about our own death bats club and be like what do you think if we started a dow like a mini dow how would that work and then so they're great people to bounce ideas off of because they're trying to navigate the space as well so it's been very uh very useful that's awesome do you think you'll you'll be into like music investing i mean i don't know to the extent that you you do that now or work with like up and coming bands but like thinking about this you know potential future where like you're buying into ownership of a an up-and-coming band or a song of theirs or something like do you see that being something you'd like want to dabble in in the future so i invested in a company called tune coin which is going to try to they're very new this is very early seed money they are going to try to go and convince spotify and apple music and all the labels that they need to be on blockchain and they have a lot of reasons the ceo his name is john he's very smart he convinced me that he could do it i i told him i think it's a long shot but i will help him in the battle so things like that i want to try to change the industry with individual bands i would gladly buy all the tokens of all the bands i want to do it from a fan perspective i have helped bands that are starting to dip their toe in the space i've always felt dirty about taking money from them i just want them to get in it and feel good about it so i haven't invested in that way i've just been more investing in the traditional finance stuff and then i want to help bands with my knowledge and then if a protocol comes along then i'm like this is really good and we can help and then they need avenged sevenfold to kind of push along the agenda then we'll look at it we've done a couple of things if like your everyday kind of retail investor type who's in this space is really interested in in getting exposure financially speaking to like what's happening in music and nfts do you have any recommendations on like what they should start looking into understanding we don't give financial advice this is just like you know do your own research like what what would be things they should start investigating i think we're in a period right now where i wouldn't feel comfortable giving any clear direction because i'm not moving on any of it because i don't think it's ready yet and i don't know i can't see through the fog right now i can't see like i think buying people's publishing already exists i think it's interesting and i think it gives a lower barrier of entry because a lot of times it's big companies that buy publishing but i've never been sold on publishing being worth enough in our lifetimes i think the big companies that buy it there's a much bigger play and you can borrow off it and you can borrow off the the proposed worth in 30 40 60 100 years buying bob dylan's catalog is brilliant in 200 years and in 100 years i don't think it makes sense for somebody that's got 20 30 years left of their life i don't think it will ever make its money back it's obviously an overpay bob dylan understands that and it'll make money in a lifetime or a couple lifetimes so the fractionalized thing as an individual you'd want to get in early on artists that you believe are going to grow right like a nas is probably as big as naw's is going to get you're buying older tracks that you kind of see what they've done and so i just have a lot of things i think about when i'm thinking about that sort of thing that's fascinating and i do have a few more minutes here because i also want to you have a podcast coming out that i want to make sure we we kind of talk about and let folks know where they should go to check that out but um that's that's a fascinating thing so when you talk about buying publishing which is what we're you know one of the models we're looking at does that mean like buying the masters is that like you know the you reference scooter braun like the scooter braun taylor swift fight like is that is that about publishing rights what what does that specifically mean if you buy publishing so there's there's two types of rights there's the masters which is the recording okay then there's the publishing which is the songwriter and so when the labels traditionally own the masters right they own that they they own that particular recording of a song but the publisher is usually the artist who wrote the song and then they can do publishing deals where they get advances on it and the publishing company will take like a little cut so when you buy publishing you're buying the songwriting royalties of that particular recording so what scooter braun had was he had the masters so taylor swift after a certain amount of years was able to re-record because she had the publishing rights because she had the publishing rights oh this is very helpful what an education in music yeah so you you actually so when when someone goes and pays 300 million to bob dylan they're buying the songwriting publishing and when someone like metallica gets their masters from the label they've agreed to a deal that they'll do more records for the label in return that after 7 10 15 years the master recordings about the black album or all these legacy things would be given back to them now then they start their own label and they have the actual recordings that everyone grew up listening to now the problem now is that with streaming the streaming companies have given equity to the labels with the idea that the labels own the masters now the the streaming would never give equity to somebody that doesn't have the masters the streaming people know they need those recordings to make their business work so they cut a sweetheart deal with the labels the labels don't cut the artisan though they say they do and then we get our bad royalty based on a sweetheart deal that they get from the bad cut so artists nowadays that are trying to get their masters it's not really possible because of the streaming environment and so that's what i meant earlier by trying to get those old masters into web three there's a wall there yeah there's a wall of like no we do things this way and here all your stuff is behind it so the artist moving forward that going to web 3 that's great but you're not going to see a really easy solution of all the stuff prior right if that makes any sense yeah no i think it does i was going to i was going to drop back to that analogy you were saying and i was actually thinking about this back when we were talking about it an hour ago or whatever which because being a taylor swift fan like that's that was sort of my introduction to this whole world and the fact that artists maybe don't always get the best deal and they don't own their own works and all the rest of it so like the challenge right now being okay the or let me ask it this way is one of the things that that's being talked about for moving forward for new artists who aren't already signed would be investing in either masters or publishing like that's something that's for this web 3 world the fans could in theory own a part of either the challenge there is then those artists are going to have a hard time getting onto spotify having a good relationship with spotify is there is there a challenge for them then on these traditional streaming platforms uh because of that relationship with the labels who now won't own those masters i think the streaming platforms will be fine they'll let you on but i think if you're gonna promise things like that so this is why we're in that gray area where nothing's really clear right it's um if you're a new band and you play in front of 300 people and you sell a token to crowdfund your new record right well then you can decide is it going to be the masters it's going to be the publishing is gonna be for a certain amount of years is it gonna be kind of just open-ended you do whatever you want but when it streams you're gonna want it to be somewhere that's accountable and that you can simply write instead of getting a check from spotify 12 months after it was played and then you take a us dollar and then you try to turn it into ethereum and then you just say hey everyone just believe me this is all we got it so you need it from the top to be like this trickle-down effect where you can see everything and it's accountable and then everyone can go like okay i feel like i'm not being taken advantage of right now none of those things exist in a perfect situation because if you do go to a new streaming platform you're gonna go like okay well we're making our master we're making our record but you got to download the xfn app and that's the only place you're going to get to hear us because that's the only place that's going to be accountable on the blockchain what john's trying to do is say okay well even if you have that new platform that comes out let's get the old platforms on another coin and they can all meet up in the wallet then you can exchange it out to whatever currency you want and then distribute it and that's going to be better and it's going to actually lure the new artists who don't want to be off chain to stay with spotifier to stay with all the record label because at least there's accountability and so that's his big play on it right there's going to need to be both you're going to need to like fix all these problems um to make this work because there's a lot of power and a lot of people don't want to give that power up so the thorniness is getting clearer here let me ask this uh question you're talking about how owning publishing rights or being a fan who owns publishing rights like probably isn't going to pay out the way you'd like it to for it to be a really a sound investment and but it makes sense if you're a big label who's trying to be around in 100 and 200 years and you can do all sorts of other stuff with it uh is the is the master's recording sort of different to you from a retail investor perspective like if you know a new band says we'll give you you know 50 ownership divided among these number of tokens to the master recording um is that a better economic bet or am i like still kind of off off base nobody pays for music anymore so the if you could own like a cardi b song or something that's very popular you know you're getting and we could look this up it's like point zero zero one cent on every play and then it's going through the royalty system of the label and then you're getting it trickled down right so the problem is spotify is only paying a tiny fraction for that paying you a tiny factor for that player so now you're owning that is only getting a tiny fraction like the money is being made by these companies that own equity and spotify yes more so than the music itself is that and even spotify pays out 80 of its money to artists they they actually have a really good rate it's just that it goes through more filters right and so you'd have to be very careful with what kind of what artists you're buying and what their deal is right these are things that you'd have to really look at like if you have you know this rapper that you love but he's got a crazy deal and you buy a little bit of the mastering like who knows how many filters it's going through right but if he does it direct to consumer like on tick tock or it's something that's like there is no label and there is no this or that then it can be extremely valuable but then again you have all these web 2 things like how is it getting how's the money coming in is it ads is is it spotify is 9.99 a month is it the free tier there's so many things that if you put it all on chain it would be very very clear but right now the reason why artists don't worry too much about their masters unless you're like a mega star is because there's not much money there right it's just there was money there when you paid 15.99 for a cd but there's not with the streaming age so it's it's kind of changed publishing there's more money in publishing for sure that's fascinating so it's not just a matte like it it's it's it's not just a matter of sort of replacing the labels with the fans right because the echo the way the economics are the streaming platforms are in there like it's it's more complicated than just being like yeah we'll just transplant this one group for another group there has to be all sorts of distribution platforms that are conforming to that new dynamic so yeah and the distribution is key right because we could go to our fans and stream them music all day you need that pool of money coming out of like that subscription of everybody's there right and then it's being distributed like say say it was spotify and there was no label spotify giving out 80 but collecting all that money i think everyone would be pretty happy with sure and i think even the fans buying a little bit of the publishing like as an artist you could give up 20 to your fans spotify keep 20 you're still making 30 more than you make with a label yeah right but then the question is well what does the label provide well you still have to hire a publicist you don't have to hire a marketing person i'm of the belief that all those things can be whittled down and and you'd be in a much better position yeah but the labels might have a good case and they could say well most people don't want to do any of that work they're not going to hire those people we come in and do all that for them handle that well it sounds like an industry standards problem right you these industry standards that emerged in a different in a different era and now they probably should be renegotiated but yeah you know the the labels making their case you're a new artist who just wants to be signed right and you see that as like the the you know way to to to fulfill your dream of being an artist and so you know things don't don't really change but yeah we went to we we famously went to court three years ago with our label um over the seven year clause and this is before we knew about jpegs and about nfts but it was our fight to get our masters back wow and they would they would not even have that discussion with us so tell me that so what what's the seven years clause there's a law in california that you can't enter and do a entertainment contract with any entity for longer than seven years the the it's been obliterated in the acting world hollywood the only industry that's held onto it still is the music industry and what happens is artists use it as a ploy to renegotiate their deals and we said the only way we're renegotiating is we want our masters back and then we'll do more records for you we just want our masters back give them back in 15 years we don't care like we want to we want to be able to have a route or like a road to get them and they just weren't going to talk to us about it so we left the label with and we said sue us so they did and so we went to battle and we all ended up having to settle because it was costing us both sides millions of dollars and the law still isn't changed but the law gets tested every once in a while but it had to do with this fundamental right of like we have no path back to our masters because of streaming mm-hmm and so and you settled but do you have a path to your masters now no no that's so outrage i don't understand whatever i'm you know i guess i'm being idealistic like i don't understand why these you know like let the artists have their masters it feels so funny uh so our plan is our plan is we put out our last record on warner that's part of the settlement and then from then on we'll be a decentralized into the ether so why uh do they hold on so tight to these masters is it so important to them to have it because that's the leverage they have with these streaming platforms yes yes why that's why it matters so much to them it's not because the masters themselves are making the money it's their leverage to say this is why this is why the industry still needs us basically the masters make the money but it was a leveraging tool now imagine imagine a different world imagine you're metallic and you just came off of a 12 million selling black album and metallica doesn't have to do any more records for you and metallica walks in and there's no streaming at this point and they say well you know the next one's worth at least six million and the one after that's worth six million and then maybe five and then maybe three and as as a career happens because they've had a behemoth record right and they go well we'll sign four more records with you but we want all the masters back that's the only way we're doing it and the label looks and they go like they don't seem streaming coming they just see money money money cds metallica we've got them for four more records great deal right it'll take years for all that stuff to to work on the catalog end right so metallica can make that deal and a lot of artists did now that deal is like does not exist because they know they can't sell 1599 cds they know they're not going to make any money on the recordings and the only money they are making is on the streaming services and the streaming services don't want anything to do with them if they don't have the catalog so when artists come in to say i want my masters it's just it's laughable why would we ever give you the catalog right and so that's where we're at and so and if an artist today like you know one place this could start is like artists just start demanding that you know they just they start refusing to let labels have their masters so if like i'm a you know there's a young artist who comes in the path they would go then without a label is what is it is it tick tock is it youtube like are who are the people who should go the label this route and who are the people you're like if that's the career you want you still probably have to sign to a label and conform to their shitty master's rules well i would never conform to the shitty masters okay doesn't mean that the new because now people are getting smarter right and um there was nothing to see back in 2001 when we signed our contract there was no streaming wasn't really on the horizon um and so i think a lot of artists that are hip-hop artists or emo rap or you know pop they're breaking on tick-tock anyways right and they're breaking on youtube anyways and the labels are actually trying to figure out how they can get their artist to break on tik-tok and youtube so they're in control and if they can just do it diy as long as they can then that's probably what they should continue to do and the tools will be built out for them to easily monetize in the next year or two but right now i don't see a clear the clear answer you know back to your investment i don't see it did the labels have the relationship with radio like like if i'm trying to be like a very mainstream pop star do i kind of want a label because they're what's going to get me played on hot 100 so yeah is that your manager but no it's the label but it's um it's becoming very very irrelevant you know the idea that our kids listen to anything on hot 100 they're listening to tick-tock they're listening i listened to spotify hot 100 exactly so all those things um they're irrelevant now they don't have a market share and so again the labels you know they're gonna what they're gonna do they'll get you number one on top 100. they know it doesn't mean a damn and then they're gonna go swing it around with all their friends and say we got a number one hit on the radio and all the old heads are gonna go that's great that's great like oh you guys are killing it but if the kids don't care then it doesn't mean yeah wow what a thank you for this education in uh in the way this all works like it i totally see it it's a very thorny complicated process do you have a bet like do you think we you get there like you think we get to this place where like it's on chain and so there's like an easy you're not waiting 24 months or a year before you get your revenue from the stream played you're getting it more instantaneously you're also it's flowing to the fan that supported you early on like do you see us getting there and you have a time frame in which you think we get there um i've been alive 40 years i've been cognizant of what's going on for about 30 of those i've never seen and as much as i know about the past i've never seen a better technology than the one we currently use and seen that go away i've always seen the adoption even though it's slow whether it's electric cars or it's cell phones or whatever it is when something's clearly better and more efficient we get there eventually so i have 100 confidence i would not put my band's reputation and my own personal you know whatever it is at stake i wouldn't you know um if i didn't truly believe that this was the future um i think it will be much quicker than we think it happens quick happens swiftly i think easily in two years we're having a much different conversation maybe one year um where we start seeing the emergence of these things really happening and and we're and every day we are reminded that we're on the right path when people like nike get involved and adidas buys land in the sandbox and you know jay-z sells title to jack and he puts a crypto punk as his his uh you know avatar you start seeing these people that are that are kind of pulling the strings on where this is going and i think it's going to be very interesting really quickly mm-hmm well we'll have to have you back on when that fog starts to clear a little bit and then you start to see the path a little bit more let me know and we'll we'll do part two of this conversation and be like here's how it's starting to play out this new title is now doing this thing um and speaking of having another conversation i don't know it sort of ties in your podcast you have launched a podcast with one of your bandmates bees i believe b e no so bees is actually a he is a he's a legend in the metal space he's he's always worked for magazines like he's like one of those media guys that like so he actually came to us he bought a token and he started getting obsessed with decentralization and he came to us with his idea that instead of doing these breakdown videos which we used to do where we kind of pull pro tools apart and show people how the songs were written talk about it he's like let's do it as a podcast powered by the deathbats club and we'll give out tokens that kind of commemorate the podcast do some merch drops but we'll talk an hour about people that were involved in the song and just give people something to listen to and the idea was like to do it on a decentralized platform and kind of spread out those royalties but that's when i found out that everything just isn't quite ready yet so yeah yeah yeah always in doing it yourself i i learned this myself in recent projects i've been involved and i'm like oh our legal infrastructure is not there yet yeah and so the legal stuff i'm cool with like foregoing it's honestly just like there's no platforms that can provide us what we need yet at the scale we need it um we've looked into a lot and they don't quite do what we're looking for so that could be tomorrow and it could be a year from now but we would like to get the podcast on chain and have people see i'm okay with getting a bunch of people to go to a new platform for a podcast the music gets a little hairy because it's like it's too big of a pool that you're pulling from yeah you got to download this other thing podcast i'm cool with going like hey if you want to hear us talk about these songs like you got to download this thing sorry and so maybe it's like a little you know dipping the toe in the water but it doesn't exist yet um people say it exists but we've done some research and it's it's shaky at best and and the vision there is like hey you download the special thing and then like you you have like you get tokens for listening like you become an owner of the platform itself by being a patron of the platform essentially and by a patron like you're listening and you're engaging on it is that the the sort of goal the goal the goal would be that it's a big enough podcast that people are paying a subscription just like a spotify subscription and then the money is being divvied out from the um the platform and then we could see it on chain and then we could write a contract that would just provide even if you don't listen to the podcast you're just a part of the deathbats club and we want you to partake and so as in like the the fund the funds that are coming in for paying for the podcast then getting divvied up among in addition to yourselves or whatever to some extent like the the death bats holders and the people who are supporting the ecosystem and engaging yeah that's awesome yeah yeah yeah and then and then um but obviously you need it to be bigger than just us right because we don't want to charge people for a podcast and then turn around go here give us 9.99 we'll give you you know 20 cents back so um yeah it's got it it works perfect in like a spotify platform where if they gave us the line share we could fractionalize that out and you look at someone like joe rogan who's got you know so many listeners and it's interesting that they pay him money but they don't actually pay royalties on spotify for podcasting all stuff i learned this week um so it's an interesting thing that they do they take their money that they they take advertisement money and they take their money and they pay him in that way so talk it that way oh wow yeah so they're taking their 20 so the artists actually don't get less money by joe rogan being there interesting dynamics that i've learned all week let me wrap my head around that you say the artists don't get less money by joe rogan being there as in it's not coming it's not coming from the the revenue being made for people streaming songs yes it's a totally separate pot of money okay that's coming from ads and other things that they're doing to ads and like they're part of whatever they're taking providing the platform got it so it's interesting yeah it's uh well hey if i mean honestly if there's anybody that's probably wants to just like go rogue and be like a maverick and and could pull eyeballs you know maybe it's time to have a conversation with joe about uh going right going and bringing his eyeballs to a new decentralized platform he hasn't fully grasped and there's been a couple people that have um so-so explained blockchain and nft dome you know people was on there and i think people could have gone a little more in depth to make it kind of click um obviously people knows what he's talking about but he's probably trying to keep it surface level i think if you don't understand the tech then you almost don't believe what the blockchain can do right um so you have to you have to kind of explain that first and then go okay well on top of that we're going to bake our cake and this is what you can do because of this underlying thing that keeps it you know immutable and um and he's had other people come on that he's kind of just blown off and i and i wish he understood it a little better or at least bought into it because i think it could be really beneficial especially in this circumstance yeah yeah absolutely well your podcast what's the name of your podcast that's unfortunately not yeah it's called tracks t-r-a-x like yeah cool all right do you have like a if you give us a link or something we can put it in the show notes because you're like it'll it'll literally just be under the event sunflowed spotify okay for now yep okay cool uh that's very exciting so tracks you're gonna be breaking down songs with bees who's very cool in the in the death metal space i say that right this is the metal space yeah middle metal face yeah yeah you can tell if i hadn't mentioned taylor enough in this episode yeah i like it yeah yeah where i where i've tended to be um well this is
