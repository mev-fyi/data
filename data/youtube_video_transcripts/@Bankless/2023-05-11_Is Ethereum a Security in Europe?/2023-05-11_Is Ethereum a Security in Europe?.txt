if I went to a governance body in Europe and I asked is ether a security what would the answer be they would basically say we want to know is this an existing Financial instrument or is this something new and so in kind of European terms you would say is this a method instrument so is it an existing Financial instrument that fits in there or is it a Mika instrument for which we've got new rules the direction of travel if you ask this question in Europe I think is very clear ether would not be an existing Financial instrument it would be in other Financial token to which the rules are under Mika apply
