what gives Gary Gensler the confidence to be so bold the aim that he is playing is to seize as much Authority for his Agency for the purpose frankly of bolstering his own credentials as an effective regulator I do think the SEC will lose the case against coinbase I don't think chair Gensler will lose that case because I think he will be long gone by the time there is a resolution to this case so what he gets is all the benefits the headlines in the Press but then he does not have to suffer the consequences of the embarrassment of the commission losing the case once that happens three four or five years down the road
