of people like steph curry have bought into so he's a big deal i love this conversation i honestly wish we could have gone longer i had so many more questions to ask but we uh we had a time cap on this so we'll have to have marcus back on we talk about the sandbox obviously it's a it's a big deal right now with facebook's metaverse announcement or meta announcement there's been a lot being made of the metaverse space in general and marcus really talks about how the sandbox fits into that ecosystem we talk about their alpha launch which is the big news right now for the very first time you have public users exploring the sandbox we talk about how that's going and marcus gives a prediction as to how far away we are from like a ready player one scenario where in a mainstream way we're all hanging out in virtual houses with our friends or you know going to concerts in the metaverse and i have to say his answer very much surprised me so you have to tune in to listen you're already here

rumble kong league which is a play to earn game and hopefully we get to that if we're talking too long about the sandbox we'll have to have you back on marcus uh but so glad to have you here thank you so much for being here uh really excited to to learn more about what you do and the sandbox generally yeah thanks for having me thanks for the invitation i'm excited to to spread the word about the sandbox excellent i want to start with your background uh tell folks where you come from how did you come across nfts what was that journey like yeah uh sure like it's uh i'm i think i'm rather new in this space compared to some other people and some other like colleagues and friends that i met now i'm my background is in traditional gaming i joined the gaming industry in 2008 and i was working in the european publishing office of blizzard entertainment where i was in charge of some risk management and and the scheduling tasks and i wanted to was my was my entry into the gaming industry that i initially only wanted to have for six months and then somehow i i stayed there and i'm still in the gaming industry i stayed there for four years and then i joined a free-to-play developer and publisher called wargaming they're doing free-to-play games and back then it was a was but soon ten years ago it was nine years ago when i joined uh free to play was rather new it was this this this business model that was coming from the asian market which was around like grinding and pay to win and uh not very attractive to a western audience but uh as if if listeners or viewers are familiar with the uh with the free-to-play business model in gaming it's something that right now has established itself as like a go-to model for for big publishers like riot games um with valor and with league of legends like it's triple a games that are on this business model and um like working in this space for like uh for a long time and seeing it evolve i um last year like i think exactly like one year ago a little bit more than one year ago i was doing like just i stumbled upon something called nft and play to earn and uh had this um penny drop moment where i was like oh this is actually really cool and uh i i jump down this rabbit hole that i feel i'm still falling down to this date and i found out about like play to earn about like actually infinity about the sandbox and uh and the potential here and i was i was i told myself like i want to be i need to be in this um before it gets too big and i i met uh met the co-founders of the sandbox like i think like it must be exactly like one year ago and here i am 12 months later with the sandbox just launching the alpha and um it's a very like a very it was a very busy year but uh very exciting year so rather new like a one year in the space but i feel like i've spent a decade in it a one year in this space is 20 years in other industries that's for sure especially if you were in it for this year where things have moved so fast you describe that penny drop moment and i think on the one hand it's very intuitive for people to understand why somebody who's in gaming might understand nfts more quickly because you already are familiar with value of digital assets on the other hand it feels like there are a lot of people in the gaming world who are very opposed and dislike play to earn or dislike the idea of nfts in gaming why do you think for you it was naturally intuitive what in your background made this different to you than than for others who who maybe have the opposite reaction when they're in gaming and first hear about this space well for me it's like the example that i bring up is what i did before as well like it's free to play it's like you have various business model if you focus on gaming like you have a premium title which is you pay x amount of money to get an experience that is like 10 hours 20 hours 40 hours and then it's complete and you move on like you paid for the experience that you get then you have a free to play which is free to get into and it's at your leisure you can decide if you want to spend money or get the cosmetics or get like new gameplay elements added to it um however there's no there's no payout audit out of it apart from the experience like the connections that you make and the the fun that you have in the game if it's a game that you enjoy um however if you look if you now bring this to like play to earn which for me is like an evolutionary segment it's something that you ideally can get in for free and you can spend money if you if you enjoy it if you made a connection with the game and something that resonates with you so in this sense it's uh it's very similar to what free to play is but there is this there's the blockchain component to it which adds completely new layers because all of the sudden um if i use let's let's use traditional gaming terms like if i use uh if i got a sword in a quest all of a sudden it's mine and i can sell it or i can give it to my friend and it's like i own it because it's uh it's a digital asset and i can decide what to do with it and it's not a middleman that is the actual owner and if i stop playing or i don't use this item anymore it's gone like i can trash it or keep it as a memory and this combined with play to earn by earning like in-game currency or and like any other currency theoretically through the investment of time or completing of tasks inside the game is quite straightforward if you have a gaming background and but bringing this on the blockchain all of a sudden opens completely new possibilities that were not possible before and this for me was this this moment i used to play a lot of world of warcraft and um this is the perfect example because you get like you spend hours and hours and grind and you you do dungeons and you get new items and then all of a sudden like you either you stop playing and there's nothing you can do with your account and it's just sitting there or you you you keep them or you have items that you can't do anything with and just you look at it's like oh it was nice when i used to have this but um it's a frustrating experience to an extent because you are limited in what you can do with the uh like with the assets that you earned like in through time investment and for me this was the this was the moment that was frustrating from a gaming perspective and and that opened a little bit the like my horizon when it comes to utility of nfts because initially when i heard about nfts i did not know about like the utility behind them and um this was something that is very like that became very exciting with me and it's the same with with rumble kong league which is all about bringing utility to nfts and this is for me the the area in like in play to earn in on the blockchain that excites me the most because it's it's clear what you get and i want to get into the sandbox quickly of course i do want to ask though can you speak to why other people in gaming seem to not like it though like you make that case and i think that's incredibly compelling what a no-brainer and but as somebody who's not a gamer i do see pushback on the internet right and i'm curious if you can articulate the counter case or why people are reticent around it no it's a it's a like it's a very good question because just uh just yesterday there was ubisoft to announcing that they're going to introduce nft features into one of their titles ghost recon which is uh which is a very very strong signal of a like a world known aaa publisher and developer doing something in this space which for me is very exciting because it shows that there are there are pushes into that direction and for them of course it's also an experiment to see what the what the reception is and if you go into the comments on twitter on their announcement like it's like anger yeah it's just anger it's just hate it's saying like hey why are you doing this and i think there's um it has multiple sites like over the last year as you know as well like in like in the first quarter of the year there was a lot of attention about nfts about art nfts and there was a big discussion about the ecological impact of it like it's not scalable all of this because it's really just like a very like it's very early it's not built to be scalable or was not built to be scalable now of course with the with other chains it's uh it's changing and it's going into a completely different direction but i remember this um when we when we're doing when we talked about the sandbox in q1 and q2 a lot of the the pushback that we got was around like the ecological impact of nfts and just being something that is new or having a a connection to an audience or to an user base that to the outside for a lot of people looked like just um some shady people doing business on the blockchain which is uh not of course what it is and for us it's really about like bringing entertainment to this um to the through the blockchain through utilities through empowerment of creators like supporting creators to the sandbox and um bringing ownership of digital assets to any user like be it sandbox be it rumble congress be it uh like be axey being like any game that is out there that is being developed right now which is pushing this and it's it's exciting to see let's talk about the sandbox i think something that i learned looking into this whole space is that the sandbox is actually quite old and if you talk about you know these game makers or that have are making the transition into nfts the sandbox itself is actually one such example so um i'm trying to think where to start here i guess why don't you give the elevator pitch if you would for what the sandbox is and then i want to ask you a little bit about its history so the sandbox that we're talking about today is a virtual world that is all about empowerment of users on the blockchain so this is uh it's it's not i would not call it a game it's really more a platform um but i'm going to get into this in a moment but the ip the sandbox is as you mentioned like it's it's it's a couple of years it's almost a decade old and it used to be a mobile game with with the sandbox the sandbox evolution and it was a was a single-player 2d side-scrolling ugc game and a lot of the feedback that always came up over the years and that like it got over 40 million downloads and it has still an active community that it's playing it but the feedback was about i'd like to have multiplayer i'd like to have a 3d version of it and i'd like to monetize it and our co-founders sebastian and arthur they they built this um this the sandbox on mobile and looked into this and had the genius idea of hey actually there might be something with this um like talking about nfts and exploring this space and out of it came the sandbox that we're talking about now so the brand itself is is older and it's more experienced and there's a lot of features and a lot of like look and feel taken from the original game especially the the voxel art style but the the overarching concept is quite new because it is it is bringing like everything that was good about the sandbox and even more to um a pc title for now and this is uh this is something with what we're right now in alpha so we still in the very beginning but we're seeing like there's good there's good feedback on it and as i said it's not really a game it's a platform because for me like when i talk about the sandbox it consists of like four key components which is the which is the game which is where you can play which is a vox edit which is a like a standalone tool to create voxel assets like avatars objects anything that can be used within an experience and we have the sandbox game maker which is a no code game development tool with which you can build experiences that all of this can then be put into the fourth component which is the marketplace which is like where all the transactions within the ecosystem can happen and so it's not really a game because there's more to it even from the creator empowerment side but um it is um it is a like there is a lot going on in the sandbox and the alpha is only the most recent beat so let me see if i can articulate this evolution correctly it sounds like you know it launches in 2012 and it is more like a a game as you say at that point correct though if i understand correctly there was players were kind of building experiences to some extent or building out worlds even then in 2012 is that correct is that true okay and then one of the big criticisms that you just articulated or one of the big asks from the community over 40 million downloads you actually had an active community yeah yeah was one of the asks was hey we want to be able to monetize the stuff we're building on here like i as a creator have built this really cool thing in the sandbox and i can't see any gain from it and so arthur and sebastian two co-founders are like okay well this feels like a no-brainer that we can now move into the blockchain world where suddenly we can empower these creators and these creators can start potentially making a living off of what they're creating within the sandbox um i think that's fascinating and and it seems like in reading materials and the communications coming out of the sandbox i'm sure much of which you're responsible for that's sort of the foundational philosophy or like foundational motivation for you all is how do we really empower creators and we'll talk about decentralization and how that's playing into it um but can you talk a little bit more about what you all do and how creators can earn a living in the sandbox or earn passive income or or you know make money in the sandbox yeah there's there's multiple there's multiple angles to it like from a from an artist's perspective i think the the most straightforward approach is if you are a creative person and you know your way around like 3d designs that maybe you experimented a little bit with uh with voxel designs or like 2d pixels um the most straightforward approach is to download vox edit and just design like just build something that then can be published on the marketplace and uh on the marketplace and something could that could be anything really like the idea is that you you log in and any asset like any item anything that you see could be created by another user and you can inspect it you can see what it is and maybe it's something hey i really like this tree for my adventure game that i'm designing and you can interact with it and maybe you can make an offer to the creator to purchase it and um this could be one uh one revenue stream and actually to date um we we launched our marketplace i think it was an end of q2 and we paid out over i think three million usd two creators only through our marketplace because like on anything that's being listed 95 of it goes directly to the creator and we take a five percent transaction fee that is i want to pause there actually is that is that unique in the industry in general and you know there's other there's other sort of metaverses out there so to speak there's um there's other matter versus like each of them have their own approach like even if you go on openc like there's a transaction fee attached to it if you list something that you can decide on on yourself for us the like the unique part of this 95 is that out of the five percent um half of it goes into the foundation that we can talk about later because it's a completely different box to open that is really about decentralizing this whole ecosystem but um like even like even if it's uh if it's five percent that is being like that is being added on top of the purchase price actually it goes into the community directly and it's meant to be empowered empowerment for the for the users and other revenue streams will be a like as a big component around digital land and parts of the map which we did not talk about yet but the sandbox consists out of 166 000 individual parcels of land each of which is a bit smaller than one hectare and on those you will be able to publish your experiences your houses your concert halls whatever you want to build and monetize them so you can say hey only you can only access my experience if you have a nft that is acting as a ticket or you can like interact with it and build a play to earn a live ops campaign behind it that you can engage with your community and snoop dogg did that correct he said hey i've got this mansion and you can only come if you have one of my nfts that's a pass for my mansion party exactly exactly like there's this there's snoop dogg actually is very exciting because it's two parts of it um we have the early access pass which is really about the experiences and this uh this um this snoop verse as we call it where you can engage with the with snoop and his vision like on a creative level which is not possible in the real world because like uh it goes also like it's it's a big topic of artists bringing their life to other experiences to a digital world because it unlocks completely new opportunities because there are no boundaries anymore and um and yeah snoop dogg was doing it that we have um there's an estate with the board a bjork club as well and they will say like hey we're going to build our club and you can only enter it if you have a broad ape nft in your wallet so there are multiple layers to it and but however what we really want to get to is that we that we help building and creating jobs in the metaverse it's like being a designer being an artist or something very straightforward but also empowering for example like landlords or like industry like mobilia [Music] concerns that that i want to deal with with virtual real estate or maybe you are a you're very good in teaching um game maker or something digitally we want to build bring an outlet where you can do this and offer like new or revenue streams in web three and it's part of our mission as well and we have a we have a big creator fund we have a big game maker fund that we where we put a significant amount of money behind to support um creative uh teams and individuals that might not have the the funds to start something themselves but we want to give them an outlet to to go wild and build whatever they want to imagine so i really want to talk about where in this whole journey we are right now and that obviously connects to the alpha launch and then what in five ten years you you all want this to look like but i have to ask have you met snoop dogg have you been on calls with snoop uh do you have anything inside two snoop that i cannot every week and we do our brainstorm but actually a big part of the sandbox it's like we have the brand and the brands that we are working with and that we're involved with it's a it's a key uh it's a key point of what the sandbox metaverse consists of like we have over 160 brands that are engaged like that that we're working with and snoop dogg is one of them but we have also like we have adidas we have dead mouse we have uh avenged seven fours gemini coin market cap it smurfs like it goes the whole like it was a whole 360 on any any genre and uh it's it's really like where we want to get to is to this when you if you're familiar with ready player one and you log in and you see a smurf running next to a care bear and then there's a snoop there's snoop dogg running next to it and it's like it's this this surreal environment that we want to somehow want to portray i have a lot of respect for snoop dogg i have to say i think he's a very talented business person who ends up having his tentacles in 10 000 different things and yes well we'll come back to how you pitch the sandbox to all these brands because it is really impressive all the partnerships that the sandboxes has developed but let's start with where are we right now so i could go on as a creator and create a chair and put it up in a marketplace is there anyone right now there to buy my chair where are we and of course alpha just launched so you only just have the public starting to come in give us a sense of what this means in terms of users and what the sandbox looks like right now understanding that it's very much not in its final form yeah so it is an alpha and if you're familiar with the product life cycles alpha is essentially like the early version of uh of a a bigger vision does alpha become before beta a before okay and so alpha is a very it's the very first time in some cases like you don't even show the alpha to an external audience and you keep it very limited so it's really something that we want to share and want to involve our community as a in part of the development process and um in terms of the timeline where we are now we last week we launched the alpha so it's one week old which um gives which means we're one week into the public seeing the sandbox at all exactly so from the gameplay perspective and we have the first play to earn mechanics through something that is called the alpha pass and the alpha pass is unlocking various experience like up to 18 experiences that someone like ken can experience which consists of single player experience multiplayer hubs clubs there's an experience from the from our game maker fund which is completely ugc generated and it is really just a glimpse into what will be possible it's meant to just give you an idea of what this ecosystem could become um so if you log in now and you don't have an alpha pass you can still experience four experiences which is like an nft gallery which is a music club and the single player experience as well the the alpha hub but that's that's it then after a couple of hours you experienced the alpha and there are multiple ways that you can still engage by by talking to people like visiting the art gallery it's something that we're going to change the art that is being displayed there but um from a gameplay perspective this is the alpha right now so it's something that is like the the rollout was initially a little bit bumpy but now it's smooth sailing and there are still some bugs but overall it's very good um however if you're a creator you can download game maker and voxed it right now and get going and you can build games and regularly we have game jams where users can submit their experiences that they're build through game maker and you can already um share them with the world and get other people to try them so the incentive right now if you're a creator is not that you're probably going to get rich in this moment off selling shares in the sandbox it's to have that first mover advantage and get in so you understand this space and you're making a bet that in some period of time this is going to become a major hub of metaverse activity of gaming of community gathering and if you have learned the space from the beginning that's going to give you a huge advantage is that is that sort of right now like if if i would uh i was talking about this with the with the boyfriend of my sister-in-law who's uh still studying and um i like i did not give him advice or anything but i like i think right now if you get familiar with any metaverse building or building content for a metaverse environment you're very well positioned in like in a very fast growing space because what we're seeing is we have over 16 000 individual land owners but only like a very small percentage of them knows how to use game maker or create assets like it's most of the time it's not creative people are not designers at all like some of them are investors that just want to hold land they see it as an investment that you want to they want to rent it out in the future which is also a revenue stream and um and they they lack content and they don't know what to put on their content so if you are like if you're a little bit creative or you have an idea for a for an experience or a game or a house or a social social environment like now is the time to get familiar with the tool and offer like build something for experiences and lands to be hosted on like last i think it was last week or two weeks ago republic they um sold in an auction like a metaverse yacht for i think it was 150 east or something which is uh which is a massive amount of money but it shows that there's a there's a market there's an interest to have content on your land and uh because you want to have something you wanna you wanna show what you have like what you can do on a land and uh it's also like inviting and inviting your friends to hang out to do something to listen to music and uh decide what you want to do on your like on your home turf and it's worth maybe mentioning as we're talking about this that you specific or that the sandbox specifically connects artists and creators and game makers to brands so you have brands coming in saying hey we don't know how to build in here do you have anybody who can build for us so there's also opera like it seems like there's a lot of demand for these kinds of creators to to consult for and work for brands that and that's the connection the sandbox will make is that that's always part of the discussions that we have with brands it's uh they're asking hey how can we like we know we know what we want we know um what we want to share with the world we know the type of experience that we want to build in the sandbox how do we do it like in some of the cases they have the internal manpower to build something themselves but more often than not we give them a like we have a git book where we have a category that's called creators for hire which is a small studios that are specialized on metaverse building and some of them they're now working with um with major brands in the space to build their like their experience in the sandbox and uh if you think like one year back i don't think a lot of them would have have thought that they built now experiences for like multi-million follower brands out there wild so this this alpha is a really big deal it's been coming for a while you all actually pushed it back you were gonna launch it i think this summer and pushed it back because you wanted to get it really right so this is a huge milestone what are the what are you all hoping to get out of this what are the metrics you're looking at what is the feedback from the community you want to get out of this and and how is it going so far you're a week or two or so into alpha and people actually getting into the sandbox how's the reception been talk about some of that well it's uh so it's not the first time that i experienced an alpha or a product launch and it's always it's it's a very exciting day because first for the first time in a product life cycle you have like you give your baby away to the likes to the to the masses and uh give them their opportunity to share openly what they you're saying exciting but it also sounds terrifying it's how it is it's both yeah it's uh it's like having a having a baby and having children and um there is like the feedback overall is very good like we're very happy with the with the resonance that we got um because also we we explained that that it's an alpha don't expect to be able to spend 80 hours in this uh in the sandbox because it's it's the first step of many and it's a it's a glimpse into this vision that we're building and i think for this part we succeeded because we we have a good set of experiences to try um we have a good set like it's it's a stable the servers are running good like the client is stable there's there are some bugs of course and but it's expected because it's an alpha end of the day but what we want to get out of it is really gathering user feedback seeing the like the behavior of of players inside the space like in certain experiences like what do they like what do they don't like and using this as well to maybe give recommendations to to builders or to to other like brands and say like hey we see that a a disco themed experience works really well because people they want to log in and they want to listen to music and they just want to hang out and chat with other people um but uh when it comes for us like it's um we want to like it's mainly about feedback from the community and learning what they like what they dislike what should be changed maybe the controls are too wonky maybe there's something like in the in the ui that is not clear and this is the type of feedback that we want and is there any feedback you're getting you've seen over this first week or so that keeps coming up that that stands out that you can share that keeps coming up no there's some things about um like ui things that uh that can be easily fixed there's some clarity on our side where we have to maybe in the future have to see when it comes to the alpha pass because you can see all experiences but not all experiences are accessible some of them you can only go to if you hold in alpha pass nft in your wallet but those are ui and explanation things but really game components we get a lot of feedback of being able to swim to uh to to fly like to do things that generally so those are features where we have to see now when we can implement them and what comes next so the alpha this alpha period ends december 20th i believe yes exactly right yeah and and and then what happens like if the the sandbox goes back into closed mode development mode can people still enter what does that look like come december 21st this is a excellent question [Laughter] let's let's see um so let's let's see so first of all like we're going to take we already started working on the on the iterations of the alpha what i can imagine happening is that there's going to be another iteration of the alpha with different type of experiences with different features with new features with extra like new editions and and more like play to earn components because if you hold an alpha pass you get access to experiences right now but if you do a set amount of quests you also get um access to 1 000 that you can earn which is uh which is with a trading volume of send like it's it's a good it's a good amount of uh three dollars if you want to say five dollars i think today yeah so you can you can do the math and it's like it's a nice little uh christmas pocket money if you do some quests for it in game but it's play to earn you know like it's possible and it's also like what we want to educate around so the next part is going to be most likely a new version of the alpha new features new experiences um everyone that's listening and holds an alpha pass hold on to it it's going to be useful it's a memorable there's some alpha for you hold your almost literal sense yeah yeah yeah exactly and nobody so there's a lot of development work to be done are you seeing anything so i can't even participate in like the three open experiences because i'm a mac user so this is something to know marcus you're walking around here like anybody can get in this i cried i could not just little um so are you seeing though is it mostly folks interested in playing games are there people who are like just hanging out and jamming to music it's a combination of all of that and this will tie to my question about long term where where you want this to all go and be but are you seeing any feedback on on that now we're seeing a lot of um seeing a lot of just uh hanging out chatting sharing experiences trying the experiences that are there long term our goal long term is to go away from like providing experiences to try and getting more to a ugc component because ideally we have a like as the name says that the sandbox it's uh we want to have something that is completely driven by the community and by the by the like by the collective and that means that also like any experiences that are being published on the sandbox they're not done by us but they're done by a user or a team or a brand that is building this experiences and we want to build a platform to provide this and empower creators to to share their experiences and the assets that they created and end of the day like it's going to be it's going to be the the the players and the users who decide which content they want to like see and what is going to be in most in line with what they're expecting the sandbox to be so i think this is fascinating and let me see if i can put forward a vision for where you all want the sandbox to be in 10 or 15 years and you tell me if that seems right so my sense is you mentioned ready player one there is an element of that to what you're trying to build like hey we're the oasis there's a finite amount of land here so presumably you can't fit the whole world in the sandbox is that correct correct correct okay so you know in 10 years though you want to be this thriving world where you have concerts happening and people hanging out in each other's virtual homes and brands are there with game experiences you can go it's like you know disney world where you can go from from whatever the very the kingdom animal kingdom to other parts of disney and you're you can explore these worlds but all of that has been driven by what the users themselves created and the bet there is that if the users are creating it it's it's going to be more appealing than to users than if it's you guys in a lab doing focus groups trying to figure out what people want in this case it's they're building exactly what they want exactly and that this is one part of an interconnected world of many worlds right so the metaverse is not just the sandbox the metaverses many different places and you can move between them and take your avatar between them and and the sandbox is one of those one of those places is that is that the vision yes yes it's a good it's a good summary it's a good summary i'll take it okay what would you add or subtract from that no there's a i think i think what's the key differentiator for us as well to other projects that are out there as well is that we don't limit ourselves to hey this is a platform for social events this is a platform for gaming and it's really like it's it's up to you like you can you can log in and you say like hey i wonder i want to visit a museum and then i'm going to go like hey but now i want to play an among us style game or player like i don't know like an rpg game and but you can do that and we want to give you like the possibilities here and like to the ugc component the gaming industry is is very it's very fast moving and all of a sudden like you have genres popping up that did not exist a few years ago like a battle royale mode which is something that did not exist before like pubg and fortnite really went into it and as like established the space for themselves and now you have like apex you have a call of duty warzone all of those games that are around battle royale and um a lot of them are being just they're created by by players they're done by like the community and they know best like you know best what uh what works and what type of content you wanna you want to engage with and what type of games you want to play and there will be genres that don't exist yet and also what we see as well in the game maker right now like there are features and functionalities in the game maker that our community is using that our devs did not even know was possible like we saw someone that is that created a like that played around with the functionality in gameweek and he created a lasso and this is a functionality like that does not exist in our like in the in the technical components but found a workaround and i think this is very exciting because like we just give a we give a blank sheet of paper there are some rules there's the border but then you have the freedom to use it and build something that you want to have and i think it's very exciting so and ugc just in case folks don't know is user generated content so that's yes sorry for the basis of all this no no i'm sure i'm sure many people are familiar with that term so what i hear you saying is that unlike in the traditional brand world like if you were to look at facebook and twitter and all these social media giants that are centralized places that jockey to figure out how they're going to position themselves what are they going to focus on and specialize in spotify right now is a good example they're clearly making a big bet on podcasts and apple doesn't seem to be making a big bet on podcasts and that's being determined by people setting up an executive suite saying hey we're making this bet on podcasts what you're saying is and it's sort of interesting when you think of your job probably or like or any any job sort of where you're not saying hey we as the executive team of the sandbox are going to decide where to position this in terms of we're going to specialize in gaming or music versus decentralian we'll do x y or z you were saying we're going to see what the community decides they want to do here and just support that and let's see where we end up in 10 years that's that's the answer i'm hearing yeah it's part of the answer of course there is there's more to it and there are like we see this functionality that's not possible where we want to get user feedback in the terms of directions of that we should focus on like for example if you want to do a concert in the sandbox you need to have specific uh special effects that are supporting your music and you have to have a playlist playable and those are like technically features that are not yet there um but we want to like give a like a playbook like a set of functionality that can enable this of course for this this is also part of the alpha just to really see which type of feature set is in demand yeah so you will of course be you'll be doing work to double down on what you're seeing from the users themselves yes yeah so decentralization is obviously a big part of what you're describing and it's a huge ethos in this space in general you mentioned the foundation earlier i've heard i think sebastian say in an interview before that he has plans to have sand which is the economic basis of the sandbox be fully in the hands of the community at some point meaning he and others executives and vcs and things won't you know won't have the majority of sand it'll all be in the hands of users you guys have talked about having dows be a part of this speak to the decentralization piece and where you are in that evolution where that's where that might end up yeah um so the decentralization part and the foundation part is something that we that we will talk more over the the coming months and years but what you just outlined is essentially it like we want to give the majority of decision rights and decision power to the community which is what decentralization is all about because as of now the sandbox is still rather centralized if you look at it like we decide what type of experiences are there we decide which um which nft drops we publish on the marketplace and that we want to send an email about and it is like following a very traditional model that we want to get away from in the like over over the the years to come and part of it is this foundation where any like 50 of all the proceeds that we make of all the revenue we make goes back into the ecosystem and is being used to fund game jams it's being used to support creators and artists we have a big push of supporting also like nft collections and um like uh there was a there was a big purchase of like a golden bought ape a couple of months ago that made quite some impact in the in the space but it's part of the foundation as well it's not something to to uh like to have in our wallet and show off but it's part of the treasury that is this the sandbox like where we have over 3 000 ethereum worth of nfts in a collection that in the future the like the community can decide like hey what do we do with this collection like what should we do with it an ideal world of course it's a very it's a dangerous game to play as well but i think it's also part of um of giving empowerment to the community and decide hey um why don't we do this with the game and we're putting it to a vote which is uh like a lot of the movements around taos and and collectives that is very exciting and that goes very much against like traditional gaming which is very much about hey i want to do a game in this universe let me do six months of user testing if they like this setting and then we're gonna do that and we hope it's gonna work while decentralization is really much about like hey we want to do this oh i have an idea let's put it to a vote and see if this is direction that that we want to go or or maybe not even us putting this but maybe a community member is saying hey i have an idea and why don't we see how we can get there and i think this is very exciting and it's going to be a bumpy road because it's something that does not exist in this shape or form at a scalable level yet but i think there's a lot of potential of really like bringing ownership and empowerment to um the space and at the end like this is this is also what i found out about like when i found out about nfts it was about like empowering artists and all of a sudden they have new outlets to to showcase their art and and like talk to their audience that is all over the world and now you see like musicians that go into this space because they can engage with through nfts that act as tickets or that give avatars or that push like the brand uh um further and it's it's very it's very exciting to see and uh like the the ubisoft news as well like it's a good example of really like established triple a um companies looking into this space and seeing hey what is this actually all about and um we did not talk at all about actually infinity which went viral in the philippines and families were playing actually infinity because all of a sudden they could make a like a couple of hundred dollar more a month which is a which is a significant amount of money and it's uh like there are those on the personal level those stories as well which are which were not possible before and all of a sudden like you have um you have the web three added to it and it is like it opens completely new doors everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you

hang out in my digital apartment with my friends from around the world or around the country but it depends what uh what what you think also what the like let's say this metaverse what you think it is if it's if it's a place that you go if it's if it's a like uh a moment in time as a negative oh let's start with that okay you shared a very interesting article about this so i'll back up how do you define the metaverse and i think you're gonna get into or or what are some of the different definitions of the metaverse that you've found interesting no there's this one that i just outlined so anyone listen go to my twitter profile at direct follow me check out what i share and there's a there's a i think it goes too long to go like really into detail about this as well but um like if if you like if you come if you have a mainstream approach to this whole metaverse it's it's a buzzword that is being used quite a lot right now in various senses but um for me there are already like there so there's already various metaverses that are interacting with each other like you can consider twitter one as well because like you have all those um like profile pictures that are interacting with each other on a platform that is not at all about like nft um collections but it's uh like all of a sudden you you have interability beyond collections because the users are interacting with each other and uh however it's still a centralized platform and it's still like twitter running it and um i think in order to i'm not sure there's there's gonna be like one um like the internet in any in the near future where you just log in and it's part of it um i think there's there's going to be still a like long road for like centralized uh companies that are very established right now to to let go of their like of their baby again of their like the reigns maybe um but like i'd love that the doors get more and more open and that you see more and more like cross product uh usages and something in the sandbox like we have brands that are that would never work together but you have uh like you have their lands next to each other like you have a snoop dogg next to the care bears and uh like this is um like from a traditional sense it would not be possible otherwise so let me ask this because and you said this but i don't know if it went quickly so there's this idea that the the metaverse is a place that you go to and so the metaverse exists once this place and can be defined in different ways exists then there's this idea that the metaverse is actually a point in time when we are spending not just more of our lives but like more of the life that matters to us probably is digital as opposed to as opposed to in real life and that it's actually at that point in time that the metaverse has come to fruition yes let me i think that's a really interesting definition and people should go and check out what you shared about that we can we can link to it in the show notes here um but going back to sort of the place idea and this ready player one idea where what you described you know you've got a care bear running around next to a gremlin next to whatever all these different kinds of avatars running around in a space how far away do you feel like we are from that if you if you if you feel like you can put a number on it like i would say like no i would say like less than five years wow yeah it's uh like it's and like the the like just look at 2021 like how fast this uh the space is evolving like my background is in the gaming industry and in the gaming industry there always like it always was oh you have to stay on top of everything the gaming industry is so fast moving and then i moved into web3 crypto nft space and that's uh you're like oh you all don't even know what path is yeah what the is going on back on that in for one for one second because i think obviously yes the acceleration to digital lives very much happened because of covet but there's also the opposite which is i think work from home is has accelerated and it's very much here but then i think when you look at like school there was a lot of push back to kids at home from a schooling perspective and there's it's if anything made people want in person school that much more and so and one of the reasons i bring that up is because i think an example you hear a lot in this space and an argument you hear a lot in this space is like look this kid cares more about his fortnite skin or her fortnight skin than she does her sneakers in the real world and i feel like that was especially true when their only interaction with their peers was digital because they were home for kovid but now that kids are back in schools and presumably will stay in person in schools is that really true still like do they still care more about their fortnite skin than the sneakers they wear where they're seeing the girl they like in class how do you think about some of that no it's like it's very it's a very black and white thinking like it's uh i think there's like you have to strike the balance of everything and uh like you can't have a blanket approach on all of like on all of this of course and there is a reason why um like brands are exploring this digital space as well because there is like you want to represent your like you want to show your sneakers in the real world but maybe you also want to have an opportunity to show you sneakers in a digital world and you see like fortnight there like there's a lot there's a spider-man skin that you can get and you can you get a unique functionality with it and um it depends like really where you use where you where you spend your time and where you engage and from like from a kids perspective the the social life is very important and social interactions are very important and it doesn't mean that it has to be black and white but on my side as well like there's a lot of like there's a like let's let's take example like i um let's looking very briefly at rumble complex it's a it's four co-founders and i never met them in life which is like we built a we built a we built a company that is a company that steph curry uh steph curry wore the merch for rumble kong yes like paul george as well like uh there's like there's very famous uh conholders that are out there and it's like and my co-founders i never met them in person i know them only digitally and that does not mean that i um like i respect them less but because like we we put like our like our the quality that we put out there in front of it and um of course i want to meet them in real one one day because there is still this like there is still real life that exists and it's still important to to have this interaction and i think it's important to find this balance because part of the premise of ready player one is as well that there is this dystopian backdrop to it where you log off and it's a dystopian world where it's run by corporations and it's just going downhill so and maybe having a decentralized is the is a approach to to prevent this because like it's in the like one side it's digitally run by a collective but then you have still the the real world out there like me i live in the middle of nowhere uh very lost and that's also on choice like to just uh to to have a moment to switch off as well and um i think it's it's there's there's both i didn't really answer the question but um no i think you did i think you're you're making the point that i'm being a little too black and white about my thinking of like they're only going to care about in person or only care about their digital lives and the reality is you're saying they're going to care about both and so this is very much much coming how integral do you see and maybe this is an obvious question how integral do you think the metaverse is to nfts becoming mainstream and i say that because i have right now in my head sort of two models for how nfts go what i would consider mainstream they're mainstream now in the sense that pretty much everyone's heard of them but there's still a lot of eye rolling like a lot of like what the heck is this why is this yacht going for 150 eat that seems crazy whatever right and to me the two case the two stories right now that i have in my head about how nfts really go mainstream in the sense that everyone buys and owns them is my first one is concert tickets the second and i i really mean that as a stand-in for ticketing in general like once tickets are issued as nfts which i think is inevitable because the economic incentive is there and then the social signaling incentive is there that becomes once you have to buy your beyonce ticket as an nft like game over because people are gonna buy their beyonce take concert tickets that way and then everyone's gonna start caring about what concerts you're going to and the social signaling piece comes in that's my one theory of the case my other and these aren't mutually exclusive is the metaverse and that people will start buying nfts when they have a house in the metaverse that their friends come over to and they want to have cool art on the wall just like they want to have in their real world in their real life what is your theory of the case on this do you agree with that and and it sounds like you think that metaverse story which i saw as being maybe further out is maybe just as close as the concert ticket story what do you what's your reaction to all of that i think every every example they just mentioned is a perfect use case of nfts and it's um and it's something to look back on and it's a memory and it's something to to keep in mind of it because like you can you can say like all of a sudden you have a proof of attendance that you wear at this concert that goes beyond having a blurry um video on your drunken selfie or sober selfie [Music] but it's like it's uh it's gonna happen it's like concert tickets for me is like a low-hanging fruit and um like in terms of art it is a status symbol that all of a sudden it goes beyond like having it on your on your wall in your apartment that only like a selected number of people can see but you can make it like you can you have completely different bragging rights and uh it's like it's already possible like if you just go on twitter and you see um like nft profile pictures like there's a direct value attached to it which is like in some cases like wearing a rolex on your arm but it's all happening digitally so but when it comes to nfts i think i think there's going to be much more use cases that go of course like beyond um just going to concerts there's going to be there's going to be communities that are going to be completely gated behind nft and accesses like that you can only be if you're part of this community and uh that it's a token gating or like art as you mentioned is going to play a key role of just displaying it creating like yachts creating houses villas digitally where you can host parties like going to concerts digitally because for as a music artist if i have a concert i know i have a stage that has this size i have a like an arena if i'm lucky that can hold that many users and then that's one evening and then it's over but if you bring this digitally all of a sudden the potential that dressable audience is like it's like billions of people that can enjoy your content in a way that you can also present it that would not be possible physically because all of a sudden like you can be you can be a giant you can be like firing lasers out of your eyes and um like it's opening completely new possibilities and then we saw this in the pandemic didn't travis scott do a uh yes travis that's a very good 143 million viewers or something or yeah and there's like that they happen more and there's like you have um you have ariana grande i think she did also like a concert and um and it's like they're very distinct experiences that are happening and they only happen at a certain point in time which is like an event and you can say like hey i've been there like you don't have that in fortnight because you have a screenshot but um maybe like in the like in the in the web three space you have this nft this um like this this pull up this proof of attendance that can show like hey actually i've been there i was a part of it that gives you like a memory for you to think back off but also for the rest of the world to see like hey look um i was i was there like it's your proof that exists on the blockchain and um i think it opens a lot of new new new possibilities and nfts themselves like theoretically you can put anything as an nft like you can you can have your birth certificate as an nft if you really want to because like it is unique and it is uh like it is it can have the necessary information i don't know if you want that but what i'm discovering as projects that i have going on is is it's really our legal infrastructure that's behind right i mean and obviously laws vary by country we're in different countries but like here in the u.s there are projects we're trying to do that we could totally do via smart contracts the problem is the law recognizes like the paper contracts as the official way things are done so i think this journey is also partly a getting sort of the legal side to catch up with what the technology is able to do so that we can have things regulated via smart contracts in a different way okay i know we're we're running low on time we'll have to bring you back because there's plenty more to talk about but i want to have two two final questions here i do want to end with you sharing a little bit about what rumble kong league is even though we weren't able to dive deep into it on this conversation but first obviously mark zuckerberg the meta announcement facebook has done a lot to i in the last several weeks popularized the idea of the metaverse what were your reactions to meta to this announcement what i don't know if you watched his whole presentation what did you think of the presentation regardless of what you think of him do you think that that vision he painted of like that kind of world we're all studying like is that that what y'all want to do reaction no it's like of course i watched the announcement like i followed it and also like from a like from a branding and from a marketing perspective like there's always like two ways to look at it which is first of all the message and then the presentation the presentation i thought like it's uh you know it's it's nice like it's it's a nice use cases you all have a lot of money clearly you're able to put together something good exactly like yeah it looks cool like yeah you have you have your headsets and yeah you push your own your product portfolio no it's cool you know like and by the end of the day like it remains like it's an ad platform that is uh giving you use cases to spend time in it and like this is also what uh what you have to keep in mind and just because like a big corporation or a big uh company is pushing something doesn't mean it's gonna work like uh uh looking at you a google stadia and which is uh like uh which was a cloud gaming uh experiment from google that uh did not work the way they intended to and um but um like it's it's in terms of awareness to the space like it's it's incredible because like all of a sudden we saw this on all our like uh homepage visitors like the trading volume like and all our metrics like they went up following this announcement and it's uh and for this like thank you thank you mark so yeah it's because it's like from a brand awareness he uh spent a lot of money on our marketing you're like you did my job thank you thank you so thank you thank you uh job well done and um but from a product like site we will see how it's going to run like there's going to be use cases for it it's a it remains like a centralized ad platform so we'll see where it's going and there's going to be probably going to be some nice farmville experiences on there that you can play and we will see how open they're going to be and the end of the day like how like a metaversy decentralized web 3 approachable they're going to be which is going to like move the needle in the the acceptance of it because like uh in the younger generation they are not on facebook anymore like they are like it's it's uh it's different platforms like you have twitter you have tik tok you have like just playing video games that are not on facebook and um it's gonna be interesting to see this play out and like i'm going to remain open we're going to follow it closely of course um but it's exciting because it shows that there's major brands into this space um but we are skeptical we're going to remain cautious yeah yeah so all right again i wish i had you for another hour because i have so many questions i didn't get to uh but let's close with you're also a co-founder on this project rumble kong league that is a play to earn game is that the way it's called or project it's an nft project give us the the quick spiel on rumble kong league against by st uh yes so yeah rambocon league is a initially launched actually as an ft collection but always with uh with a gameplay component in mind it is a play to earn game that is currently in development that is around like um about uh kong's playing basketball the 3v3 basketball and every player on the pitch is an nft that is owned by another user and this is the this is the premise which launched four months ago and um currently in development and very exciting as you said as well like steph curry he's uh like he he bought congress himself like we have paul george who is like or who changed his profile picture to his kong as well um there's several like sports brands and athletes involved in it and it's very exciting and but the part here for me goes back to a lot of the points that we touched before which is around like bringing utility and ownership to um players because like if you play nba or if you play fifa games like you play a game and then okay that's it but we want to push this a little bit further and bringing the ownership to the holder of the nft and let him decide like if he wants to have a nice profile picture or if he wants to have like a play to earn component behind it because we saw like what we're seeing is a lot of attention on play to earn a lot of put like attention on those nft like 10k nft collections and of course like this whole like nba basketball which is a very early adopter nft market which is uh very exciting to see well it's interesting you chose basketball given that there is nba top shot and so there is there is you know it sounds like a very different yeah like top shot top shot is very like top shot did a very good job in bringing a casual audience into the nft space and maybe you as well you talk to people and a lot of them will say like oh i got into the space because i played around with top shot and i collected some moments and then i stayed in the space and stopped using top shot and it's still like like we have a we have an audience that is a 3 billion gamers 2 billion basketball fans and and fast growing nft space that we want to build a product for and topshop is very much around collections and moments and we want to bring action to it and something that is more interactive that you can like you can watch the game play out that is not around the the players themselves but alter egos which are the the kongs in this sense which is uh like also bringing a little bit more fun into it than um and pushing the boundary so it's something that we launched four months ago um we're very happy with the with the reception of it as you said as well like there's uh there's basketball players who wear our merch which for me like half a year ago was never imaginable like it's a serial moment to see steph curry wearing like the the same logo that i have on the desk behind me like it's uh it's crazy how did that happen did you all pitch them or they just found it naturally i know steph he has a board ape like he's savvy in the space but do you know what drew them in how this happened no i think there was there was a lot of components so he's actually like a lot of like a lot of nba players they are very um nft uh adapt and savvy and they're they're in the space and i think like he did he did his research and um like uh i can i can say it on record like we have no doing in him buying a kong like it's all organically and because it's a question that we get asked a lot as well if we repaid anything for this or him wearing the beanie and there's no involvement like he just uh he he likes the like he seems to like the brand and um for us this is like it's the highest form of recognition that we can get from someone like him or like like other like we have a we have tyrese halliburton who joined our discord like very shortly after mint like you have ja rule who has a like who has also like is very close to the community and it's a it's a fun group and um we like we had no doing in this like he bought them organically we um we we might have nudged them in the direction hey there's merch that you can also get that is on brand you know you because one of the big questions i get all the time i know i'm now going back on my word which i said there was one last question but i i know one of the things i get asked a lot i imagine you do too is like hey i'm launching a collection how do i get noticed like this space is so over saturated yeah do you want to you know give 30 seconds or whatever you can give on on how you approached getting the word out about rumble kong i mean sandbox 2 obviously being director of marketing but rumble kong so that staff was even able to realize you existed yeah yeah yeah it's a and as you mentioned as well like i think like the time our time to market was different than it is now so when we when we launched it was four months ago like uh of course we've been inspired by the second wave of collections after the the punks or that has been the board apes that i think it was in march or something and they like kicked off this wave of um of collections of nft projects that that's still to date like causes five to ten collections launching every day and um what for us was important like what i what i described before like we have we have a very unique value proposition like we combine a lot of things that is around like play to earn around like collections about basketball sport like fashion is a big big pillar for us because like we're building more than a collection building a brand that is rkl like we have merch we have our logos like uh basketball players where our like our brand and um and i think there's a lot of components that resonate with a with a lot of people in the space that um that they can see something which goes also like back to utility if you have a like and and quality as well like our art like the longest time we spend on nailing the art and making it look like high quality and i think um a lot of like a lot of projects out there they think it's an it's an easy task because they see like all of those projects they sell out and they make uh so much money and it's it's great and it's very easy why don't i do that but there's so much behind this like it's month of work that we put into like uh every trade like every look and feel and our like our like our white papers out there that people can read and it's like it's i think it's like 15 or 20 pages long just talking about game like game design it's a game design document essentially and there's a lot of work like there's a lot of sleepless nights a lot of long days and and it's not as easy as it sounded like if anyone listening currently thinking of launching a collection do it because worst case it's a great learning experience best case it's going to find its community and it's gonna like it's gonna work but um do it because you're passionate about it and you it's something that you believe in because otherwise i think it's gonna be a very like it's gonna be a long road ahead and uh for us like we all love basketball we all love gaming we all love like nfts and what is attached to it and i think it shows in our communication and what we're doing and then what we're putting out there and then like for us we were in a very lucky position where we have a very good value proposition a very good product um that got picked up organically and then you have word of mouth so people talk about it and we see that like there's we have we have i think we have zero marketing spent on like we have merch that we spend money on but apart from so what are you doing what's the point of yes i'm just sitting here yeah in the world yes exactly like i'm just sitting here and ever have a collection do it try try to do it um no and um but it's a lot of word of mouth like how do we present something how do we display the brand how do we build a brand like it's a it's a brand that's actually four months old and like for us the challenge now is um to answer your question what i'm doing is how to like how to reach like get the word out beyond this nft space that we're in and i want to have a brand that reaches mass market awareness and that you hear about because it is directly linked to gaming directly linked to basketball and directly to sport and play to earn and this is going to be the challenge over the next uh next like years essentially um but it's a it's a very exciting challenge and i like i love the i love the community i love every like uh person like i'm super thankful for everyone that that got a kong because like we had a like we have a floor of one and a half east which is a lot of money and i'm i'm like i'm still like i have moments where i'm uh i'm i'm literally speechless like i don't know what happened in the last year like it feels like a fever dream of nfps and uh like it's i'm super i'm super thankful and uh i i say that like in every opportunity i get like i'm thanking everyone that is part of the project because it's just like what we also said like we just want to do cool and i think it shows and uh i think this is also like what drew me into this space like the nft space is very welcoming still and uh it might change as it's going to get more mass-market and there's going to be more people in but still like um like you you send me a dm if i want to hop on this call and yeah sure let's let's just do it yeah it's very cool yeah amazing just having fun well fantastic well thank you so much we'll we'll have you back in
