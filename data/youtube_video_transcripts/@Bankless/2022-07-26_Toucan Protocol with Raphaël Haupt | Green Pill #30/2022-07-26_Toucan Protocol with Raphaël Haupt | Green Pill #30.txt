what's up coordination how you doing today on the pod we got raphael from 2km uh toucan launched in october of 2021 to be an infrastructure provider behind the base carbon ton which is the carbon reference token and released in the with their launch partner climadow which is a platform built on toucan's technology that helps remove carbon from the atmosphere so basically uh the bct achieved 2 billion dollars in trading volume in 2021 which i just think is incredible i mean yeah it was a bull run but two billion dollars and they had just launched and uh basically they have really been thinking deeply about the intersection of web 3 and carbon neutrality and i just think that you know coordination i call you coordination because it's a nation of coordinators we're here to coordinate and to solve multiple traps and game theoretic problems and climate change is like the biggest one it's not the only one but it's the biggest one and so i think that what toucan is doing is like the intersection of web 3 and climate action and that's regenerative crypto that's coordination and if web 3 is going to allow us to program our values into our money and we value having a climate that's not burning and oceans that aren't boiling then i think this is an important piece of the global financial open source uh infrastructure that is building so is toucan the solution for that it sounds like they're one of the money legos or refi legos that is working on that and i think that this episode kind of dives into that good sister episode to the clean medal episode that we did a couple weeks ago and i think that you're really gonna enjoy this episode so without further ado i give you raphael from toucan enjoy immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers

coinshift.xyz bankless all right hey raphael how you doing hi hi kevin so excited to talk to you yeah so glad to have you i i just really think that within the refi space uh working on the climate and existential risk is one of the highest use of of web 3 in dowels and that's why i'm so excited to have you to talk about toucan protocol so can you tell me about about toucan sure so toucan really is about being an infrastructure layer to make refi possible right so um i think we played a crucial role into in like making refi actually a thing and um yeah essentially we started by bringing carbon credits on chain having carbon as a building block to unlock all the innovation that can happen on top of it so really we're we're kind of an infrastructure layer focused to um unlock you know builders and like help builders build build better things and greater things on top of you know on top of web3 that will address the time of crisis amazing so uh what would you say that like if toucan is maximally successful say in like 10 or 20 years what is it what does that look like like x number of carbon taken out of the atmosphere like what's the positive externality if you had to quantify it yeah i mean for me it would have to do with um having changed the financial system and really like you know that defy and refi would not be two different places but would be the same place right and i think this is what i'm really excited about is that uh in web 3 we have the possibility to embed regenerative practices into the code and into the protocols that like the next you know the world it will be built on so um for me like two can will be successful if in you know every uniform transaction or every you know if any transaction on chain um some portions some value would flow back toward regenerative practices so that's one thing and that would obviously ultimately translate into financing the best the best carbon removal projects and removing carbon from the atmosphere and hopefully be back within levels of greenhouse gases that are creating a sustainable environment for our society to live in right because ultimately right now we're like far beyond the planetary boundaries and it's really about like bringing our economic system back into those planetary boundaries so um yeah that's so i want to get back into the practical but uh let's go let's go deep on on some of that a little bit first so planetary boundaries uh i was just recording a podcast the other day with someone who said that we have a linear materials economy uh that's based off of materials on the earth and then we have this like need for exponential growth in our economies and so basically these two things are constrained with each other there's a planetary boundary of of how much energy that we have how much carbon can we externalize and biodiversity and lots of other things and you know how do you how do you sort of think about planetary boundaries when it comes to this space and in the impact that you can can have yeah so obviously it's it's it's a lot about energy right i there's a there's a good view of like society being a heat machine really what we do is we you know we we take low entropic energy right in form of like oil and gas etc like energy that has been condensed into like very you know small taking up very small space um and we combust that energy it dissipates heat and it creates like highly entropic waste essentially which is like greenhouse gases etc so um the on that front right unlike the greenhouse gas level obviously we've gone beyond the planetary boundaries and you know it's like what is like is what is planetary boundaries here right it's not that the earth really cares um it's that uh organisms and the species living on earth that really care right that like we need to stay within that zone like it's we're in a very very kind of unique position in kind of the broad history of time where the temperatures are like not moving too much and this is essentially like the ground for for our for the world like for for the life forms that currently live on the earth to to survive so and right now we're shooting out of that band right we're shooting beyond that and um so um and as you said the challenge is that right now our kind of economic system is based on extraction so we will extract like a lot of that um and this is why it's tied to money as well like a lot of like um practices that generate money are based on extraction and so we don't have that kind of path that flows back into putting that greenhouse gas back into into like fixed forms into you know like reinvesting into capturing that carbon so we're basically just creating more and more heat more and more heat and um we're not you know not not creating a um a sustainable sustainable system and especially not regenerative nice and and do you see like basically all these like money legos in the refi space around carbon capture and then hopefully uh transferring money into that kind of correcting for the that externality um you know like how do you envision sort of the the blockchain ecosystem helping to attempt to address this problem and maybe even solve it if if if we're lucky yeah i mean it's a coordination failure at its heart right and so yeah yeah the coordination failures is what we're trying to solve in here yeah i i mean this is so true for climate right like it's just a big yeah it's just a big mess and it's gonna take a lot of people and a lot of capital and coordinate that to to kind of fix it right so um coordination is the name of the game um it's ultimately about moving like substantial amount of resources especially financial resources from the global north to the global south that's a pain today in like the existing financial system like it's it's really hard and if you then also want to like make sure that that money flows towards projects that are most impactful there's a component here about like measuring impact getting that data you know um making sure that that donation or that like um um money that is flowing there is used in this most efficient way so you know what what we believe with stuken is that the systems that will kind of you know unfuck the planet and allow that coordination to play out and for the best they need to be you know running on open systems that's like open source open data open access and um so this is why we believe that by building this like ground layer like carbon credits really are just vehicles to like move money from atv right it's a results-based finance mechanism where there's a climate project on one side that is like planting trees like you know to simplify things somebody some third party is like verifying that those trees are actually there and have captured that carbon so it's like an exposed verification and then the carbon credit really is just like a packaged positive externality that can be moved around and right and like one of the things like the most prominent use case for these packaged positive externalities today is to use them to match them with your negative externalities and call yourself carbon neutral or like call your company carbon neutral whatever which is a pretty boring use case in my opinion for for something good and so what i believe with that you know with rept3 we have also other means other use cases for like how do we make money flow to positive things i mean and github ultimately is the best example of that right like just you guys just prove like that this is possible so um i mean it's incredible like the bitcoin like the last round like the top three projects where glamour projects that's insane like so um yeah sorry i got lost here but like i i hope i answered the question in that in that download yeah no it's just neat i mean like in d5 they have money legos and um you know the nice thing is that when you're launching an erc20 token you can take the open zeppelin repo and then you know you can launch governance on top of compound like that's what git coin did when we launched stardow and it's really nice to have that forkable and composability because everything can be interoperable yeah from there and just speeds up innovation because you have all these money legos that you can combine and and the reason why i'm saying this is like that composability i could see being really useful in the refi space as basically you have different people that are providing different uh i don't say money legos like refi legos yeah and it seems like is aiming to have like a core core one of those yeah 100 and ultimately toucan is a bet on the web3 community right like um we are running out of time and solving the club crisis so we cannot build barriers around innovation in on the climate side right and that's what the status quo looks like the the current carbon markets are like basically behind mode it's hard to access it's hard to get a vera account it's hard to like play in that market like and especially hard to innovate in that market so um the objectives just like to break that open create like as you said a kind of carbon lego that like people can build on top on and then innovation can happen and then you know who knows maybe the maybe the the project that is gonna solve climate change is gonna be built on top of toucan right um and i think really like we don't have all the answers so we need to get the community to like build and like try out and like the iteration cycles are just so small in web 3 that's that gives me hope really at the end of the day great um anything more to say about the sort of like systemic climate crisis and um like the game theory or just like any like abstract thoughts before i take us back down into the real object level tangible nuts and bolts of of toucan yeah i mean one thing that's just really important is like the climate crisis is like one crisis but we also have a biodiversity crisis and the water crisis and other things right so we're fighting that carbon war but like we need to make sure that it's kind of happening within a broader like you know that it makes sense based on this like broader landscape of crisis that we are that we are in um but the good thing is that if we do it right you know climate finance also um impacts how like hopefully impacts like biodiversity and like water retention local communities etc but we need to do it right so um that's just like one thing that i think is really important the other one is that um you know offsetting is uh not the only solution right ultimately it's about reducing emissions and not just compensating those emissions so um and you know going beyond that like carbon neutrality because the the challenge that we have if we like if everyone is carbon neutral we haven't moved the needle a bit right we're just basically saying okay we're stopping at that point and we already have like greenhouse gas levels that are beyond what we what's good for the world so um those are some like some um some thoughts that i have but you know at the end of the day um the last you know i'm not sure if you haven't read like ministry for the future and like the whole uh i haven't but it's been recommended to me a couple times so i may have to add it to the list yeah you should i mean um it's it's based on an idea from the delton chang on like green quantitative easing and i and like that's one of the things that got me really excited and you know it's the idea how do we back money with carbon and like stuff that we actually care about as a as a society and i do believe that like if there is a place where we can try that out right if there's a place where we can start experimenting with like money and how money relates to um to value into the environment etc it is web free right and we've seen some of those experiments already in web 3 and there's like more and more projects that are incorporating carbon as a building block or as a collateral asset in their protocols and that's really interesting because we're essentially creating these like economic carbon things where um you know if you use carbon as a collateral and make it out for instance that those carbon credits are kind of locked in there and it creates like a kind of pull um and um yeah that's that's i think that's really that you know that's really interesting because we could actually if we do it right trigger some kind of carbon gold rush and kind of flip flip the you know flip the thing on its head and like get people to like do carbon projects because if you do carbon projects you can actually mint money from it so yeah it's a bit out there but i do think ultimately um you know we are at a point where we need these crazy ideas and like hopefully one of those crazy ideas is going to work right yeah it's a nice thing when you take the systemic view of the ethereum ecosystem is that it's kind of letting a thousand experiments blossom and then you know we have these bear cycles where 50 of those projects will die but then the ones that live will yeah you know inform the next epoch of of everything so it's it's it's all about that experimentation from my perspective and this is one of the most important things the space could be working on in my opinion 100 100 i'm really like you know we started at a hackathon in east london actually in 2020 and that was just before the re that sorry the refi somewhat the d5 summer and um nobody cared about carbon i can tell you i was there at pcc tried to like convince people hey nobody cared uh and now look where we are right two years later and like refi is a thing refiles on the map like i know like hundreds of builders that are kind of building towards that so uh you know now it's a bear market which is the perfect time to build anyway so i'm really excited to see what's gonna come up in like one year one and a half years and like you know all the teams that will have been building you know in silence and that will come out so right yeah so you all have been around oh wow for a couple years now and um you know take me through the launch so i see in my notes here that y'all launched in october as the infrastructure behind the base carbon ton and that y'all are partnered with cleveland who we just had on the podcast a few weeks ago actually so i would love to like learn more about the nuts and bolts of the system and and uh in that first experiment yeah absolutely so we as i said we started as a hackathon project when we were still called co2 cam um back in february 2020 and um then we did the blockchain for social impact incubator um kind of kind of building on the idea to like bring carbon on chain um and kind of use the dow to verify um yeah to verify that the bridge of like bringing carbon on train is actually is actually valid you know the ideas were there but you know we were still pretty early i ended up doing nine months in a kind of a venture building in london called deep science ventures to really like flash this idea out and really dive deep that's where james um one of the other founders uh joined me also in that research phase and we basically spent um yeah six months together just mapping this whole space out right and it's funny because then when i go back to these drawings and like these um figma boards um i remember that it felt so unreal two years ago like when we were like sketching this out oh we need you know we need decentralized carbon standard digital mrv and all of these things didn't plug together into like an open data layer right it was all more like intellectual masturbation i would say or it felt at least like that at that point but it was ultimately what you know if i look at it now all these things are kind of happening now and it doesn't seem so crazy anymore but coming out of that kind of venture builder part we decided that the most impactful thing that we could do with toucan is to um build this like first carbon or like money lego um to you know use the existing carbon supply and bring it on chain so that we could have you know our like that we could experiment if the with free space is actually interested in tokenized carbon and in that building block and along the journey refrigerator appeared and you know it makes sense as not refinance sorry chemida appeared and it made sense to you know use toucan as the infrastructure behind um behind klima dao and so uh klimadao um had this theory of change of like sweeping the floor of uh of carbon and so um that's how the base carbon ton basically was created so they uh one of their advisors and like their team um came up with the requirements for the base carbon tons basically which credits are can be can go into just to explain how these pools work right so what how token works is that we right now um we connect to legacy carbon registries like like vera and allow holders of these carbon credits to tokenize them to bring them on chain right and so we don't actually own the carbon we don't transact that it's really just an infrastructure provider and basically you hold your carbon credit as a certificate and you turn it into a token and then that that token on chain has all the metadata that is attached to their project right so it can be like a you know reforestation project from brazil from 2020 et cetera all these attributes are attached to it and then ultimately what these these pools allow you to do the base carbon pool for instance it allows these different projects and these different credits to be put into the same basket the same pool to create a single kind of more commoditized version of that carbon so the base carbon ton essentially is backed by you know millions of different carbon credits from different projects that all satisfy those criteria that need to be true in order for you to be able to deposit any carbon ton into the base carbon pool and so the base carbon pool um was the first kind of collateral asset behind behind klima dao um and you know was kind of optimizing for um that kind of sweep the floor narrative um yeah so today i think there's like that narrative has shifted slightly on their side um i personally think that like um yeah the base carbon ton as a as an asset um is you know fits very well with to that to to that narrative i don't think it fits super well as being an offset like an asset to offset your emissions which is an unpopular opinion i'll say that you know um but um it's you know it makes sense like the sweep the floor narrative was basically like let's take the the the oldest and like the um the lowest quality credits put them into a pool like get them off the market and like lock them into the black hole of the of the clematis treasury and now that narrative has shifted towards being a you know um being more of a of a marketplace a liquidity aggregator etc and uh yeah i personally find it a bit problematic because you know the these the carbon credits are based in the base carbon pool are not of highest quality and i think it still has a role to play as a as a you know as a tool to get that off the market um but to make environmental claims against that um i think is a bit more challenging or a bit more questionable let's see got it so um it's one of the reasons sorry like that's one of the reasons that we launched like the nature carbon ton which is like only nature-based carbon credits and like has a you know a bit more of a um constrained acceptance criteria so not all types of credits can be deposited into the nature carbon pool to maintain entity right got it and it looks like from my notes it i'm not sure if i wrote this down right but two billion dollars in trading volume uh during the entire year of 2021 it seems like it seems like a lot for a first year launch yeah i mean it was the hype was real right like yeah um the hype was real um olympus dow was going great until it wasn't and um and clean it out was the the biggest project the the you know the biggest contender to being the next olympus now so there was a lot of hype about this um and you know be steeping the the the main asset backing backing climate obviously saw a lot of that a lot of their trading volume yeah um definitely belong beyond anything that we would have imagined or like yeah um yeah it is it's been it's it's been a explosive and explosive launch in in that regard got it so um you mentioned olympus style uh and i know that i think that olympus dow cleanly that was a fork of olympus cell and they used some of the same tech but were they one of the biggest sort of consumers of the of the tech like what what dallas have you seen kind of adopt like where that volume come from i guess is what i'm asking all that volume came from klima like clema was the first like the the first use case built on two can so all that volume i i wouldn't credit that volume to toucan that would be no that would not be correct like that volume was generated because of climate and um yeah so and ultimately bct is is an asset that's been it's a you know it's built on two can tech but it's built right um it's you know very much a clever asset in that regard right i see okay cool we'll uh where are you all going from here what's next yeah so i mean the the bear market is the best time to build right so i think there's still a lot of uh there's a lot of education to be done be you know to get these two niche worlds together as as i'm sure you're very aware of like the the web3 world and the kind of carbon world are are both quite niche and like the overlap is still relatively small so right there's a lot of education to be done on like the traditional carbon market side because ultimately we're not building tweaking to just like you know give some like what free people um you know just stay in that in that bubble and like you know you know get build this building that's like you know that we believe that this is going to uh like swap over uh into into the traditional carbon market and we really really believe that that climate is one of the killer applications for blockchains because we're dealing with intangible assets we're dealing with like you know you know what what is a carbon credit it's like you know it's a great it's a bit of data some signatures and a pdf like so that's where there's been so much fraud and like along that value chain so our objective really is to legitimize on-chain carbon within the traditional carbon market space so um that that's one recall another one is to get like to diversify the the supply that we haven't you again so uh to move you know beyond just like vera credits and like onboard you know different sorts of you know carbon removal and like more more um maybe also like more niche types of carbon assets um and then ultimately it's just driving the driving the integrations in in in web street right like there's there's still um refi still a relatively small bubble and um so you know just just building building the the general consciousness of like hey we as a we as we're free society as a you know we have a role to play in you know in addressing the family crisis and we actually have the tools that we need to address the climate crisis and we just need to use them and we need to build communities around them that like that can yeah that can that can bring those tools and like drive that financial like drive that money to the projects and i think you know if you look at if you look at git coin who would have thought you know that this is i mean maybe you you probably saw it but like i have to say i didn't i didn't see it when i when i first saw it kind of like wow that's that's cool but like um yeah i didn't uh i didn't i didn't get it from from from from the get-go how powerful this is right so the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with

small businesses and local economies all on selloff follow along on twitter to learn more about how cello is accelerating refi summer for a positive impact on people communities and the planet if you're attending ecc visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts yeah i mean i think the refi space is so the re-fi space is so it's so small and so niche but i think that this is honestly one of the highest use is of the blockchain space and one of the things i've been trying to figure out is just how to have more web3 people understand the refi space and take it seriously i think a lot of people think that this is going to be just like charity 2.0 but because the ngo sector is so stagnant and um blockchain has so much to offer i think to capital it's trying to have an impact on the world i i have i just trying to figure out how to build it to to be a bigger bigger thing within the space but also how do we legitimize refi web 3 to the carbon markets and to people who care about energy because the reputation is is really quite bad now it is yeah that's like and that's really sad to be honest that like uh crypto still has this like scam um scam appeal to to a lot of to a lot of people and it's like i mean like with duke and we spend so much time just explaining how you know like you know how terra is not has not much to do with us or like you know like um terra you know or like anyways like this it's still it's still very much a a bridge building exercise right i always joke that like you know we we thought that building the carbon bridge in twicken was the hardest part but ultimately building the bridge between those two communities is significantly harder so um but yeah and that's true on both sides right that's true in both the kind of carbon market world which kind of looking at that with three space with like with doubts and like and fears um and then there is like the tradition with three space that i have to say sometimes is like um you know some people who really are like very very close-minded in in in um like i find like that the and you know i only learned that like now by kind of going beyond my my small bubbles number three that i realized that oh wow like for a lot a lot of people still i thought with you know i thought refry was bigger than it really is right i guess that's what i'm trying to say it's like for for so many it's still not still just a money-making yeah it's like it's it's it's all about kind of building financial tools to like make profit or whatever and i think that um we're just replicating what we see in the web 3 and they were like the web 2 space and we're just like putting it on like on on the blockchain and like yeah then it just happened yeah because capitalize on steroids right and like we're basically back to like an unregulated um wild west um you know i'm not like i find that i don't know what's your position regulation in the space like it's i find it really i find it really hard to to have a you know a good opinion about those um just about where it's going and the the need is it is it bad is it good like where you know like do we want more immigration um like yeah yeah um sorry is what bad or what good regulation do you think that regulations have more regulation than three yeah uh that's a good question i i really like the i mean i think that like on the object level terrace collapse is bad um the amount of carbon that's being used is is bad and i think that we want to prevent people from losing all their money on ust you know if something was advertised as a stable coin because it it hurts the space um a lot and you know i i think that like on the carbon front the fact that the merge is happening and we're gonna be carbon neutral is going to be a real opportunity to go on narrative offense although there's people that have already decided that they hate web3 and they're going to rally against it and i think it's just going to have to be a generational thing where when it's here to stay people get normalized to it they don't hate it as much and like the analogy i make is like the internet was all about decent like sending information across the computer network and you could build a website for anything uh back then like the internet was for porn was like a broadway play that was it was like out there back then but like the internet is for porn but it's for lots of other great things news entertainment like education um and there's the same thing with like finances like the internet of money can be used for like ponzi schemes but it can also be used to solve the deepest systemic coordination failures out there and the real question is how do we create an informed base of people who can tell the difference between column a and column b and i don't know the exact way to do it but i do think first do no harm then go on offense and be a positive externality for the world and um i think that we're kind of like turning that that shift in in this market cycle into projects that just like capital rotating into just the same project the projects that have the best ponzinomics and away from that into the projects have the best real world impact and that's what i would like to see now how do we manifest that is i think the big question and you know there's a couple questions embedded in that one is like how do we get capital allocators to even like to put money into toucan uh or or projects like it and the second one is like how do we separate the projects that are actually meaningful like like yours from the scams and i think regulation is one way that it could be done but i'm skeptical that it's it's gonna work in a global open source financial system that a nation state regulation approach is is gonna piecemeal work so that's my answer to your question yeah i think it's a really really good answer i appreciate it i think i um yeah it's a it's a complex problem and i i share the same like regulation like from from where right because you asked me earlier like um well this is one of the key challenges with the climate crisis is that like nobody is responsible for it everyone is responsible for it some are more responsible for it but like ultimately we don't have that like global body that can say hey you united states please don't like stop emitting yeah there's no global body with legitimacy right because we've got the u.n but that's comprised a lot by like richer nations who have already extracted a lot of hydrocarbons out of the earth and so they don't have the legitimacy to tell the up-and-coming developing nations and so we're in this multi-polar trap where and we need like a neutral coordination bottom-up uh infrastructure i think that's like highly legitimate and also highly high resolution because we have the un but it's such like low residue resolution like handshake politics that we need something that you know is more like information age yeah and i think it can only be you know at this point it can only be from the bottom up because like the i think we're kind of at an inflection point where like so like global politics it's like you know yeah it's a network it's just the farts it's just the farthest over the direction right now the most official way and the like the best way to get things done in an information rich world is is with networks networks exactly so yeah um i know probably a bit off track now but uh yeah i i i agree like it's the um it's it's our it's our task to make people you know to educate people and make people care and um and kind of find these loopholes and like you know how do we and ultimately as i said like there's no there's no easy answers here like the yes we're trying to have real world impact like we're trying to change the you know ecology the local ecology in like you know colombia or whatever like we're trying to have real impact on the ground so yeah um but that's also what's so fascinating about it right like because it is about like you know center is about like getting that data kind of making sense of the world making sense of that data connecting it to like the assets on chain transacting these assets and ultimately you know like making like embedding that like you know programmable carbon embedding it into um into systems right into the metaverse let's you know have yeah let's plant trees in the metaverse that actually you know sequester carbon in the real world or um we had an interesting you know uh talking talking gated communities or uh where you know you have some you know only if you can are provenly kind of contributing towards um addressing the climate crisis you can be part of some community or you can you know you get rebates when you do shopping or whatever like how do we how do we incentivize behavior ultimately that we want to see in the world and yeah i mean like we and that's where all these like you know all these pondynomics all these like um just pure financial applications they're building tools that we can leverage to to to build these incentives as well right so ultimately i'm very thankful for i'm very thankful for the ground work that's been done and like that we have these like you know open tools available and we can just like change a few parameters and and and we have a kind of open carbon market right so yeah which is why i would i would push back a little bit on your your supposition that we're off track because i don't think there's a track um it is we are part of this broader ecosystem right it's a funnel the total value in in web 3 uh and the total brand awareness of web 3 are like the top of the funnel and then and and then like the regen web 3 and the awareness of that and the value in that is is the next part of the funnel and then coming off of of of that is this kind of like circular economy but also these positive externalities for material and living capital that come out of that so it's it's about widening widening the funnel into i think that the work the work that you're doing um and and i think that's super important so um yeah anything to say about that as a funnel yeah i wanted to ask you about something um the the you said something about like the narrative offense on like you know ethereum moving to to stake and the emergence that were happening like how do we deal like how do we leverage that like um i remember i remember talking to to liggy from the ethereum foundation like last summer i think it was or like even two years ago i think i don't know it's you know um where we were talking about like um how do we offset their how do we offset the merge like how do we offset the historical footprint of ethereum on you know like together with the merge because like um you know the merge is awesome we're reducing the emissions by 99.9 or something um but like how do we go into like the narrative offense how do we use the collective kind of power of web 3 to kind of show that like this community cares this community has like you know has the values and the the power to make a real difference in the world so um i don't know i think like you know when we had this discussion um a while ago the merge was still pretty far away now it's like around the corner um exactly um so yeah oh yeah um i i think you were just asking like how do we go on narrative offense around carbon yeah yeah like yeah how do we how do we leverage that like um yeah yeah i mean i think first do no harm right have no negative externalities first so like by the way the negative externalities of web 3 are not just like carbon which like by the way the merge is going to be great for future emissions i if there was a dow that developed to offset the historical emissions more power to them i think that'd be great i think it'd be cheaper to do during a bull market than a bear market because there's more capital to go into carbon um but um so yeah the carbon negative externalities but also the ponzi negative externalities are bad also like if retail investors are getting fleeced into like the next tara that's pretty bad too and so um you know like the people who have already decided that they hate web3 will just shift narratives if if web3 only does the carbon offsetting and doesn't fix the ponzinomic like the the capital rotation into ponzis um and so i think that those are the two major major negative externalities that i'm aware of and um and then i think from there it's a matter of really highlighting the category of impact owls and that that category even exists helping the talent in the capital find those impact dials is is sort of the the next thing and then you just it's like a scale like negative externalities go down and positive externalities go up um and i don't know i don't know about like marketing or messaging it or media campaigns but i only even want to be involved in media campaigns if it's true like i'm not going to market that if it's not true so i think it's first like actually making it true and then the messaging will take care of itself in a in a networked world is is sort of my maybe somewhat naive approach but um you know i think toucan is going to be like a key part of this story if you all keep growing and doing billions of dollars of of of of trading volume uh and working on this yeah working on this 100 i think that is the that is the that is the mantra that is a mantra for the next for the next month now like um i don't know how you how are you experiencing the the bear market like is it is it bad for you guys or is it just or do you appreciate the yeah the reduction of noise yeah um what's funny now i feel like you're interviewing me sorry i don't know just the way this has gotten conversational at the end but uh i do think that you know like you've been around since the last bear and bear market is the best time to build like you said um i i'd be curious you know like what i didn't ask you that you that you want to tell me you know that we've talked about like messaging ecosystem game theory and economics of climate change and then toucans nuts and bolts like what didn't we cover or or how would you connect the dots further um yeah so i mean i i often you know i i kind of touched on a few on a few points as i said like um our core belief is that like you know by building these these money legos or these carbon legos we we can unlock stuff so it'd be like duking is really at a point now where like you know the the sdk like the the you know the contract the smart contracts kind of integrate carbon are like already and it's like easy to build now so like i welcome any like um any experiment any like also obviously big big projects to like in to think about how can you know how can a protocol integrate you know carbon as a as a building block into into their protocol so you know for instance where like how do we how can we redirect some of the yield that is generated in what three towards like permanently retiring carbon credits like you know making value flow back so i think this is a very interesting um a very interesting point then ultimately uh we are on the path to go kind of multi-chain we launched on polygon we're now like we're building a bridge to to cello and then building a bridge like like obviously ethereum and others um waiting for the waiting for the merge uh to to become a reality and then um um so yeah like any like any talent that is like you know that wants to work on that on that niche of like web3 climate um please you know hit us up we're we're hiring and like looking for looking for the like smartest and like most motivated people to work on like the hardest problems so um i think other than that i mean obviously i can dive into kind of the mechanics and how token works but i guess um that you know like i don't know how much time we got um we got left but yeah yeah we got uh about five minutes left can we do maybe do like a high level overview in five minutes or should we just direct people to to something written um i mean we have a ton of like our like ton of content on on the vlogs that has blogs that you can earth um and yeah and there's another one which is developer developers or developer dot token dot earth let me just check that developer dot token dot earth so that's the builder hub that is specifically targeting builders and has like uh there's a grant program as well uh for builders and there's like you know example projects that are kind of building on toucan and um like documentation and all of that so i think this is a great resources you know if you wanna you know build there another thing that's really cool is like um you know we've we've came out of like colonel as well uh and we we're um yeah looks like you have a bitcoin grant also so i think that we've we've intersected in in multiple ways already oh yeah absolutely you guys have been like you guys have been awesome man really yeah it's not it's not us it's the ethereum community we're just a channel for which they give you money but but yeah that's that is true that is true but um yeah i was about to say like colonel uh we're uh hosting the refi or like the regeneration guild um for for the next for the next round of uh of kernel as well um there's been one already in the past which was really cool so you know if you wanna get building in the space and you don't really know how to start and where to start etc um i honestly cannot recommend colonel moore like it's it's beautiful people but it's also you know like extremely extreme informative and like yeah like uh and hands-on you actually do stuff so that's uh that's amazing those are some of the some of the key things that i uh they have to say and obviously you know we're gonna be in barcelona right now i don't know when this podcast is coming out probably that's not relevant but you know if you're if you're going to paris um we're going to be there as well nice yeah so maybe i'll see you at ucc yeah so it sounds like uh check y'all out we'll have a link to the toucan website on uh the show notes and thanks so much for joining me on the green pill podcast ref thanks kevin that was really fun yeah definitely [Music] you
