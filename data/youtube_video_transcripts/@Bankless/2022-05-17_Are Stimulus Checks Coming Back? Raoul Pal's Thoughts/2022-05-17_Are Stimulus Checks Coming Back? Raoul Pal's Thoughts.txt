you've talked about the thing that's going to break the bear markets back and sort of have the fed reverse course is this idea of a stimulus describe this scenario for us this is the stimulation the way it was the stemi check was a new thing that we'd not really used before as a monetary tool so the issue is with just printing money is it makes the rich rich because the denominator falls and the value of the assets go up so people who own assets make a fortune and the people who don't earn assets get poorer but if you give it directly to people politicians love it because you buy votes you kind of bypass all of the political system and you give it directly to people it actually helps people who need it so it helps with the disparity between rich and poor i don't see a world with which this does not get used particularly when there's some complexity to the macro which is prices are high you know if we seem to be stimulating by cutting rates people can accuse us of stoking inflation so why not just give people money directly
