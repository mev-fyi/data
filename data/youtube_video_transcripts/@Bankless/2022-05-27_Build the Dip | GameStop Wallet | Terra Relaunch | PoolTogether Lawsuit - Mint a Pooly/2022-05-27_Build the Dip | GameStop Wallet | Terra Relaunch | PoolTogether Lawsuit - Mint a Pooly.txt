you know crypto represents just 0.3 of the average household's net worth 0.3 that's it my house is a little different than that imagine your household is a little different bankless nation happy fourth and final week of may david what time is it oh ryan it's the friday bankless weekly roll-up time where we cover the entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless as we go into this build market that we are going into uh we're gonna talk about all the shenanigans that went down in the last seven days i like that man it's not it's not the bear market it's the build market right and that's our mantra is build the dip we're not gonna you're not gonna buy the dip well you should do that too but first let's build our way out of this thing and that's what we're doing david it's good to see you back man but this is our last recording from your uh studio apartment in uh in san in san diego right yeah yeah it's gonna be the last time you're gonna see this background uh the for i'm gonna be like kind of uh figuring it out for the next three weeks because my stuff is gonna take time to get to brooklyn uh but in three weeks time there's gonna be a nice shiny brick apartment in brooklyn somewhere uh so new background new background my my background changes ryan's uh ryan just never changes mine stays the same and it will be here for the next five years of penguins all right well what do we get into this week uh topics of the week number one gamestop is releasing a wallet that's a big deal that's a really big deal horse on our side we're gonna take a peek at that what else we covering david uh we got luna relaunching we got luna round two we uh un-ironically now have luna classic and new luna uh so that is getting spun up under new management uh joe dokwan's troubles continues we're gonna update you on that also optimism token updates uh uh warning it's good for holders uh and then of course uh ryan you wanna take this one d5 going to court what's going on here yeah d5 is it's a court case that we covered a while ago frivolous lawsuits someone taking the pool together protocol to court but the community is fighting back and now there's a way to mint your protest i've minted mine we'll talk about uh pulleys and uh and what we're trying to do in the d5 community to get some funds to guard against that frivolous lawsuit last thing david this uh feels like a bear market but that's the thing with crypto there's always a bull market somewhere where's the bull market this week the ens numbers right now are absolutely insane so we got the april and may numbers in from the ens dial about all the ens metrics so we're going to go and cover all of those because uh ens is in a bull market at the moment guys every friday this comes at you so if you're on youtube make sure you like and subscribe right now just do that right now if you're listening to this podcast on apple or spotify leave us leave us a five star review okay that's how we pump this thing to the top of the charts and how do we get out of the of the bear market oh is that how that's how more people listen to bank list more people like buy the dip more people build the dip and all of a sudden we have a bull market on our hands so five star reviews strongly correlates to bull markets happens every time works like a charm there you go review the dip as well subscribe do the dip uh we also got something to tell you from our friends at alcomix uh alchemic sponsored this message they wanted us to tell you about their fantastic protocol dude this is the closest thing to financial magic i've seen because this kind of thing is not available in traditional finance but let me tell you how this works so the merge is coming you know we're in a winner bear market but who wants to sell their eth at these prices in the thousand range like who wants to do that i don't want to do that but maybe you need somebody 1800 not 800 1800 thousands range uh so here's what you can do with the alchemics you could take your eth you could put it in alchemix and you get your future yields paid to you up front so like a lumps on payment and you could do whatever you want with yields so maybe you need some student don't loans to pay back some car loans to pay back but you just want to treat yourself go like i don't know your tax bill your tax deal yeah treat yourself to paying off that tax bill uh it's it's it's a way you could do just those yields for after a long while you eventually get your eth back okay after and we call this the never sell plan in fact david you wrote an article about this like back in the day really cool protocol and it's not me if you could do this with other assets as well yeah you can also put dye in and die well alchemics will go out and yield farm your die in defy and it'll pay you your interest payments up front and all you got to do is sit on your hands and wait for that loan to be paid back uh it does take some time uh but the beautiful thing is is you can't get liquidated because that's how the protocol works there is no leverage here uh you are just taking future yield payments up front so there is a link in the show notes to get started bankless dot cc alchemics it's a capital a at the start uh for if you want to dive into the alchemics they also they updated their tokenomics so if you are an alcx holder uh they have a tokenomics upgrade you can take a peek at very cool all right speaking of tokenomics let's uh let's let's take a look at the bitcoin token economics bitcoin price what's that telling us david i mean my screen here bitcoin price it's down uh i lost 700 in the last week we started at 33 000 we had 29 400 ish uh so overall down two percent on the week um that's what a bear market looks like just two percent that's like a good week in the bear market because deep down is ethan's down harder yeah last lost seven percent in the last seven days uh that's one percent a day for the math whizzes out there uh started at two thousand dollars we are currently at 18 40. uh deputy dip in the dipper dipper on this one uh so yeah uh and of course bitcoin ratio that's already suffered right also down bad yeah down six percent um yeah my eighth bitcoin long uh long position is not feeling good cause i opened it right at the top right over there really uh not uh the most recent spike so i keep going a little bit to the right like right uh i can't really show you one on the right here uh yeah well it was that point like point seven something uh anyways you gotta stop betting on these ratios my friend just go long on the asset you love like do you remember i'm not gonna bring it up now i'm going to bring it up the d5 ether ratio is that going oh god yeah well i mean yeah there's there's no more dpi uh left in me on that one the ratios will kill you in this market but yeah so i mean people are more bullish bitcoin than they are ether in this particular week um that's kind of funny going to the merge but is it sort of a flight to safety is everyone freaking out and like hey bitcoin is still the traditional safe asset so we're going over there uh it is uh who the hell knows uh the east ratio is inherently hard to trade on the short time frames i'm just bullish on the fundamentals flipping in ether's favor with the merge in august which is what was said by both president van luen and justin drake on our panel and permission lists merge in august time where all of a sudden ether gets 30 million dollars a day increased net by pressure uh and so like how can you not be bullish what probability do you give that merch in august so so by the way it's not just david and i saying this not david and i saying this this is um preston van loon at permissionless last week and also justin drake saying that it was very likely that the merge would happen in august i'm paraphrasing a little bit but all the like the the stars are aligned also said there was a great deal incentive for this to happen um before before block fee block fees increase uh what's it called what am i thinking of david blackfeet oh uh uh was uh ice age ice age ice age yeah difficulty yeah difficulty bomb kicks in so it feels like it it's you know i don't know what what percentage would you sign i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go with 80 percent probability that happens in august yeah i mean i was going to say like 90 by the end of september just to include a couple weeks of lead time being said there needs to be no bugs discovered so under a condition no bugs discovered we are like 90 likely gonna there were going to be a post merge ethereum by the end of september agreed that's gonna be a big deal but it's likely gonna happen during a bear market and we'll see how the market reacts but how much did we lose on the crypto market cap uh 40 billion dollars in total crypto market cap lost uh in the last week um which you know that this is like small change i guess could be worse one luna down uh all right well let's get into some news man we we're gonna divide this because it's you know bear market season let's let's talk about the bear market news first then we'll get into the good news but let's bad news first so bear market news uh this is just general macro markets but have you seen ark innovation lately remember we had kathy wood on the podcast not less than a year ago and uh things are pretty good at arc still that has completely reversed look at these characters sound bad arc down yeah very s so okay arc is they were up let me see no 750 percent since october 14 uh 2014. since their inception that's a lot of that's a lot of percent okay so they were up 750 percent and now they're only up 112 percent and they're actually underperforming the nasdaq by a lot qqq business by a lot at this point so if you just had held nasdaq versus arc this point in time you would have been up more than double 2x yeah oof ooh it's pretty brutal it's pretty what do you think's going on here well i mean it makes sense if you if you take everything together right like the whole idea about arc is that it prices in the future uh kathy wood is saying like there is so much growth that the market is not pricing in right now we got growth in crypto and blockchain we got growth in electric vehicles like battery technology biotechnology and people are mispricing how much future growth is coming in the short term and so arc is based on the future uh which is crazy to think about like oh investing is about the future weird um but that's that's what the arc real brand is is like so much of typical investing is about just pricing in historical uh history uh like historical patterns but kathy wood is taking the counter trade of generally uh well accepted investing in pricing and future growth which just makes sense to me but also when the fed injects a bunch of money into the market it allows the whole market to price in the future uh when interest rates are cheap you allow people to look into the future and invest and speculate and so arc goes up 750 percent and then the inflation happens and then we increase the interest rates to tell people to stop looking for the future and start saving your dollars now uh and so then arc dies and goes down from 750 percent 112 so like this all just makes sense um other than right yeah you're not saying the future is more pessimistic suddenly overnight you're just saying like the the expectations for the market reaction to that future right the liquidity is kind of dried up and so cash flow potential of the future just looks much more pessimistic and dim right and this is why we're calling it the build market right same thing applies to crypto like crypto's future has never been brighter like the amount of building going on right now is insane yet prices don't reflect that prices are down bad because of monetary policy and interest rates and all that stuff so um it's not that you're wrong it's that the fed doesn't like it welcome to the build market this is the new reality i think we're all embracing open c new reality a seven day this is a chart of seven day average they're back to uh december 2021 levels and i think continuing to drop so nft market pretty bearish here too um let's switch it up though there's been some good news here okay here's the one i want to start with you to swap just hit one trillion dollars in lifetime trading volume david i remember not too long ago okay less three years ago uh people said again ether was dead bitcoin was kind of like the the only use case but it was dying as well d5 would never work smart contracts would never work what are they good for here comes this upstart uniswap that's saying hey we're creating a different type of exchange it's not going to be peer-to-peer it's going to be decentralized it's going to be peer-to-contract okay now here they are the experiment worked incredibly well three years later one trillion in value all right a lot of people said that this would never happen and now now we've hit it uh it pays to be contrarian in these bear markets 10 trillion by the end of 2024 i'd say uh also in the world of awesome numbers and metrics during our build market the ens boom is absolutely insane so here are the april 2022 ens stats 163 thousand new eat registration so that's almost a hun that's almost a million names registered uh all of those fees for registering all those names goes to the ens dow so the e s dow collected two thousand six hundred and sixty eighth in fees which is up from the most the previous all-time high of november 2021 which is the 900 eath more than november 2021 uh that's basically eight million dollars going to the dow uh three thirty eight thousand new eth accounts with at least one new ens name so this is a proxy for users because new new ethereum wallets buying their first ens name 38 000 of those and then over 40 000 eth being traded in secondary market sales just on open seas 4 000 i think uh 4 thousand eats yes and that was april that wasn't even may ryan that was april uh may is now all in and there is an all-time high for every single ens metric that uh nick johnson from ens tracks uh there if you are there's a link at the show now so go look at this but here's here are the things to look at uh april uh we're not even done with may and it looks like may's uh uh is already well yeah no we're not done with may we're already like 20 like longer or higher in terms of revenue for the protocol versus april we still have like five days left uh there's this is one of my favorite lines is that there's always a bull market somewhere uh it doesn't matter what phase of the market in you can always find a bull market uh the bull market uh cycle has rotated into ens names in the last like couple months or so that's really cool and this is another chart from nick what's this showing uh let's not he says oh let's not forget new and returning users to all-time high with returning users all-time high for new users uh ens speculation that's the thing there's there's more on the ens boom uh from william p wrote a fantastic article on this in metaverse we'll include a link to the show notes there too uh david as well some interesting reports actually two reports that i wanted to highlight is one from goldman sachs and the other from the federal reserve and i think the story here is oh my god most people don't have crypto yet so few people have crypto all right just just a few stats from the goldman report first you know crypto represents just 0.3 of the average household's net worth 0.3 percent that's it my house is a little different than that i imagine your household is a little different but 0.3 okay and this is if you compare it to the rest of the economy the total crypto market cap is about 1.3 trillion uh american household wealth sits at 150 trillion less than a percent less than a percent of uh total wealth is held in crypto right now um there's some other interesting stats like if you if you sort of compare how many adults hold crypto uh last year 12 of all adults in the us held crypto yeah the the story here is that there's a lot of people left to buy our bags bank list doesn't stop until 90 percent of all household wealth is crypto denominated uh and so we got a lot left to do the crazy thing is is that that these are numbers even after like the mania right and so uh we're about to see probably an exodus out of uh out of the crypto industry from all the tourists and while you know i would say like go check me on this run ryan but like 20 percent of people that come in during bull markets to stay as long-term settlers is that kind of high oh 20 stay 20 stay yeah side that might be like ten percent really stay twenty percent stay kind of interested they listen to podcasts yeah yeah yeah occasionally some people are like oh that's me yeah some people are not listening to this already because we still have a bunch of people to leave in the next life if we are indeed in a b market uh and so like there's so much growth left left in crypto uh hashtag early i guess did you say if we are indeed in a b market we're definitely going to be mark are we not either 1800 it's either still 1800 man we're still 400 above uh the last the top tick of the last uh bowl cycle um yeah which means maybe we have more to go yeah we'll talk about this more but like there's universal consensus that we are going down like another fifty percent and like i'm maybe doesn't know i don't buy it i think we could i definitely think we could everyone thinks that everyone thinks that here's you know what did you know though uh this is super interesting i i saw this from coinmetrix they put this chart out this week um if you look at kind of the three classes of tokens on ethereum right just divided into this ether stable coins and other tokens other erc 20 tokens all right the the the numbers come out like this stable coins are about 108 billion dollars all right uh other tokens non-stable coin tokens are actually less than this than that 86 billion dollars and ether is 240 billion dollars so ether is still the vast majority of value on the ethereum network stable coins are only 108 billion dollars but they've already exceeded as a killer app the rest of the erc 20s which are 86 billion dollars do you think that this will stay like this as a proportion what do you think happens in the future david okay so ethereum is meant to be a protocol for other applications many of those applications being token related seems to be the product market fit of ethereum we like tokens uh like it's been thought by the developers that a secure ethereum has like roughly a one to ten to roughly one to 100 ratio of value on top of ethereum to ether value because the easter value proof of stake secures the network right and so if we have a 10 trillion dollar ether market cap which is where we will eventually get to i'm sure uh we will have roughly a it will be safely storing and managing a hundred to 200 trillion dollars of total wealth on top of that and so that is the balance like a strong a strong foundation of 10 trillion dollars of ether market cap can safely secure 100 to maybe 200 trillion dollars on top of that as well uh also shout out to just like wealth generation on ethereum like when in the bowl case for ethereum the long-term uh what we're what we're here for is like hundreds of trillions of dollars of total wealth creation uh and so right now when we see only something like 20 of the ethereum of the ether market cap being uh secured on top of ethereum so much room left for growth absolutely it's another indication that we're early guys we got so much more coming up including the gamestop wallet we're gonna peek that open uh what else we got david oh my god we have uh the loopering boys are gonna be really happy about their game the game sock wallet so shout out to those guys luna 2.0 uh no i'll go stable coin this time so what is it uh and also loyalty coin season uh we're gonna talk about that a little bit uh bear market prices but bull market building uh we will be right back after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the era of proof of stake is upon us and lydo is

wallet is here uh you can go and download the gamestop wallet it looks like a metamask extension uh i believe it's also on mobilewallet.gamestop.com uh it's a layer two wallet and ryan has got it built into his browser already so i mean if you know what metamask is you kind of are going to be familiar with it but it's built on the loop ring layer too uh and so that the looping bros are super happy about that uh and so shout out to all them uh the alpha for what this thing actually is we actually i was trying to go around the blog post for like all right who's released like looping didn't release very much information gamestop didn't release very much information you know where the alpha is ryan you know where i found it uh i bet it's is it on the gme subreddits yeah the alpha is on the chrome web page store uh and so it goes through the features uh self-custodial ethereum wallet you can buy eth with a few taps or credit card or card using apple pay there's probably a back-end payment integration there you it's on the loop ring layer 2. it's got all the token standards of course ethe erc20 erc721 erc1155 uh send and receive it's good for payments you can swap both on the ethereum l1 and the loopering layer 2 you can connect your gamestop wallet to decentralized apps in the world of ethereum of course but the bigger question is what you can connect this to in the world of gamestop and so there are gamestop nfts at beta.nft.game those four dots uh and you can check it out there so gamestop um yep going from a brick and mortar business to a web 3 nft store i can't believe it i i'm super impressed by this actually like the meme became reality and they're actually getting into crypto in a meaningful way i mean this is like a meta mask level it looks good wallet it looks fantastic there's a place for your coins there's a place for your nfts there's a place to swap just like metamax in fact the user interface in some ways is kind of nicer yeah i mean obviously i haven't i haven't used this uh very much yet but it's supporting layer two out of the box which is loopering right now but they're gonna be incorporating other layer twos as well that's impressive completely self-custodial these guys are on it and uh i'm blown away with what they delivered in this first release so it's super cool to see david i thought we had wallet weeks week because remember we talked it was like robin hood and coinbase releasing a wallet and ledger releasing a wallet and now here's gamestop entering just in the past seven days all of these these wallets have come to fruition at least like i don't know 14 days now i don't know what the time span is but two weeks granted i haven't tried to explore the then use the other wallets yet that you just mentioned but this is the first wallet that we have on screen in the browser ready to go so uh kudos to gamestop for that oh boy from the ashes yeah yeah okay so it looks like luna is rising from the ashes i think so a luna 2.0 sort of thing here's a threat that explains it tara 2.0 i guess i should say so luna is a token tara is the chain of course there's going to be a new luna as well and uh basically what they're doing is relaunching this uh blockchain network as a layer one um without the algo stablecoin this time right so there seems to be some acknowledgement hey i think that was kind of a bad idea well that didn't work let's not do that again and they are distributing tokens luna classic or sorry luna tokens to the luna classic so i guess the old luna network is now called luna classic is that the case or is this little spot uh no old old chain luna classic a new chain is currently called luna okay and they're giving it to a community pool first of all so that's the guy gets the slush fund for the community to vote on that sort of thing then they're giving an allotment to the pre-attack luna holders 35 the pre-attack usd ust holders ten percent and then the post attack yeah oh my god i can't believe i'm reading that out and i didn't even notice that propaganda um but absolutely i refuse to call it an attack now that you said that um the post-incident post-collapse luna holders and the post attack uh post uh collapse usc holders as well are getting some portion of this um so i don't know i like i i'm glad there's some resurrection uh it seemed seems like that you know some similar ideas uh same management as well like i think doughnuts involved in this other thing no he will not be here he might really he is in trouble um are you sure oh okay he like was this his idea though i thought this was partially his idea but like he's not going to be phys like he's got other things to deal with is more what you're saying yeah i i think he like maybe i i don't know the details not connected to the terror ecosystem i would be surprised if do kwan is a leader in this whole entire thing especially while he is going through some legal issues oh boy uh can you tell us what some of those might be i think that's our next story uh yeah this is more related to the luna foundation guard uh and so police authorities in south korea have taken action to freeze assets tied to the lfg the luna foundation guard uh the the seoul seal so how do you pronounce uh the capital of south korea i've actually never sold yeah okay solo metropolitan police agencies got seoul yeah it's like ethereum's got soul absolutely uh the the police of seoul uh has asked multiple exchanges to block luna foundation guards from withdrawing any corporate funds uh and so uh there is rumors of embezzlement uh tbd on that but that is one of the reasons why the police have uh said that they have the authority to do this uh they said they intervened after finding clues they were indicating there was embezzled funds within the lfg oof that is an oof ryan that's what that is i remember there was some uh some podcasters maybe some critics who said that uh holding assets like bitcoin off chain was not a good idea by a small set of multi-sig signers not a good idea not to have a clean transparent audit trail for all of that stuff yeah but you're just a fighting ethnicity ryan man i am look i'm glad i hope this this will not be the last time we talk about tara and luna i'm sure but i'm glad i'm just hopeful that all of this can be pushed behind us i'm just done talking about it it's like it's over let's move let's move what's moving on this uh well not the only thing taken to court but this time not not so nice leighton cusack of pull together is sadly part getting wrapped up in this whole pool together lawsuit and this is becoming a bigger and bigger deal as we get more details about the lawsuit itself somebody deposited 12 into pool together and immediately filed a quarter billion dollar class action lawsuit on pull together because uh you know flagging's like it's a it's a lottery it's illegal uh i lost money on gas that's not that's i'm not making a joke about that that's in the whole thing uh and so uh pool together has like sadly been paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees to fight this thing this very innocent very beloved defy app a no-loss lottery you literally cannot lose money it's called a savings it's a savings it's called gamified linked savings account you put your money in and every once in a while if you win you get a bunch of money and then if you don't if you want to get out you get out uh it has pool together has onboarded so many communities from all across the world it's probably the most multinational defy app that i know of they've done a fantastic job putting out documentation and literature in many many languages to onboard people from asia from africa from all over the world and so it's like the most like diverse app by usage and they are getting these absolute schmidt uh suit out of them by somebody connected to elizabeth warren a previous elizabeth warren campaign person uh is doing this and so uh pull together this is this is the they're called arms like we defy is under attack they're not just going after pull together they're going after defy and they're using pool together to do it and so if you think that this isn't your problem it is your problem this is an attack on all of us all of us yeah so here's what they're doing they're uh it says keep pulley flying so they're minting all of these pooly birds these are nfts that uh you can purchase so there's a pulley supporter it's uh 0.1 eth all the way to a lawyer and a judge and those are more expensive and there's limited quality of each and all of the funds all of the proceeds go to the defense of pool together in this in this lawsuit and i think david this could become a shelling point for uh the rest of the d5 community because this is not this is like the first battle of a war that we have to fight the nation-state level and more specifically i mean we're fighting this war with kind of lobbyists and washington politicians and regulators this sort of thing we also have to fight it in the court system okay so this is how we uh defend our rights in the co in the court system and this is less about like no will this court case kill defy of course it can't kill defy it's not that that can't happen what this is about is making sure that americans people in the u.s people in whatever jurisdiction you live in do not get left behind because if our like our governments come together and they say regular citizens can't use a defy savings account like this or even worse maybe i don't can't open an ether dress i don't know where this leads in the court system then it's u.s citizens who will be left behind that's why this is so important i'm into the pulley i am a lawyer i also got a lawyer we are now lawyers we are lawyers you and i are lawyers and look david it's scary man do you ever think like even what you just said i mean you could be you could be sued bankless could be sued for what you just said i mean we've talked about where people together in the very early days no no before that oh just talking about pool together oh yeah we've we've uh posted articles about pulled together how to engage with a prize linked savings account so and i remember writing about pool together back in my pov crypto days uh all the way back in like 2019 or something and as a result of that people took their money and put it and pulled together some made money and no one has lost money and we might be sued for for like stating that that you can do this totally david i wouldn't be surprised if if we were at some point some frivolous lawsuits coming down so we look if the community's gonna rise up we've gotta we've gotta protect um people that are going bankrupt protect our d5 protocols fight this out in the court system so american citizens don't get left behind that's what this is about defy will be fine let's make sure america doesn't miss the boat here okay so what you got to do you got to go mint your pooly uh mint.pooltogether.com link in the show notes there are three different tiers that you can mint point one each for the little guy uh one eath for a lawyer and 75 eth for a judge if you want to be a real chad the the bold case for this the financial bold case for this is that with this in your wallet you are signaling that you are somebody who cares about defy and you are a good community member and so with this nft in your wallet you get to signal to the world that you care about dfi and that you are a good ethereum wallet to have this nft in it and so this is are you implying that this could uh have financial upside yeah this will add it to an air dropless a list of good people who care about defy uh and i remember just like and this is the story of airdrops right like things i did in like 2017 ultimately got me an airdrop in like 2022 22 and so you don't know when it's going to come but you want to be on the list you want to put your name on the list so that is the financial bold case for minting a pulley uh yeah yeah do it for the right reasons yeah and do it for the wrong reasons yeah whatever it's regen crypto like we can turn bad incentives into good ones uh this is a good thing to to fight for listen crypto beautiful uh what do we got next david uh optimism token okay so optimism cracking down on air drop farmers removing 17 000 addresses that have been verifiable to have been farming the crap out of the airdrop this is also this a very similar strategy from uh from hop protocol these two air drops which have come out in the last like month or so i've been calling the new meta for airdrops it is an arms race between farmers and uh and airdrop senders so we're trying to find all the farmers and nix them because they're not the community they're toxic they just farm and dump the token and so uh doing having this like strategy the optimism the optimism strategy was to create six different criteria that you can get the airdrop for uh and then if you have had multiples of those criteria you had a multiplier and so that's that was a community surgically discovering surgically discovering the community strategy uh and then hop protocol strategy was you could go and do like ether scan like narc on farmers uh and if you could find the hop protocol farmers you could report them and you could receive 25 of the tokens that they would have received wow mitigating token distribution that way so smart uh so this is the new meta for airdrops so ryan for the listeners out there who are like damn but i want to farm the airdrop what do they what do you think that they need to do like i think they should be a real human instead yeah and just use the protocol the way a real human would use it and stop trying to game the system and instead of trying to game the system and go for the short term rewards here just think about crypto as just a long-term multi-year multi-decade journey put your student cap on go learn how to use the protocol treat it like a homework assignment find every single corner about the protocol put real money in uh and then you will probably be getting an airdrop um to other things related to like size of money and time of money so those are all all concerns as well anyways that's your outfit for the week there's there's more alpha here which is which is uh yeah uh loyalty coins season that may be starting we've we've talked about loyalty coins in the past a little bit but maybe you could give the tl dr and what a loyalty coin is and we're seeing actually two examples of it in play this week one at coindesk the desk token and the other is revolut which is with revcoin revolu a major fintech platform as well so give us the tl dr what what is a loyalty coin and what's happening this week that uh you know people should pay attention to well people should be familiar with like loyalty points right and now it's just loyalty points but as tokens uh and so like airline there was a big like movement in 2017 to like during the ico mania to tokenize airline miles which i thought was hilarious actually wasn't the worst idea of the ico mania but there's this concept that is universal it's a primitive i'd say where if you put and engage your economic activity through a particular like host uh like your credit cards or your airlines they just give you back rewards they and it's basically like yield farming right like if you buy a flight you get some points and the points get you to buy more flights right it's like a form of yield farming this is a primitive you one of the great marketing strategies is to pay people to use your stuff uh and so coindesk has launched the desk token and is a part of the experience of consensus 2022 for the people who are going to consensus 2022. uh you can earn desks throughout the festival by engaging in consensus stuff so you can and you can also redeem it for swag food drinks nfts and more it's basically like the internal currency of consensus and overall the coindesk ecosystem this is nothing new uh but you get there's now like a verifiable place where you can spend all your points for swag and food and stuff so it counts as money i guess and and this again this is not the coin desk which very large company it's a big deal that they're doing this uh revolut even bigger company even bigger deal though they're also doing this so they're doing rev coin yeah and revcoin is kind of what you were just saying david is uh this from the article revcoin will function in a similar way to airline air miles programs where users earn rewards based on how often they use the service it definitely won't be a stable coin says the the founder the goal is to make loyalty tradable i love how he says it definitely won't be a stable coin right after the collapse of terror no no we're not that guy but it's also it's also like hey price can go up by the way that's that's that's the other between the lines well that's the thing that's what he said the goal is to make loyalty tradable so the problem with airline miles and hotel points and i don't know if david if like in my younger years i used to try to like open a bunch of cards and like game the system and you know get them get that maximize my my uh program for this credit card yeah yeah it's credit card farming yeah yeah exactly man uh similar thing i do today uh anyway it was way less way less profitable then and part of the reason why is because you couldn't transfer the tokens or trade them like what is the value of an airline miles i mean whatever american airlines says it is they're highly inflationary they're kind of highly inflationary they're terrible and so the ability to actually have a market price and allow these things to escape in the open finance economy and the defy economy that's what's special here that's cool i think we'll see all sorts of look there's no real regulatory pain points here in the way there is with like securities and that sort of thing right loyalty coin is is sort of a different thing we have some precedent for that in the in the real world so i think that's all a good thing and if you listen to that vr you have a summary yeah and if you listen to that and you're like oh i'm bullish here's the bear case uh there's this one of my favorite episodes of uh always sunny in philadelphia where they mint paddy bucks patty is the name of their pub and they give out paddy bucks to incentivize people to come into their bar uh and then people come into their bar and they buy beer with the paddy bucks and then at the end of the day they're like okay now we don't have any any beer because we sold it all and all we have is patty bucks and so basically so this they're like okay well what do we do like oh well we go give the paddy bucks back out so they can come and drink our beer and they're like wait when do we get the money though where's the dollars come in and then they'll never quite figure that out it's like as yeah yeah but d5 figures that out because they could just uh swap the patty bucks on you to swap right there's gonna be a market for that so you have your paddy bucks the other day well no but then that's that's what that's what we're talking about you get a coin lets them like take their death token to unisoft and sell it for heath i don't know how it works david it's an experiment okay experiment and we are not a stable coin definitely it's not a stable coin open c just launched something big too this is uh open c marketplace called seaport and i'm not sure it's one marketplace but it's a set of marketplaces can you try to explain this i know the details are scant right now but do the best you can details are asking about like what this whole like spin up a marketplace thing means the details that i do know that it is verifiable is that it is opening up uh more ways to express a sale uh so right now you go to openc you're like i like those properties uh i will buy it with my eth uh a seller now with with uh with uh seaports can take their uh one of their nfts like a i don't know a a hoodie uh crypto punk for example and then they put up the hoodie crypto punk they're like i want i want a uh 3d glasses crypto punk and so i will sell my hoodie punk for a 3d glasses punk uh and that trade can be executed by somebody who owns a 3d glasses punk uh and so you can just like skip the money apparently the theme here is we're skipping that we're we're going back to the barter system i thought i thought we were speed running finance now it sounds like we're going the wrong way we're going in all directions right now it seems to be like the theme of the show is the part where we skip the money um but yeah so like you can i mean think about it inside of a video game right where like you have like your axe and you like want to trade it for some guy's sword or something or just like you have one it would make more sense three axes for one sword yeah stuff like that yeah and so it's just like more expressing more abilities to trade stuff so useful tool that's cool uh not what's not cool yeah here's what's not cool seth green yeah he has a tv show uh and he is because he owns well tbd on that one uh because he owns a a board ape he can use the property the ip of that to make a tv show so he's made a tv show uh he's invested money into this uh but he sadly lost his ape as many apes do to a phishing attack uh so he no longer has the commercial rights to the nfc and therefore cannot run the show wait is that for real that is for real ryan he no longer has ownership over the ip because he lost his ape to a phishing attack his entire show got it hacked yes the entire show the entire show so this is like really bullish for cco i'd say uh like creative commons open which are things like noun style is this um mfers are this there's a bunch of cco type nfts where like anyone can use anything uh and so like if you but imagine like imagine if you have like a star wars level franchise around your nft that has embedded ip and it gets hacked right and so like you have to have that thing in the deepest cold storage of all time in case somebody steals the ip wow isn't self custody fun yeah right right so bullish cco i think it's the tldr sorry screen you lost your your ape look i also think like bullish uh smart contract wallets social recovery better security like people are learning the hard way this cycle and it's funny it's not just like the crypto ogs losing their bitcoin it's like people who are in the nft space and just didn't take the time to go all the way back down the rabbit hole to figure out how to secure their stuff before they're diving into this on a separate note uh would you watch an nft tv show ryan only if my nfts were in it i mean to be honest i don't know it would have to be it has to be good content i can't like i guess it's all the content i don't want to watch it yeah with somebody else's bag because i don't want to show if somebody else is yeah apes unless i'm part of the ape community right so there'll be at least 10 000 watchers of that show i don't think that's a very high number for a tv show i think you need more i think it has to be good content we'll see i'll suspend judgment until we see it uh david just some quick things you know cami russo meant the pope she met the pope and she gave him her book uh so the the pope now owns an ethereum book uh bullish i guess i think so well a couple weeks ago when we say the vatican was doing nfts i forgot about that nice job cammy yeah oh yeah we got crypto missionaries going out and recruiting popes to our religion wow all right that's a deep cut i don't know how many people you offended with that but we'll keep going um sbf sam bankman freed just says he could spend as much as one billion dollars in the 2024 election one billion dollars yeah so spf his brand is all about uh uh philanthropy right like i'm going to give back all of my net worth i'm going to give back give it all away i'm just going to make a bunch of money just to give it away has he spent has he given away a billion dollars yet i don't know i don't know how much he's got i've been tracking that but this is not philanthropy this is not philanthropy this is political clout yes this is like lobbying help i will steal the steer the ship with a billion dollars um so there's a there's a how do you feel about this i mean it's probably good for the industry uh it's definitely good for the industry it also is really good just to say like yo politicians there's this people giving out billions of dollars to other politicians uh and so we know the world of politics responds to money it's probably good it's probably good um yes uh it's not awesome that this is how it works though that this is how it doesn't make me feel good right it's like when we talk about kind of lobbying like i imagine it much more of a grassroots thing where it's like you know a hundred thousands of people hundreds of thousands of people millions of people who are donating small amounts in order to fund some sort of political action movement it coming this way is a little bit different i guess as long as what sbf is doing is protecting like the values of decentralization and like hardcore crypto values right and like defending against those and supporting politicians who put those in place and not trying to prop up this neo crypto banking sector and i am still aligned with his mission here yes but i don't necessarily trust that that's going to be the eventual outcome and i don't think we should trust it i think we should be eyes wide open when we start to use these sort of nation state tools yes that you tapped on to what i what i was feeling that i couldn't verbalize is that it doesn't make me feel good that a crypto neo banker is paying one billion dollars to uh joe biden uh that does not make me feel good not necessarily just joe biden right i bet oh is it really i think so wow okay wow uh he's also saying he could spend one billion dollars so he actually hasn't spent this yet okay well he could spend 10 billion he could spend i could spend 10 billion all right well somehow it feels more credible [Laughter] uh but speaking of all of the opportunity and billions of dollars in the crypto space should we talk about jobs in crypto this is our weekly opportunity to tell you to go get a job in crypto i'm gonna pull this up david but um this is the bankless jobs board okay this is where we list all of the jobs uh and i'm gonna read them out for you because you know what you have to do you have to check this out get out on the list submit your resume to the talent collective as well number one solidity developer from unlocked senior product designer smart d5 business development lead goldfinch marketing manager wanderverse vp of engineering zkx head of growth zkx developer evangelist argent customer successfully tally i could go on but they're all available for you get on the jobs board list subscribe sign up and you can be part of getting this notice uh in the future david um jobs are heart and crypto you know what i feel like we did this time a lot better is we actually prepared for winter time we put we put some of those uh chestnuts away you know we scrolled them all away and there are a lot of companies that are still hiring well positioned for this bear market i don't think we'll see a major decrease in hiring at all i i think i said this last week and i might have said it with the week before but this bear market is going to be the most unlike other any other bear market i tweeted out today uh this bull market or bear market is going to be the greatest bull market of all time and then i had to add an asterisk to that meaning like meaning how much fun we're about to have not not like we're all about to get wrecked not price related although that might also happen um but the idea that like we have so much this industry is flush with cash it's not going to the assets sadly but it's going to building it's a build market so this is unlike 2018 where everyone literally almost like everything almost went to zero we almost lost basically all of our funding when ether was eighty dollars we couldn't pay people to develop ethereum uh and so that was bad like we almost ground to a halt that is not what's happening right now the the the alternative it's the complete inverse we have every single company is flush with cash everyone's hiring uh bankless is hiring we're hiring like crazy it's kind of scary uh and like every single company has the money to spend to pay a lot of people uh and so everyone is going to make so much wealth in this bear market ryan because like that's where that's where wealth is created and so so many things are going to get built so many salaries about to get paid so many people are going to get a job because like hiring is probably at all time highs right now i'd say uh it's it's insane like it's so fun and i'm having a great time i think i think there's going to be some belt tightening uh but i just i mean we'll get into it when we get into the races i mean massive raises this week announced as well but before we do david uh tracer has just released something cool you want to tell us about this yeah okay so i'm going to run through the five things out of tracer dao's perpetuals v2 uh disclaimer ryan and i are advisors for tracer dow so uh we're close with the team uh we have tokens uh and we also know what's up going on behind the scenes and that's why we have uh the information to talk about it but it's also here in this tweet as well uh tracer dial perpetual pools it's like leverage long short positions kind of like dydx but in tokenize into a a token uh it's on balancer on arbitrom right now so you can go like three x long bitcoin 3x short bitcoin et cetera et cetera the idea is that you can plug in any sort of price feed into tracer dao and you can produce a perpetual pool on that thing so like you know any other crypto asset but you also do like housing markets or like oil or water or whatever uh anyways going from v1 to v2 first thing no minimums there's no more minimums on getting into a position you can enter or exit at any size love it uh more second feature number two more stable value transfers uh so in v1 when bitcoin would go up by five percent in single hour the actual value transfer in a 3x market was 13.6 percent not 15 uh this makes the whole thing more efficient and better this which leads into feature number three which is long-term tokens that thing is called volatility decay previously tokens would eventually go to zero over time but that has largely been fixed these tokens are now suited for long-term holding perfectly times around for a 3x position to go into the merge if you dare if you dare take that leverage position uh mint fee there's also a mint feed to get into it so this also helps prevent volatility decay and increase holding of these tokens so if you mint the thing there's a small fee towards the holders not towards the protocol towards the holders and so the holders get the fee uh currently there are two markets available 3x btc long short 3x eth long short there's also a quiz this is what is also super cool about this they're teaching you how to use the protocol there's a quiz to that changes every single week uh and you can pass the quiz to get a co-op same deal with the whole like pull together nft thing holding these these po apps that prove you did something in a part of community are useful things to do uh so there is my shill of the week it's a really cool product i'm really bullish on it uh there's a link in the show notes cool uh this is uh also pretty neat since finance they just released a few products and what's cool about this is you know we've compared david sort of ether being bonded to like the uh the yield curve like treasuries for instance you know in the traditional markets they're uh there's this yield curve right so you get to look at t bills and you get to look at the on the one year and like the you know the 10 year and even the 20 and 30 year or the one month right this is called the yield curve or the uh risk-free rate if you will the risk-free rate of money when you when you hear terms like this well this is what sense is coming up with they're coming up with a risk-free rate for eath and they're coming out with a an eath yield curve so what's cool is they're creating a a two month to six month a one year and a five year um yield curve for ether the asset so that means like um ether as a bond you know there's a market for a maturity of that bond in two months there's a maturity in six months maturity in one year and five years and so through this they can create a yield curve we can actually see what the risk-free rate for ether is in the ethereum economy so this is kind of wonka's stuff to geek out to you but i think the the risk-free rate for ether within the ethereum economy is going to represent sort of the cost of capital right because like it's going to be like a really important number it's the new interest rate because like why would you invest in any token in any d5 project really in anything in the ethereum economy unless you could actually exceed the um the opportunity cost of staking something in ether for two months or one year or five years for instance so i'm just psyched and like kind of geeking out that we're starting to construct these these yield curves in uh in crypto like i have like so much to say about this and i'm like oh this is the weekly roll up i can't ram but i'm going to uh so there's two things it's not called the internet bond for nothing uh this is the financialization of ether the asset in its proof of stake form this is the internet bond market this is the new like ryan's the cost of capital is what the fed does when it controls money the price of money and right now the fed's like okay we need to make the cost of capital go up the cool thing about the ethereum interest rate is it's dynamic it's set by the market and so in yields go up when less people stake because then ethereum is asking more for more security so it's incentivizing you more yields go down when a lot of people stake but also what's uh not very often discussed ryan is that when the economy is hot when there's a hot economy which is generally associated with high inflation rates uh and low cost of capital when the economy heats up what happens to gas prices they go up what happens to the staking fees when gas prices are hot they go up increasing the stake rate increasing the cost of capital naturally putting a dampening effect on the heat of the ethereum economy exactly how crazy is that and so it's like no we just we just got rid of 12 jobs the board members of the federal reserve like we got it guys like we are better we need we need to honestly do an entire episode around this like once the yield curve kind of matures like you can even see here this is super fascinating so a eath bond with a six-month maturity is about 7.1 right so it's high higher uh with a one month maturity it's four okay and it goes so one month it's down at four six month maturity it's seven so you know picture kind of the slope of the line here one year it drops down to 6.69 and then five years it's 5.6 interesting slope here uh from it from a time perspective and it does chart the cost of capital and if you want to speculate on like i think the ethereum economy is going to grow hotter or i think it's going to grow colder you can you can express that and so if you think interest rates are going to go up you can speculate that or not interest rates yield rates yield rates are going to go up because the future of ethereum is going to be a hotter economy this allows you to express that uh super cool the financialization of eth is like in like day one of like 365 days like there's so much left to do it's a build market yeah well do you remember when we uh when when staking came aboard we hey this is the the world's first internet bond that's what we're really launching here now we're starting to see this emerge uh david let's go through some raises real quick all right so uh a16c biggest crypto fund ever where like what what bear market is kind of what they're saying here 4.5 billion dollars and this is their fourth crypto fund uh we actually had mark andreessen chris dixon on the podcast we're releasing the full episode monday if you're a premium subscriber you can go access that now on the bankless premium feed fantastic hot episode and david what did chris say he's going to spend all this on the 4.5 billion dollars do you recall exactly oh a bunch of companies a bunch of startups building really cool stuff in the crypto space is that the right answer i think that's the thing that's right it's crypt it's crypto stuff like protocols these stable coins a whole bunch of in jobs like this is why crypto is hiring uh also um there's so if yeah if you're worried about job security in the bear market just take note that there is 4.5 billion dollars coming into this industry that's very true they also backed flow carbon which this is adam newman do you know adam newman from the the wework guy do you know much about that i know i know the story yeah i watched that all right well why don't you tell the story then i didn't watch the documentary or anything i don't know much about this okay so adam newman he is basically like a theranos type thing where he just like turns fairness yes thank you it turned in he turned like we work into like this cult trade where like so many people kept on pouring money into this thing he's a really good salesman he had this like crazy vision and he was basically adding just like this visionary element on top of what was essentially just like cube of renting cubicle space he was like we're going to change consciousness we're going to change society we have such ambitious projects and then at the end of the day when the fundamentals came because they timed it they wanted to go public the public took a look at their documents and be like these fundamentals are like the worst fundamentals of all time like what the hell is going on here and then they stopped having to go private it's a big scandal anyways adam newman is now backing a flow carbon a 70 million dollar raise for flow carbon uh he's not part of the team so like the the the controversial nature of adam newman is not relevant to what flow carbon is building but it's just like an interesting story uh also this is a startup he's co-founded it uh david so he's definitely oh just kidding oopsies no no he's the co-founder of the thing this is like his so it's backed by a16z and a whole bunch of others uh general catalyst samsung next whole bunch of others but this is his like i'm going to be a ceo again and a co-founder okay but why don't we say like why don't we suspend doubt on who this individual is for a minute low carbon this is like a tokenized uh carbon sort of platform right so this is sort of a public goods refi type angle oh that's cool oh i like that yeah oh well maybe maybe this is adam newman's like great rebrands like all right he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna make him make a comeback maybe we'll have to see i i do think it's it's kind of cool i guess like what could go wrong even if it is a big ponzi scheme we you know we clean up the clean out the world a little bit there are worse ponzi's out there a ponzi scheme that that makes people money doesn't collapse and also cleans up the world is what kevin milwaukee would call a good thing oh it's that it's that middle part that's hard it doesn't collapse that's the part that's the hard part we got to learn more about it to be fair but that is the news that it was it was uh adam newman this week and a 16c founded uh starkware they just announced a series d at an 8 billion dollar valuation what bear market right what bear market eight billion dollars dude that's insane only a bear market in the bags that we hold that's what's going on it's just it's just it hits it hits public markets faster than privates these private valuations will take a few months to catch up i think this is true but uh standard crypto this is another crypto fund they just raised casual 500 billion dollars as well so the private equity keeps uh keeps chugging man it's only public markets that are suffering won't one public fund care about the crypto prices just can you just buy the crypto so they stopped going down at some point some of them should i don't know if that's in their charter but uh you know it's a little lopsided right now uh david we got some hot stuff coming up next though including our new segment questions from the nation love it all right so some questions from bankless listeners to us we're gonna read those out and try our best to answer them what else we got uh we also got some bullish takes from vance spencer which will i think also summarize the whole entire vibe of this very giggly uh weekly rollup i'd say this week ryan it's just you yeah that's just me i'm stone faced uh we also got dan elliser mike demaris from rainbow and hayden adams all discussing uniswap chain uh just just a theory just a theory uh so those takes are coming up next but before you do if you haven't liked and subscribed from the first time we told you in this

reminder if you want to get in the next roll up you gotta ask your question on twitter i think we got 65 of them this time around david but uh this is the one we picked it's got a lot of likes now i'll read you the question maybe you can give your shot at answering first why is there this is from data underscore always on twitter why is there so much incomplete and misinformation in the space and around the merge what's up with that misinformation about the ethereum merge why yeah this has always been perplexing to me so i understand why this question where this question is coming from and why it's getting so many likes ethereum is perplexingly misunderstood not just about the merge but like persistently all of the time uh and to why that has happened is is a big mystery the the only thing that i really have to say about that is my two answers that seem reasonable to me is that there is like the ef being like the one thing that started ethereum doesn't really do comms or communications or anything and so as there's still like official there is no ministry of promise of ethereum right and so like the ethereum has like the ethereum team but the ethereum team is like modular and like distributed and of itself because every single client team represents one component of ethereum there is no center of ethereum to have these comms coming from and so instead though that responsibility falls on the on the shoulders of like media people uh people like uh tim baker who leads core devs call and then we report it here on bank list anthony cesano does a fantastic job uh the re finance community is fantastically well informed if you're trying to get high signal communities but other than that like if you don't listen to the like those sources like that's about it yeah do you know how like the white house has a press secretary there is no press secretary for ethereum whatsoever not at all and then like the other way that i will also explain this is this is just for the crypto industry at large i've talked about this in other capacities i i view the crypto world as like uh concentric circles where at the very center you have the core beating heart of what makes crypto tick permissionlessness decentralization uh blockchain networks that imbue all the properties of crypto and then you have you know bitcoin and ethereum and that's really at the core center and then you have like all the people that surround them those core values like i would put us there ryan like again anthony cesano people that really care about these values and then there was like one more concentric circle out that are like okay there's something here there's something really valuable here let me add my flavor to it and make a lot of money from it and those are like i would call that the the tara luna ecosystem which is like yeah crypto algo stable coins it's kind of a ponzi at the end of the day but like it's not true about decentralization it's not really about the core ethos of of crypto and those people surround like the inner circle and those people make a bunch of noise because they want to suck up attention and put their attention on their thing because they're here to make a bunch of money uh and so like there's this like like crust of like grifters around like the core beating heart of crypto that is like taking the value out of crypto and like redirecting people away from the center to go to like the grifter side of the crypto community and then they like you know get they just make a lot of money over there uh and that's my explanation yeah i think that's a good explanation i think high level that's that's probably what i would say to you you know the only thing i'd add is like it probably depends on what specific piece of incomplete or misinformation you're talking about and you could probably take that piece of information and put it in one of the camps like one of the categories so for instance one thing that's often said is like the merch will reduce gas fees like right no it won't technically ten percent actually it's a ten percent scale that's not what people maybe that's where it comes from i just did it so right and they'll be like well and so you know where does that come from it's probably it's just some wish wishful thinking some people just not understanding there being no official communications probably that right yeah it might also be like post-merge we get people think it's ethereum 2.0 and previously ethereum 2.0 used to have sharding and that would have reduced gas feed so there's cut miscommunication there exactly exactly and then like the incomplete thing why can't we just get a date on the merge why not and i think that's that's nothing malicious it's not like a community like flooding that's that's just like it's we're coming to consensus what the date actually is and we don't know and there's no spokesperson for ethereum but then you get something else like uh the merch will never happen right right or like uh you know will always remain proof of stake and like some of these things are proof of work some of these things are more malicious right it's like just completely uninformed and verging on like ethereum will never ship uh nothing ever happens um you know vitalic man's all the like the uh the masternodes this sort of thing and so it's this confluence of reasons and you almost have to go through the specific piece of misinformation and throw it in one of these buckets but um some total i think you're i think you're right yeah and this is why i call the crypto world like navigating the crypto world is navigating the dark forest right like you can't trust every bit of information that comes to you you need to learn how to do your own research and verify for yourself which is a fantastic skill to have there is no like nine year schooling for crypto you got to figure it out and that's why like crypto the crypto culture is so strong ryan because like that's what separates us from society like the crypto the crypto twitter the cryptoculture crypto communities that all like we can speak crypto we know the words we know the terminology we've made it through the other side of the dark forest right and so we have that shared story of like yes we all went through the gamut we all went through the dark force we figured out how to reason about it we know we know what's right and what's wrong and communities that agree with what's right like gang up together uh and and and so that's also why we're so different from society right like we have this big handshake with each other like we all made it through the dark forest of learning how to navigate crypto i think that's true i will say though that's just for me that's just for crypto right so like like another example is i i start to like doubt all of the other news sources that i get because i'm like not experts in all of these various other things i see the headline like oh okay i guess this is what's happening right but um like it's my dad was asking me i'd spend some time with him uh last week in florida he's like okay so the coinbase wasn't going bankrupt what was that thing i saw it on all my news chat and i'm like no dad like like they're they're not going bankrupt like we pay close attention these are all the reasons why this is why it was misreported and it just calls into question all of the other headlines that i'm not an expert in with all of these various eras whether it's you know science or technology it's like what kind of stuff are we actually being fed like the one thing i'm knowledgeable knowledgeable about and we could see how it's completely farcical nonsensical misinformation like how many other things do i just take at surface like it's man information is is a very difficult thing uh and good good information is a very difficult thing to like parse through and figure out in this day and age yeah and i really actually love this discussion uh the crypto gives you an insane vantage point to view the whole rest of the world like we understand global relations we under because of just how our blockchains span all borders we understand economics because our blocks are our prices respond to global economic forces we have to understand that but also we have internal economics into the blockchain network we got to understand computer science you have to understand like sociology and like tribalism and once you make it through the dark forest i feel like post learning about crypto and getting to the other side and being informed about crypto i feel like i know at least a little bit of almost anything about the world oh dude this is 21st century life skills yes 100 guarantees yeah this is university this is like way better than i mean don't drop out of school kids like get your degree but like also no i totally do it totally do it totally get a job in crypto that was only the first question the second question the second question what are three things slash ideas that ryan and david strongly disagree or clash on um three things is a lot uh there was one time where ryan and i got into a debate about how gas fees are come to be like how does the value of the gas fee come to be like where does that um like not not how it's calculated but just like what is the price of a gas fee and does it depend on what was that debate actually it was like yeah it was it was a debate so uh i think you were saying you were saying basically that eth price and gas fees are kind of one in the same market very very close and i was saying they're not the same market they're separate markets they're correlated at some stages but they are completely separate right like block space demand yes it was a really geeky conversation and kind of a debate i feel like we realized at the end of that thing that we should have been recording it because a lot of people have this question right and like i'm almost tempted to rehash it i've pumped at the conclusion david that i'm still right about that i was saying that the eat when eat price goes up 10 times gas prices will also go up 10 times like if you if you hold gas the same like 10 way at 100 versus ten gwya at a thousand dollars gas feeds goes up by roughly a factor of 10x yes these markets are correlated ones float off of each other but like when everyone who's holding eth is the person paying the gas fee like i would love to hear like uh somebody make a tweet thread about this to answer this question in more depth actually if someone if you guys would like to hear dave and i debate this if david still feels very strongly about that maybe we'll record a one-off podcast the funny thing is it's like it's such it's of all things to debate about someone that just like does not matter is there anything i i'm trying to think of anything else like major um we have different stylistic choices on the podcast yeah so there's that but like that also like works out where like it's a yang yeah it's a tug of war yeah you know i use like gas and breaks right like breaks sometimes you're more gas and you're like we should buy with everything at this moment and i'm just like well are you sure are you sure about that and the beauty is sometimes you're right and sometimes i'm right and like on balance we're more often more correct yeah and either way we have fun along the way but i wouldn't say that strongly disagree on i think it's the gas thing that we only really strongly disagree on the lost podcast will probably never happen uh david let's get to some takes man so uh this is a really hot take i like this could you read it out for us yeah you labs is valued at a higher valuation than what disney paid for for the entire star wars ip uh that's a lot of growth uh embedded into the board ape ecosystem when you put it that way it's does that mean that anyone who is like holding an ape and holding apecoin and uh all of that stuff are is like saying that at some point in time the board apes ip will become equivalent to star wars i think that's what you mean i don't know i just feel like asking that's extreme i like look i'm bullish on eath but i am not bullish as much as the bourdain ecosystem is on the border ecosystem yeah i i agree with that we'll see what happens look the the test of an ecosystem or any communities can you survive a bear market so this is where this is the fiery crucible right so it's happening now um this is a great take from eric connor i'm glad he's back on twitter uh i'll read this out and maybe comment so much negativity towards d5 lately god i've noticed that too many people are questioning what benefits it actually offers annoyed to see it honestly permissionless access to financial tools for anyone in the world is powerful enough to have extreme meaning and staying power i think the take here is that the overton window is shifting as in like yeah people have gotten used to permissionlessness and and d5 financial tools and now we're like we want more give us more things and now and that's just the new norm and so like the people who are like having negativity towards d5 like oh it's just like borrowing and landing in ave oh it's just like trading on uniswap like reminder those are big deals we didn't have that three years ago guys like this is amazing i i i think it's one of those cases where um narrative follows price and so like d5 prices are in the dump so everyone's like ah d5 was never cool it was never a thing who cares it's not world changing at all no no this tech like decentral bankless money a bankless financial system this is like the biggest innovation since the original internet like this is absolutely massive it's gonna change how human beings coordinate across the world for like generations to come this is an absolutely huge deal and so it's another example of remember the people we said earlier were saying like yeah unit swap will never work smart contracts will never be a thing d5 will never be a thing okay no you hit it hit it that's actually not the one i was going for well that's the one i feel like like that's how it falls for me when i when i hear them say this and it's just like man narratives are so so overplayed and so boring um yeah i'm i'm glad we're i'm glad we're back on the contrarian side of things though david it feels good it feels like home yeah that is where i feel very comfy it's bear market contrarian vibes all right okay dan elliser says uh dan elser is the guy that wrote um uh like this thing that kind of like called the d5 bull market before it happened with super phonic um superfluous no super fluid collateral which is relevant but also hydrophonic yield farming he basically called yield farming before it happened and then he also called superfluid collateral before it happened so like when dan elser says something i listen that guy is like he only gets loud on things he has high conviction on uh and uh and that's always he's always been right this is actually completely irrelevant from this but uh he didn't make a an article he didn't write an article this time around but he made a tweet which i thought was really interesting and he goes uni chain is inevitable there are three costs to dex traders the swap fees that's like the 0.3 percent that you pay to the unit swap liquidity providers there's also the transaction fee and gas and you also pay mev so if you get like sandwiched or if you uh get front run by by validators who are doing mev then you pay them a fee as well basically uh and so today uni uh dan elser continues saying today uni holders can only flip the switch to take part in number one so only one of the three revenue sources and also probably the smallest one and he finishes with two and three at being transaction fees and mev payments are more attractive long term and better align the chain and so this is why he says uni chain is inevitable because if uniswap puts unit swap on a uni chain it gets access to one two and three and so uni token can be like the the currency of unit swap would this be like a layer two or something like this this would be like a layer two yeah an application specific layer two it would think of like i don't know if you see a uniswap went on to a application specific zk roll up it would be like the uh the apis of layer two liquidity for unit swap right and so you could like ping right go right into it uh and that and then unit swap would get the trading fees and then the mev on all that ecosystem it's basically like the uniswap universe on layer two uh and i bet you actually that now that i'm thinking about this unit swap does produce like the first meaningful zk application specific zk roll up that is engaged with other roll ups on layer two uh mike banderas from from uh rainbow wallet goes wouldn't would that mean either accepting death or of composability or that uni chain will become competitive and hostile to ethereum and hayden says that sort of assumes that cross-chain composability won't ever exist uh is that a tweet from hayden adams ryan because it's a tweet or is it because he knows what he's talking about and this is a something that they are actively discussing inside of uniswap tbd i don't know i don't i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised it does seem like that would be a huge barrier to basically like um i guess you're not entirely leaving the ethereum economy but you're you're leaving all of uh and i don't know that this would mean leaving i guess you could launch a chain that's kind of a layer too in addition to everything that you're doing on ethereum main chain and other layer twos well the this thing about you you know swap like going into and being coming its own chain fits in the roll-up-centric road map of ethereum model where like applications can become chains uh that is like a new thought that actually i'm just having right now in this roll-up i guess so it just here's where it kind of breaks my mental model right it's sort of like um like like a company gets big enough like a facebook gets big enough and then they're like well we should just become our own nation right right and like we'll create our own money and then like that'll give us maximum like maximal control and all of these things and what they what they sort of forget is like okay but people don't want to live in the facebook nation because they don't have good representation because it's owned by like uh you know stakeholders and that sort of thing it kind of breaks breaks my brain a little bit i guess this is like uniswap saying this would be like them saying hey we want to be a a state in the union of the like that's actually not how i see it and that's not how i see it okay so i see it as uh optimistic roll-ups becoming that optimistic as like uh generalized roll-ups optimistic roll-ups are like flat land there's a lot of real estate there they have their own internal gas fee markets uh they have their space to build your thing because it's generalized with an application specific zk roll up it doesn't operate like land like i don't i think you wouldn't leave your assets there it's more like i don't know like a where's the optimistic rollers roll ups are like wide and flat and they have like real estate for you to settle on uh application specific zk roll ups are very like long and tall and they're something that you ping and then you send something back what do you mean application specific zk you're just talking about like dydx or something like that yes like one single zk rollup that does one thing and in the uni chain world is unit swap so is the unit swap as a z well i guess we're kind of repeating this this uh conversation that they just had because then i want to be like but wouldn't that mean they lose composability from all the other apps but not not from layer twos yeah and then hayden and then hayden goes well that assumes cross chain composability won't exist right roll up centric road map of ethereum possible we just we just speed [Laughter] these guys already thought about that i guess that's why they're the defy so why it's a take in the roll-up let's do this one man this is pretty cool this is a graphic that i really liked yeah 13 years the tweet says 13 years of w3b what does that mean i don't know what that means uh web three web3 yes web3 web3 and nft converted into a 24 hour clock uh so so for the listeners we're just looking at a clock where 12 o'clock is the birth of bitcoin and then like right to the left of it as in where we currently are like 11 59 is like the launch of coinbase nft platform and it kind of just like takes you through the history and lets you put things into a relationship with each other in time uh so that's pretty cool i like that yeah so like so like so like midnight is the birth of bitcoin all right and the very first non-fungible token that we ever got was bitcoin.bit okay this is even pre-ethereum and that happened at 4 00 a.m in the morning that day all right and the very first erc 721 that we got didn't happen until 16 o'clock what is that that's uh 2 16 o'clock it's 16 o'clock how do i read military time 1600 hours it's 4 p.m 4 p.m that was the first erc 721 all right so like 4 p.m that's like and now uh basically six minutes from midnight that's sort of where when coinbase just launched their nft platform it's kind of a cool depiction of the eras and how early things were before and still how early things are now they kind of they don't have any l ones where like why don't they have the genesis of ethereum where is that that is that's gotta be like somewhere in like nine a.m yeah we should make our own bangla style 500 in bank to anyone who makes this and updates that i'll commit to that uh somebody in the bank of stout do that and then ping me when you guys and i'll send you some bank token amazing all right david what are you bullish on man besides this clock here uh i'm i'm bullish on this uh new podcast uh not from bankless actually it's called alfalfa and it's for my friends that i've made in san diego uh and so they have been grinding away at their alfalfa podcast and i've been listening to it it's been getting better and better the takes are being coming hotter and hotter they're into like 20 something late 20 episodes and so uh i said uh yo guys come over and we'll record a podcast in my apartment uh and i finally got to use my soundboard thing that i really really like uh and so we recorded an alfalfa bankless podcast which is going to come onto the youtube sometime soon uh and it's a it's a all in style podcast uh and so uh they are very very much bankless listeners but they're also bankless skeptics at the same time uh they play in things that like ryan and i generally don't uh they're a little bit more detailed how'd they do with lena luna david uh they all escaped luna uh oh except for one all except for one uh one one guy got caught up caught up in luna um but uh but he's not a complete d-gen so like it was only a small portion of his backs uh but also they also talk about things like real estate markets and also like kind of how like the all-in podcast does uh also like politics and so they get it this is starting to sound like another bankless podcast launch is that what this is going to turn into here well that is potentially a potential future so if you are a consumer of crypto content which you are you might like this podcast but you should start with the one that we put on the bankless youtube uh in about a week or so tbd on that just stay tuned i'm really excited about it i'm really bullish on it awesome awesome uh ryan what are you bullish on so actually yeah we uh we we forgot i'm gonna steal vance spencer's take as the thing i'm bullish on and add my own thing because we've got to cover this in the take section uh this is a tweet from vance spencer and i think it echoes my sentiments uh as well he's coming on the show by the way so maybe we'll talk about this he says this crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now very much not dead very much alive washing out the excesses very much building things people want to use coiled spring on a path to hyper growth i think that's why if you're a unicycler and you've heard david and i in the last few rollups we've been like very clearly in a bee market right bear market build market whatever how we're so excited we're so excited right now because like the last bee market that we were in it felt like things could actually fall apart like it felt like d5 might not actually ever work ethereum the project might not ever scale we would never find product market fit and the whole bitcoin experiment was maybe or the whole ethereum the whole crypto experiment was maybe bitcoin if we're lucky and that would take years to recover all right this is a very different feeling entering this bear market and i couldn't say it better than vance spencer just says it right here coiled spring on a path to hyper growth we are washing out the excesses we are building things people want to use the hardest part of the whole thing the whole thing in a new product in anything the birth of the internet like birth of google for any of these transformational uber is product market fit once you have product market fit there's gonna be cycles now it's just a matter of scaling we have product market fit now we're just scaling so i've never entered a bear market with more confidence and uh you know what that leads me to is the thing i'm i am bullish on is i feel like this is the last time this is gonna happen all right ether in the 1000 range right ether look i'm gonna say it dave i know dave disagrees on this ether could dip into triple digit territory once again we could go below thousand i'm not saying it will i'm not saying that'll happen okay i'm saying if it does happen back the truck up right all right not financial advice all right some other kind of advice for you maybe life advice for you i don't know i'm just saying this is the last opportunity that we'll ever have it's this bear market and i'm thankful honestly i'm thankful that a whole bunch of listeners who got in the first cycle of the last two years a whole bunch of people got into crypto now they can they can prove their metal and they'll have an opportunity that previous generations have had right it feels more fair that way i'm glad we didn't just zoom all the way up to 10k and then pass that and like see you later everybody else you have another opportunity here and this means be responsible dollar cost average in that's what you want like buy good assets but think of this as the last great generational opportunity buying opportunity because that's what it that's what it is and this is why i've been saying this is the greatest bear market of all time so much is going to get built people are going to get jobs in crypto people going to get paid uh and people are going to buy cheap eath in ways that they never had that availability before uh i remember after my first bear market and or going into my first bear mark in 2018 i was like oh okay this is that was a cycle where it's not the future uh i'm rex now uh and i and and so i had like i'm not gonna put out numbers but i had an amount of eth that i had and i was like by the time the next bull market comes around i'm gonna have 10 times the amount and that was like a lot of money for me at the time uh and i made uh that was actually uh cutting it short i made more than 10 times the target that i had going through the bear market and so think think bigger dreams going into the the bear market think about what you want to get done uh and and just grind for that and work hard because when you grind in the in the bear market you turn into flowers you grow flowers in the bull market uh and so uh this is why we're so excited like this is such an awesome time to be in the crypto space when so much gets built and there's such little noise one of the reasons why bull markets always end is because it becomes a meme right it turns into a self-reflexive loop as in like oh there's these things that people are just throwing money into and they're doing that because other people are throwing money into them therefore i will produce this thing that they will throw money into and the more that that like self reflects on itself and like turns into a like a loop over and over again like how can i make the thing that people put the most money in the fastest that is literally the opposite of long-term time horizons and so now that that is fully dead uh we have products that are going to be built for things that people's like oh maybe in five i'm gonna build a thing that people are gonna put money into hold it there for five to ten years and keep it there and that is called ryan fundamentals and that is why this is a build market absolutely david and i are bullish on the bear market that's uh the santa things you were talking about memes david here's the meme of the week here you and i just popped out i think the bankless uh bankless hq twitter uh posted captioned this i saw some great captions i saw some embarrassing ones but what are we looking at here uh it's us doing i think the weekly rollup um uh or it was recording the intro to vlad uh with robin hood and you're talking into the camera and i'm just looking at you and for some reason i'm biting my lift dude and i don't know why [Laughter] the caption is you feel uncomfortable yeah the caption is that you are ethan i am layer two there you go yeah i i see it and i hope this becomes a meme of the ages guys uh this has been the weekly roll up it's fun to do one in person we are back to our regular schedule where we are a coast away you're gonna be on the east coast next time david uh no i'm gonna be in seattle for a little bit because my stuff has to get there uh i have no idea where david is i'm gonna be floating around in the world for the next two weeks i do know though none of this of course has been financial advice
