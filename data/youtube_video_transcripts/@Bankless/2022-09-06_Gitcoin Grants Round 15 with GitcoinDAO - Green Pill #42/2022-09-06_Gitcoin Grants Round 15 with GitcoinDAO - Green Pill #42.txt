[Music] what up coordination it is that time of the year again bitcoin grants round 15 is upon us and on this episode i've got leon erickson who is an associate pm on get coin passport brent martin senior pm at moonshot collective one of the get coindal work streams annika lewis work stream lead for public goods funding also one of the work streams of get coined out and they are here to talk about get coin grants around 15 which starts on september 7th and goes through september 22nd sounds like there's three million dollars ish and you can contribute at gaquin.com and get your contributions matched so as a reminder i am disaffiliated from get coin dao i am hosting the episode and just asking questions and i'm learning about this stuff uh in many cases at the same time that you are all all learning about it so it's been fun to see the evolution of get coin dao over the years and get coin grants round 15 is the 15th evolution of the quadratic funding protocol that is run by git coin now get coin dao so the first voice that you'll hear after this bumper is myself followed by annika lewis the uh workstream lead for public goods funding and this episode goes really deep on civil resistance bitcoin grants quadratic funding and how the project managers pms at uh at get coindao are thinking about evolving it forward so i hope you enjoy this episode about get coin grants

going everyone hey hey gm all right we're here to talk about grants round 15 which is the get coin grants round that is starting this week so uh annika you want to give us a little history of bitcoin grants and tell us about grants around 15 yeah absolutely for anyone who isn't familiar with with bitcoin grants get coin grants has been running for a few years now and we are a group that uses quadratic funding to distribute funds to all sorts of projects both within web3 and beyond we started off really with a focus on the ethereum ecosystem and open source software there and have expanded well beyond that in the last couple years we've delivered over 50 million in funds towards open source and web3 development to all sorts of early stage projects and as kevin mentioned this is grant's round 15 so this is the 15th time we're running this round um we run them every quarter so this is the september edition for 2022 and we're super excited to kick off the round beautiful uh i think this episode will air either tuesday the 6th or thursday the 8th and i think the round starts on the 7th is that right that's right the round starts on september 7th specifically at three o'clock utc is when it will be active and the round runs for just over two weeks so until september 22nd great and uh how much money is is allocated in this bitcoin grants rounds yeah so so far we've got almost three million dollars committed across 17 different rounds so i'll talk for a minute about just the round structure and and how things are going to look for grants around 15. so we have quadratic funding pools which if you're not familiar with quadratic funding and how it works go to wtf is qf.com and check out the nifty calculator there but sort of the tldr on quadratic funding is that it helps with the preferences of the many over the few so you effectively are able to vote with your dollars vote with your die and decide how you want this almost three million dollars distributed across all of the grantees in the different quadratic funding rounds so within grants around 15 we've got 17 different rounds so 17 quadratic funding matching pools that will be distributed to the grantees in the platform we've got the main round which we've got um where all all uh grants on the platform with an ethereum payout address that qualify are eligible for those funds we've got our ecosystem rounds which are for specific groups in web3 that are building out their own communities and want to have a quadratic funding pool dedicated to their specific ecosystem and then we have the cause rounds which are something we introduced in grants around 12 that help support many types of social causes both on chain and off chain um you can check out all of them on our blog we'll have a blog coming out this weekend at getcoin.com blog that will give the details on all of these rounds but a few to call out for grants around 15. first off we've got the crypto advocacy round coming back that's going to be a 300 000 round this time i know with everything that's going on this summer uh in terms of what you know what you've seen in the news from a regulatory perspective there's a lot of buzz around advocacy for crypto with the tornado cash situation and all sorts of other um conversations bubbling up so we're really excited to be supporting those who are doing work in the advocacy space for crypto we've also got a new round around decentralized science this one's really cool because most of the rounds that have been stood up so far in bitcoin grants have been sort of dow led or driven by the internal team whereas this is one where it was totally decentralized many different folks from all across the ecosystem wanted to run around for decentralized science and this was really totally bottoms up and not necessarily get coin driven so really awesome to see this one come together um and those are just a couple of the themes that you'll see if you read the blog post and see what types of rounds we've got going on um so yeah that's that's kind of the structure for for grants around 15 and lots to come great so if i'm interested in posting a grant or funding a grant how can i do that what's the url yes go to getcoin.com you can see right there on the front page if you're interested in posting a grant definitely get that in sooner rather than later so that we can get you approved before the round starts um if you're interested in contributing to grants as an individual that's also the right place um and so yeah gatecoin.com grants is the best place to get started browse through grants and create a great yourself if you'd like to thanks annika um what uh is there is is there anything in grants round 15 that is moving towards grants 2.0 i know that git coin dial is moving towards a more protocol based vision uh and i'm curious whether there's any sort of like decoupling of the monolithic architecture and moving towards grants 2.0 yes there certainly is and if you listen to this green pill episode uh for either grants round 14 or grants around 13 you would have heard us talk about grants 2.0 and the vision that the dow is working towards there but the tldr on that is that bitcoin grants for the last few years has been running on a centralized platform where there are only you know a handful of people who can you know stand up rounds and kind of all of it has to go through bitcoin we are in the process of moving towards being a full protocol dow and building a permissionless protocol that anyone can use to stand up their grants around whether it's using quadratic funding or other mechanisms and really making it easy for anyone to use fork and and and play around with as they please so as we move towards a grants 2.0 world we within the bitcoin grants program are thinking about how to make the program more reflective of that world and start to evolve into a more decentralized manner even while we're still working on the centralized technology so one thing we're doing this round is what's called decoupling which effectively means for grantees that even if you don't meet the platform rules for being a grantee on the platform we've got some rules around you can't have a token and you can't have raised venture funding now we're giving autonomy to the ecosystem and cause rounds to make whatever rules they see fit um and so the grant doesn't necessarily need to qualify for the main round in order to be eligible for these other rounds so we're really excited about this and testing this out and playing around with kind of different rules-based systems in order to see what things will look like in a grants 2.0 world and make things a lot more flexible for funders and grantees alike great thanks hannika um as listeners may know i've disaffiliated from getcoindao although was involved in the very early days and so i'm learning a lot of this stuff for the first time here along with the listeners and it's a lot of fun to see get coin go from a company from a dao but it's kind of weird this is one of the first rounds that i'm seeing it from the outside so uh very cool i know one of the new things this time around is get coin passport and its evolution so what is git coin passport why does it matter and how is it evolving in round 15 i guess maybe leon will lead with you yeah sure um so thanks for having us here kevin um glad to be here with you all um yeah the git coin passport is basically the the identity verification method that we use for the donors or the voters in the grants program so as you may know due to the democratic nature of the quadratic funding program we might be able to game the system by like setting up multiple ethereum wallets and like donating smaller amounts from all these accounts instead of donating like the same amount from one actual account so basically what we're trying to do with the passport is verifying that each donor or voter is uniquely participating in the round um to do that um you as a like grand surround participant go to passport.getcoin.com and there you you will set up your passport you can sign in to your passport with your ethereum mainnet account and and then we have like a bunch of different um basically identity verification providers inside passport ranging from web 2 platforms that you might use or no like twitter google github and facebook to like more web3 native applications or platforms like ens or like ethereum or your lens profile or being a nose safe signer and then we actually also this round for the first time have some bitcoin grants native data so we'll one way to verify that that you're a human is by proving to us that you have contributed to git con grants in previous rounds or that you have received contributions in good congruence in previous rounds so if you have contributed or like been active in the congress ecosystem in the past um make sure to like verify the the congruence part of the passport as well um but basically once you've kind of collected everything that you can collect there um there are like 19 different options in total last run it was just eight you go back to your git coin profile so you find your gitcom profile basically just by going to gitcon.com your bitcoin or github username and then add slash trust and there you can then submit your uh passport and we'll basically record the verification methods you have added to your passport on password or google.co and based on what you submit will assign your contributions in the program in matching weight so these weights are dedicated to grand sound 15 and range from 50 to 150 percent so this one this time around because like you know we know that not every contributor is like very familiar with the passport we kind of give every user by default some trust uh and and with that 50 matching weight but through the password you can actually multiply that by three to up to 150 matching weight and at the same time just fyi we have the fraud detection defense team of git condo um working in full swing to identify other like attackers who try to game the system at the same time i know this is a high level overview i'd love to i know dig into some more details around the data points you can verify how the scoring works i'm not sure what you think okay totally well i guess you know first things first just always want to orient this around the listeners where can they go play with passport i'm on passport.gitcoin.com um cool so so that's a place where you create your file basically um you'll basically create a passport based on your ethereum account on the so-called ceramic network which is a data open data storage network and um then you can verify these different options are we actually still in working in full swing like adding all of the like methods that i i have just mentioned but all fingers crossed will be done by a tuesday um but yeah okay one thing i'd love to just call out here um on passport his passport launched just last round in grants around 14. um and i remember personally you know thinking about the round as the whole as a whole passport and its adoption was one of the things i was most blown away by i think we had 44 000 contributors in grants around 14 and 17 000 passports which is close to 30 percent of people just standing one up even though it wasn't required i think there were correct me if i'm wrong guys but like 50 000 stamps which is more than one stamp per contributor um so just awesome to see the organic adoption of passport in its first round and i'm excited with all the improvements this round to see uh how much higher we can get that yeah same here and at the same time we're working like with a couple of like very much reputable like with three projects on utilizing passport in their apps as well to verify either like the unique humanity of their participants or like verifying certain attributes about their members so i think the number of passport holders throughout the web 3 ecosystem will likely rapidly grow in the next couple of months with the grants rounds that we're operating but also with the other applications that kind of help drive this network effect i just want to make sure that we drill down on this because it may be obvious to people who've been involved in get coin and not be obvious to the median listener why passport why do we why do we have to verify all these different stamps there must be some reason why identity is important for this right so if we didn't verify that someone is uniquely participating in the program at all right you could basically set up a bunch of accounts like ethereum accounts or git code accounts and then donate to the courses that you care about and due to the democratic nature of quadratic funding you know would basically be like buying votes buying multiple voices or accounts so um basically you would get more impact on where the matching funding will be steered towards if you were creating multiple accounts and we want to avoid that if you're listening to this don't try because if you don't have a passport the weight on your contributions will be like comparably low and at the same time we have this um team that's still like kind of actively seeking out um sketchy activity on the platform um but yeah the i mean we could obviously do something simple you know and like pick out one particular decentralized identity provider you know say like bright id or like only improve humanity or we could i don't know maybe even do like kycs with like national passports but um with the passport and how we design like the gitcoin passport we basically have a range of options that you can choose from and if you're like someone who say doesn't have a bright id account you can still verify or prove to us that you're a unique human by for example verifying proof of humanity your past congrats activity and that you have an active twitter account so basically leave people the choice how they want to verify that they are human and don't really you know remove flexibility by like focusing on one particular identity provider out from the ecosystem cool so it sounds like there's a bunch of money at risk especially when people can make up new identities and so increasing the cost to create new identities for the uh people who would forge them is is kind of the the goal um and increasing the understanding that people are unique humans uh is what keeps the rounds legitimacy of the funds legit is that a good summary yeah absolutely basically want to make it very hard for people to set up multiple accounts and with that balance right like imagine you could like submit 20 ballots in a federal election right it would be kind of weird yeah so not just weird but probably illegal and and profoundly unethical coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who need to manage their

industry experts i i would love to dive in more on passport season two of the green pile podcast is all about this digital identity and reputation and privacy aware sovereign reputation especially and so i'm wondering if we could just pinch and zoom on get coin passport what else is there to say uh what new stamps will be in the passport this time around what are you excited about what is the future of identity and how does passport go into that uh let's maybe put all those questions in a pot and stir them yeah i mean one particular new stamp or like any provider that we've added it's quite interesting one that was also developed inside good condo uh namely from brent who is also here with us um it we call it like identity staking or gtc staking and i know maybe when you want to talk about how how getting these stamps into your passport will work yeah yeah i'd love to um and and and i like the way leon set that up too i think one of the one of the principles are guiding things that that we talked about here when we were launching passport for gr14 was how it's more important to go wide with your stamps to create that more costly that more expensive way of creating one's identity than to go deep on one and the current systems that we saw across identification was that people would use one system uh whether that's you know maybe that's bright id or maybe that's like just oauth and some web 2 sort of thing they would use one system to identify themselves but passport started to break away from that and go wide uh and so that's why one of the things we're excited about is the fact that like we're multiplying the the number of stamps or the identity signals that you can build on your profile one of the big ones that we've been talking about right now is identity staking this is what i've been working on with the team at moonshot collective over the last i guess the last iteration since the last grants round and the way identity staking works is that you can stake on your identity or your passport or stake on other people's identity in order to increase your trust bonus score or to increase someone else's trust bonus score and i kind of differentiate those two because there's a lot of really interesting things that can happen when you start to stake on other people to benefit them in their passport and starting to build like this network of of trust um that that we could do i like to call this like a new product but actually i'm sorry i like to call it i don't like to call it a new product i'd rather call it like a new experiment because what we're doing with this identity staking is we're also learning a lot about how this helps increase the trust bonus score of passport and how it can be used across other ecosystems so when i look at passport i think about um this being an identity primitive that we're shipping to the web 3 ecosystem as a whole it happens that grants is using it and is the first major adopter of it and is you know front running the building of it but like it it ultimately is a web 3 primitive to me and and it's a it's a major building block that can help accelerate this entire industry so i'm really excited to see other people using it uh as as uh to verify passports for whatever their needs are right and for us to continue the amount of identity identities taking our identity things but for identity staking specifically they're um it's kind of that i think what was really important to us is that we start creating this experimentation loop of being able to experiment with um staking on someone's identity and then learning from it through the the data that we collect in these rounds uh of people using it like are how interested are they in staking on themselves for to increase their trust bonus score are they more interested in staking on someone else to increase their trust bonus score like what things about this are interesting to people and as we learn from those experiments we can change the course or like the things that we ship in order to build better primitives from this and so i like to call it an experiment rather than a product because of the nature of it being uh changing its form in between as we grow and evolve it and that's specifically on identity staking that's just one stamp again of many on the passport but i think it's one stamp that starts to unlock some really interesting things uh a walkie-you talked about something even earlier you mentioned something earlier that is something that we're thinking about when we're thinking about um identity staking which is uh as a basically as a launching point one of the paths i have about four paths and we could go into that if we wanted to later um but of exploration uh that identity staking is starting to tap into and one of those paths is to start creating some form of cost of forgery so this is almost could be the genesis point to um to thinking about passports and profiles and what the cost of forgery is for them and measuring them that way so like when we talk about identity staking it's really the starting point of a lot of exploration and research that's really exciting for us cool um anything else to say about passport or the future of digital identity i know that we're going deep on that this episode or this season of green pill i mean it's a it's a turn i like to take but i'll um this at the end of the day this podcast or this episode is about gr15 so i want to make sure that uh i don't just like go down a rabbit hole with you kevin on the future of decentralized identity maybe we could constrain it to several resistance then uh since that's what really matters to get coin grants yeah i mean in total we have like went from these like 80 identity providers in the last round um where brand was pretty much uh helping put the passport up together to like um now like 19 identity providers including like 61 data points you might be able to verify so maybe to like contact contextualize that like one example was in the last round you would have verified that you have a twitter account and that's it you know we basically check um okay you authenticate yourself through twitter do we get like a positive response from twitter that this account exists and if yes we would have issued you a stamp to your passport or stamped your passport saying okay this passport is associated with a legit twitter account this time around we'll also check okay does this account have made like more than 10 tweets or posts so if you are an active twitter user will basically also give you a stamp hey okay you have also more than 10 tweets or posts or like do you have more how many followers do you have so if you have more than 100 followers you'll get a stamp this user is more than 100 followers and if you have more than 500 well you'll also get the stamp for having more than 500 followers and more than 1 000 more than 5 000 so this way we can kind of assess obviously it's not like too easy to get like 5 000 followers on twitter right um that we basically saw some very good evidence from twitter for example on like hey this this passport here is associated with a twitter account with 5 000 followers so basically we have like added a range of um yeah data points like this that that you'll see once like all the final uh updates for the release for gr15 are pushed um and and this way kind of we you know basically the the task that we set ourselves was is how can we gather evidence that might indicate that somebody is a you know actual human and then at the same time aggregating that and kind of adding some identifying hashes and and cryptography to these stems and the passports so we can see okay this seems to be a very active human and it's uniquely participating in this grants round and if you are uniquely participating human you can basically boost your contributions to the grants program by 150 so um basically increasing the matching that the projects um receive from the matching fund great well it seems like tldr passport continues to evolve and civil resistance is existential to quadratic funding and so that's the the lego for that but i'm curious as grants 2.0 rolls out is is this helping build momentum on on the protocols within get coin downloads like like is passport a kind of like a preview or a canary in the coal mine for for grants too anything else to say about the grass few protocols well i'll let somebody else speak on the the on the grant the rest of the grants true protocols but i have some thoughts on like what it looks like for us to build protocols in general um with gr14 some of the people that may know or not uh like i was the main product manager on getting passports initial it's alpha state brought in which i worked with leon on that was really exciting uh to be able to work together on those after we launched passport uh i i went back to moonshot collective to work on things that are related to passport and identity but not as like the the core protocol team that is passport um and leon started to run with that team so essentially we have two different teams that are building on this protocol i think that what's exciting about that to me is that the the vision of these protocols is that there is not one person or one team that is building these protocols that they're open source they're given by the community there's multiple teams there's multiple people that are working on this so what we're proving in this model is that hey brent can run off with moonshot collective and some builders and build like these new exciting pieces of prototype stuff that we're building on top of the passport at the same time leon can be working on expanding the stamps uh on a completely different team right and like expanding the robustness of the protocol itself and so there's something really exciting to see those splits happen and to see other teams express interest in in getting involved in passport protocol as well and like what kind of ecosystem that can that can create when there's you know uh one or ten ten or a hundred teams right building things on a protocol yeah i'll add to that brent i think it's been just really interesting to see how the dow has started to sort of very gradually shift in terms of how it works and thinking you know in a protocol's first way i think passport has been you know the first protocol we've really launched um i know that a lot of the grants to work with round explorer around manager and all of the other pieces are still kind of being worked on but as we start to have conversations about devrel and what it might look like and you know other kind of protocol native ways of working i think passport given that it's live and has you know improvements coming in already in the second round that it's here um it's just kind of yeah paving the way in terms of how we think about you know how we work and organize people uh in a dow that is moving effectively from being kind of a a social and impact dow to more of a protocol focused now so i think it's to me it's just a really interesting indicator and yeah experiment as to how we work and build these systems together maybe just one thing to add is um i think i mentioned between the lines previously but basically what we mean with protocol is that as you create a passport and add these different stamps to it all this doesn't live in like a django app on on the git coin side or like some proprietary database that we control but lives on this like open composable data network called ceramic you can find out more about it at ceramic.network i think and it's it basically allows us to like just build an interface um for for these passports which are basically just data structures that store these verified credentials on the ceramic network and interface with them for our purposes so we make the stamps or data points visible that we care about in our grants program but now if if you're an application developer and you also need to verify sub resistance whether that's like for spinning up your own quadratic funding program through grants 2.0 that we're also working on or you you know have an independent voting app going already and you want to verify whether someone is a unique human or a member of your community you can basically add data to these same passports and read data from these same passports and and utilize that to verify the identity of your participants so the kind of architectural or technological innovation is really that we don't really control that data of these identities but people really are pretty much in control of like what they add to it what they might remove from it and who they want to share it with yeah that's a really good point leon and that to me that's what makes it a true web3 protocol is that like we've moved away from like the concept of like center of one one trusted source or uh one trusted source owning all of the data and storing it all in one place for everyone else to use like it's it's been decentralized over this network it's good to point that out too leon it's it's you can tell where we are in web3 because um as a lot of people engage with this we still have this idea uh that uh the this kind of data that that works with this is about identity is about colette is about one centralized source collecting all this identity because that's what we're used to seeing right uh all around us but uh so when people a lot of new people come to passport they they kind of roll with that assumptions so i've had some conversations on twitter already uh with people that just assumed that this process of going through all these stamps is storing all of these stamps to like some like honey pot of data that bitcoin has or something the truth of the matter is we don't have any of that um all that happens is a verified credential is created to attest somebody's the truth of somebody's sign in or whatever that is it's encrypted so we can't even understand like i can i couldn't look at someone's passport and say this is their twitter handle like it's just an encrypted piece of data that shows that it is a unique uh twitter handle and all of that's stored on the network so we own none of the data at all and never will and that's by design and so it's funny whenever you know you get on twitter i think there's just we just still have this idea this conception from being so close to web 2 concepts that like all of the all of these things are going to a honey pot somewhere that someone can access and that's just not uh not the case and that's what makes this web 3 to me yeah well you know speaking of unlearning web 2 um i'll just mention that i am now disaffiliated from get coin the company that i started which was called get coin holdings is now rebranding to we think web3 event co still tbd on the name and it's been fun to be a contributor from the edges and to be mostly just affiliated at this point on our way to being fully disaffiliated and just to see the project continue to grow and thrive and that's another web 3 paradigm that i think didn't really exist in web 2 is you know being being friendly and and seeing it evolve and decentralize past you so uh really really grateful to you all for joining and talking about bitcoin grants around 15 and the investments that are being made in a protocol-based future for git coin uh any any final thoughts maybe you could end on around tldr uh round stats and how to get involved yeah absolutely so as a reminder grants around 15 is coming up starting on september 7th uh ending on september 22nd we've got almost 3 million dollars in matching funds to distribute across all of the different quadratic funding pools uh if you're interested in getting involved either as a grantee or in checking out grants to donate to check out get coin dot co slash grants and you'll be able to see all of the details and get involved find us on twitter at getcoin hit us up join the discord and yeah we're excited for the round great anything i didn't ask that any of you want to say all good for mine um great yeah just uh super excited about gr15 and the future of identity all right well thanks so much for joining public goods are good and see you during grants around 15. yeah thanks guys have a good one [Music] you
