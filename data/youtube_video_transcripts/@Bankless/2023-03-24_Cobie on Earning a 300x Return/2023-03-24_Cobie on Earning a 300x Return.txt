I think my biggest wins and my biggest losses were all by making mistakes because my biggest portfolio wins were like throwing risk management completely out of the window and doing something that now I would no longer do my first two trades ever after buying Bitcoin were my biggest like portfolio multipliers ever I did like 200 300X in my first few months in crypto by buying some altcoins that were just like completely trash but at the time I didn't know why they were trash
