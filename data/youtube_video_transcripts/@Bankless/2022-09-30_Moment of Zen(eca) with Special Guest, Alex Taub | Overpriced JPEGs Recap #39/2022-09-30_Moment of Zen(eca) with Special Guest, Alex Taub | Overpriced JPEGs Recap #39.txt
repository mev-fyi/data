just like with an overview what's happening in the market what's the macro picture how we feeling in the world of nfts in business you want to kick us off with your thoughts and then Alex will pull you into this yeah I think uh what's been two weeks since we lost chatted it's you know largely business as usual we're very much still in a bear Market eth I think last time we chatted it was like just shortly after the merge and eth had crashed which uh some people expected some people didn't but we've sort of hovered around that 1300 Mark just chopping five ten percent back and forth and nfts are chugging along that there's been I mean in the last 24 to 48 hours there's been a bunch of activity which you know some people are calling hope like being very optimistic saying hey there's a bull run coming back there was a 3300 eighth uh crypto Punk sale uh hoodie ape which was a big sale but you know that eight would have gone for two or three times as much I think uh a year ago there was the qql drop by Tyler Hobbs and dandelion which was a Dutch auction yesterday so Wednesday that sold out 900 mint passes at 14 eighth which is 17 million dollars so there's still there is liquidity it's just you know I think a lot of it's sitting on the sidelines and not not necessarily going to come in and and flow down and uh you know there are occasional projects that are popping off uh ranga is is one recent example I think we'll get into a bit more later but uh yeah generally still in a bear Market uh most things are bleeding out and it's very difficult to Mint out a project but there are exceptions so yeah how you feeling Alex yeah I mean listen we made Goblin town for a reason we're this is uh it's all forget it forget it uh Dave what's it what's the line forget it Jacob's Goblin Town yeah I I don't know I think um I think yeah I think it's business as usual I think there's definitely pumps here and there I think if you're a really great team right now it's a great opportunity to like launch your project where like there's not a lot of competition um you know what I'm seeing in the market is I'm seeing like people trying new things I think um you know mentioned you know God's Unchained and and regna um two interesting different mechanics that they used one right now has this like unboxing thing so you'd get a box and then you like break a box and then you get your nft uh God's Unchained to this whole application process which I think is really interesting sort of like making your own Community you know basically you can accept who you want so I think you know that's what I'm learning right now you know in in this market it's yeah there are opportunities here and there to make money I I don't think there's like you know the daily generational wealth opportunity anymore I think maybe it's like weekly or monthly um but I think uh I think it's if you're really Vigilant you could you could find Opportunities still um but I think for the most part it's it's it's rough do do you play in the Solana ecosystem at all Alex I think as we talk about kind of macro what's happening obviously I guess really starting with you it's D Gods but but in general right during the the bear we've seen Solana um sort of relative to eth pop off a bit yeah I think it's interesting I don't know that nfts are the right thing for Solana I think a lot of it's just like you know um for the most part pump and then dump but I think also most things on ethereum are pump and dump so I think Solana could be really interesting for D5 I think it can be really interesting for gaming um but I don't know that like it feels a little forced to nft stuff um but I think they're trying things you know they want the ecosystem to work they want people to build on them uh so I don't have any you know I don't have any issues with that I'm not like a maxi of anything I just I think I think it's just you know I think there are things that are better suited for those really low transaction fees specifically gaming D5 that could be really interesting nfts I don't know less so to me so I struggle with this too and I'm sure there'll be some Solana people that'll come after me for this but I recently put on some recurring buys for like very tiny tiny but for like IMX token and flow for flow and Matic just because those are sort of the three kind of alt eth not that Matic and IMX are actually really old East but kind of bets that I'm more bullish on right now I partly didn't do anything with Solana because I already owned sort of I'd like stack some Solana during the bowl so I'm just like oh just hold that and see what happens um but also I don't really feel like I yet understand what the Solana value prop relative to these other chains is is going to end up being like I feel like flow has this real like onboarding new consumers you know brand because of Top Shot Etc that makes sense for certain projects that are cool with like a somewhat closed ecosystem you know whatever we can we can go into that but and then IMX people know I'm a fairly bullish on and have worked with work with in various capacities on the gaming side so Lana feels like it's in this weird Middle Ground where I kind of agree like nft is there versus eth especially in like a low gas eth environment sure but I don't really know and on the gaming side I don't know that they actually have yes they have more scalability yes they have more throughput TPS than ethereum does right now but like still don't have the capacity for the kind of TPS I feel like you need for like billions of gaming transactions um and I think I understand how IMX is building towards that capacity and I don't understand what Salon aside so again so a lot of people I'm sure can come after me but I do my God as of now is like a little bit of like people still want to gamble in the bear and there's some activity happening on Solana and there's a little bit more kind of like I don't know maybe even liquidity kind of like you can flip you can play around whatever happening there so people are there but I don't know that I feel like there's like a sustained long-term play I mean you even have youths and D gods or that team saying like our next drop is going to be on ethereum like you have like some of the biggest Solana projects talking about doing future stuff on ethereum which to me is kind of telling no it's actually funny you know we were um yeah the value prop when of like the high gas this is low gas is sort of gone for the most part um which was the main value prop I think or at least the big you know talking point actually true story when we originally did Illuminati uh nft uh in January uh we were we were trying to figure out a way to do maybe 50 we were trying like weird stuff so we were thinking maybe 50 of the mint would be on Ethan 50 would be on Solana and I try something different we ended up scrapping that um I forgot why but it was overly complicated unnecessarily but I don't know I just think that the the um yeah East works you know it may be a little expensive but it works and most people use it so I think there's other things you're gonna have to get interesting on Solana for it to be useful there I don't hate any like Solana I have a few Solana nfcs I just don't think that it's um like I don't think there's any specific value prop besides the uh the the cheaper gas um that makes it interesting or I haven't found one yeah yeah I'm kind of with you I feel like they had I guess it clearly marketed well which is you know kind of key in this space but I don't know that that sustains you for the long term you know um anyway we don't have to belabor the point let's get into some of the specific drops you mentioned a couple of them uh God's Unchained like topping the charts for several days in a row in terms of volume um I know they launched kind of a promotional offering as part of their wearable integration imx's variable integration um so they were running a bunch of like gaming rewards trading rewards had some new drops within the gods Unchained ecosystem for those who don't know God's Unchained is a um Trading Card Game you know played digitally uh created by Robbie Ferguson yes like Hearthstone um Robbie Ferguson James Ferguson Brothers made that game and always had made that game sort of like a trojan horse for building a layer two like using a a an ethereum based game to kind of test and know that they would need to build like a a separate ecosystem to um to ethereum for scaling purposes so uh I've always been just like a huge fan obviously as I said of Robbie and James and um kind of fun to see that having a bunch of success I don't know do y'all have thoughts you have more you want to add to that Alex uh personally I used to play a lot of hearthstone I actually it's so funny when I originally saw gods and chain I was thinking D gods and I think it's just because they're so they sound so familiar so I actually haven't played I I don't know that much about God's Unchained so maybe zeneca knows more I don't know too much about it when I was first getting into nfts I heard about it and it appealed to me because I played a lot of hearthstone as well and it was a a game and it was out you could already go and buy Cards and you could play it and I downloaded it and I played it and it at the time it sort of I was like this is just a carbon copy of hearthstone it's like it's played exactly the same to me back then I'm sure it's changed and evolved and has grown a lot more I basically not paid attention to it for the last year and a bit it's just there's so much happening it's impossible to stay on top of even a fraction of what's going on in the space on eth let alone all the other chains and layers and and stuff but uh yeah I didn't even know that it was it was topping charts until you mentioned it or put it in the the um show notes so yeah it's cool I mean I I feel like it's it's nice anytime you see an OG project you know with with pure intentions I I would say or right like revive or not I I it wasn't like it was dead by any means right but like have sort of a moment I I just I find that gratifying um I have played guns Unchained funny that I seem to be the one out of the three of us who's probably played it most recently I I don't I don't understand games or training card games I literally was playing like the tutorial one where like they walk you through all but like the last step of what you have to do and I was sitting there in like the last step they were like you know okay great like we've given you all the tools now like go defeat the opponent and I was like uh I like so it's a I don't know I think you have to have like learned these games there's a wiring for it slash uh just like once you've learned like the basics of these and you have them in Your Arsenal then it's easier to go and play new games but I do some at the point of my life where I'm like learning a new like a whole skill set of like trading card games just is like low on my kind of priority list so it seemed cool but I uh I struggled mightily to like actually figure out how to play it effectively it sort of reminds me a little bit of like I mean I haven't played at all with gods and chain but like the concept of like loot back in the day of like you know loot you get like a list of things and then it like the idea was that you could play like turn it into a game and you can build on top of loot um I think obviously there's a lot of like hoopla around it and you know probably um you know uh I I still think it's interesting maybe not like for crazy amounts of eth per thing but I still think it's it's it's it's a really interesting concept of building a game using whatever is on your list as like a thing yeah I mean battle somebody loot was just words and yes like maybe somebody else will go and make a game out of this versus like an actual game um but I mean there's kind there was like the the loot words definitely lended themselves to sort of like a fantasy you know like the kind of game that I think would uh is definitely similar um okay I'm embarrassed because I don't really know ranga and it's like been I don't I don't think it's on the top charts today maybe I missed it oh it is it is okay um but it has been you know for the I feel like past week or a couple weeks maybe even and I've um avoided excite just haven't dug in and I don't know about it so I need one of you to explain this to me because it's a clear Gap in my uh my understanding of the space I I can probably take a stab at it so it's a project by uh the artist behind it his name is dirty robot and uh I'm forgetting his uh real real name quote unquote but uh very established artists the super rare artist has you know found success in this space and creates these wonderful characters they're sort of I don't even know how to describe them that that they're I don't know that they're they're I'm just not going to even try and describe them uh maybe we'll uh we'll have a link in the show notes but anyway he creates this is Matt he's created this massive world and it renga all started from a drop I think it was like six months ago now called The Art of seasons and it was an art focused drop of which there were different styles that were you know uh artistic pieces that had I think a fun mechanic where throughout the day I think they change from like one season to another so the art changes four to six times a day uh or maybe it's over a week or something like that and it was always alluded that back then you know that they're working towards the pfp drop they're building a world they're building a story they're building um an entire ecosystem but it's beginning with this drop and then somewhere I think like three months later they airdropped black boxes to everyone who had a the art of season nft and these boxes were uh effectively the the conduit for the pfp so they said all right so now everyone has a box this was our reward for people who supported us and thank you for buying the art of Seasons um at some point in the future you'll be able to unbox and reveal your pfp urenga pfp character and they they there's a lot of excitement and then in the floor price of the boxes went up quite a lot and um then they started to get a lot of flack because uh like the process between dropping the Brock the length of time between dropping the the boxes and the unboxing beginning was quite long I think it was like two months or three months which in this space is might as well be a lifetime so floor price sank there's a lot of fun and just generally people like it was almost became a meme like when unboxed when unboxed but eventually you know clearly good things take time they put the time and effort into creating like a really diverse set of wonderful characters and they had a really strong core community that you know but they might have been fun but the core Believers that were there since day one uh really said hey this is uh you know we believe in the project we believe in the team we believe in the artist we know that good things are coming we're going to wait and support and then good things came the the unboxing began maybe a month to go maybe slightly more slightly less and a lot of people have been having a lot of fun revealing their their pfps it introduced it as it introduces an interesting scarcity model where because there's a random gambling element effectively when you unbox uh you know and every time you unbox the the supply of the the black boxes goes down so now eventually there's only a limited quantity left to unbox and it's similar to the clonex vials I think where you don't know exactly what you're going to get and yeah they've both just been pumping sort of in unison the black boxes and the pfps over the last couple of weeks and that yeah I mean and and thinking forward like what they're building I think they're really trying to create a a narrative and a story it's very much a story based project uh where they're going to use these characters to build out their law and and yeah I don't know Alex anything to add yeah no I think the unboxing stuff is really interesting and like you said like you know there's zero patience in this space for anything and and and that's the truth and that's it's sort of the sad truth because um you know I I think about this a lot because you know people are like you know you talk about floor and they want to pump and they want this but those people don't really want to be in your community they're looking to sell whatever the thing is because they're looking for a pump yeah and I I think you know people cater too much to the people those type of people in the space um and I don't think long term it's a healthy thing I think long term it's it's probably a pretty unhealthy thing so just be caring about that type of stuff and it's good on them that they took their time to get it right because you know if you don't get it right you can't really take it back at that point so I really like I look at when I look at projects I I look at Art I look at the stuff like whatever but I like to look at the mechanics of the things that they did and that created excitement or um you know and and I think that the unboxing thing I mean it goes back to every you know beginning of NBA Top Shot packs right you open up a pack you keep it closed you know you get a LeBron or do you get someone who's not LeBron um and I think that that's really the the most interesting thing to me is that I think storytelling is also really interesting it's something we you know perform and start storytelling in Goblin Town but um I think that the the mechanics just interested me the most [Music] but I've been a lot lately because I think so highly of it with kryptoys which is really fundamentally like creating a tactile feeling unboxing experience that's reminiscent of what you see with like lol surprise dolls really targeted towards like families and something like you know parents and kids can kind of do together digitally so I definitely think that the the kind of unboxing mechanic which of course any reveal in this space is to some extent but when you make it really explicit like here's a box and it will be unboxed it kind of just Taps into these mechanisms that we as humans are familiar with from other places and I feel like just trigger that like kind of gambling sensibility in a uh you know in a profound way I'm looking at the site here the art is sick it it feels a little bit Asian a little bit totally that's what I was going to say is like if I were to yeah if I was going to put into a bucket I would call it a Zuki even in the way that I I you know look the website's great it's the same way I thought about Goblin Town like when you go to a website and you're like I've entered a little bit of an immersive experience even though it's still just your static kind of web page thing you can tell when a product or a project is kind of bringing you into an experience and bringing you into a brand on their website azuki for sure gobble and town did it well uh Karo furu uh that project um I always forget to announce that I think they did it really well yeah I don't I'm not even gonna worry about it like you know there's a number of them it's not actually I think cool cats at times has done it well but ranga is is is definitely doing it um 10 10K TF I feel like does it really well um this is beautiful the website so um again I think because I have them a little bit in in like the azuki world in my head do we know you were sort of getting to this xenica but like I would say azuki's really position themselves and they're like almost like Street Wear culture brand angle obviously you've got Doodles is going hardcore entertainment IP kind of music side of entertainment IP you guys is everything within the kind of different buckets has has renga indicated where they look to fall they might have but I'm not aware of it I'm I'm sort of I have some and I fumbled my bag I had a lot and then I have a lot less now but I uh yeah I I'm just probably unaware of of it but I think on I don't know where it says it I think on the open C page it says in in its purest form renga is The Art of Storytelling and okay so I it's very vague at least at that point I don't know yeah I don't know maybe I think they can't explain it because they're a little bit open open-ended of like where they can go with it but there's definitely different types of like people and characters in the in the art yeah I mean look again it's evocative I totally see it as a you can see it as a story but there's a lot you can see that way actually invisible friends would be another comp I would maybe put out there for some reason friends too I totally agree I think totally agree long term they're like they're like a long-term hold for me like what are they at these days probably two two three two to three yeah yeah they have another one of those really strong core community of supporters that I think uh will be there through thick and thin three um yeah yeah to it yeah what's the um what's the is dirty robot the artist do we know anything about the artist themselves faranga uh other than knowing that they're they've released on super rare uh I used to I I have the name in my head somewhere I want to say Daniel but uh it could be totally wrong uh yeah but it is dirty robot it is dirty yeah okay one of one's on yeah so I like that because I like that about um invisible friends too like the the creative character creative Collective whatever the whatever it all is and like you know like it's an artist behind it which gives it a little bit of like I don't know gives it a little bit more in my opinion in some way where it's like it can kind of stand on the basis of being an art uh being art because that's sort of what it is fundamentally as opposed to like an azuki where you have zagabond is not an art is not the artist behind it like you know it feels a little bit more commercial in that sense um while we're talking about azuki Zuki news this past week I guess or azuki rumors which is that they've raised the rumors that they've raised 30 million at like a 600 million valuation do I have that right I'm not sure if it's true I don't know is it like what's what's the but that that is I do have that rumor reported yeah it was on the Block so I think and it yeah the block reported well but but it's funny because there was initially a rumor that it was gonna it was getting a 1.4 billion dollar valuation um which is why I think you've seen azuki's actually dip recently they sort of fell they had this 1.4 billion dollar valuation rumor then the block comes out and says 30 million on a series a raise I'm trying to find the uh I had 400 million 400 million okay yeah at a 400 million evaluation that's obviously significantly less than a 1.4 billion valuation and so the the the floor price sort of fell on the uh on the news I want to say but again it's all rumors so it's it's again shows how silly we're all just like trading rumors in this space um they should not have a 1.4 billion dollar valuation a 400 million dollar valuation is supremely more I would say reasonable um though it's it's all strange in this space right because you have these projects that from like an annual revenue perspective now it's not like Revenue that they can count on next year right but like these projects have done huge volumes made a ton of money in a year so I do think it gets a little weird to know how to value a company like this where you have crazy Revenue in a year one scenario but you can't really Bank on it moving forward but like what if a Project's not 100 million in Revenue you have to evaluate at some sort of multiple on that I guess I don't know it's very strange have you guys ever thought about raising for for I guess probably not for Goblin Town Alex because you're very like no Discord well okay so we're a free-for-all so there's truth Labs right but I I I have a company called upstream and we raise 20 million dollars from investors we've we've been approached by a lot of people to to take money for truth labs doesn't make sense right now um it's you know it's it's very pure right now what we're doing um you start to introduce investors uh like VCS Etc just changes like the motivations changes the Dynamics changes the trajectory like we have crazy stuff we want to do don't feel as comfortable with an investor like you know with VCS around it like we have enough money to do what we want so um that's us that's not everybody you know you know we we were sort of um we minted ourselves or we we made ourselves in the bear so you know I think it's it's um this is a different Dynamic I think a lot of companies do need some of that Venture money to continue to go um happens to be that we don't so uh but I don't I don't knock people from taking Venture money if they can get it um you know the idea around Venture money is to help you go faster that's the the thought process behind it I know a lot of other projects who are raising or in the middle of raising or just closed raising and you know it's it helps them do more that's the idea yeah yeah I think it's go faster and then also in this time that we're in it's also a security blanket for the next 12 to 18 months of of if you know we stay in a kind of deep winter or go into a deeper winter God forbid right over the next 12 to 18 months like I think Doodles talked about that a little bit of just like you know what like we have lots we want to do and there's like a go faster element and there's also like we don't know what the Market's gonna look like for the next year and a half and let's make sure we can kind of pay salaries I'm putting some words in Doodle's mouth but um I mean like I've been approached to take money for for things and we're going to be expanding in some ways that we'll talk I'll talk about it some future date but and it's like a big debate it's like you know what yeah like if things are going to be dark for the next 18 months it might be nice just have a little bit of a cushion there um so totally teach their own I think it's awesome as long as you're like you know the team is being strategic and smart about it and not sort of screwing over holders in the process I think it's you can't you can go right both ways it can yeah it gets yeah I have nothing against people to take VC Monday and I think it makes a lot of sense in a lot of cases but it can skew or misalign incentives in some awkward ways sometimes when you have nft holders and then the VC is coming in and uh how are you going to generate profit for the business and is it going to be selling more nfts to the same people that already bought your nft it it it can misalign incentives and it can um restrict you and yeah to your point Alex sometimes if you want to do crazy things if you want to just go off and and not have profit at the front of mind uh not that all VCS want profit a front of men but many of them do um they want growth front of mine that's one way or another yeah short-term or long term they obviously want to return on their investment and I think uh for some projects that make sense and for others it doesn't do you have thoughts on the Suzuki race do you trust them to manage it properly kind of yeah I think uh I think it seems like they're coming from the startup and VC background and so they'll yeah I I think 400 million is way more reasonable obviously the 1.4 billion I think uh that they've got a rabid community of very strong supporters and I think that they'll do fine and they'll do well and they'll be around they've carved out a really strong Niche for themselves in the pfp space so yeah yeah I mean I've said it since the drama which is like I think zagabond smart like I read I read his thing like outing himself as like you know what some people would say a scammer and I was like yeah but like you kind of read it like I also think he's like kind of a hustler and like and I mean that kind of in a positive way so it very mixed feelings I there were some funny like tweets being like okay I would love to see the slide deck where he's like regarding my previous scams or you know like picturing zagabond like pitching VCS and like you know having a slide about like tendys or whatever the heck um yeah I don't find that sorry uh I just also don't find that VC fundraises actually affect much of the Far Cry floor price of projects right um I actually find it to sometimes have a negative effect uh for the floor Doodles so I don't I don't see it to be a problem I think Acquisitions help like you saw like artifact Nike uh but I don't I don't see that VC funding has a material effect I think it'll probably have more effect on a token than it would on a on a on an nft um like a tote like an erc20 type of token because there's just a lot more liquidity there I just don't see it being um uh or historically I've seen companies raise and I don't see having a massive effect on anything yeah well and if anything to your point like I think it can actually have a negative effect if holders end up feeling like you're not a priority anymore we've been deep we've been de-prioritized yeah absolutely which you know I I've ranted about this in the show I don't I think it depends on the team right but like in the case of like a doodles at a certain point you have to firm up a vision and go for a vision for the nft to to have long-term fundamental value and you know if your vision is big enough which is the only way it's going to maintain a 10 plus eth floor price in the future right like you probably do need money to make that Vision come true so you know again it's obviously all going to be their product by project but I just I I don't think holders have been de-prioritized in certain immediate ways they probably have been but in the long term I think this is actually the only way that they'll really see long-term value for their token so um okay in the spirit of like corporate corporatizing the nft world which I've been kind of talking about recently because I do think we're seeing a lot of it and I I mean it positively Chipotle I was not expecting this exact move which is Chipotle comes out and is like getting really nerdy and talking about how ethereum now uses 99 less um energy since it's moved to proof of stake so Chipotle introduced proof of stake s-t-e-a-k where if you for X number of days if you went into a Chipotle store and used your flexa HQ you know basically they're they're like steadin app or something flexa is a payments app that partners with Merchants basically if you you use crypto to buy your Chipotle meal garlic steak Chipotle whatever the heck you it was 99 off so you basically got it for free um Wild it's awesome like yeah it's it is wild to come out of left field I wasn't expecting it I don't think anyone was but it's awesome I think it's it's it's nice to see that sort of the validation that we were all hoping for that sort of maybe companies that were hesitant to get into crypto and especially ethereum because it was proof of work and the environmental impacts now that they feel a lot more comfortable to experiment at least in the area and be like all right we're not going to face the environmental backlash let's let's do something a Chipotle is celebrating the merge like that's Wild Thing it's a wild thing Alex what are your thoughts yeah I mean I think actually the biggest thing from the merge because the merge didn't really affect the the youth prices uh didn't have them like didn't move tanked them in some ways well yeah but it also didn't um I think it's almost like a long-term sort of thing but uh I think it was it didn't make gas any cheaper um people figured that out over the last you know six months um or nine months they've made it cheaper by making more simple contracts and things like that uh but I think the biggest thing for the merge was was the environmental thing uh and the corporations will feel all comfortable and I think a lot of uh Big Brand corporate you know entities got approved to do something in web 3 probably during the run-up um and now they're finally launching their thing or they're getting ready to launch their thing and this this aspect of like the environment helps them do it in a more confident way um and I think they'll be just like and I've said this a few times publicly like just like everything there'll be winners there'll be losers there'll be companies like big brands that like don't understand the space and they come in and it looks like a cash grab and it just doesn't work and then there'll be companies that stay true to their brand and and they do something really interesting and fun and funny and they probably have someone on the team who's like a d-gen who understands the space and that's that you know there's going to be a winner or two in the space right I think actually even though they got a lot of you know sort of like hate and like hoopla around like I think like the Tiffany was like a really good example of like sticking to like what they did small supply high cost that's that's Tiffany you know what I mean that's not yeah they didn't make believe they were someone else which I think is is interesting so I'm a fan of this I mean I think you know people talk about wanting to go more mainstream like there's no other way to go mainstream without bigger companies involved this is also etha's money like you know this isn't just like hey Chipotle partnered with XYZ nft this is like we accept eth or I mean again it's basically free so it's like I don't know what fraction of a percent of eth you know or what you know this even amounts to but like that's this is a distinct entrance into web3 in my opinion relative to what we've seen from other companies because it's literally saying we're accepting ether's payment which is um from from Chipotle which is huge I I don't know it feels like that's wild to see I don't know if we'll we'll continue to see this but like eat this money it's also a huge win for flexa um which I'm trying to dive a little bit more into I know they have the amp token um but like what a what a what a huge win for them I mean they're certainly not alone in trying to be like the you know pain the crypto payment solution but the certainly like cements them as I don't know one of the one of the leading answers for that if you have this you know kind of Nationwide partnership with Chipotle so is it is Chipotle International you get Chipotle out where you are uh Boondocks of Germany just kidding uh I I don't think it's very International if it is we don't have it in Australia uh pretty sure we don't have it in Germany so maybe there's a couple locations but it's largely American based um I got one right around the corner one of my favorite go-to's for lunch you know I don't know I don't know if I've ever I've even ever been to one like I've been to America a bunch of times but Chipotle I don't think I've ever visited I remember what I don't know when it actually launched but when I was in college it was sort of like new and there was like you know it was like as a college kid it was like perfect college kid food you know just like

okay last last item I want to talk about before we move into the Illuminati Dao announcement that Alex is going to break down for us the cftc went after ookie Dao did you all see this was that English I have no idea what you're talking about I'm gonna I'm gonna be a flyer on the wall for this conversation yeah I could talk so yeah yeah you break it down but you know basically the commodity Futures Trading commission you know there's like this back and forth between the SEC and the states and the fcftc SEC regulates Securities cftc regulates Commodities there's this big kind of looming question of like in the world of web3 crypto nfts like should these things be be regulated by the Commodities Regulators or by the by the Securities Regulators um and the the cftc just sort of threw down a gauntlet so to speak I don't know they just kind of made a statement uh themselves do you want to break it down for us Alex yeah I mean I uh in terms of specifics I think from what I understand is in the big headlines we're like if you are a voter in a dow you may be liable for the Dow type of thing and and they're sort of like making it I think it's like a nice funny not funny like it's a nice like headline to be like scare people but like the truth of the matter is if you're voting in a doubt you're actually an owner in the Dow because that's how Dows work like you're not just a voter you're you have ownership in the Dow because those are autonomous organizations that's the idea is that everyone who can everyone who could vote is is a partial owner now the the thing that I'm understanding from this and I'm not in a lawyer I'm not an expert I'm an expert I'm not a lawyer but I'm in the in the specifically around dads a lot of people in the crypto space believe that you know code is Law and the reality is the code is not law law is Law and if you have a dow and you want to exist in this world like doubts aren't legally anything right they're not legally considered anything today talk in a few years they might be legally something but today it's like Wyoming has been now legal like yeah there's like a dow LLC like there's a structure but Dow's the concept of a dow the smart contract is not legally anything so if you want to exist in the reality of the world without like having you know having fines or you know any issues you have to like live within the confines of what the law is today so there's a lot of different ways you can you can fit so for example there's different types of dows like for example an investment Club investment club sub 100 people sub 25 million dollars you know you you um you can set up an entity like an LLC for that group to exist in you can you can do that type of stuff and live in in the world and from my understanding um there was no type of entity uh involved so I think it's important to break down a little bit here what happened which is you have these two guys Kyle something I actually don't know their names anyways two guys who set up it was initially b0x which was like a lending protocol so it was you know the standard you input whatever eth is collateral and you can get loans and whatever um and it became like a short shorting platform right I believe like they were they were probably probably I don't know well the the the cscc is claiming that they were an unregistered like Futures broker basically and that they hadn't registered as such but but this is to me some some of the details here which is that they initially set up this protocol they were you know their docs like this was their protocol that they then handed over to a community and I've read I wouldn't want to fully fully confirm this because I didn't like see it myself like first you know primary source stuff like they were pretty open about the fact that they were handing it over to a Dao in the hope of like that absolving them of any kind of regulatory scrutiny and that's very different than like starting a Dao initially you know just like writing a piece of code like kind of never having a centralized control point so these guys had this sort of centralized control Point handed it over to a community almost like baiting Regulators it feels like by being like now they can't get us um and and yeah had no sort of registered legal entity even for this Dow structure uh is my understanding so like I mean that's your problem right there like that's a huge problem if they're not an entity and the other thing listen if they were an entity and then they gave it to another entity then yeah they would have been able to have been like okay okay maybe if they made some issues and some errors or whatever I don't know what they're saying publicly or privately or whatever but like that's fine when you're just like this code is the law and like that just doesn't it just doesn't work in in current reality I mean listen llc's haven't been around forever they've been around you know I think since the 50s 60s 70s like that's not a long time who's to say that Dows aren't the entities of the internet the digital entities I think that's a reality that could happen over the next 10 20 years um but you just you you if you want to work within the confines of you know today and you want to have it sort of exist in that real then you need to have some sort of entity that makes sense and there's a lot of different types of entities that make sense you know Illuminati Dao we're actually uh um uh we start off as a una an unregistered non-profit Association and we're seeking 501c3 status in Wyoming uh as a foundation um you know I believe eight coin like um the the Yuga sort of aped out um is is a foundation as well I've heard there I think Cayman Islands base too like that's the other the popular thing right is to to go home yeah there's a lot of different options there but you need to do something you need to like talk to lawyers instead of some sort of entity and that typically protects you because for example for the Illuminati Dao we did it because it it was a combination of we're being taxed as a corporation so meaning we don't have to send uh um you know K1 to everybody so nobody has to like there's no taxes on it and then two it's just taxes as a corporation and then two is the limited liability if something happens you can't go after the individuals if you don't set up an entity you can go after the individual and that's what's happening here so to kind of put a bow on this you have the two original founders of this b0x protocol which got renamed Uki Dao when it was handed over to the community and uh the two individuals who founded it are getting fined 250 000 a piece and then there's the ctfc cftco is invert those but um it is saying they could go after the actual like individual holders voters as well which is why there's a lot of kind of fear-mongering around it um unclear if they really will go after these individuals there's also a kyc component of this of like you know is this going to force kind of more kyc restrictions on like protocols and D5 and I think there is obviously a reason to be nervous because you have you're seeing that these Regulators are very clearly indicating that they want to go after things you also have basically two regulatory bodies like seemingly like competing to have jurisdiction and so that's also probably like upping the ante of them wanting to go after things um but I think I think the final point is like the reality is what's frustrating is these regulatory bodies are not issuing clear guidance and so we can sit here Alex and you and I say like yes there are clearly ways in which b0 acts like and slash Uki like did this kind of blatantly quote unquote wrong or like blatantly like brazenly but there's a problem which is that people don't know exactly it's all a little bit speculative of like how to set this up to comply with Regulators because they're giving no guidance and that's really freaking frustrating if you're going to then go start going after people for not complying but you haven't really spelled out what Dallas should or shouldn't be doing so you know I think that's the big one here is like give us guidance man guidance is great but without guidance and you have to follow like the law of the land you know and that's I don't know maybe there were maybe just you still need to register your entity in some capacity yeah like if you don't have any kind then you're just like you're rolling the dice and I don't know maybe maybe they went after them because their name's so bad I don't know um all right let's let's do it Alex yeah tell us what's going on from the Illuminati Dao crew and how it benefits uh Goblin townholders uh so it's actually so let me actually take a step back and and explain what it is because I think that's there's definitely um and we need to do a little bit a better job of explaining so we started truth Labs end of last year beginning of this year started uh we launched Illuminati nft those pyramid you know nfts um sort of the iconography of the of the Illuminati and the whole idea when we launched it was that the if the Illuminati like existed um and we wouldn't reach that to by a lot of Illuminati entities since we've launched but if the Illuminati existed um they would sort of be a dow right so he said okay this could be really cool let's launch an nft project where 50 of the mint goes to us and the team to sort of develop and 50 of the mint goes to a dow that the community could sort of run and decide what what they do with it so that was what we launched I think was January 3rd um the the 50 that went to sort of the team that was to sort of you know develop and end up building a lot of different things and then the 50 percent that went to the Dow the Dow can sort of decide what they want to do um now you know we end up charging 0.23 if at the time it was about 800 to a thousand dollars so we end up having and there's 8 128 illuminatis so it was an expensive mint even for the time but very clear that 50 of it was basically going back to you in voting power in the Dow um so anyway the Dow and then eventually we like we launched Goblin Town and we have this thing called the 187 we have this like Universal building and these different characters um I won't get too much into that today because it's not as relevant for what's what's coming so early on uh a member of the Illuminati community and the doubt a guy named Nathan um he reached out and he said hey I found this um uh contract on etherscan and that was basically that predates uh crypto punks by three months or three two or three or four months and it was a um an avatar project uh specifically a pfp project and he's like this is uh it would be really cool maybe if the Dow wanted to put some money to sort of resurrect it and relaunch it um it was built at like a hackathon project uh and it was the first known at least that we've found we've been looking the first known um sort of Avatar project on ethereum and uh we thought oh this is cool so we ended up giving it a name we call it uh OPP which is um it actually has a real name uh but we didn't want to reveal it and and it by the way other people had sort of found this there's been like 50 plus interactions over the last you know I don't know how many years this is 2017 so uh five you know last four to five years um there have been a few interactions uh but there's a few reasons why people haven't touched it um but we didn't want to like sort of let anyone sort of just go and run so we've been calling it OPP which stands for operation uh pre-punks um and uh and people seem to like it with the opp you know you know me um and we've been uh so we pitched it to the Dow every week at on Friday at three o'clock we have a down call uh on upstream and we basically you know pitched into the Dow saying hey this is what we found uh should we put it together we put together like the community basically put together a document outlining what we want to do we brought in the devs who built a lot of the Illuminati stuff when we asked them if they wanted to go and build it and now we're launching it uh this weekend so important context here yes which is maybe you said this and I missed it but the the original project is it was set up to be non-transferable effectively which is why it needs to be resurrected or relaunched so I didn't say that yet should I cut that out or you're saying you can't say that it's not like I can't say that um no no but that was that was part of it so we wanted to stay true to the true to the um original work it has an original name there's actually somewhere that the person who built it we've been trying to reach the person we can't get in touch them luckily enough there is a place on the internet that they basically said anyone could do anything with this which is our lawyers were very happy about because it's like they they basically said hey like anyone who wants to play around this do anything take do whatever you want they basically open source the entire thing uh at least in their in their words they open sourced it so we felt comfortable being able to like bring it back and do something also this is going to be a free mint this is not and it's going to be a claim anyone who owns Illuminati will be able to claim it um but we uh yeah so one of the big issues was this was before any standards right like one of the funny things about it is when it was like an avatar Builder so you come to the site you you'd build an avatar and then you sort of mint it to the blockchain it was so old that like um besides for any standards for those before any of that even before that like you they gave me the option to enter your seed phrase into the site like that's how early it was um like like enter your seat phrase to Mint oh my God it's like that that type of level which is really cool so but we wanted to do our hardest to be true to the original attempt back in 2017. um so instead of like updating the art they actually used SVG avatars um so you can actually go to SVG avatars and play around with like the different things that they allowed you to do and it's a really really like robust Avatar Builder it's a lot of fun uh to build the avatars there um and so we wanted to do uh like we wanted to bring it back but the the problem the big problem was like okay there's a non-transferable sort of token that is is part of this um thing so it was meant to be like an avatar right so you mean Avatar was yours there wasn't any rule of plans to like send it to somebody so what the what the devs did is so we came up with a little Innovation around the the non-transferable hash so every initial Mentor will be able to use their like artistic Vision to create their OPP nft customized by them and then in a single transaction uh the opp mentors and we're gonna say the name when it comes out just going by OPP right now but um obb Menders will register their unique hash to the original smart contract and produce an nft using the metadata from that contract hash on the new smart contract so like this way your token has direct Providence from the historical contract while you know being usable and and and meaningful like being on a modern token platform and adapts and be able to be so transferred so that's the first thing so the the hash is coming to the original Mentor the other interesting thing that we did is around royalties so we thought okay what can we do interesting here and you know for those that here that are lawyers or or make believe they're lawyers and understand like how we test and how we test is what you determine if something's a security so it's an investment of money with the expectation of profit in a common Enterprise with with the work of others and the way that like nfts get around it is it's there's no expectation of profit because there's art that's why a Warhol is in a security and that's the the reasoning behind why an nft is in the security whether you want to believe that or not and whether the courts believe that or not I guess we'll find out over the next few years but that's the reasoning obviously this is free but you can still make an argument that caused gas so there is an investment of money but the work of others is usually because like okay I you know you know Yuga made board Apes right and I just bought the board ape I didn't do any work to I just bought it that was it so I don't I can't get any if I sell mine I get whatever money I sold it for but I can't get royalties on future sales but because you're building this Avatar uh every time that you um every time that let's say you you the opp you make it you sell it for 0.3 right and then you so you get the initial amount of money but then the next person sells it for one eighth and the person after that sells for two Ethan on and on and on uh we built it so that you can take three percent on every single transaction going forward so the these initial mentors of Opp are basically getting a royal a residual royalty on any future sales of that nft which I think is a really interesting model especially if you start to introduce the ability for people to participate in the art Creation with you and actually that's something that uh Tyler Hobbs I think Tyler Hobbs did yeah yeah qql um yeah we did three percent well he did he did he did royalty ongoing royalties for the individual who mince it not the mint pass but when you go use them in possible for your art yeah yeah that's really interesting so I think I was gonna I actually didn't realize he did that I was going to draw the comparison to like generative artwork like that but yeah so it's it's but so you're actually making the art so I'm pretty excited about it we're gonna um we we told we posted in the Discord um that we're we're not We're not gonna be like surprised it's live we're gonna we're almost done there's like a few little things we have to do but it could be as soon as tomorrow but most likely it's sometime over the weekend Saturday Sunday um but we'll give people like 24 hours being like it's live and then the last thing I want to say is the breakdown is everyone who owns an Illuminati nft it's a free mint there's 8 128 of them then we have something called the 187 so there's 187 uh of those uh that are like there's a free claim it's one to one so if you own 50 illuminatis you get 50 Opps um and then uh and it's funny like internally like OPP because everything in Goblin Town is like PP it's like in our Discord it's like oh p-e-e-p-e-e um but then um obviously because we're child children um and then uh and then so we put a thousand aside uh for uh Goblin Town so it's going to be uh a thousand out of the ten thousand owners are gonna are gonna get one it's basically there's a 10 chance and the reason why it's only a smaller percent is this was built by the the Dow for the Dow and the Dow holders and things like that but we voted as a dow to basically take a thousand of them raffle them off to goblins just like goblins get raffled off to Illuminati holders and then the final I think seven 600 something or 700 something there's going to be a premen so the way that we're thinking about it right now is it's gonna go live sometime in the next few days we'll give everyone a heads up you know a good 24 hours before when that happens there's going to be a prement that anyone can go and and and um you know apply for it'll be random and you know you'll have to like maybe follow a Twitter account or something but you'll be able to um apply for that there'll only be like six six seven hundred of those um there'll be 30 days for people to claim from Illuminati and then that premium is going to go for a week and then when that's over the goblin raffle will happen so meaning Goblin people could still go into the pre-mint just and you know double their chances or maybe not double their chances but help their chances by a nice little percentage um and I'm pretty excited it's all free and you know the idea is that you know people could you know if this I think historical nfts are interesting I think I think there's a few things that are going to happen I think some people are going to love it some people are going to hate it I think you know crypto punks holders they may be like what's this crypto books wasn't meant to be a um a pfp like there wasn't it wasn't like it wasn't called an avatar it was Art and collectible you know what I mean it was like it was a little even political it was like more like rebellious this was legitimately in the contract meant to be an avatar project um you know talking about things like gravatar when the person talks publicly about it so I think it'll be really interesting um but I think like love it or hate it I think I think it'll be an interesting sort of topic of conversation once it comes out and um you know especially with what we're doing with the orig you know basically the original you know registering the unique hash to the original smart contract and producing the nft with the metadata in the new con I think it'll be an interesting thing and that's what we're trying to do interesting stuff you also mentioned I believe it predates curio cards by like a couple of days a few days I'm trying not to give like dates and things specific things but yeah it's like um it's right around ens uh came out so it's like it's it's really early um and listen we're not we're not making claims that like it is a hundred percent the first ever Avatar you know project ever because you know something might come out that someone finds and it's like oh no that was even before that there was an attempt so even in the blog post and we're gonna put out a medium post that just explains everything how we learned about it what it is the historical relevance what we're doing about it um we're calling it like the resume direction there's actually something in our original roadmap for Illuminati called the resurrection so we're like all right this fits um and uh we're saying this is the one of the first attempts of on-chain profile pick identity on the ethereum blockchain we're not we're not going to make a bold claim that will like poorly age that this is 100 the first attempt so in some there was this Avatar Creator that came out of a hackathon back whenever early 2017. arguably as of right now to the best of your knowledge right the first like art project effectively or like a project of its kind on the blockchain certainly the first time I would say did you know of any that came before it if I look at the thing I know that there's a few art there's a few um like uh ethereum projects that predate punks that are okay are are but they just aren't like profile photos you know what I mean like that's the whole thing here is like identity Avatar profile photo um you know everyone looks at crypto pumps as being the first and um it was a it was a hackathon project that somebody put together and um so and the mechanism was such that like once you minted your avatar that you created to the blockchain you couldn't transfer it so it hasn't really gotten traction as people can't buy them some of the historical people I've spoken to a handful of them they know about it and they just didn't think there was much to do with it with the non-transfer because there's no secondary Market you could have there which is why we came up with some of this Innovation around it and we'll see you came up with this Innovation to kind of tie any new Avatar where you're kind of replicating the original code with the exception of like don't put in your seed phrase and some of those things um but you have this time to the original to the original contract to to give it that tie the historical narrative into the historical piece of it all well you're getting something historical in your wallet so the person who mints it gets the historical thing in their wallet and then the royalty aspect of it is your your licensing your nft so you're licensing the original hash to people so meaning listen you could it's not in your wallet but like if you license something to somebody like they effectively own it so that's the idea around it is like the original Mentor holds it and by you know taking the the royalty they're licensing that uh historically significant thing to anyone who future buys it okay is it legally licensing or is it legally transferring ownership and you're taking a percentage because you were the original Creator just like an original artist would like it like because I think there is a distinction an important distinction between like what rights do later holders have I could look at the specifics of the actual licensing agreement I don't know that the the distinction between licensing that you could do with it I mean I don't know that we're putting any rights on it there it's an avatar uh uh Builder that like it's like we could have came and put our own art on it but then like you're sort of moving away from what the initial thing was like this person put like use this thing called SVG avatars it you know a lot of people wanted us to put like graze art on it and we're like yeah it could look cool but like at the end of the day like it's not really the historical thing we're trying to build like we're also trying to keep the website really simple and how it was originally intended uh besides adding some like FAQs and you know some some openc stuff like we're trying to keep it uh as as pure to the the original attempt as possible yeah yeah you've kind of the funny things like I think you know maybe it's just came out with its new license contract whatever it was a month ago or something and it's like exclusive license not exclusive license but like you know yoga Labs is sort of the original Creator can take royalties and then they issue a non-exclusive license to you if you buy one for an exclusive license to you if you buy one I think that's what it is um with a couple carve outs in the case of units but anyway I mean not that not the point you're trying to get out with this one all those licensing things that's a whole other like cc0 versus IP rights we could be here for ever those IP those actual licenses for like boarded oh so I own a I do a bunch of other stuff they're not real because and they're not real because you can't really do anything about it and the fact that like Moon Birds revoked it and made it to zero it like proves that you basically can't do anything about it so like if someone goes and takes your your ape and they go do something and they do something that you don't like you can't really sue them you have to get you good to go straight don't actually agree with that we did a you should listen to the uh the panel we did with a bunch of Ip lawyers you look it's not like there's no there's nothing cut and dry here but there's actually prob there probably is recourse if you're an individual holder if you file for your copyright basically the license is really you just saying we're not going to see you could do anything it's funny you know when we do our next merch drop one of our big holders uh is a guy named Khan King everyone loves him he's funny he's on Twitter he wants to make a bunch of um take a bunch of eight faces and make like inappropriate sex toys and and see if they'll come after him just because like to like basically put it to the courts see if like yeah you know we sell inappropriate items and anyone does anything or you can't even sue me about it yeah I don't know I I would fall in the I would fall on the camp of they probably can having the lawyers I've talked to know again nothing's cut and dry but if you file a copyright for your ape because to sue anybody over copyright infringement you have to file to get the copyright right so so how did movements take it back how did they go and say you guys don't have the rights anymore and now everyone has the rights because Moon verbs never gave you an exclusive license right like moonbird's license always was you have the right to use this but we also have rights over it if you're the original copyright Creator you can give rights away and still retain rights so Moon Birds specifically like proof in the beginning that was sort of what their Arrangement looked like was like you guys have rights but we retained rights too which is why they were allowed to then like change up all of them so you're saying board Apes cannot at this point change anything that they've done okay let me think about this you go live by the way I'm sorry we could also yeah we could offline about it no no I I I'm so fascinated by this because this like you know I had a whole conversation about Hugo Labs specifically where I landed with the the lawyers that we talk to was that yoga labs my understanding would be they probably could change it all to cc0 at this point I believe their terms allow them to change whatever they want so when I talk I asked explicitly like could you go Labs suit Ryder rips as the example right writer rips is using all of that Yuga is going after him for trademark infringement because they probably have a fairly open and cut shot case around trademark infringement the question is can you also go after him for copyright infringement so I put this specifically to a panel of lawyers the consensus there was Yuga Labs could probably Sue Ryder for copyright infringement they're choosing not to because it's just an easier case for them to win trademark infringement um and the individual holders who own who hold the copyright for the individual Apes could also probably or could could certainly go after him for copyright infringement once people kind of file for that copyright registration so I believe that that's the case if Yuga is supporting them I believe if Yuga does not support them yes and I have it on good authority yeah which means that you don't really have anything as a person meaning Yuga is not going to sue you for making a business what I can promise you if like Isis bought an ape and made their face you know uh the face of Isis at board eight like Yuga would probably and maybe that that's a bad example because yuga's not gonna like you know there's nothing that they could really like they're killing people like why would they care about like law but what I'm saying is if ice is a bad example I keep using it but it's a really bad example maybe like somebody like they just didn't like that does care about law um they could uh you know they may be motivated to but I think small level stuff it'll be really hard for for people to prove I don't know this is this is a this is a fun debate it feels like this is a debate that happens on Twitter between non-lawyers I think it is yeah yeah well this is but I and you know I wish we had the lawyers on this call to do it because I spent so much time trying to like get it kind of clear on my head and I I you go we you'd want you go to be supportive of your lawsuit as an individual only because the original licensing agreement that Yuga put out was very sloppy right so like have the re have Yuga kind of verbally reinforce yes we meant that you as an individual Holder have rights not because you didn't get you see what I'm saying like Yuga could very much give rights to their holders the holders very much could sue file to get copyright registration sue somebody for misuse of it but their original license was just kind of shitty because it was so early force that you have that right I think there's gonna be a bunch of cases over the next two years so we'll it is it is not cut and dry I agree it you know a court has to actually make a decision and and then we'll see this stuff but yeah I think if I I think um I tend to be I fall on the camp without like individual holders do own enough of the uh rights that they could sue um well obviously anybody can sue the question is can they win and I think anyone can sue for anything in America well sorry to derail that I do this is a topic that I think is is fascinating no it's it is so cool so and and so earliest known that you know of again we're not making any broad sweeping claims because this space is fraught with too many broadsuping claims Avatar project if you are a goblin holder you can enter the raffle to Mint one of the 8 000 X numbers that will uh will come to be um it's ten thousand it's eight thousand oh it's ten thousand eight thousands ten thousand and then a thousand and then there's like 600 something for the uh the premium and if you Mint one of these you get you get three percent ongoing royalties on that specific secondary for that specific right of course for that specifically look whatever you want yeah you can make it look like a celebrity can make it look like whatever you want um you know and we're recording this on Thursday September 29th this will probably go live probably Saturday or Sunday potentially Friday Saturday Friday Saturday Sunday we're at the end of it um you know we don't want to put a specific date on it yet or a time until we're feel 100 comfortable there's no reason to rush it we've been building it for the last few months like uh why I know people are like oh you you you're gonna you're supposed to do it on this day and then it's like three days later and then they're like you don't know what you're doing and it's like no you don't want to put it out wrong and then I have to live with the mistakes of that you know so we're gonna but we'll give people a 24-hour heads up that it's like hey it's ready you'll you'll be able to start what Twitter account so people people will be listening to this starting Friday morning what Twitter accounts they go check and be monitoring to see when it uh when it comes out yeah I mean you could look at mine I'm at ajt on Twitter or you could look at at Truth uh on Twitter um that's the truth Labs uh handle wow truth Labs got at truth so I've been sitting on ad Truth for almost 10 years now hot damn yeah have you been offered money for it before so it hasn't really it has a really interesting story so I I don't think I've ever told it publicly so this is the exclusive how I am um a friend of mine was leaving Twitter and she had the ability to change handles so she's like this is when you could still do that back in the day like you can't really do that anymore um or you can but it's it's harder it depends on who you know but this was a time when like a bunch of people had access so the way you get an active Twitter account is they haven't tweeted in a certain amount of time and they haven't either they haven't like logged in in a while so she's like send me a list of all the handles that you'd want if they're available and you have to make an account to switch it into so I basically made like 10 accounts right like whatever accounts and I gave a bunch of handles and I ended up getting a lot of good ones uh one of them was truth and then I sat on it for a while and then and then I uh CNN in New York Times I spoke to a few times about like um this was like early Trump days where they're like you know uh maybe we do a um uh like a show about Truth The New York Times had a whole like truth campaign about like the concept of Truth um that's funny well well what ended up happening was I I they didn't pitch me anything interesting so I was like no I'm not I wasn't even like really looking for money I was just looking for something interesting and then my buddy started doing social for Biden during the during the election campaign and I was like hey if you want this account for like the debates or something I'm happy to give it to you and so he they took it and they used it if you go search at Truth uh you know by then you'll see they use the truth handle during the debates to like do like fact checking stuff and then they built it up to like 100 200 I think like 300 000 followers or something like that 200 300 000 followers I was like yes I'm getting in this account back and I was gonna get the account back before when after the election um and then they wiped it right before they gave it to me um and I was like that wasn't part of the deal I mean there was no real deal but I just thought I was gonna get this like souped up you know account um so anyway there's no such thing as a free lunch it's a lesson yeah one and I feel I I understand yeah but I was like yeah second account I even lost the followers I had I had like a few thousand followers oh that's brutal that is brutal no I I mean like look you you know how the people will scrutinize public figures for anything so I'm sure like had you gotten it back you know like it was just a risk to Biden if they're like you know he literally had like every politician following it every media person following it so it was it was rough but um yeah oh sorry man you're living your life it's so cool you got it still cool you got it yeah so awesome that's the true story of Truth the handle the the true story of truth thank you so much Alex uh I really appreciate you coming on congrats on all the
