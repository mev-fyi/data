foreign I got one last Alpha leak for you one last interview from Dev constix that'll conclude the Devcon 6 experience I hope you've enjoyed these interviews thus far I hope it's made you feel like you were on the ground at Devcon sticks itself and you didn't miss a beat there was so many more talks so many more things to explore they're all in the newsletter on Bank list about the Devcon sticks experience this last one is about push protocol which is also a sponsor of bankless so there's a disclaimer this is talking with the co-founder of push push who has been with push since day one they've recently rebranded two push from epns ethereum post notification service now just called push much better name if push of course pushes notifications to you about what's going on in web 3 about what's going on in the metaverse into your phone just like all your other notifications and so there's probably a link in the show notes for you to get started if that intrigues you but to learn more just go ahead and listen to this conversation with harsh from push right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible trufi is leading defy into the future of on-chain uncollateralized loans opening up D5 to the 8 trillion dollar Global Credit Market whether you want higher yields on your lending or you're a fund manager who just wants access to global liquidity and the cost Savings of Defy trufi is here for you but if you're going to use trufi use it through the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet view your nfts and keep up to date with your web 3 communities another thing you can use through Brave is of course Arbitron and you all of course have heard about Arbitron but the arbitrim ecosystem is really heating up with a recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrum has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with a recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrum Nitro shipped to last month and has made arbitrum faster and cheaper than ever before but make sure that you can experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking fuel Network free from evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security also pushing the frontier of web3 development is the sequence wallet from Horizon sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for users sequence is a smart wallet and perhaps the most intuitive wallet in all of web 3 but for developers it's a plug and play platform for all web 3 apps and games check out sequence which is already powering some of the best web 3 games out there and lastly diesel is a decentralized social platform built from the ground up to disrupt the social media industry disrupting social media takes a lot of data and dieso's infinite State applications can finally store an index large amounts of content and data fully on chain with multiple crypto native monetization mechanisms for both developers and creators diesel wants to usher in a new relationship with our social application check them out at diesel.com and now on to the show and we are back at Dev concerts in Bogota and now I'm speaking with harsh from what was formerly called East but now called plush better harsh welcome to bankness time to thanks for having me and yeah now we have which protocol uh epns was when we started uh during the 2020 but now we are doing so much more and so it was better to call ourselves first besides that some people pointed out like Indians sounds a little different in someone yes so first maybe a better way back and first of course actually relates to the product that you are building but for the bank was listeners and the people out there that don't know what push is give us a download let's push got it so bushes basically the communication cycle Factory uh what we started building was uh first push notifications for battery so if you're just also like when even when we are talking on WhatsApp we are not really talking on WhatsApp as much as we are talking buyer notification on WhatsApp and when we get up in the morning we probably looked at our phone and we have all the notifications from email to banking alerts to PayPal when you want to any social link we are doing to any gaming that we're doing and so on that was all available is driven by notifications right uh but when you when you came to grab three uh this driven by notification was absent uh there was no way for you to identify uh or for you to communicate with the three wallet address which is your username and website and that was the Genesis of bush uh which basically meant that it's a decent price communication protocol using bills in e-dub and smart contact and backend they can send Communications including notifications and now chat as well which are now directly tied to of all the titles uh this is done through our open network like ethereum uh let's make sure that uh wallet can just tap into a usable at Android and then show them the communication out uh it's multisaneous platform agnostic as well and things that it solves now is like for example D5 so whenever you're doing liquidates before you alone can liquidate now protocols can send alerts directly targeted to the wallet address and say hey your loan might be liquidated or on chain governance or of chain governance uh so whenever the governance proposal comes now people can be notified or the wallet address can be notified so they can go out and vote metaphors like it solves the problem of communication and everything it solves a problem or free targeting or even bidding like if you are waiting for an airplane or you want to negotiate so that was push notifications was all about and hence ethereum question multiplication service because we uh we Now launch some polygon and we are entering a web 3 Journey that ethereum thing then made sense because we are evolving uh to even other non-ethylene fields as well so we drop the ethereum known then the service didn't make sense because this is a protocol like a block both push notification and the push chart that we launched so we had to drop the service out that the push notification is not the only thing we are going uh therefore we had to drop the notification out so yeah just to make push and that's what we have I love the story I love the story that's great and just to re-articulate the thesis as to the the model here is that most of the activity when we're looking at our devices are notifications yes uh but ethereum doesn't have a way of communicating to us on our devices this just doesn't really work yes and so the idea is like when uh your SMS text messages your Instagram your emails all show up as a push notification which is a web 2 thing currently uh and the idea here is that if we want all of these events on ethereum all the transaction is is an event anyways uh all these events on ethereum to look and behave the way that they that we're are already used to our notifications looking and behaving we need them to show up next to our SNS text messages or our Instagram messages or whatever exactly exactly so that's that's it you know like for us to get one billion developers the seamlessness of bedroom whether you uh ux software will be super ported well actually so the three usernames are wallet app it's like Twitter username are you a username WhatsApp username is your mobile phone and they have notifications because you know they had that introverted but for their three usernames which are wallet address this Central was not better and therefore post notifications make a lot of sense there was of course a higher underlying like once you build push notifications out now you can build the next WhatsApp out or Discord out so that's why we launched push chat as well during Defcon uh the idea being now when you are talking to a wallet you have notifications just like you have notifications for your WhatsApp or Twitter or telegram so now you can go back and talk to each other so that's how we are trying to place a gap of ux for web 2 and battery because what we feel is like communication is the soul wave by which you can get adoption going uh of course we are not only on a team like uh we launched on Pokemon as well and we are going to launch on several other endos as well uh even the uh I'll do that is selling series Block series that's an inside joke for optimism by the way yeah and then we are going to go beyond ethereum as well so we are going to launch on that's a Solana more uh big boy the idea being that other user can communicate seamlessly uh through anything uh to a new protocol uh or training Service uh using the wallet that they have they don't have to move anywhere else and a big focus on many of the core ethereum people vitalik mainly in them and many others like him focused on the non-financial use cases of the blockchain which we don't really have too much access to on the ethereum layer one because of high gas fees the only thing that you can really do in an era of high gas is financial stuff but uh push fits into the financial stuff just to notify you of defy events but I'm assuming that's a very small total overall market for what could be notifications on ethereum I think as we get to uh the the layer two it's super cheap gas fees and of course uh here at Defcon we've seen three announcements from the ZK Roll-Ups ecosystem about what test Nets or on the layer 2 or layer three so there's there's this era of low fee things coming to ethereum and all of a sudden I would expect that the surface area for notifications coming out of push would also be increasingly large is this something that you guys are thinking about ahead with all of these growth and adoptions of a very low of the blockchains and all the potential notifications that we might need are the results of this like what are you thinking about this uh yes exactly so we just reach in Vietnam so uh the integration but then it's uh because you know social network is going to come unboxing uh and in Social Network cannot survive in the double communication and recover modifications and that's that's the thing like that's how far we are thinking like metaverse we are talking of metabolism so we need to have a private school it's getting a they can chat they can give you a call they can do notifications and that's what we are thinking so you're exactly like right like even the transactions like when we used to send ourselves ethereum we weren't able to be notified so we had to see the wallet and at times someone would have sent us something unfortunate times it would have someone would have happened would have gone but we never were notified of it so that that that was one basic geography that works all and then the gaps and uh the social acts and the letter words and then empty game and uh of course all of these they require notifications all of these they require communication so yeah that's that's where we are headed like the vision is we're actually made up communication there uh just like how Apple has the uh communication there that's what it says for the achievements yeah I think you can totally just imagine D5 events they're not supposed to have you don't want a push notification by the D5 event usually probably not um but when we get into the world of the metaverse and like web3 gaming that's different kind of events that's like social events that's like cultural events that's things that are happening in a game that you might be interested in the landscape I'm sure just opens up uh far broadly to all of these different use cases that we know are on the horizon there's not here yet uh and so I want to ask you how does this change what a wallet is uh previously people think a wallet is like where you can store all of your ether and your tokens and your nfts but now with something like push it changes it a little bit like how does it change when a wallet is yes so for first of all I mean for D5 also like notifications are very important uh not when your loan is liquidated that's just sad but before your loan is liquidated now you can read modified so if you're working with the IDS to ensure that notifications now so D5 also plays a very huge huge product market rate uh coming back to wallets so yeah if you just think about it like we don't have apps like in webto so uh like for example we log into Facebook where we log into Twitter and they control all our data and they send us notifications and everything because it is a single user input it's open but when you come to Pepsi this is your shared username you use the same wallet or uniswab save wallet on lens and same wallet on anything that you do even decentral ad or open C it's the same wallet and therefore this wallet now become so identity uh not crypto wallets front end but the wallet that you own that becomes your identity it becomes a wave it becomes a username of sorts which has everything it does to it like communication uh your reputation uh the way you have interacted in the past all of it is actually attached to your wallet and I think that's where we are headed uh identity repetition privacy and communication so so I I don't think that's that's where we are going like one very funny thing I eat a non-shelling point like we were amazing push chat uh and that was inspired by optimism presentation so I just went on cpt3 and I just asked like what are the next steps for uh blockchain or where Vlogs in this headed so uh and I let and legit telling you this like they said that the three main key points which they see in boxing are metaphors uh communication and uh even machine learning and making sure that that machine learning can somehow uh derive your identity that you already have uh without linking it to your real identity so I'm glad that the the things that we are solving turnover problems of the future sure sure and so what actually is push though is it an app on your phone like how does one interface with it got it so push is a protocol uh in essence it's a Lego building block okay for other tabs or other protocols or other smart contracts who want to you know apply their users so just like how Apple provided this modification platform and WhatsApp provided is chatblog.com uh wherein other services can come and utilize it which basically puts that gap for battery and then the user also has to like sign up for to receive the notifications right yes yes so the user sends uh or option uh to see notifications from a protocol that can be done from their front end or they can come to a discovered app messages to a opt-in uh it's a gasless process uh so users they don't have paying any gas speed whatever again Network model so where do users actually go get their notifications like how does it show up on my phone got it so because this is an open network any crypto wall you can just go ahead and integrate it so if you are not an app you are a service that any IOS app that's a wallet could hook into yes we are basically a protocol uh we do provide like our mobile app or Chrome extension that's built on our protocol but that can be done by any interpreter wallet uh we did announce our course so integration even Bollywood so whatever it will be basically interfacing with push protocol and showing all those notifications out and we are talking to several other models because now I think we need to start that uh with the wall and uh integration what uh notifications do you get oh yeah so my favorite one is actually uh from wine desk uh we yeah also a non-spartners so you get notifications of this uh then ens like uh I don't want to close by in the story so now whenever the domain expires uh now there's a notification which uh now helps me a lot it actually helped me because my DNS was expired uh then uh then yeah I'm doing ens uh I do use uh something called gas tracker but I think now the utility is going down for that channel because gas is are kind of now optimized or not that high uh so yeah those those three are my go-to channels I usually just open to all the channels that are getting made yeah it's also one of my favorite one because uh I do have a healthy food so whenever the fee falls out of frames I'm getting notified so that's also good as well right right and just unpack that a little bit you know swap V3 you can have concentrated liquidity and push can tell you when the price the unit circle has gone in or out of that that liquidity pool to tell you you're making money or you're not making money yes yes because the app defines what notification they want to send but yeah and so this is like a developer platform so anyone can come and customize their own kind of NF uh push notifications right they can just you know create build build uh build a notification service yes yes they can do it either directly from their smart contract but from back end like uh what nothing has come to mind is that we know that these web 2 apps like compete for our attention with push notifications and so now we've actually given our web3 apps that same that same competitive advantage of like hey pay attention to me like something's happening exactly and so like now we can direct some of our attention from web 2 and web3 a little bit more uh organically For Better Or risk to engage into the attention economy exactly exactly so the way we do it like that's why we built the opt-in because we don't own multiplication notifications are very useful depending and his family as well so that's why we said that a wallet address has to clap on opt-in uh before getting those notifications otherwise it just lands on your spam box underlying the Twitter well congratulations probably brand I'm excited to see all of these notifications coming out into the world above three if you're appreciate it [Music]
