[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david ryan selcus on the podcast we cover two things first everything that's going on in the government regulation nation state versus crypto and second we got to ask him once again what his thoughts on ether has that changed since the last time we spoke last time we debated it last time we argued it really interesting discussion here i really think ryan could be positioned to become one of our industries leaders here he already is at missouri but now that this um political conversation has really blossomed uh ryan really seems to be positioned to take a even more leadership position kind of helping the crypto industry navigate uh a part of the world that everyone really gets frustrated about and no one really wants to have to partake in yet you're kind of damned if you don't and ryan seems to be having just a fireball of energy behind him with regards to how to approach crypto regulation to get what we want and rather than acting uh defensively which is like anytime some sort of bad regulation comes up crypto like rises to the challenge to defend us ryan is thinking offensively which is how do we attack these issues and uh instantiate crypto in the parts of the world that we want to instantiate them in before bad regulation even comes about i think that's a fantastic strategy and i really enjoyed that part of the conversation and then like you said ryan in the second half of the show we turned to a rehashing of a debate that we had last time ryan came on the show about ether as an asset whether institutions are going to be interested in it and where it fits in his personal opinion in his a portfolio uh and there was definitely some concessions uh from versus last time that he came onto the show not as many as i would have hoped but i think if we just keep on revisiting this conversation with ryan over and over it's simply going to be a death by a thousand concessions yeah there's definitely room for for growth there you know at the same time like the last conversation we had it was literally a debate on whether his money or not what we meant by that was is it a reserve asset worthy of monetary premium is it going to like do well in the future and uh well listeners will have to tune into that section to hear what ryan has to say um we'll leave it there before we get into the conversation we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d-apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbor trump comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrary and join their discord bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest he's been on the show before this is ryan selgus he's the founder of crypto analytics firm missouri crypto he's a long time crypto advocate he's been a content producer in crypto for quite a long time and more recently he's become a single issue voter we're going to talk about what that means too ryan great to have you back welcome to bankless thank you for having me i'm surprised that uh you wanted me to come back and slap you around a little bit more oh man well you are alluding to the second topic we're going to cover which is uh eth and whether your thoughts on eath have changed we had a debate the last time you were on on whether eath is money or not i want to get to that but first man i got to tell you if it feels like you've been on a street lately or something missouri just raised 21 million from some massive names 0.72 bill that's billionaire steve cohen that's his firm you've been spitting fire about unelected bureaucrats in government i feel like rallying the crypto industry uh about what's going on in the infrastructure bill and in getting the industry involved in in politics how's it feel man how's it feel to be ryan selkis these days uh feels pretty similar to how it did two weeks ago uh you know i've lived through a lot of chaos in the last eight years in crypto uh you know that's that's a lot of dog years so um i think uh generally pretty pretty steady you know social media um can um can be read a bunch of different ways uh and i know when to dial down and and up intensity i think uh depending on on what's going on um but it doesn't really change my day-to-day um so i think the the first thing that is really important about the last couple weeks is what happened in the way that it happened with the infrastructure bill in this last minute provision that was inserted and then the bipartisan efforts to amend this particular provision of the bill and then the last minute stonewalling everything about the process cover to cover was essentially a hundred percent of what everybody hates about the us government and government and today's decaying institutions in general so this was not a very like risky position to go out on a limb but it was an opportunity i think to help shake people awake and and kind of catalyze people and and and get them riled up in the aria manual never let a crisis go to waste camp right so um i i do think that this is a crisis um for crypto i don't think that it's going to shut the industry down i don't think that it's something that's going to necessarily us but it's definitely a move in a very negative direction that we're going to need to work hard to overcome so it is a crisis and i think to the extent that people are finally starting to take political effort seriously and ongoing engagement down to dc seriously that's important now when i say engagement that's a loaded word and a lot of my frustration and i think the unique voice that i have on this particular issue is i'm sick of the as is everybody else but most people can't actually say that quiet part out loud because they're running regulated businesses within crypto okay they're running an exchange a custodian they um they have a token um they're they're investing other people's money right so so there's a a lot of things that i think are pretty unique about me um just from where i sit in the industry a running an information business and b not necessarily touching other people's money or processing crypto transactions so you can be a little bit more vocal about some of this um the other thing that's important is uh this is a very bipartisan response right now um i think if you look back to the early crypto days it's a lot of libertarians it's a lot of like you know crypto anarchists and small government maximalists more than anything else but more recently crypto ethereum all the new application builders there there are a lot of progressives um or classical liberals i guess uh that have entered the frame more recently and uh it's not that they don't care about progressive issues um they do they just also happen to be very passionate about tech's ability to kind of advance humanity and and be a part of the solution um particularly when you juxtapose with government and and some of these like legacy like monolithic institutions so i think um both from like right and left um the thing that has changed in the last couple of weeks is people are really fired up there's an opportunity to get engaged uh down in in dc and enforce the issue um because this is going to be very politically expensive for representatives on both sides if they end up on the wrong side of it and i think the the big um unique uh tone or uh or niche that i think i i tapped into is the fact that engagement no longer needs to just mean education advocacy kissing ass essentially there is i think an opening to play a little bit of offense now and i think everybody right now is scrambling to figure out how do we do this productively because yes most of this is still a an education problem and the episode that you guys just did with jake was perfect right like i agree with him like anything that can be ascribed to incompetence versus you know malice yeah generally it's it's incompetence and it's historically just been that they're not paying attention and they don't understand how this tech works but i don't think that's um i don't think that's really an option any longer um for elected representatives to not pay attention because crypt is the fastest growing sector of american tech i think it's important for us from the geopolitical perspective particularly when we compare ourselves to china and our future competitiveness and it's basically the only technology that is doing anything to preserve civil liberties in this country and defend against the overreach of the ubiquitous surveillance state you look at apple's announcement um from last week that was buried or a couple weeks ago those buried on a friday that they're they're essentially going to incorporate back doors into their products um you think about basically what treasury's trying to do with this bill in making sure that all of d5 is surveilled and you know at some point we need to push back against the illegalization of all private transactions and play a little bit of offense um and i think riling up the base um organizing at more of a grassroots level and uh and yes ultimately primary and unseating elected representatives that are openly hostile versus just ignorant about crypto is going to be a good strategy the difference between this year and years past is we have a lot of money to actually put this in action um and i think it has to be done now because the market has been going up and if you're going to play offense play offense in a bull market when there's as much distress as the current currently is in in institutions um don't do it after a 50 60 70 drawdown when they can just slap us around on consumer protection on fraud on everything under the sun um that you know is coming the next time the market takes a dip i love i love your voice in the space and and for the listeners i think we're going to divide this conversation like two parts the first is we got to talk about regulatory nation state versus crypto and the second part is uh i want to hear an update on your opinions on eth as an asset ryan but like let's stay with this theme of of playing offense crypto uh versus nation state um this is for bankless listeners this is kind of a taste of uh that the fire that ryan's been spitting lately on crypto and i think this really resonated there's a lot of likes on this tweet but it's basically the message i'm sick of feeling like we have to apologize for all our early stage and walk on eggshells around politicians and regulators this is ryan say tweeting this out we built a two trillion dollar financial market from scratch in less than a decade with absolutely no institutional help and active encumbrances from government meanwhile the banks give you 0.025 percent interest on your deposits and front run your trades legally and dc grifters overspend and debates your tax dollars well they insider trade stocks with impunity this really captured i think a lot of the the zeitgeist and crypto and that's kind of that playing offense as you said it feels very much uh ryan like uh the politicians are kind of like newly experiencing this force and not sure on what side they're going to fall on right so like it's a bipartisan thing it's not left versus right like almost everything else in our political discourse these days and the politicians haven't yet decided are they going to be crypto friendly like what what's the cohort what what what's the uh the coalition around um crypto that's going to support this or are they going to be anti-crypto and what's the coalition that's going to support that it feels to me like it's all squishy and they haven't figured it out but um can we talk a bit about like i i'm curious it seems in dc that there is a certain contingent we asked jake this question uh as well but like that is against crypto and i want to know why like why do they hate us well because they can't control it um or they can't control it in a way that they would like to which is fully uh i guess for lack of a better term and and you know for for many decades now we've had a two-party system that is really just one big government party with different policy goals um libertarians lose elections because they always say vote for me i'll do less work um and it's probably what we need but it's not a very good message because people want to know i'm going to vote for someone powerful they're going to advance my agenda they're going to advance my interest well i'm going to get you know this this and this from from this political leader when really what we need is is just you know a greater degree of of decentralization um and i think that's where crypto's been pretty powerful um if you think about crypto basically being like an opt-out political movement in many respects it's a way to play that thesis proactively um and what i've uh compared it to it you know you think about like gold bugs versus people that are building in crypto gold bugs are waiting for the end of the world living in a cabin in the woods and digging holes in the ground to put shiny metal like back in from once it came um folks in crypto might have the exact same thesis as those gold bugs but instead of being in a cabin in woods digging a hole in the ground and putting a shiny rock waiting to ride out the apocalypse they're actually on the front lines building things every day and every single day a new problem is created in crypto because of the unintended consequences of what has been built so far and and almost always someone immediately recognizes the problem and starts a business to solve that problem we've seen this for a decade now every single major problem that crypto has uh unleashed onto the worlds the horror has ultimately yielded like a billion dollar business you look at chain analysis it's a five billion dollar business right now they they have have done data forensics to help regulators and law enforcement worldwide actually track money launderers you look at tax bid just a few year old business the narrative is that crypto is full of tax evaders and people that don't want to pay their taxes and this is just a way to kind of cheat the government and your fellow citizens tax bid is a 1.3 billion business did they get there because people are evading their taxes or they're trying desperately to pay them in a manner that doesn't take a week and a half to understand how to comply with impossible tax policy in the u.s or abroad missouri we were created to basically be a first principles edgar repository for disclosures and and other project information solve the investment fraud issue i can tell you right now some of my investors have relationships with ripple one of the first things that i did when we started the company was right a multi-month screed against ripple and how um how horrible uh their investment practices their took and selling practices were for their and investors and how shady the marketing was around it um so yeah there are folks in this in this ecosystem that want to see it survive advance and ultimately become more anti-fragile and get built out in a way that is going to be a force for good in the world [Music] versus just sitting on the sidelines saying everything is going to ship everything is broken there's no way to fix it i'm going to buy gold wait for the dollar to get debased and then come out of my cocoon or my hiding after a decade when the dust has settled um and i think that's pretty powerful because it's techno progressives um and it's you know classical liberals and and it's like all the libertarians molded into one but playing offense instead of just defense and and basically saying you know what we're all screwed i feel like that's particularly true in d5 this whole idea of like we're building a new better financial system that's the goal much more transparent more open right it's like i i'm curious what you think about this it seems like everybody in washington all the time is trying to protect us from crypto it's like this protection atmosphere is is you know what it is it's a it's just a massive projection right yeah it's this is what they this is what they do is it is it code they're corrupted for like control they want to control us is that what produces they're all all of their concerns just project their own corruption right they're they're worried they're worried about um grift whereas the the revolving door in dc is just from a a seat in influence in dc to a lobbying seat or in-house at a big corporation and then back again you know janet yellen made 7.2 million dollars last year during covent when she was giving speeches to financial services companies via zoom 7.2 million dollars her time is not that valuable i refuse to believe that um unless she was ultimately going to become the new treasury secretary which of course happened so that that's money well spence but that's just part of the crypts and this happens at all levels of dc people know that it happens it's you know it's it's it's just assumed that this is kind of the way that this is is done in dc and there's no real way to stop it so if you think about the ethos of dc and the people that are working there and and you know what the revolving door looks like and how people actually make their money then of course they're projecting all the worst things onto tech onto you know crypto finance and and all the entrepreneurs that are working because this is how they would be operating if they're in the private sector it's just in their dna let me add so let's call that out okay so so it's in their dna but let me ask you this question because uh this is actually further an agenda we wanted to get to but let's get to it now um you you also tweeted out recently about crypto that we need to spend money lots of it like crypto should also be playing this games what you're saying and we should also i don't know maybe pay for janet yellen to to come speak to us i don't know is that are are you basically advocating that um crypto play the same game that everybody else plays in dc and have a stake at the table is that something that's important to crypto and is there a is there a moral issue with that i hate it but i think you have to fight fire with fire and i think people are slowly starting to wake up to that and and you know here's the issue crypto can be shut down china just proved that it can be um do i think the u.s moves that quickly do i think it's as dire the political situation and kind of surveillance state in the us is china no um but it's certainly not where it was 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago certainly a couple hundred years ago when the country was formed so we are moving in that direction and i think the the reality is there's a lot of damage that regulators and policy makers can do to crypto via um tax policy and by overextending the patriot act and all the you know associated provisions related to national security that they'll kind of throw at us we saw a sample of this with the treasury's report on privacy uh tokens late last year and if you remember in december january um when uh steve mnuchin on his way out of office was essentially trying to sneak in some of these last minute you know provisions that would make it very difficult to support any privacy tokens this was you know uh is a big part of uh what they had in mind so um anything that they can't can't control um i think is scary to them and so if you uh ultimately want to get elected representatives in office that understand why this is important not just from uh constitutional theory standpoints but from an electoral standpoint uh and and from the perspective of their constituents then that's gonna take active engagement beyond just yelling at people on twitter um you're gonna have to host fundraisers for uh politicians that are gonna be on the right side of the issue that have this as part of their platform that are gonna be going up in primaries against their 70 80 year old counterparts that have been in office since before the internet was created so i think there's no way around that because the alternative is pretty bleak everybody likes to talk a big game that we can just like route around the government and and you know this is permissionless and and so you know even if it is shut down we're we're still going to be able to operate these systems that's all true but it's just gonna it will cover to cover be a black market and there's a sizable contingent of the world that is not going to play ball like americans and europeans are not going to transact in systems that are deemed illegal by their authorities because those are still relatively functioning well-functioning societies that have otherwise you know robust financial services and so you're not talking about situations like argentina and venezuela and sub-saharan africa and high-inflation uh countries in southeast asia people will generally fall in line they'll be a you know some contingent that will not and they'll opt out but it doesn't change the fact that it will be illegal or it will be extremely expensive or cumbersome from cumbersome from the user perspective to actually participate in these in these systems so you know the the folks that um you know uh that are the loudest and and have this battle cry on twitter that like we we you know we need to play a different game or we need to opt out the problem with that is there's no new land in the world there's no place that you can escape to there's no free world to settle like like we had when when america was settled and the country was founded um you can't even escape to the metaverse right like they will literally tax this is what we're talking about they'll tax and surveil everything that you're doing in the metaverse even um and i i know that you were being completely facetious uh david this is you know more proof that i listened to you guys versus just kind of come on every once in a while to harass you but like one of you made the comment in the jake episode about like the irs literally wants to know when your axes are mating and it's not that far from the truth like any activity that you have in the metaverse they're still going to be they're still going to look at like where was your phone locked in to establish a tax nexus which is insane and and so if there's no place to escape to physically um and you're not allowed to do virtual commerce even even if it's completely unplugged and kind of disassociated from the rest of the economy um then you have no other choice to put the kind of uh fight on their home turf and um i think you can do so intelligently so you know i'm not i'm not advocating for like january 6 insurrection like that's that's the the worst type of um uh you know undisciplined theatrical dangerous uh type of of revolt and ultimately is completely counterproductive and it's it's extreme everybody knows that um i'm i'm not even advocating for like online harassment um or you know vitriol it's you know directed or you know female you know senators or congressmen getting misogynistic tweets and threats and and you know all the garbage that you see um what i'm suggesting and advocating for and i think a lot of people agree with even if they're not as forceful about it because it can't be is you know we have to start grading these folks on a one-to-five system and the fives that are allies get a tremendous amount of support an eye-opening amount of support through social channels through grassroots campaign efforts through political donations through super pac contributions the ones have the exact opposite in terms of how well funded their enemies are and their political rivals and then the two through fours is where you can continue to focus on the education and advocacy but the the education and advocacy work of for the two through fours will be infinitely easier if they see what's happening to the ones and fives because on the fives you've got a big carrot and on the ones you've got a big stick and if we can unseat some folks like brad sherman that are in the one camp as established as he is and threaten folks like that or even make their lives very difficult during the midterms um it's going to pay i think extremely lucrative long-term dividends that's to say nothing of the you know the the broader impact that we can have just through social channels because crypto is very very vocal uh and i i think that the challenge there is like different but it's um it's how do you uh contain some of that enthusiasm or kind of channel it proactively so so we don't look like a bunch of nut jobs which may never be solved brian i i think i would think we definitely need to unpack this because i think this is a fascinating point of the conversation that we should really spearhead here um i was going to ask you now that we have this like regulatory drama of the last two weeks in our rear view mirror what have we unlocked but i think you've kind of already answered that question in bits and pieces in the last 10 minutes or so i i think where this is going and what you're talking about when uh we're talking about like uh reviewing public uh our regulators on the merits of whether they support our industry or not i think really what has happened in the last two weeks for this industry is everyone has taken a moment to reflect on what crypto really means to them and ask themselves the question am i a single issue voter when it comes to politics and crypto and i think we we all know that crypto is has so much uh tribalism and like a desire to defend our home turf and so much energy and as we all know so much capital behind it that perhaps the measure of a single issue voter body uh that is that is the of the crypto world might actually be one of the most significant cohorts of a voting body that we've seen arise out of any part of the political sphere that we've seen in america in the last i don't know since since the nra how do you think that the let's go into details onto how you think the crypto voting body can galvanize itself and direct itself to get what it wants in washington dc what are the next steps now that we have identified that we are here in this moment of time how do we actually adequately capture this energy and direct it to get what we want done in dc well i'll answer that question in terms of like what are the methods and and how can we actually make some forward progress there but but first you know it's important to note i i intentionally use the nra as a like a uh a call to action just because it's a good x for y comparison and it's provocative so it kind of hits all the twitter checkboxes but there couldn't be um anything that's further uh from the truth in terms of the the um fundamental issue that i think crypto single-issue voters have with the government right now um you know the nra um you know guns are used in school shootings and mass shootings and and gun violence is a real problem in the country um you know other i won't kind of name drop other organizations but but most of the other organizations where you have single-issue voters the um the issues that they're talking about are extremely contentious there's often like an element of violence um or like national security implications that kind of rallied people up and in in crypto the issue is there's no opposition like there are very few intelligent opposition leaders to crypto it's basically proponents and then people that don't understand it that's an extremely powerful position to be in because like i said it's not just about like right-wing or libertarian or progressive um voters that are working in the industry right now and that actually care about building this tech and and preserving its ability to you know get developed um in a way where you can still regulate the the centralized organizations that are you know building broker services um and so i i think that is uh just a a major difference between some of the other lightning rod individual member-led um you know organizations the the card-carrying member organizations for for other lobbying groups now how do you actually win that i think there's probably about a dozen people collectively working in dc right now at the major think tanks and trade associations that everybody knows about crypto 20 tops working on defending this entire ecosystem and that i think has worked in the past because we haven't really been on the radar this is one of the first times that crypto has been a major part of the conversation any legislation that's been passed most of the conversations to date have been regulatory in nature right how's the irs going to treat this for tax purposes what's the sec say about you know whether this is a whether these tokens or securities or what's going to happen with the bitcoin etf um what does treasury you know think about the aml you know kyc requirements for for crypto brokers things like that um how is fincen thinking about this from a kind of monitoring standpoint almost the only bills that have been i think even tangentially is tied to crypto haven't really gone anywhere and uh and so this you know last minute provision it was only included because the politicians thought that was there was some type of money that they could extract from the industry right again follow follow the money and and you'll you'll see where their real interests lie um and so i think now that it's on the radar the the big thing that's changed is is they've we've kind of had pandora's box opened on us where they looked at the 28 billion dollar score from the cbo and their estimate as to what tax receipts could be with tighter enforcements and tighter surveillance of defy in particular and now it's some that's something that can't be undone um nor can the kind of battle that ensued over this because now they know that actually this is a much bigger deal to our con constituents and and this is a pretty fiery community that we didn't really know existed before but the actual people in dc that are fun to do this on a full-time basis that you know there there's there's probably about 20. so the first thing that that needs to happen is um we need to make sure that that queen center the blockchain association some of the other groups that are are popping up have the funding that they need um and we have the right lobbyists infrastructure in place um to do the combination of like education advocacy work um and then you just generally have a better coordinated pr campaign that could be you know funding endowing chairs at uh at think tank so that the the research from the independent heritage foundation or um hutchins or you know brookings wherever that all of these folks in dc actually rely on to support their policy positions um there's a lot that we can kind of do there and coordinate from a policy support standpoint and then most importantly which is what i've been talking about is just getting more involved in electoral politics and having this grassroots effort where you have hundreds of thousands of dues paying members to an individual member dominant organization where you can actually mobilize people in local elections local campaigns you know going to town hall meetings all the blocking and tackling that i think people don't really appreciate until um until you see how much politicians care about not having pains in their ass um just harassing them at all times and and it's one of those situations where the squeaky wheel gets the oil and so combination of money boots on the ground and um and and just potential bad publicity i think is is probably enough to get our ultimate policy goal which is not don't tax us give us favorable treatment do this at the other thing it's don't regulate things that you don't understand and don't penalize crypto unnecessarily particularly versus traditional financial services companies that were talking about or other tech giants that would be subject to the same regulation i could i could definitely say i would be a card-carrying member of the self-sovereign crypto lobby group and maybe they could issue that as an nfc that would be a bit more conducive to uh to to the way i carry things these days but um one thing that that gave me hope you kind of started this episode and uh i completely agree you use this term state surveillance right as like feels like there is an all-out assault on our digital privacy and freedoms it's not just crypto it spans beyond crypto right so like the newest thing with apple releasing a software update to give them the ability to basically scan all of your local photos on any apple device right how dystopian is that and what's weird about this ryan is like there is nobody in our government who is pushing back against these things right maybe they're not incented to push back maybe they don't care but what's given me some hope actually recently is crypto has the and i think we've seen this over the last two weeks has the coordination ability and the capital and just the raw community fervor to push for self-sovereignty and maybe we launched this thing and it's primarily about crypto cryptocurrency but then maybe it expands and we capitalize other areas we care about because like look if i have the right to own cryptocurrency but apple has the ability to like scan my device for whatever it wants like i don't want to live in that world either this is why i've kind of come i don't know i used to be less enthusiastic about engaging you know on the lobby level and in dc and like you know as as the traditional uh organizations have but i think we need to for those for these issues because nobody if crypto doesn't if the crypto industry doesn't who's going to right like big tech isn't going to come to the defense of privacy and self-sovereignty they don't care right so like it's got to be us at some level maybe we start with crypto and expand from there that is a hopeful future what are your thoughts on that um yeah i think that there's multiple ways to do this um but you know generally speaking i think we have the resources right now let's win the battle that's right in front of us and then um we can start talking about how we play with other organizations because i ultimately think this is a team sport and ideally you know we've already seen um allies at the eff that fight for the future at um a number of other organizations and i think uh generally there there's often a lot of overlap that can be done in terms of research in terms of advocacy work and and you know i think across the board um it's uh it it's a starting point to just kind of focus on cleaning our own house and then ultimately being in a position where we can cross pollinate for many other important issues across the board i i i see what you're saying and i think that there's this is like a wedge and that's why i think about it as like a political movement in and of itself because um there's so much that i think is embedded in in in crypto values more broadly that um we haven't really defined as a community because we're we've generally been so focused on like all the differences between the communities versus you know our um uh the the kind of common interests that have been shared historically and and that's by design right like it's a decentralized community it's not a company that can just kind of lay out its all of its core values i'll tell you like just for me personally it's um it's almost been like a little bit liberating because we went we went through this period with trump in office where you could not talk about politics at all like in in like any uh in any context because the the tenor uh was just so um over the top charged and i think um you know before that it it wasn't entirely different but you know before that in in like the 20 2009 to you know 20 15 environments um there was there was a lot of political discussion within crypto because this this movement had political roots and it was it was you know kind of anti-government i guess anti-big government and certainly um to start and then you know trump took office and it's like you you you can't actually talk about anything political because you're like three steps away from from either being referred to as a communist or a nazi and so like nothing good comes of it um and then you know again two weeks ago when we saw the bipartisan effort and you see everyone from like ted cruz on the one hand to a 21 year old brown progressive writing an open letter to elizabeth warren like on literally the same side of the issue i i have trouble thinking of like a starker contrast than those two people articulating the same argument for like why it's important to support crypto long term you know um and it it's kind of like smash the overton window to a certain extent for i think a lot of people that have maybe fallen into the camp of uh what i would think of as like radical centrism um or like you know just like blinders on let's focus on building and not focus on every single debate that has that is basically just like dominated today by the two like five percent extremes of the bell curve with everybody in the middle just getting shut out because you know that they don't want to talk about or or they don't want to incur the wrath of of being on the wrong side of an issue and um i think this the the conversations that i've seen and like the general agreements uh importantly with with yeah i think many of the people in in um in crypto on certain kind of core values has been um it's been illuminating and i think it's also been empowering for people to that kind of feel strongly about the why like we're in this industry aside for just the memes and the money which you know is is a nice byproduct i think that's been a good rally point and you know people have been comfortable getting a little bit more politically engaged hey guys coming up next on the show i asked ryan about his opinion about whether or not we can convince regulators to actually align with defy align with ethereum align with crypto as an attempt to you know increase the brand the strength the value of the us dollar as we all know the united states nation wants a strong dollar and as we all know dollars are a very important part of the dfi economy and therefore perhaps the global economy of the future how can we convince regulators to see this truth and to leverage this fact in the face of the chinese cbdc that's what i asked orionx and then after that we actually turned the conversation towards ether as an asset and his opinions about the institutionalization of ether and putting ether on the balance sheets for larger and larger financial institutions and also his own opinions and his own perspective as to where ether fits in his own personal portfolio and teaser ryan has actually become overweight ether in relation to the last time we had him on the show roughly nine months ago so we go into all those details and more but first before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on ramps you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bank list and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ryan one possible future i see ahead of us is that we actually have an opportunity to convince regulators that aligning with the crypto industry is in their best interests um using the stablecoin side of of defy is a way to export the us dollar and the value of the us dollar and dollar demand globally and it also if we can get regulator support behind this it can be a huge offensive weapon against the chinese cbdc which i think if you're paying attention to it is a we all people who do pay attention to it generally agree that it's a massive threat to dollar dominance meanwhile we have u.s regulators having these uh banking panels or seminars asking what is crypto even useful for just really broadcasting their complete naivety about what this what is so cool about this industry so there's there's a future world where we can actually convince u.s regulators that instead of being overbearing and over uh regulating this industry that we can actually get them to use this industry as a weapon against the chinese cbdc are you optimistic that we can actually make this happen and if we can make this happen do you have any thoughts about the the right path to get there well i think that argument it it works because it's truthful right if you just look at how quickly the us can move at a kind of centralized government level on certain issues um it's just it's not very fast uh by any stretch of the imagination like that and that's actually the one thing that's been like very positive for folks within crypto um in uh in the american and european scenes if if our governments were as functional as china is i'm not saying that we want to live there but if we're as functional as the ccp is and just making unilateral moves then then we could have you know a real problem if there was political opposition what we're doing but um generally speaking because we move slowly things get funded slowly innovation happens slowly and so i um i think there's a credible argument to be made that the installed like tech base um that we have is uh really going to have to be built by private companies and that are facilitating transactions and these open protocols um because a like fed coin is just not like can you just imagine how inferior like fed coin as a product would be if it was rolled out by the big banks um it's just like the the it would definitely stop it it's laughable right like you're just not gonna have anything um near what um what we see in in crypto and and maybe the government would argue that's for the good of uh and for the protection of consumers but i think um you know by and large it's the uh i i i buy that argument i think we should make that argument that um the government should be working proactively with crypto companies and supporting them and yes regulating the centralized businesses that are working on this infrastructure because it is arguably the best way to preserve the dollar strength um over time so say we do go down this path in an attempt to get regulators who really really don't like crypto to be more okay with crypto in an attempt to use crypto to be offensive against the chinese cbdc or other just like um or just the dollar protecting the brand of the dollar uh i'm going to go ahead and guess that if we if this reality plays out the crypto industry is going to have to give some concessions we're going to have to make some compromises with the way that this industry works the first thing my mind goes to is perhaps something like tether but even usdc has a very non-kyc element to it that is probably concerning to a lot of u.s regulators those are the first two concessions that i come to my mind is probably more regulation around stable coins but what olive branches can we give to regulators that doesn't just hamstring what makes defy and crypto so cool do you have any thoughts on that well i i i think more or what are they really going to ask for probably no matter what i i think the the hard line in the sand needs to be that developers and and code needs to be protected um and uh the ability for someone to uh actually receive customer information it needs to be taken in into consideration as to whether um certain regulations should be um put on uh any contributor to an open network right so this is basically like the staking and kind of validator issue on the one hand and then um just the contributors of code on the other so you know i um i think that we um we have to be realistic and i think the industry is realistic about centralized companies centralized exchanges in particular uh being very proactive about working with regulators i think we should expect that there's going to be you know continued oversight and tax reporting requirements and um in general like customer information sharing requirements with the queen bases of the world the gemini's and to be honest i don't even know that any of those organizations are like pushing back on that um i think the uh the big um sticking point um might be around private transactions um and and we already kind of saw hints of that six you know six nine months ago um and uh aside from the private transactions is gonna be defy which is you know just there's a lot of capital gains that are arguably being generated in decentralized exchanges that there's there's no oversight um over and there's no kind of clear tax reporting policy having said that the the data forensics companies exist to get that information so you know again you're coming into this situation where if you are the irs you can make very clear guidance that transactions of such and such in nature are decentralized exchanges are taxable events and you need to you know if you are attempting to launder money uh or or you know evade taxes by you know parking your money and defy that's a really bad way to operate um and uh and ultimately you know you're gonna get caught because there's a digital paper trail and it's it's a it's a terrible way to actually um execute a scheme like that so i think um i i don't i don't think that our expectations or or or what we're arguing for is is unreasonable by any stretch of the imagination and and that's what um makes me so confident that like a grassroots effort like this could actually um work out you know very very effectively because we're on the right side of this and i think the arguments that we have at our side make sense and no one has really pushed back against them other than the very ill-informed takes of well if if this software can exist then it's probably not good for society and and we should shut it down or try to move it offshore yeah we've only heard a few people really say that so yeah i i agree with this like so like i i think there are enough wins for uh for regulators and legislators in the us government here in crypto uh for them to get actually excited about it it's like if they're not going to compete with china's central bank digital currency by rolling their own which they can't we just talked about that there's like i don't think there's an appetite to do that what is their strategy well like it's got to be crypto export us dollars on crypto rails right like ethereum uh what i do worry about the orion is that maybe just in congress and maybe this is a symptom of like where the u.s government is right now is just they're too like old and set in their ways to actually do it you know like they're just too content with the status quo so we just roll around like roll roll on like the us is doing on a number of issues don't make any progress for it we just settled the status quo and doing that is not a sustainable strategy for the u.s so that that is my worry not that there's not enough wins here it's just that they don't care maybe they don't care um but let's talk about something else uh that's sort of related because i know you're very plugged into the institutions and i'm curious what the reaction is from sort of the the big money institutional world to all of this did they freak out that crypto was like it didn't reflect it in the in the market price which was interesting but were they freaking out that crypto is like a a potentially a contentious issue in front of uh congress and that this your treasury is is possibly against it is that a bad signal to them you know i think it's a wake-up call again i think the um the existing regulated businesses and brokers are going to continue to be regulated uh and and they're going to continue to have big compliance teams and legal budgets and and i i think they'll be just fine right um so i i i don't think that there's um i wouldn't say that they're alarmed i i think it's it's less about it's less about being alarmed by like openly hostile actors within the government and more alarmed that this happened on such short notice it was um you know it was extremely fast how it happened was very dysfunctional and so now we're more or less at the mercy of those that are going to be writing the rules at the unelected regulatory body level right so how much authority is treasury going to have uh to write rules how much authority is the sec going to have how much that is where authority is ultimately getting delegated and um that's definitely not a net positive so i think a lot of what's being done right now with respect to you know kind of arguments in the house and and trying to uh meter some of the the native impacts of um of what we already saw past and senate it's really just kind of laying the groundwork and setting the precedent for future court challenges and you know maybe we can get lucky and and there's um improved language that comes out of the house and is ultimately incorporated into any final legislation that passes but um i think right now it's more of a long-term game and i can tell you if they're not alarmed everybody is certainly very mobile right now um at the institutional level and that's you know defy major investors um and then obviously the regulated groups themselves um obviously won't name individual names but i'd say it's pretty universal that people are um fired up and taking this very seriously so as we all know this is probably crypto's biggest regulatory event uh it was we couldn't stop talking about it for two weeks we're still talking about it now and as a community generally everyone kind of feels pretty emboldened after the fact even though technically we kind of lost uh and during the actual um actual debates and the the drama around different amendments uh and everyone was getting scared about crypto being regulated to death crypto asset prices like had a stellar performance uh a week of weekly performance uh like ether went from 20 300 up to 3 000 bitcoin where it was below 40 000 and then zoomed up to 47 000. so in the face of of crypto's biggest like regulatory hurdle asset prices like had a stellar weak what what does this tell you does this tell you anything what signal is this uh people are distracted by pingus really you know do you generally think that the asset price movements uh were just uncorrelated to what the drama that was going on in dc uh uh honestly i have no idea i've i've a long time ago given up on trying to understand what moves crypto markets but um i guess the point is this isn't like china like when when when china actually like pushed the miners out that was a major event um and it had some like fundamental impact on on both the ethereum and bitcoin um i would say long term it was it was a massive net positive because it made proof of work cleaner and you you kind of uh do risk some of that geopolitical element um i think uh with what happened last week for folks that are on the outside looking in it doesn't necessarily look like the end of the world per se because it's like oh well you know the folks that passed the bill ultimately went on the floor and said here's what we meant and so here was our intention in the rule obviously we didn't mean that developers would be captured obviously we didn't mean that stickers would be captured so there was already like a little bit of hedging and people you know kind of hear that and they're like oh okay well this is probably just like lawyers dotting the eyes and crossing the t's right and um i just i think that's um i i this is going to play out over over the course of years right like even in the in the worst worst case scenarios some of the rules that we're talking about and and some of the policy that's that's going to be implemented we're talking about like 2023 right like you know certainly into like 2022 deep into 2022. um so we're we're still quite a ways um away from that and so i think um there's uh plenty of time to prepare there's gonna be plenty of like you know uh core challenges and uh you know a lot of procedural issues and and yeah this is really just kind of like the first ending in terms of how this ultimately plays out but um it's uh it's not something that would necessarily move the markets you know one way or the other on you know on a day-to-day basis it's funny sometimes i wonder in crypto whether we just like create explanations based on price or like like just like if the market had fallen out during those two weeks for other reasons unrelated it definitely we definitely would have pinned it the crypto industry on you know regulation it's always hard i i i sort of agree with you that like the short-term noise in the market it's so difficult to discern whether it's like signal or noise or whether it's based on current events or not um definitely have to think about this over the long run this kind of brings us to the to the second topic here ryan that we wanted to get you on for this is the topic of ether ether as an asset so um bankless listeners longtime bankless listeners may know we had a debate uh last year david was kind enough to host about eth as a store of value compared to bitcoin right i'm not going to use the term money let's not get hung up on the term money but it was basically a debate as to whether ether would accrue monetary premium perhaps uh surpassing the monetary premium of um bitcoin and your take was like hey no eath is not a good monetary preserve asset uh my take was yes it was and we had this conversation with like a number of different um different trails on it um but i'm curious so it's been i don't know close to nine months or so since we last talked about this in december has your opinion on eth changed since we last spoke and uh if so in what ways um i think the world has changed so um i i ultimately think um your thesis was right for me reasons i disagree with i don't sit for the wrong reasons but um but but i i think that the thesis like there's been new information uh over the course the last six months that i think is pretty important um the the first uh kind of major uh item for me is you we've actually de-risked the move to ether pretty pretty significantly right when we last talked it was uh it was it was kind of very earliest phases of it everybody was celebrating oh look at all the those that was locked in the staking contract for the beacon chain uh one five five nine uh i think was a big uh milestone i also just think the continued um evolution and like health of defy and all the other markets that continue to predominantly you know ride the ethereum rails the just explosive continued growth in stable coin adoption and usage and lending markets and basically every conceivable metric for for decentralized finance um and then uh importantly the the fact that we still haven't seen a ton of value leakage from ethereum to other smart contracts platforms and chains right we're starting to see like interoperability with layer ones we're starting to see their one versus layer two um you know value flows and that'll play out over time but for the for the most part you know uh uh ethereum is like the base layers is you know continue to show that it's uh resilient and um and primarily responsible for a lion's share of of crypto transactions uh writ large so one one thing that you i would like to see more of and and we'll likely have some product coming out here is um i think we've gotten so used to like market cap dominance um we just need to have like all of the other like dominance metrics uh top of mind and um and whether it's like transaction volume you know uh lending capacity aum for for whatever applications uh ethereum has continued to move up and to the right you know aggressively so where i uh where i disagree with you uh in like the whole like bitcoin to ethereum um debate is you know i actually had the uh epiphany from arthur hayes at bit max i think the way that he articulated it um kind of clicked everything into place uh for me because it was something that i kind of felt but didn't really have a a good kind of verbalization of and he made the point that if you look at like m0 versus the market cap of like big tech they're about six trillion dollars each is ethereum going to be money or is it going to be the equity in the decentralized financial system and this is not at all at odds with what i've been saying for years uh in fact i don't know if you guys were there but like ethereal two years ago 2019 i was on stage and everyone was talking about you know uh i don't know whatever like the the hot um topic of the moment was and and like web 3 or decentralization the internet whatever um and i was on stage and and you know basically said to a room full of of uh ethereum world computer maximalists that like if ethereum was just the settlement layer for d5 that's literally all that it needs to be and that's kind of where we are now that's not to say that that's the only thing that's happening on ethereum of course but um the the fact that ethereum as a platform is generating real fees for the like financial internet um that is a massive multi-trillion dollar opportunity itself um that does not necessarily make it a better money or a better shelling point for people that are thinking about just the um the value settlement use case that bitcoin has kind of built a narrative around i also just think that the most entertaining outcome would be a 50 50 split between like the money winner and the financial internet winner so that ethereum maximalists like yourselves and then bitcoin maximalists um on the other hand can just argue in perpetuity over the flipping and like the the re-flipping and the unflipping and and like and and and we basically just kind of run in circles forever because uh everybody's talking past each other about like okay how are people actually valuing these two very different but important things um i will say from uh from a fundamental standpoint the other thing that has definitely worked in ethereum's favor that i under-appreciated late last year was how rapidly like the esg narrative would shift um and you know from my perspective we um like the the black rocks of the world um starting to get more active on um on you know climate policy and and and the potential risks that that could create for for bitcoin as a holding of you know not only individual investors but potentially a treasury holding for other companies um is a pretty meaningful developments that we saw in q2 and i think that had a real impact and and i think they're staying power to that negative narrative for bitcoin potentially um having said that that's not something that ethereum solved yet either it's on its way to but until it's solved it's it's not actually solved so i think um you know there's certainly a a bunch of things that have changed but my uh my core thesis uh for a long time has been um both are valuable bitcoin is more valuable i'm probably slightly overweight ethereum at this point because of that new information i still don't think it's money i still don't think it's money but i think um the risk reward for uh for both if if you put a gun in my head i'd probably pick pick ethereum right now wow overweight ether um that that that is a change definitely when you say overweight ether ryan is that overweight versus bitcoin as in you have more ether than bitcoin no i'm not stupid [Laughter] wow they're the slap slaps are coming in well i'm from from from a yeah i'm i'm overweight from like a portfolio standpoint okay got it versus versus where they sent from a a market valuation standpoint so so so i'm curious like so i i know the term money can be distracting for people so let's not use this whether it's money whether it's a reserve asset whether it's kind of equity in this gdp that is ethereum whatever it is right ultimately like asset price go up if it's successful if this thesis is successful is cut what i think um the last time we talked um asked you about the flipping or you brought it up maybe and you said the answer is definitely no eth would not flip in bitcoin do you still believe it's a definite no i don't think it's a definite no anymore so i think that's why i've moved overweight but i'm you know i'm also not going too aggressively in the other direction like there are tax reasons also not to you know to go aggressively in the other direction because i think both are going to succeed long term and um and uh i i definitely think that that ethereum is potentially relatively undervalued right now um so i'm i'm putting more there progressively but it my position has not flipped um that's not to say i i i am not convinced that we will see a flipping of market cap in the next couple of years but the probability is not negligible but by the way one thing that's interesting i know use the term uh through a maximalist for david and myself like i don't think of myself as an ethereum maximalist at all like in fact um you know dave and i helped propose the index co-op this thing we call the bed index which is a third bitcoin a third each and a third d5 right i think that is juxtaposed with possibly bitcoin maximalists who take up that mantle and claim bitcoin that all they buy is bitcoin right um so so yeah like the term maximalist is is a bit different but i have always thought that um for a long time ever since we started bankless that the eth i guess fundamentals and the narrative was not appreciated and i want to ask you a question about narrative because i think that was one of the things you mentioned in your your end of um you know 2020 thesis paper where you kind of sort of wrote predictions for 2021 one of the challenges with ether is the narrative is too complex as what you said do you think the narrative complexity has that been simplified a bit better is is ether maybe better understood in not quite mainstream but in sort of the circles that are buying it yeah i think narratively it's um i still don't agree with like the triple point asset like that particular memetic that a lot of people have right like i think it's resonated with with a lot of folks but i'm a little bit more simple than that you need heath for working capital for gas and to stake so you you you need ethereum for working capital and it is a capital asset now it's more like equity in the decentralized internet than anything else it just so happens you also use that for transactions for now but you don't necessarily have to right like you can use usdc many um many applications on d5 denominated in usdc or usdt or another stable point so you're already starting to see that um and and you know at the end of the day you know anytime that you run a transaction you probably want it to be dollar denominated most people in the world will want it to be dollar denominated so even if it's like an auto conversion to eth um at the time that you're paying a transaction fee for a specific defy application that's something that can be solved and you don't necessarily need to hoard eth to pay for at the time that you need it for transaction so the reserve demand is not necessarily the same as it would be for money the reserve demand the reason you would want to hold it is for a combination of convenience today and then staking and collateral um so i and and that i think it makes a lot of intuitive sense for investors and and like i said it's just it's such a massive market um that um that both narratives can win um and look maybe you will still prove to be right and that you know people will use this for money too but i think generally speaking people lying around the single best use case for a single technology and in this case the capital asset for financial internet i think is is the stronger memetic that is getting institutions excited about because they look at this like okay jp morgan is a 400 billion dollar company ethereum is a 400 billion dollar tech you know technological network that you know we can understand because these fees are getting burnt there's like you know real money that's getting earned by those that are securing the network kind of like bitcoin but you know in more of like a shareholder base uh perspective um i think that's um it's really easy to rock and and i think d5 reinforces that because some of the other defy applications are very similar right you're providing liquidity you're providing um uh you know lending uh you know capital for um for for underwriting loans um so like the whole like stake earn deposit kind of ethos um and and the the uh the flywheel that creates in terms of network security i think is like an important facet here one last time ryan that we had you on the show to talk about this same debate um we had to take some time to actually define money because it was a question of is eth money uh and we we landed on uh you know monetary premium is is how you determine if something is money or not but i want to ask you this because ryan ryan said for a moment setting money aside we're all kind of primarily focused on number go up right market cap what what's the size of these market cap things uh and so say for a world in a world where eth does flip in btc and ethereum has a larger market cap than bitcoin in your opinion does that make money or or how does the relationship of the market cap and whether a thing is money or not how do those things relate can bitcoin still be money yet still be under the market cap of ethereum uh well i can do you think that the value of tech stocks will eclipse that of m0 right going back to the co-opted example from from arthur which which i think is the right framing i think the answer is yes so um will it happen you know how does value um accrue to ether versus solana dot you know all these other networks and by the way the other layer ones or sorry the other layer twos because like each of these other you know layer twos they're gonna have their own financial uh incentive you know uh frameworks uh across the board because someone's gonna need to like actually process transactions on any blockchain whether it's a shard whether it's another network whether it's the main chain and they're gonna need that need to be incentivized to do so so um you know we'll we'll see um but like i said i'm bullish on both and um right now the growth in the bitcoin story is still all about like government debt deficits monetary debasement and that trend is not decelerating for ethereum it continues to be all about decentralized finance permissionless you know kind of innovative marketplace infrastructure and that is only accelerating and we see the kpis for ethereum and all the applications that are running on it and the kpis just keep getting crazier and crazier and more applications keep getting built you know on that infrastructure so i think um i think both are you know still very healthy um it's a little bit of a an unfair comparison from a fundamental evaluation standpoint though because if you think about bitcoin as money and then the medic around money and you think about ethereum as ultimately being priced as a financial internet and like the underlying stock or asset that secures the financial internet then one is going to have only mimetics behind it because you know all currencies are means and then the other one is going to have some like actual kpis uh behind it um so again i think uh to to synopsize uh overweight ethereum but not more eth than btc i definitely think that flipping is possible um maybe not likely but you know certainly maybe like my probabilities up from 0.1 percent to um to maybe 20 so you got a 200 x return on that which is not too bad um i'll take it 200x anytime yeah exactly um and then uh you know ultimately speaking uh it's going to be entertaining for me to watch from the sidelines as people argue about semantics for the next uh 15 years oh the arguments will be unceasing hopefully we can come together on the regulatory issues but we know that there will still be arguments um the last last question on this is one comment you made was about institutional demand in our last conversation and at the time bitcoin was getting a lot of institutional demand i think sailor had just made some of his you know earlier purchases um institutions were talking about adding into the balance sheet but that time you said institutional demand for eth is a mirage and i think you're kind of right like there wasn't a lot at the time i mean we made the argument that um well you know ether is kind of a cycle behind but it will play that cycle a little bit quicker than bitcoin because big brother helped ether out and like created the channel now ether just has to follow that trail as an asset are you starting to see more institutional demand interest for eth as an asset as well i mean i'm not really at the um at the front lines of this i'd say anecdotally yes um for for for me the thing that matters um i want to see more institutional adoption of eth for sure because our business at pinsari is market intelligence for crypto as an asset class you don't need a market intelligence platform if it's just one or two assets that you care about so for us like it's it's critical to have institutions actually interested in supporting eth because that's going to help lead them down the rabbit hole for defy and ultimately like the the the universe of potentially interesting applications and assets um so i um i think uh the the half-life is um is what we look at i think the half-life to get someone from like interested in bitcoin or not interested uh versus that what it takes to get someone who's already bought bitcoin to buy eth to get to go from uh i have bitcoin underneath now like what's defy and then you know all the way down you know into actually being like an active participant in these ecosystems or you know um nfts are probably their own complete you know wild card because it's a more you know kind of consumer friendly and like retail driven phenomenon but for but for everything else i think um if you like bitcoin you're probably gonna look at eath at some point if you like eat you're going to look at d5 and that's going to be kind of the natural progression of things over time can i ask ryan so at missouri i've definitely seen a kind of a an increase in focus on like defy tokens and like the metaverse and some really fantastic research and analysis on these topics um i think a lot of this like didn't exist a year ago in general as kind of you know asset classes but what are the the sectors i guess within crypto that you are most excited about and that missari is most excited about providing uh analytics and and research for is is defy a key sector is kind of nfts in the metaverse a key sector what are the what are the hot things we should be looking for out of uh so i mean we've been uh covering these assets on a sector by sector basis i think we're one of the earlier ones to kind of come up with these uh designations uh for for a per asset basis and and have that you know on our home page we've had that on our homepage for for a year being able to toggle between d5 and web3 assets and privacy coins and stable coins so that you're not just kind of comparing everything you know apples oranges and bananas across the um across the ecosystem i think there's probably more hard data on defy and and those um financial applications like how much capital is locked uh what the what the interest rates are what the exchange rates are um and uh and there's just i think more um infrastructure like open infrastructure like subgraphs have been developed for for all these um different markets um nft is definitely interesting but i i there's no real like price discovery on like individual nfts right so like how that factors into like a market intelligence platform for institutions i don't really know i'm sure we'll probably have like rare rocks like digital jade like rock jpegs um on the slide at some point if like the market continues to be insane but um right now i think we're just taking a wait and see approach on like how nfts get incorporated in the meantime we definitely have a bunch of research on the um nft space um and i've been keeping a close eye on that and endow infrastructure and you know other bits of that infrastructure stack myself um because um we know that there are going to be you know additional plug-ins over time so um yeah we'll we'll see um and uh stay tuned we got main net coming up just a few weeks you guys are going to be there right i'll be there comps good absolute comps mainnet september 20th through 22nd we'll be talking about all these things and um the general uh theme of the event is uh you know basically our interoperable future and the multi-chain future so uh we'll be kind of going through the basics uh obviously for bitcoin ethereum but a lot focus on defy decentralized web applications nft infrastructure dow infrastructure um and then um interoperability between other layer ones and there two is probably the kind of core themes of the event i'm about to submit my speaker application to maynet right after this round so maybe you can help me get that one processed it better be good david yeah and it it it better be good because i'm not even involved so fair enough i can't pull any strings for you sorry you're on your own man ryan we'll fight we'll find a way every every single year ryan you put out a you a famously gargantuan report titled something along the lines of crypto theses for the following year right so big predictions about because it's also a summary about you know crypto over the last year but also predictions over the next year as well uh and in the crypto theses for 2021 you kind of finished off with this uh section that you titled exiting to the the networks state and i think this conversation actually uh becomes irrelevant once again as if it never it always was but really becomes relevant with uh the earlier conversation we were having with the regulators and how they are pushing us into compliance pushing us into regulation pushing us into capture so i want to pick your brain a little bit on what is it what does it mean to exit to the network state and how is this conversation becoming relevant once again um i think the the network state um you know a lot of the writing uh and a lot of the thinking there has been uh centered around what biology has been talking about for for quite some time and and you know basically you know kovit has accelerated a bunch of tech trends and um and crypto is kind of the intersection of a lot of them so i think um uh i i can't speak as uh intelligibly and um and as uh with quite the crystal ball that that he has um but i do think that because of how incompatible some of our legacy institutions uh and and kind of legacy laws are with kind of the current reality of you know where we are at the tech um there's gonna be some real you know friction points and and issues to resolve that are going to require some political resolutions and the very best thing that we can do right now is hope that's there's just plenty of um uh kind of channeled fury channeled uh uh assertive response to uh to make sure that people don't unintentionally regulate us out of existence or to oblivion because you know ironically that would be the very worst thing when you're talk uh talking about protecting investors the very worst thing in terms of um you know promoting economic growth in the country very worst thing for civil liberties and and and privacy um because the folks that are building in in crypto are the ones that are taking those values seriously so i think um the network state um is uh i like the real world uh i don't want to just live in the cloud so i i think the network state is is more about the future of the economy and um and and and the future of kind of like individual responsibility and kind of sovereignty and how we kind of plug in and cooperate since um since more work is crossing borders and uh more you know economic activity and social activity is happening online um tuned for my 2022 thesis which there's no way i'll be able to write this year because i can't afford to take time off to write a 500 page book i i think you will find a way ryan you've never let us down before it's going to be a tweet storm there you go we'll take it one one of one of 11.79 yeah yeah ryan it's been uh
