before I had money I thought everything was a scam and now having money and being able to help my family out and seeing my parents personalities change because they don't have to worry about certain things anymore like getting to know them more as people because some number changed on a screen makes me saved like everything seems like a giant scam B feel like I was also slightly robbed of experiencing that while I was growing up or while I was younger because they had these burdens and had to worry about them
