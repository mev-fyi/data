this is from kevin o'leary i love you kevin you've got a lot of great takes this was not one of them kevin o'leary says essentially i'm glad the tornado cash developer was arrested now we get to move on we get to be more regulated i'll read some of the direct quotes i want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work i want that too i don't need to be a crypto cowboy and i don't want to be one because i work in the regulated world okay understand that but this is the take that really gets me at the end of the day it's okay to arrest that guy oof the tornado cash developer why he's messing with the primal forces of regulation if we have to sacrifice him that's okay because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital it is not okay to sacrifice an open source developer who is working on the public good i know why i'm here and it's not for that he says we are messing with the primal forces of regulation that's why i'm here right that's what i'm here to do
