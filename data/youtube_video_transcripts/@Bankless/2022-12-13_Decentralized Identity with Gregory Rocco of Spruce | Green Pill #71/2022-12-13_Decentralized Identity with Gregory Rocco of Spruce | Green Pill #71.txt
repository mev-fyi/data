foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we have Rocco who is the founder of spruce Rocco and I go way back we're both incubated at consensus get clean was incubated at consensus Rocco worked at consensus back a couple Market Cycles ago and so we've been friends for a long time following his work working on Spruce ID and more recently sign in with ethereum which is an open standard for how you can prove to an app that you own an account and you can give it information associated with that account uh so we're talking about decentralized identity decentralized reputation decentralized Society all of the good stuff that decentralized reputation could enable in this episode so just really quickly revisit that thesis decentralized identity is regen because it's going to enable more positive some games and repeat interactions between participants in the decentralized society that is being built on web3 and that is why I sign in with ethereum matters it is the portal through which an application can get access to your data in a privacy preserving way and create a more decentralized society and regenerative of crypto economic internet so Rocco is one of the Unseen voices and unseen Heroes of decentralized identity and so I'm just really excited to be on this episode and talk about signing with ethereum and Spruce and Spruce ID with him uh also just a great guy like I said I've known him for years and it's been really fun to follow their Journey so without further Ado I could be Rocco and Spruce IG enjoy coordination working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work

you got to be working on this problem Spruce is working on decentralized identity and data and one of our core Tendencies we want to make sure that users control their identity and data across the web you see a lot of what's going on in the crypto space especially around assets how can that also translate over to user zoning and controlling their identity as well probably the core way of summarizing what we're working on it Spruce a lot a lot of it being developer focused purely on bringing open source software to the world and letting users Implement these kinds of workflows into their adapts and regular applications too and try to make it as easy as possible for them um yeah let's maybe spend five minutes on your your history and how you got to be working on this problem yeah so before Spruce times um I was at a different tree known as Alpine uh over on the consensus side of things so my co-founder Wayne and I worked over at consensus uh years back and it's tough to interject that you and I work together at consensus I think you were out in Boulder for a summer and we we hung out for not a summer but like at least a month uh while we were both at consensus I do remember that I do miss the mountain views too the views out there are beautiful and uh we were working on a decentralized identity at the time over at consensus and consensus was probably one of the leading organizations putting resourcing into decentralized identity that many years back like really early to the trend with like the folks over at uport and the work they were doing way early on in terms of bringing decentralized identity uh over to the ethereum ecosystem and Beyond and like understanding that the keys we use in crypto land uh translate well to like you know these decentralized identity paradigms and some of the focus we had at consensus Wayne and I were on platform economies namely that a lot of companies in the space were trying to rebuild a lot of different forms of platform economies uh at the time but in a decentralized manner like tilting some of the things towards users more so than platforms reaping a lot of fees and one of the things that was missing at the time uh was the trust portion of the transaction how do you handle knowing who you're dealing with on these platforms if it's all decentralized and namely a lot of these things we could operate as like a public key like 0x you know yada yada but let's say you kind of have the example of like a decentralized Airbnb uh where folks want to stay at a place over time we're trying to reduce the amount of fees that platforms take and really keep it between the owner and the person uh renting the space you're going to need a couple of things namely the legal portion of the identity which is does that person actually own the space and have the rights to write that space out the reputational identity as this person have a good reputation over time of like being a good renter or being a good person leasing the space out to someone and everything is kind of in order as it should be and lastly you know you're not you have like certain safety checks with reputational identity like you're not going to get serial murdered overnight so beyond kind of just us sending assets to a Smart contract kind of locking it up and having this decentralized Airbnb how do you slowly reintroduce just the right amount of information for the counterparties to make sure that the transaction is safe in different ways that was a big part of how we got started over at Spruce and around 2020 we were independent organization specifically working on libraries to bring these decentralized identity paradigms into play and implementing them on applications and most recently a lot of our work for the last year focused on sign in with ethereum and what a lot of that has to do is uh the first part of kind of identity especially when dealing with apps and services on the Internet is around signing in that first interaction that you take when you interact and interface with something is that sign-in portion and that's been a lot of the focus of our work ever since it's been a pretty wild ride but I I love kind of how the space is slowly evolving into these two areas and folks realizing that at the center of all these things are keys that all the stuff you do on the financial side deals with keys and all these stuff that you do on the identity side is also using that same key pair um yeah I mean I'll just uh you know while we're sort of traversing this design space I guess I'll just say out loud what my thesis of so you know green pill is all about regenerative web 3 and things that are pro-social with web3 and uh the reason why we've been spending some time this season talking about identity is that if you can track identities and and I don't just mean like you know I'm Kevin and you're Gregory Rocco identities but also like persistent pseudonymous identities online then what you can do is you can start to have repeat interactions between these actors and you can start to track okay this is the social uh attributes of this counterparty that I'm working with and you can start to have through repeat interactions you can also start to have positive some games between the actors in the ecosystem which wasn't possible in D5 without collateral you know um and so if you can complexify the identity space then you can start to take the positive some actors and put them in a certain bucket give them access to features and protocols and that's where you know kind of like the regen uh one plus one equals three in in that kind of world with identity and so you know I know that we're talking a lot about the technology private Keys signing with ethereum here and and I just wanted to make sure for The Listener that we connect the sort of like regen thesis uh to to the identity piece there and so I don't know if you have any any comments on that if not I have more more questions about your work no and I think that's important too because like for a user how does someone show up to an app or service uh what they have with what they have already and show that service exactly what it needs to know for that interaction without over sharing without doing too much and really like you have these kind of privacy preserving items in there as well like how do you bring everything together and the user can go across these different interactions and make sure that they have the ability to show themselves and what is needed just for that interaction without that over sharing for each for each instance as well like user protections as well especially as we move way more digitally I think that that's really a key point you know as we as we start to build this more regenerative positive sum world uh that it doesn't have to come at the cost of privacy and sovereignty of the user's data which I think is something new that people don't don't necessarily realize when they get into checking out this design space and and to me that just makes it all that the more exciting yeah and I think a lot of it deals specifically with like with like identity and data how do you reverse the login um where instead of a user logging into a platformer site that platformer site now has to log into that user's Data Vault or wherever they're holding their data where the user brings everything with them to the session rather than the app kind of storing it on their behalf having like kind of a fragmented version of you across different apps how do you just come to an app and present it yourself and be like here I am this is everything associated with me that I'm consenting to give you and that's kind of the end of it and these apps don't even have to hold user data anymore users can just bring it with them for that session and now apps can instead of competing on how much data they can store about users apps can now compete on the services they offer rather than competing on how much data they can store yeah I mean I think in a world and you know we just need to say it out loud this might be obvious to to me and you but you know with all the data leaks that have been happening where people try to hoard all this data about their users and then you know they get hacked and they accidentally like you know uh I think it's Equifax as it's one of the big three has leaked my identity data um and their whole business is storing identity data in in credit scoring data about me and so that should tell you how broken the security Paradigm of of uh web 2 and before data is and I think that people don't even realize it uh because it's like a fish being in water like you don't even realize that uh you know it's water around us there's there's everyone's storing all of my data all the time it's like all we've ever known so there's a little bit of an opportunity to show people that there's another world that's possible here yeah and a lot of it came from like when internet standards were coming out when when apps were starting to become a dominant force in like the web 2 era there was no standard way of doing user-controlled identity so every service just was like okay I have to onboard a new in some way shape or form get you onto this app or service here fill in you know your name your last name your username your password so every app just slowly began to have a different version of you and then all of them built moats around those particular versions of you and then it wasn't until later on that user controlled identity standards kind of came into the play where it's like okay what if we flip this model and what if the user just presents themselves but a lot of it came from like everything being built so quickly and just that became the moat like user user data just became them up for a lot of these apps and services so yeah I mean it's worth stating that if if each app isn't building its own mode then what happens is that all web 3 apps are building up their own data modes together and I think what's really exciting for for me about that is that there's been a whole era of web 2 applications that uh have just cornered their categories because they have such big data modes and no one can compete with them anymore I'm I'm sort of sub tweeting Facebook and Twitter and all these other social networks that have this network effect where all my friends are in Twitter and uh because of that I'm going to be at Twitter and because of because of that all my friends are at Twitter there's like this infinite Loop of this network effects that's being climbed but you can imagine someone I don't know let's say lens protocol building a web 3 social network and making the social graph open source so that anyone can derive from it and then anyone who starts a web 3 social app can just start on third base because they've got all of that data and network effects there and so I think that it really builds a more Pro consumer and pro citizen web when you can take your data from site to site and you're not locked into these little you know these little uh walled Gardens and that's exactly what it is too from the crypto space it's like we have a lot of these different apps you could use that rely on the same smart contracts but are just kind of different front ends different experiencer folks but the second you go to that other front end that other application it's kind of the same rails behind everything the smart contracts that are on like let's say the ethereum blockchain for example and like you're saying with this so you could have you know these open social media protocols where you can have uh you know the green pill social space where you know you take a user kind of brings their posts followers and everything with them I could have you know a different social media app and it's all the same data that's being brought back and forth but we're just kind of different purpose-built different themes uh different Services we may have on each application but the underlying data is just coming to each one it's kind of unlocked as part of that equation and it really gets rid of those bad incentives like for hoarding data and like like you're saying you and I can you know we go to Twitter because we know that's where all of our tweets are all of our followers are all of our network data is but in this kind of new open world of of unlocked data and user control data it doesn't matter the front end because all that kind of comes with you and these these standards are also these data formats and standards are all interoperable is that you know my platform and your platform read the same thing and understand the same language uh these standards are almost like the battle fish for data so maybe let's let's dive in on one of those specific standards and uh it's sign in with ethereum that I hear you always talking about so is this like I go to an app and instead of just connecting my wallet I actually sign in with ethereum and then the app gets some sort of data about me so the center of the theorem standard a lot of it deals specifically with like how do you first how do you prevent big login uh is a joke we use kind of internally and sometimes talk about is like how do you go away from large login providers where if you were using a Google account to sign in with things and Google ever decided to pull the rug on you you wouldn't just lose access to Google services you'd also lose access to everything you signed in with Google too so every time you hit that sign with Google button even if it's a total third-party service you lose access to that Google account you just lost your identifier the thing you're using to tell that app who you are and the sign with ethereum case these are Keys you control and these these ethereum accounts you that only you control to get into these apps and services and a big part of what we're doing with that is kind of Bridging the Gap from actually first it'd probably be good if I talked about the difference between connecting a wallet and signing in with ethereum let's do it yeah because they're yeah because there are two different actions that sometimes get um mixed up a little bit sometimes so when you connect a wallet to an app or a dab rather that you're not kind of giving anything that the DAP anything other than the means to serve you a transaction like some kind of on-chain transaction saying yep you know you're trying to make this trade you know here here's the transaction to make that trade when you're signing a message you're actually proving you are the owner of that account and by doing that the app can trust that yes it's you it could potentially remember things about you like preferences for example the goal obviously being to move this towards the user bringing that all that with them but it's the first step in having experiences of gaps rival that of traditional apps that the DAP can remember something about you that you know when you set up a profile it's all there for you when you come back one of the good early examples of this was openc so in openc you could use openc by just connecting a wallet and you know using the nft marketplace and trading things but the second you want to set up a profile on openc it requires you to sign a message and that message is like you know I'm signing into openc a couple of other details and then once you sign that message opens he's like oh this person controls that account there that they are now logged in and we could remember these profile details about them so when they come back it's all there for them when they get back and with the whole sign with ethereum initiative was was standardizing that message format that you know when you get served that thing in your wallet that's like sign this message it's very much how do you standardize that so that wallets can then tell the user hey you're signing into this where it's getting like just that much better with ux so that the wallet's not like sign the random message but instead saying you're actually signing into the zapper service and even providing users with better ux around signing in such as domain binding and what that means is that if you're on a phishing site that's trying to scam you and it's asking you to sign off on something that doesn't match the site you're on like if it's a phishing site for openc for example the wallet being able to warn you and say hey you're on a phishing Skype this site right now you're getting scammed so just getting that much closer to more of a traditional login experience but using your ethereum account using the wallet that you control the identifier you control where we move even deeper is that's that's the authentication that's the login you're logging into a site or service the second part of that is how do you actually bring data with you so we're working on a couple of standards as well to help like you're not just to make it so that you're not just like logging in but also authorizing access to like a Data Vault that you control and you can bring this data to a session with you that even if it's even it's if it's something like the first name last name thing even if it's something like dark mode or light mode but you're able to do that just by signing in with ethereum so the first step was how do we get the login right the second step is we brought our identifier second step is how do we now bring our data with us so it's a little bit of background on the kind of connect wallet signing with ethereum differences so as a developer the way I conceptualize this is that connect wallet simply has the wallet tell the site that I am user owaki.eath but sign in with ethereum actually has me sign a message with my private key to prove that I'm a walkie.eath and it's a stronger guarantee than the connecting which is just the wallet of testing for it is that the technical difference or am I directionally right completely so it's like I could always spoof a walkie-heath if I just had the connect wallet flow someone can come in put an extension in front of like a fork metamask to have it lie about who I am kind of thing yeah yeah exactly there's like an extension out there that like I am vitalik.ies and it's just kind of like can sit in front of existing wallets connected to that so the app's like okay I guess you're metallic.if but as soon as you send them a transaction like you can't they can't actually sign on that and make that transaction so the signing the message Parts like yes I am in fact able to demonstrate control over this wallet right beautiful well so I mean it seems like sign in with ethereum let's maybe talk about all the really beautiful data that can piggyback on top of me signing in with ethereum so I mean you know could we could we maybe get into that ecosystem and what use cases you're really excited about there sure so some of the early stuff around like the space that I see kind of popping up especially with the work over on the git coin passport side some of the work we're doing on credentialing and others in the space is how does a user um some of the early early cases it's like two SE a lot of it first being around Creator authenticity so how do creators in the nft world like have assurances for other folks buying their works that they are who they say they are in these places that you're not doing an onboarding every single time you go to a new nft Marketplace and instead you're bringing things like a Twitter account that's associated with your name or a dribble profile or a deviantART account that's associated with your name and bringing that with you no matter where you're logging in and all these platforms just recognize that immediately because they're able to verify that you have that credential that it was issued in a way that makes a lot of sense to them and that you as a user can use that across all these services in the nft side and even on the Dow side like how does someone create a profile with enough assurances about who they are so that when they do put up a proposal or they do get involved in the discourse going on about voting on a proposal even if it's like funding public goods for example that there is uh the folks have the ability to know that they are who they say they are or have assurances about who this person is making these uh statements about certain things and kind of joining these kinds of uh these conversations about what's going on especially like the immediate low Assurance credentialing use cases like I'm bringing social media accounts with me we're not even like at the point of like driver's licenses government documents reusable kyc those are like the big big like how do we eventually like make all this stuff kind of open and easier to use even down to like the small low Assurance use cases like a social media account how do we even take that with us throughout all these interactions because even that's super powerful especially as we do a lot of these social coordination games around things we work on in the space that I think that's even those are powerful in and of themselves coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for Dows and crypto businesses that need to

hundred thousand dollars I mean it seems like there's such a diversity of different data riders that we could have once more apps integrate with sign in with ethereum that I'm really excited to see this ecosystem flourish and of course you know the one I'm I'm more familiar with is get coin passport because back when I was at getcoin we were kind of uh starting to think about what would have to be true for our for Bitcoin to take the Civil resistance data that it that it has and make it accessible to other applications of course with the permission of of users uh authorizing their data silos and so you can imagine that someone signs in with ethereum and if the they authorize the app to have it then you could get their git coin passport score and from that application and then all of a sudden that application knows oh I can treat this user as a civil resistant user instead of just a regular user and um you know I know it just seems like there's a totally broad design space but it could get really deep in each of these individual application niches just depending on what kind of data is emergently created and what users will authorize yeah and I'm thinking too about uh if you could even blend things from the uh Bitcoin passport like uh credentials with even on-chain information like for example you have uh assurances around civil resistance from these social media accounts from these accounts across the web tied to this this identifier this key what if you could also blend that with on-chain information as well what if it's kind of even drilled down to Beyond just like has made a transaction to like has made over 10 unit swap trades within a certain period and that gets issued as a credential and that use like on-chain blended with off chain to get even higher assurances about civil resistance like that a user is in fact a unique user and just kind of showing up to something with that with enough assurances for whatever the application is let's say it's an airdrop let's say it's for increased benefits on an app or service now you could even not even just use the off chain stuff the stuff that's coming from web2 but also natively web 3 things and kind of have this Blended experience from both sides yeah I mean I think that gets pretty interesting and it might be worth just for the listener who doesn't spend their full time on this talking about the difference between on-chain credentials and off-chain credentials I don't think that we've covered yet but verifiable credentials stored off off chain on something like ceramic are different from something that's stored on chain and directly connected to your at to your address and there's the the big difference there to me is the Privacy implications of of having something connected on chain that anyone can just read versus an off chain thing that I have to like sign in to give access to yeah one of them is that right or close yeah no that's that's completely right and one of the important things too is uh when we talk about credentials like this they are off chain so you know users have this these like privacy preserving ways of using them um and a big thing about the on-chain credentialing and you could actually represent stuff that happened on chain as an off chain credential like I could issue you Kevin a credential so that said you made more than 10 unit swap trades I'll issue that off chain but the evidence for that will be some on-chain information maybe we'll hit an indexer maybe we'll hit some service that gives us the evidence for that information um but I think where it gets even more interesting is when you could start using these off-chain credentials uh on chain in different ways like let's say you have a fully autonomous system with smart contracts like imagine if you could just use those credentials with that smart contract now and that smart contract is no like you know has to have a Twitter account associated with the public key the only way for that smart contract to understand that is if it's on chain in some way or if there's an oracle something that feeds blockchain information on chain in some efficient way so there's like a huge like mix and match design space of what can be off chain what could be on-chain but I'm more along the lines of like things in terms of like uh personal information remaining off chain in different ways so long as it could be privacy preserving at the end of the day that the user kind of has full control over the information uh you might have some emerging things to somehow get that on chain in a privacy preserving way but I think that's just kind of the core of it as long as that information is protected for that person then kind of the format is whatever's easier as long as that information is protected and we should say that like you know for on-chain data there is ways to protect the Privacy uh I mean I'm thinking of zero knowledge proofs uh when I say that out loud but uh yeah I know that when the d-soc paper came out this was a big a big controversy that that happened yeah cell bound tokens that was that was probably the one burning question was like how do we make sure that whatever is going on chain stamped in The Ledger of record forever isn't my social security number and that isn't ever possibly leaked in any possible way and that's probably still one of the most important things especially for the folks experimenting with launching credentials to just always make sure designing for privacy first is super important because you don't want to visit this immutable stamp yeah I mean and this is not like when you're designing for a web 2 app where like the server goes down and it goes away the blockchain is forever so uh well you know depends on the blockchain but uh the ethereum maina I think we can assume is reached escape velocity and it's going to be around forever so um you know you just have to take some privacy way more seriously because you're going through a one-way door when you deploy something to a blockchain yeah exactly and I think that's as long as that's kind of the core of folks looking to do identity on chain as long as that's at the core of their their principles and reasoning and philosophy around it then then it's cool like as long as we're just not personal information on chain that's not encrypted not private by default just very scary uh when it's immutable like that but uh there are folks a lot of folks working in that space right now and making sure that that is a possibility so definitely hats off to them yeah totally um what are the what are the categories of things that sign in with ethereum enables that that you're most excited about right now I think one of the things that I'm a big fan of is uh how do you log in on behalf of a Dao I think um this has been a little bit of a problem for a while where if you have a multi-sig or a multi-sig while it's a like let's say uh you know an order a multi-sig wallet you just need multiple people to sign off on something or multiple wallets to sign off on something to make a transaction go through in a multi-sig wallet so if you know you and I set up a multi-sig and with the you know we can make it two up two out of two so both of us have to sign and approve something in order to make something go but this has been a problem for a lot of dows and a lot of organizations or even individuals who use multisigs is how do you sign into apps or dapps using that multi-sig you know traditionally in corporate world it's like we always have the designated social media person but it's one person representing the organization it's not like a hundred of us are sitting around a computer and uh you know all 100 of us have our hand on the mouse and clicking on things on the Opera service it's always one person and this really never translated well yet in terms of dapps where multi-cigs can you know just take off-chain actions and have an account on a platform folks did it in a couple of bespoke ways but um one of the things I'm super excited about is if like the workflow where a multi-sig is able to say these Keys these these people are the ones that can log in on behalf of this multi-sig so if a dow had a member that you know can control the social media accounts like the decentralized social media accounts if a dow had a member that did like the proposal drafting uh in certain instances or even managed the profile of that Dao on a governance platform that now there's a workflow where an individual can do that the Dow or multi-sig can say yep that's the individual that can log in and when that user goes to sign in with ethereum the DAP can ask them hey did you mean as yourself so let's say me Rocco or on behalf of the multi-sig or one of these multi-cigs that you are a delegate of and I'm also very excited to like start splitting that out so you could have one person be the social media person you could have one person manage the Dow profile on this website and have these very narrow scopes for each of these things um before this was a very difficult thing but thankfully working with the folks over at gnosis safe this is uh now been enabled which is great but now it's like what are the even deeper use cases of like single delegation to certain apps or certain verticals um again social media app like the profile management app The Proposal management app that each individual can now represent a different thing similar to How We Do It In traditional companies like there's a social media person this person managing this account but now like kind of fully web3 enabled uh and having this design space happen and also again just using wallets and I think that's a core basis for a lot of what excites me about sign with ethereum even just beyond the identity stuff is how do you take these wallets that folks are using and Beyond just Financial transactions what else can you do with them I think that's the core of a lot of this work for all the folks working on identity for all the folks working on decentralized data is how do you take you know individuals using wallets and say hey wait there's a ton more you can do with this that is this mode of like Sovereign operation Beyond just finances and I mean we have something like full user control yeah totally I mean as someone who's worked on Enterprise oh man am I I'm getting I'm shuttering but I'm thinking about myself uh but you know Enterprise access management was like something that there was whole teams at this Corporation I worked at and um you know just having that all be open source and permissionless I think is really a huge step forward but you know when I think about what decentralized identity is going to enable I think about things like web3 social being able to take my social graph from site to site or under collateralized lending or civil resistance you know like a little bit more consumer oriented applications but you know it's great it's it's amazing to have the sort of consumer stuff and the Enterprise stuff on the same structure because that enables you to do you know whatever Innovation you enable for your Dow can be enabled for you as an individual user and vice versa but I'm wondering if there's anything that like category of more consumer oriented stuff that you're really excited about being built on top of sign in with ethereum no I think I think you kind of hit the nail on the head there especially around the social space is that the one thing that I Saw the space take a great turn I'd say probably in the 2019 2020 was more into the social space and not even to social media just like pure interactions as individuals uh Beyond just the depth and can kind of make money go from point A to point B which is super important in its own right I never want to downplay uh like you know like the finance side of crypto but I think signing with ethereum really represents that other side of like those interactions those social interactions like decentralized social media um artists in the nft space and how we communicate I think that's kind of the world that's unlocked here outside the financial use cases like how do we start having these more contextual interactions in the space as opposed to just connecting a wallet and making a transaction how do we go levels deeper than that especially on the consumer side like that I think it's all the social interactions all the contextual interactions when you need just a little bit more of yourself than just the public key just the wallet I think is when this gets really really powerful and kind of signing with ethereum is just kind of that root of it it's just kind of the standard it's just a standard it enables all this but I think what it enables like we're talking about now those contextual interactions are super super important especially as the space evolves to like bring people closer together and everything we're doing here so uh I know that you spend a lot of time thinking about this and I know that because when we hang out uh we geek out about this a lot so I'm wondering if you could take me into the future it's the end of 2022 right now say it's 20 2032 it's 10 years from now is signing with ethereum is maximally successful what will the world look like what kind of impact will it have on the world I think if signing with ethereum is maximally successful we really have a world where large companies aren't extracting the value they are anymore from users I think it's a little bit of a Kind of Blue Skies but I think that's really the case because I think as we mentioned earlier now that users control their own identifier or have ways of doing it I think wallets get to the point where Key Management is a complete Breeze in terms of not like worrying about like oh no did I write those 12 words somewhere I think we've reached that point in that time where wallets have created such great experiences around like recovery around you know managing these things and I think we have this world where users are always in control their identifier is never worrying about a large company pulling the rug on them or having a data breach and instead are just worrying about new features that are dropping to make the apps and services that much more better for users that we're not constantly in this world of fear of oh no is something going to happen to my data oh no I forgot about that account five years ago and now that app or service is shut down or the their data is now posted on the dark web somewhere I think it's less on that and more about the experiences we're talking about more on a what app you know am I going to be using today that's offering me so much value and and social value and if I don't like it that within 10 seconds I can move over to the next platform and the experience is nearly the same in terms of the things I've brought with me to this platform and these platforms are just purely competing on services and what they could offer the user instead of being extractive from the user that it's more focused on the user and more focused on benefiting users than benefiting the bottom lines and that's what's great about the space is that it it bends all incentives towards that on the experience rather than how extractive a service can be and I think the 10-year view is if you get to that point if these standards are working as intended and if Key Management is in place to make make it a breeze and I know we all kind of use the default of like can my mom use this and I think at 10 years absolutely I think that'll be the case I'm very I'm very hopeful for the wallet space in terms of getting it right for users making sure the design patterns are great making sure that recovery is great and I think if we're all there I think we're really in a great spot with how we interact on the internet how we take control of ourselves on the internet how trust gets redefined on the internet and how experiences evolve as well beautiful well uh is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say or uh uh you know like is anything anything else that you want to say before we wrap I just want to say that um I think what often goes under appreciated in the space are the folks working on Open Standards that we talk a lot about um generally my new standards drop I know folks are talking about account abstraction uh Focus are talking about like what's the new the new thing going on right now is like I think the human coordination costs to make to bring these standards to life like signing with ethereum often goes unnoticed I also want to shout out to like all the EIP editors the folks who have been keeping the ethereum standards going and making sure that they're reviewed making sure there's a process for them because all this stuff is built on Open Standards and the nice thing about the space is that it moves at the speed of light in terms of like a bunch of companies coordinating on bringing something like sign with ethereum to life bringing other standards to life really just making sure that everything works so seamlessly and I just want to definitely shout out to all the folks besides myself working on Open Standards using Open Standards to really try to give users a better experience than what's out there because there's a lot of human coordination costs to it and that coordination cost is uh it's definitely there yeah public goods are good I feel like looking setting work is a uh is a public good eips or one of my favorite public goods that's uh totally that's definitely one of them yeah rude well uh Rocco keep up the great work and so great to have you on the pod thanks Kevin thanks for having me [Music]
