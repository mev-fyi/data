hey y'all a quick note before we get into this episode i initially recorded this on i think it was may 6th it was about a month ago and pretty shortly after i recorded this episode the market tanked and panic set in and it no longer felt like a good time to release this bonus content so we gave it a beat and we are releasing it now because today's episode is about land-like assets and and basically the decision by various metaverses and games to sell land in their games and whether or not that's a good strategy and it feels like it's coming back into relevance recently a16z released an article about gaming and land elluvium which is a big i think arguably aaa game one of the first aaa blockchain games coming out that has announced they're going to be releasing land as part of a game they're dropping so i wanted to bring this topic of metaverse land sales back up but do bear in mind this episode was recorded about a month ago so some of the information in here may be a little out of date or may feel slightly less relevant but i think generally speaking this is pretty evergreen content i hope you enjoy [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs we got a special episode today we may even release this as a bonus episode because i i pulled this together quickly in light of the other side yugo labs land drop uh there is somebody who has i've admired for a little while now who really specializes in evaluating land-like assets in gaming contexts and i wanted him to come on and chat all about it with me so today on the show i have lars dusay he's the co-founder of level labs which is an independent consultancy that does analysis of gaming generally but specifically does a lot of work analyzing blockchain games lars thank you so much for joining the pod so great to be here carly thanks for having me on okay i first heard you on a podcast talking about uh the problem with land-like assets in gaming contexts and specifically that you start to see dynamics play out like housing crises and and land shortages like we see in the real world which i thought was fascinating and we're going to apply this to things that axi is doing and maybe to think to the recent announcement by yugo labs but can you just start by giving giving maybe your overview what is a land like asset what is your what is your perspective on land like assets uh and and why i wanted to have you on the show here today right and so when i talk about a land-like asset what do i mean it means an asset that resembles the financial characteristics of land and so it doesn't mean you have an asset in your game and you just call it land because you can call it land and have it not behave like land and you can have things that you don't call land that do behave like land and so let's talk about what land is like right so in real life have you ever heard the phrase buy land it's the only thing they're not making any more of or maybe you've heard the term what are the three most important characteristics of real estate that drive location location yeah exactly and so basically a landline asset is any asset that fulfills in my opinion three characteristics one is it's necessary for production or you can interpret that as participation in the economic system you if you don't have it you can't play you know you must be a landowner second it um derives value from its location so it the same exact sort of asset over here is worth a lot more than if it's over here and then the third characteristic is that it has to be scarce and supply you can't make more of it and that can be either fulfilled naturally or can be fulfilled artificially and so one of the ways to create land-like assets is through government monopolies right you know if you restrict access to something artificially um you can create something that behaves like a land like asset and when i say like that can exist on a spectrum the most land-like asset there is is real world land right um but also um orbital real estate functions the same way like slots um also slots on the electromagnetic magnetic spectrum like i don't know what the kilohertz range is but like you know froggy 77.4 fm is occupying you know electromagnetic real estate and um domain names are arguably kind of a land like asset you know like is hamburger.com really being put to its highest and best use right now there's a reason it you charge more for hamburger.com than hamburger.fart or you know some unprecedented in theory wouldn't they not be it's not it's not scarce right the good ones are scarce but you you could have let me ask you i want to push on the the you need it to play right because it strikes me there's plenty of games where you'd have land like assets where you can be and you can be one of the people without land and play the game correct yes and in fact a lot of these virtual land economies are premised on the fact that there will be landowners and non-landowners so what it means is that it's so let's talk about necessary for production right so if you want to grow wheat you must own somewhere to grow the wheat um but in real life you need access to land to do anything you do when you think about it you don't necessarily need to own it but you need access to it and that's the key if you can't eat sleep work or even poop without access to land to do those things in and if you do those things in the wrong places or without permission bad things happen to you right even sleeping in the park um if you do not have permission to do so will get you hassled by the police right and so um people can charge for access to their land you know and this is one of the ways that owning land gives you unique leverage over the economy um there's that famous silicon valley um kind of cartoon which shows you know investors giving money to um companies and there's this landlord over in the corner who's got a giant vacuum cleaner that's like sucking the money out of the hands of the companies that came from the investors um and that's why that's exactly what's happening in silicon valley right now so to get to the point of production in games it means there are resources that can only be created ultimately springing from the land so the landowner so someone who's not a landowner can wind up with those assets but the landowners collectively decide how those resources get out they can and it gives them unique leverage over the entire economy and so um there can be a sliding scale of the asset of how land like it is depending on how many of those three properties it fulfills a good example would be what i call a permit is not have a locational basis it has two of the three properties it's necessary for production like you can't brew potions in the game unless you belong to the potions guild and the potions guild will only give grant 100 permits uh whatever time unit you know so each of those permits is fungible they're equivalent it doesn't matter where it is so to speak but it's necessary for production and they're scarce right um and so in one of my articles i talk about how the more land-like it is the more likely you are to have a recession and the less land-like it is the less likely that asset can be used as leverage over the entire economy as a speculative instrument the more speculation gets attached to the most land-like

friends so let me ask you a question obviously that's what we're here to do um i want to ask you a macro question i i've now been following some of your work and as like a simpleton i stepped away being like screw it metaverses shouldn't be based in land like like the metaverses should be completely that should not be how they monetize is is through land they shouldn't be selling land at all is that too strong of a viewpoint to come away with or do you agree when we're looking at these whether it's sandbox to central and other side axia infinity world that that this these shouldn't be land-based i completely agree you know um i think there are various ways to deal with the problem but it's under it's important understand what the problem is so why why do people want to sell land in the first place because it's a great way to get a lot of money so you can go make your game you could also sold effectively shares in the income that the game's going to generate but by selling land specifically you're doing two things is generally you're working off of the metaphor of land to set up the expectation that that land is going to be a land like asset right it's like i'm going to get real estate in this new world and i know how real estate works in the real world and so that therefore i have that expectation that that's how it's going to work in this game and when it causes the inevitable problems that it causes then people try to back off of it right because unlike the real world we can make more virtual land we just promised we wouldn't right and we can promise to change the rules of physics in the game so that you know we do what i call land dilution to like make it so that people can participate more and that tends to cause once you've already sold the land a landowner revolt because it's like hey dude i paid four thousand dollars for this thing i have a reasonable expectation that i'm not going to lose my entire investment and the whole point i played four thousand dollars is because i expected to have a net present value of income generated by my leverage over the economy that's going to happen and so instead of rewarding your investors with like just a share of the income you're going to make from the game you're rewarding investors basically with monopoly rights to extract value from other creators and here's the issue every land based game basically wants to be a ugc game essentially um user-generated content game right user-generated content and the problem is it's it it doesn't really make sense because if you have a user-generated content game i've worked in games for a decade for about a little over what year is it uh 12 years maybe let's say and um i'm very familiar with user generated content platforms i've consulted for valve and steam you know ship some code that's on the steam storefront page i'm very familiar with like steam workshop and stuff the classic problem every user generated content game has like roblox is a successful example of one is that when they first start out like you have a chicken or the egg problem like you're creating a tool set that will let people make content that will make people come to your platform but you need to have a bunch of awesome content before any players are gonna show up and start spending money and you need a lot of players to start showing up and spending money before any creators are gonna invest in a proprietary tool set and learn like like why would i invest in becoming a roblox developer if roblox is a ghost town only when it's already proven to be successful am i going to want to jump on that chain and so you typically have to basically spend a lot of money to solve one problem or the other and typically what you do is it's like here's our tools our tools are free hey developers come create we'll pay you to create is typically what you have to do these days um but this is like the opposite it sets up an artificial barrier it's like hey creators you need to pay rent to landlords uh what does the landlord do he owns the land so what what are they contributing to this ecosystem it's like he is a middle man we introduced into the system that um that charges you money and stands between you and the customer don't you want to build on my platform and it's like the very opposite of the so-called web3 ethos that we're supposed to have of removing middlemen and not having all of these inefficiencies c's and you know kind of illiberal aspects that everyone hates about web too it seems like we're adding more within this specific economic model and that's why i think it it's just got internal contradictions i think the reason people are so excited about it is because it provably raises you so much money up front and it does so by selling you promises and what's really interesting is one day those promises have to come due you have to ship something and then we immediately compare what is released with the promises we had in mind and then that's kind of when things fall apart well it's funny i think you you said at the start of this selling the land is sort of like selling shares of future revenue in this game ecosystem and right there you start to see the problem which is that or or to me what's a problem which is you you've just guaranteed or you've said you're going to get future revenue to the handful of people who were available and had the money at the time of your sale to buy your land rather than who's ever most productive or contributive contributive if that's a word to your ecosystem exactly but let me ask you this is there a world obviously ugc tends to be a big part of these these landed economies but is there a world where you have these games they're gonna sell land and then they're gonna make all the investment to just make it a really fun game and people will want to be on it like it can can can that can it play out that way where it's not ugc based well it just really depends on like what the land is for right i mean you can ship a game where you have something in it you call land but it doesn't behave in a way where it acts like land in the real world right where it's not only like asset and landline financial assets are all about gaining and cornering leverage over other people's productive activities things people want to do with that thing people making people need to charge money in order to get access to a scarce set of things that are required to do the things people want to do so um to kind of like give some concrete examples um sometimes games will have um like uh the landline assets will only be a part of the game so in ultima online which has had a housing crisis since it started going on like 20 30 years now i forget how old it is i forget how old i am um if it only affects the housing sector of the game if you don't care about houses you just want to go play dungeons and stuff like the recession doesn't affect you you know it's only if you want to participate in that part of the game but if you want to participate in that part of the game you got to pay out the nose to the people who've owned the land for 20 years um and so i don't think there's a way to escape this problem if you set it up this way um but going back to the whole point of shares is it's like it's all about how you reward people like um a good example is how the romans collected taxes you know if you ever read the bible you hear these people called publicans sometimes translate tax collectors everyone hates them there's a reason for that the roman tax farming system was the most regressive tax system in the universe it was like okay i need a thousand sisters or whatever to run the roman empire bob go give me a thousand sister sees he goes and b beats up two thousand people to get two thousand sister sees and keeps a thousand and the other people each you know get twice as much as they were asked to receive and so like a hundred times as many like cistercies were collected as were necessary for the running of the government and there's massive dead weight loss and just a bunch of thugs beating people up and so it's like you can collect the revenue for your economy that way or you could collect it another way and um so i know selling shares in crypto takes us on the whole world of like avoiding becoming a regulated security but the basic premise is hey investor you provide me with capital i need capital i'm gonna make this game i'm gonna make it valuable and make people wanna play it they're gonna pay me five dollars because they wanna play the game and it's fun that's gonna create ongoing revenue maybe they'll subscribe whatever my business model is adds sales who cares that will generate income you deserve a share of that income as a return on your capital that's one way the other way is i'm going to create a world where people are going to be in it they're going to trade amongst each other there's going to be economic activity and i'm giving you permission to extract economic value between transactions of people trying to do stuff in the game and that imposes economic dead weight loss because it imposes a marginal cost on people's productivity so it's going to make you know the rule is if you tax something you get less of it so if you tax people's incomes and gains privately by setting up private tax agencies which are what which is what landlords are they are private tax collectors um then you're gonna get less of whatever the activity of the game is which in most cases is some form of ugc and i think you can expand ugc abstractly enough to cover basically anything that we've seen and land-based games so far there may be other things um but so far i it kind of stretches the definition of ugc a little but it still broadly applies to everything i have personally seen there may be more that i have not come up with yet there may be possible that i haven't imagined but that's mostly what i've seen so far if that answers your question in a roundabout way yeah well i think what i hear you saying is like no my premise doesn't make sense you can't have a land game where you don't need ugc because any activity on there you could consider ugc and the fact that you have certain people owning land is going to impact the amount of ugc you get either because you're going to turn certain people away because they're not going to want to pay whatever the tax sort of is this private tax is or quite literally you're not going to have as many people willing to build on land because they can't afford it so either way you slice it right by having private ownership of land you're disincentivizing activity in the ecosystem or you're implementing a whole group of people or you're redefining land to the point that it's not a land like asset like you can just make more land at which point that's not how land really behaves that's that's clearly not what axi or other side or any of these are doing by or they're just going to piss off a lot of people that are holding their land let's actually talk about that in the context of axi because this is something we saw recently which is axi land holders being quite disgruntled many of them bought into axiland like a couple years ago in some cases and i think actually recently implied that they might be providing free land maybe not even applied i think they said you know that that might be something that's coming so all the existing land holders feel like you're going to dilute my purchase before you even built anything on it um talk a little bit about what we're seeing play out with axey and your opinions of it this was exactly what i predicted they would do um in my deconstruction for novik that's one of my consulting clients that i write for uh so this article i wrote axe infinity infinite opportunity infinite apparel co wrote with some people at novik was widely signed in a bunch of places like cnn and the virgin was it bloomberg or i forget but um anyway we predicted that they would do this it's called land dilution and it's a way to make your land like asset less land-like by while still calling it land and because it's just not scarce anymore it's like it's like money it's like the federal reserve can just print more money right his money really scares and so you have those three properties you can you can basically fudge on one or more of those properties you can keep it scarce but you can make it so that you can participate in production in other ways which reduces the leverage of the landowner or you can print more land which reduces the leverage of the landowner you know that that attacks the scarcity aspect or you can make it so that the location doesn't matter much a good example for this is like oh there's teleporters now so it's like well now the guy on pluto has just as much access to times square as i do so i don't have that unique leverage i had and so i actually kind of you know as much as i you know have my gripes about land ownership and stuff like that it's like i kind of you know i understand very rationally why the landowners feel this way they're like in a way they're right to feel this way because it's like you feel grieved in the axi infinity case they were made a promise that they were going to get an asset that would behave this way you know whether it was explicit or not the marketing implied when you say it you're selling land it's really clear that this is what you're selling that's why we're using the real estate metaphor and it's the promise of there's going to be this world and i'm going to own a piece of manhattan and that's only going to go up in value and we can talk about locational effects and the fact that your neighbor your your competitor can always create a new virtual world that land can never truly be scarce in a virtual world that's its own subject um but the point is is that it's like it dilutes the net present value of those gains and all this time there's all these other opportunities so the so i've locked up my asset in this i have locked up money in axi land which took away from my ability to invest in any number of other things right which are all like and there's so much fomo to be had at any moment of well that went to the moon and that went to the moon that went to the moon while i'm holding this bag and now this guy's telling me that he's you know gonna gonna change the conditions of this and now it's also been delayed right so they're right to feel this way um i i very much sympathize with with all of the gripes about them and i predicted that they would happen um because the um i'm sorry i lost the threat for a second there but but the whole premise of it is that they're expecting this game to be delivered and that they're going to be able to operate on these terms and then that didn't happen or there's the problem well you know i i there were some people who were like i i gave a whole rant about why i think uh hugo labs totally messed up by selling land for other side one of which is i'm like hugo labs should be shooting as big as possible like they should be shooting to be the oasis from ready player one where everybody is logging into the hugo labs other side metaverse and this is not that this is not that ambitious this is a hundred thousand plots of land i think i apparently erred and said fifty five thousand and it's actually gonna be a hundred thousand that doesn't that's so that's such a trivial point in the broader context of what i'm trying to say right which is it's a limit and people like well this can be solved in all sorts of ways and i'm like look is is there a world where maybe they are able to deliver a lot of value to these first initial land holders which then means it's at the expense of other players and then additionally expand and create some huge universe that can come become the oasis and everyone's happy because ultimately all the consumers can play in the oasis and these these initial land holders get a return yeah maybe they can do all of those things but um it feels like they're setting themselves up for a a a harder a harder road right than uh starting from that place there's two things there's two things to talk about one i want to say something about common land that you talked about earlier like free land and then second yes it sets up an inevitable conflict which is the oldest conflict in human history which is the landowners and the landless why do we have wars what is the number one cause of war you have the land and i want it that is that like almost any war can be summed up by that fundamental conflict why do peasants rebel against the king beca or the or more frequently the noble sometimes the king will ally with the peasants against the noble but like why do the peasants rebel against the people above them because they own the land and we don't why do slaves rebel against their slave owners because they own the land and us but you know and and yeah some extra dynamics that play in slavery but yes yes but even after slavery was abolished the leverage of landowners still allowed a very slave-like operation through sharecropping to persist because they didn't get 40 the slaves didn't get 40 acres in a mule it's like they had to go right back to their former owners and who still maintained a lot of leverage anyway that had a ton of leverage because they they owned land right and all of the social forces that's a whole other subject but yeah and so anyway so talking so you basically set itself up where the problem with most blockchain games already is they don't have enough users right actually kind of got around that by just paying people to play which caused its own problems but um if you compare these games daily active users monthly actor users to other games it's like like good user counts for blockchain is a phrase right and it's like significantly lower than what we tend to see in other much more successful video games and um so putting this land ownership requirement on it like i just measured the axi land and it was like i i don't have it in front of me but like 30 or 40 accounts on half the land now i'm sure some of those are guilds that hold land and trust of however many hundreds or thousands of investors are in there but like how how concentrated ownership of the guild i'm sure like a couple of people owned more than half the guild so however you spool it out there's not that many bag holders of land and um it fundamentally limits participation and then i'm talking about the free land going back to land dilution it's really interesting all these metaphors have all happened before they all have precedent in real life so in england very famous have you ever heard of the luddites right that's an insult we have for people who don't like progress but the luddite revolution was actually about land rights and it was about the fact because if you want to build a factory in europe to do this industrial revolution there are key points of leverage on the map specifically places with access to water power in order to run mills and so previously a lot of land in england was held in common it was anyone could use it which means that um you know the average peasants you know in a sense were richer than they could have been because they didn't need to pay rent to access this common resource they just shared it but the government of england you know big government came in and enclosed the land and gave it out as favors to private interests who then invested capital and the peasants did not have the ability to pool capital or um or charge collective rent as a community to a capitalist who wanted to build a um investment on the river and so they um took it out and they took it out on the factory owners in the luddite rebellion and this was framed as being anti-technology but at the root cause of it was a struggle over land rights and so common land is this the natural state of the world and then it gets enclosed in parcels and shared out to private interests who leverage it against others so it's really interesting to see common land free land coming back as a policy idea and then landowners being very threatened by it for obvious reasons you know um and especially you know when it didn't exist in the first place you sold on this premise it's a breaking of your promise and so no wonder they're upset anyway i want to talk about solutions yes i want to talk about solutions you've proposed once you've already sold land i want to talk about alternative ways to be designing these metaverses and monetizing them if you are hugo labs for example but there was an example i heard you give at one point that i thought was interesting about um it was microsoft and the arcade they're like limited space in their arcade games for xbox yeah that i thought was interesting can you can you um explain to folks what happened there okay so xbox live arcade was in the microsoft xbox 360 was one of the first innovators to have digital distribution um they totally let steam eat their lunch for breakfast like they should have they were there first with digital distribution it was really cool and they could have had this like big thing um and it was really innovative at the time so you could just go onto xbox 360 xbox live and like download games and pay for them this was completely new it was so cool um and um but they artificially limited how many slots there were and this is normal okay like it's probably really like intensive and there's a lot of hands-on work to like ship console games at the time like even if digital shell space isn't scarce like just being able to manage all those really for bunch complicated reasons won't go into maybe they only have the capacity to ship 50 games a year so they artificially limited these slots of how many games they were gonna ship but their management regime allowed um what we call a um a natural resource rent to accrue to those slots because they just gave them out to people they they didn't like be like okay we have 50 games they weren't discerning about it right right they were just like hey um namco you get five ubisoft you get six and i'm sure there was some deal where they did that but then namco would go around and be like oh ubisoft would be like oh hello i see you i can't do a french accent despite my last name it's like i see you want one of my slots you will have to pay zerent if you want this lot you know and so they had this like real negotiating power over anyone who didn't have a direct relationship with microsoft because it's like there's only three slots left this year oops two are already gone this is the last one you know so you had to like you had a i was trying to publish an xbox 360 game at the time and there was this random weird little like fourth rate publisher that had this slot and we had to like try to negotiate with them and it went really badly we wound up not getting the deal um because they artificially constrained this and then managed it in a very haphazard and unthinking way and again the the lesson there to me is that you're not letting the best content bubble up it's what you're what what you're losing if you're microsoft is having the best content on your arcade games because it becomes who can afford to put a game on here and that's that gets us back to the ugc problem if you sell land uh and you're in any way reliant on on ugc or i guess specifically the kind of ugc where you're actually building on the land in some capacity you're not optimizing for who's going to create the best experience you're optimizing for who can afford it who was around when you sold it um not things you should be optimizing for and not just who can afford to pay rent but people who can afford to negotiate with the landlords because in um just like in real life we are now starting to see the beginnings of virtual homeowners associations and virtual nimbies who are artificially like there's people in the sandbox who are complaining about the fact that someone built something ugly next to their land and so they're starting to talk about we need to exert governance we're supposed to have governance as landowners right so we need to have on-chain governance that's going to make it so that you have to get a vote of all your neighbors before you can build in the sandbox and so it's like this will lead us to solutions is is there ever a context in which you think land should be sold in a virtual game are there contexts in which this is the correct yeah well i think you just um so i don't think you should start with the idea of a landlike asset you can wind up there right um i don't think you should see it as a goal but if you find yourself winding up there there are ways to deal with it um and there's a lot of weird and interesting ways to deal with it and so the most important thing to realize is why do locations hold value they hold value because of people because manhattan has some properties i'm sure because of the conflicts of like rivers and stuff that makes particularly valuable but the reason it's valuable now is very different from the reason it was valuable 300 years ago the reason it's valuable now is because there's a bunch of people there italian restaurants what no yeah an italian restaurant and like the food i i stay in new york city because i want the food unlimited at 3am is why i'm still here right right you know and it's like if you were to take that same italian restaurant put in the middle of nevada the value to that italian restaurant would be less than if it's like oh i have new york city here that's providing value to me and so it's it's this agglomeration effect so even if you have an infinite plane of infinite land as america approximately is because like we got plenty of land in nevada you know it's because the agglomeration effect is what we call an economics like value accrues when people cluster because people your neighbors create value like an aura of value just shining off of themselves and that value is captured by private um landowners in the value of land that's what's going up when land is going up in value and so talking about solutions you know so if you wind up with a game that has a sense of location you're going to wind up with land like assets sometimes whether you want to or not and then you have to and again just to really make a fine point on this the alternative would be okay suddenly teleport is allowed teleporting is allowed in the game you could solve that that makes the consumers happy but now the landlords are mad because that's diluted the value of their land and you sold them land telling them it was going to be valuable or worth something so that's just want to really make it explicit that that problem that you paint yourself into and also you've also changed the nature of your game it has a diminished sense of place if you can teleport anywhere right so it's not just financially different it's it's it's just completely different it's like there's if you want to create these gathering hubs and like towns and stuff adding a little friction from a game design perspective can be good sometimes you don't want to perfectly like like there's a lot of games it's like i want to have like a bustling bazaar well now you can't have an auction house because if the market's too efficient you don't have the hustle and bustle right so there's there's game design considerations and not just financial dis dis considerations but if you want to talk about solutions um so let me talk about one that's probably pretty salient a lot of people have had experience with reddit r slash place is a really interesting experiment in land ownership and land management rights and it uses what i call an attention tax to determine who gets to hold the land and it's just it's kind of the way animals allocate land in nature is just by like i'm here if you want it more you come and like basically shove me off me for it yeah you know in another way like uh in my paper i call it you know like blood taxes where basically like combat is a way we allocate land in real life it's easy usually easier to defend than to attack and i'm not gonna invest more in protecting this land than it's worth so if i have like like when we were playing reddit place me and my friends so like i was with team georgist and george can you explain what reddit r slash place is because i don't know reddit place is this great experiment it's a giant canvas and it's got like 12 colors of pixels every five minutes you can place one pixel or maybe it was every one minute i forget that's it that's the whole game and people are building collaborative mosaics and so how do you get to draw a cool picture you get all your friends and you collaborate like this is our picture and our discord fellas okay let's click here click here click here oh no the swedes are coming and so it'll be this giant swedish flag and it's just marching towards you and you're like put up a barrier and then like right next to you you know will be like a transgender flag or something and it's like we must protect our transgender allies because they are our buffer state between the swedish menace and us and if their nation falls then we will surely fall and it's like oh no the swedes have have taken over that territory it's like that's okay they're a refugee state now we've allocated this land for them so they can come out here and they'll protect us from the finns who are advancing from the south oh my gosh you know wait and so how did you win land through blood in in that so blood in blood taxes it's like i use that in my paper to talk about like in a game where you have like little armies that go and take land right you don't pay money for land you pay blood you know but so you weren't using that in in the plate in this reddit place scenario there wasn't there wasn't a blood opportunity we're fighting but we're fighting with attention got it you know we're fighting with fighting attention it's sweat instead of blood and time and so like you'll a good example would be like we were and you would make allies right you know we would have the neo-liberals were below our section and we were the georgias georgia's our economists who care about land and we had our little um our banner and we had an alliance with the neoliberals because they were bigger than us so they would maintain our banner against incursions i love nerds so that we could so so that because we were a buffer state for them and they liked us you know and then we noticed that it's like well we want to expand this text here we have two small font let's do it in a bigger font and then it would get erased we're like oh our allies are giving friendly fire because um because they don't know that we're trying to do that and they think it's vandalism so let's send some diplomats to their discord to explain the situation they're like it wasn't us bro and then we check the links and it's like oh it's coming from the furries our neighbors to the east i didn't even know they were our allies and they're like yeah we're just protecting you guys because we're going to be next if okay we'll work this out so anyway my point is there are emergent ways of managing these things there's no permanent ownership there's no title in our slash place it's just do you care enough to be here can you see a context like this could this be a solution in like the axi game world or it's it's that's unlikely to work as a solution first like i'm trying to this is how anchor us in the context of this is how even meta versus this is how eve online allocates land essentially but they do it with weapons so okay there's turf wars all the time in eve online and it reddit scishow slash place is a really anxiety filled thing you gotta be on 24-7 to maintain that and so a lot of people have like a problem with the fact that it's like i'd like some security like even if i don't am not a permanent owner of land maybe i could be like a tenant for a while you know it's really obnoxious that i got to sit here and defend it so i bring up bar slash place and eve is kind of like the state of nature right you know and then there's the state of maximum privatization which is what's going on in your typical blockchain land games so is there something in the middle that's more reasonable and this is um probably getting at the solutions you're interested in and so first of all i don't think you should artificially create land like assets but if you find yourself with them anyway then here's how to deal with them and one of them is what we call a land value tax this comes from georgism which is my economic philosophy it's been proven to work in a lot of situations it's also um closely associated with the notion of universal basic income and you'll be familiar with ubi from your time on the yang campaign amen baby yeah an ubi fan yeah and so land value tax basically says we ought to tax it's similar to a property tax but it's very importantly different in one respect we don't tax the building just the land right so in san francisco it's very easy to find like a house that costs like three million dollars and an empty lot next door of the same size it costs like 2.75 million dollars so like do the math the land is worth 2.75 million dollars the structure's worth like quarter million you're mostly paying for the dirt you know and so if you tax the dirt at its rental value like the value to basically park a bunch of cars there all year right the income you could get from just like charging for parking there um if you were to charge that value every year you remove the entire speculative income of the property right you return that to the community as say a universal basic income and because you're taxing the one asset that no one can make more or less of you break the rule of taxation that says if you tax something you get less of it you don't get any less land because you can't because no one produces it so let me see do i understand this right so you're saying uh let's use the san francisco land example uh okay if you build a house on here and the house is worth three million dollars but the empty lot next door is worth let's say two and a half million that house has a an a value of of really basically half a million yeah so you're saying charge the person charge the the you know tax people at two and a half million a year if you have that plot of land not because with that oh no not quite because i'm not charging you 100 of the value of the land i'm charging you the rental value of it like basically if i was going to rent that land from you out from under you somehow charge you that amount each year okay so that's a number that we haven't identified in this hypothetical is that what you're saying right well what you do in practice is anything called a capitalization rate it's between five and ten percent so five and ten percent because you're not gonna tax on the whole you're not going to charge them you're not going to try to tax the whole thing annually because that would make no sense so basically it has to be some number that's right less enough the the actual just like lump sum value of it let's say say the empty lot is a parking lot how much income is it generating a year tax on that okay and then because what that does is it incentivizes them to do something productive with the land and not just be a speculator who sits on it it means you're going to lose money if you just sit on it but if you're going to build something productive on it where you can make more than whatever that rental tax is then great and so it incentivizes you being productive with the land is that what you're describing that's exactly what it does and this was um tested empirically in eve online and it worked um and what's so funny is the economist who did it had no idea who what georgism was or henry george the guy who created the george's philosophy he independently rederived it this has happened multiple times they just independently rederive it from first principles because it solves this problem and um so what we're talking about is when you implement a perfect land value tax where you tax away the whole passive rental speculative value of the land the selling price of the land drops to zero um it still generates that rental income but that's redirected to the community so what basically happens is that the land becomes basically free to buy but expensive to hold and so if you're gonna hold the land you're basically renting it from the community so if you're gonna rent this land and we'll use the rent to pay ubi or whatever we want to do um then i need to justify it i need to make it's like if i've got prime land in the middle of new york city and there's a parking lot there and you're charging me all the income i could make of having it as a dumb parking lot i need to do something more valuable with it like build at least a parking garage because every floor of that garage is free income for me above the value of just the boring land income value or let's say i have like a hot dog stand on land on a giant lot in the middle of new york city it's like people want that for housing people want that for restaurants people want that for a million things and that bids up the price so if i am just willing to put a hot dog stand on it i'm going to sell that land right and a bunch of other people are too and that's going to depress the price of land it's going to end the housing crisis has been you know pretty empirically demonstrated and um it's going to make it so no one wants to hold on to land unless they're going to do something that justifies holding onto it living a bankless life

short on time because you have a hard stop here in a few minutes and and the the final question i want to get to is alternative ways to build a metaverse so starting from first principles okay screw this whole land thing and i want to get your thoughts on that but but i i just want to stay on this point and and make it crisp so this would be something that hugo labs with their other side land or let's let's use it because you know it's a little bit ambiguous to what they're doing this the sandbox might choose to do this you have all these people who buy this the sandbox land we know they do it speculatively right they're just holding it they're not themselves game developers they're holding it because i think it's going to be valuable down the line this would eliminate the incentive for them to do that so that the land ultimately winds up in the hands of somebody who's going to do something interesting and productive with it and create more value for the sandbox as a whole make more users want to come join it whatever etc is that the idea yeah you know i think it's hard when you've got one of these games that has leaned so hard into them to switch gears even with a perfect policy without triggering a total collapse that comes from a landowner revolt right the best approach is never to set yourself up for a landowner revolt in the first place but um yuga labs and the sandbox you know there's other approaches rather than the land value tax the point is to capture that that that ground rent we call it the land rent you can do that by you're the game developer you can just rent it all out on short-term leases right that's a good way to do that um to create a metaverse without it i think we can look at stuff like second life you know it's still around it's actually much bigger than people expect it's a lot bigger than all other crypto metaverses one of the things they do there is that the land isn't necessarily scarce right it expands as needed and locational values might still like attract to it but they don't have the hard speculative problems that you see in these things like you can do the land value tax you can do like short-term leases from um you know yourself as the game developer um you can do hard burger taxation that's a really nerdy approach that that might work um but you can also dilute land right and if you haven't set yourself up for a revolt that's been proven to work in a lot of cases so in the absence of land i want to talk about like monetization strategies like we talked about roblox as being a great example and i think this is a the perfect indictment in some ways of this alternative approach that these metaverses are taking because roblox has infinite land and it's so wildly popular it's many people's first understanding of a metaverse was understanding roblox and so here you have this perfect example and part of the reason it's so huge is network effects and there's that huge initial upstart cost that you described and you have to get people on there first it has to be fun for you pay developers to make it fun first and then and then more people come but once you have that network effect that flywheel is very powerful we see it in the way social social networks social media networks have succeeded and so it seems inevitable that the metaphors that come out most successful we'll be tapping into those network effects where everyone's there and they have a really strong moat because everyone's there because everyone else is there because everyone else is there and that's how you cement yourself that's why facebook for all of the reasons i don't think it'll do well with the metaverse is a formidable foe in this metaverse fight because they already have those network effects right okay so that's roblox but my understanding of how roblox um monetizes is is a couple ways but but a big way is selling robux right and that's this this centralized currency that you have to keep buying more of from roblox the centralized company yes what we're describing here are currencies like an apecoin that once you've bought some apecoin you're not you know once once hugo labs has utilized has its initial supply but ultimately i'm buying i'm not buying a coin from you or from my friend that's not recurring revenue into the hands of yuga labs specifically are there other monetization strategies that that a yugo labs could engage in that isn't selling land and isn't selling the currency so like if we even forget about land like let's just talk about the apes themselves right the whole yugolabs business model is based basically on selling passports to the metaphors or plots of land in the metaverse right and the problem with this is you have this big upfront sale and it's like trying to run a country club just on upfront purchases right real country clubs charge subscriptions folks that's how it works you know because there's ongoing maintenance issues and stuff and you know this place isn't going to hoity toity itself so you know like like like we need to like you know perfect the art of like twisting the little like sleeves of the sweater and you know holding tennis rackets just right that's not free so there's subscriptions there's ongoing costs for that and so i mean subscriptions is one answer but to put it in sharp relief they're doing this pre-sale of assets whatever those assets are and regardless of how land-like they are and then it's based on the promise that there's gonna be all these benefits and the promises on a lot of those benefits are gonna come from other people but where is the incentive for the other people to build those things right why should i honor what is effectively store credit from someone else's store what's in it for me right and so some people talked about like they'll be like provisions and smart contracts to like you know if you were to honor this or that nft and you're a metaverse like you would get some kind of something but there is a real recurring revenue problem that you point out and i don't have perfect solutions in place but i think you need to look to successful games and what they do is that they either are moving to subscriptions like so many uh live service games are i call it the subscription hilarity the subscriptionalarity is coming the moment at which all financial transactions or subscriptions of some sort um you know and then there's also just like making sure there's a reason to have ongoing payments you know um ultimately you can't build a system where more people are taking value out of it especially incur denominated currency than they're putting in like people need to receive an exchange at some point that's fairly consumptive that's like i put in five dollars and i ate the popcorn and i rode the ferris wheel and i had fun and i'm happy right mm-hmm you know what i mean and that yeah totally you know it's so funny because you i i've read some of your work and i i've listened to you before we hadn't actually and i'm sure you've written about it but i hadn't actually read or heard you talk about the alternative options but i landed in the same place again i had this whole rant that came out in this morning's episode of the pod and i was like make it a recurring revenue thing and you know i'm sure there's there's obviously there's no perfect scenario right there's there's gonna be anti-web three things with a subscription model but like i'm like it's hilarious the rest of the business world is obsessed with recurring revenue that is what every company is is trying to do right now and we have this funny dynamic in web 3 where it's like buy an nft one time life type benefits you know what i mean like lifetime access like we're we we follow a very different model right now yeah yeah that the community is kind of expected to create part i mean it's you don't have that in every case you have plenty of nfts where you've got you know gary vaynerchuk what he's doing it's like you know buy his nft for basically lifetime access to all the future things that gary vaynerchuk wants to build and you're making that bet on him um and then you're making the point which is another one i made which is like okay i'm a little bit sick now of of of paying money up front for promise benefits later like you've just raised how much money you go labs from vcs like go build something and then ask me for my money another way to like put this is that um co-ops right so one of the things that i as much as i am a crypto skeptic my favorite thing to do is to just hold people to their own standards and take them at their own words and let them believe in their own dreams and see if they're serious because sometimes they surprise me and it's delightful um so as much as i like to be a critic of web3 the ponies in unicorn version of web 3 is to actually fulfill this dream of decentralization you know because roadblocks like there's rent seeking in roblox and roblox is the rent seeker right instead of hiring private rent seekers they're just like we're collecting a higher share of profit than is strictly necessary for us to provide the services we're creating to properly incentivize to produce that and there's nothing you can do about it and our power only increases with every giving day right it would be interesting if you had a community that was able to run a successful ugc platform as a co-op of some sort where it's like it's a producer run co-op we're all in this together and if there's any like ground rents that arise and a ground run economically is a return that is a windfall profit that is much higher than necessary to induce people to produce what they're producing um then it would be great if that ground rent could belong collectively to the producers right you know this is what happens with every game platform when people like gripe about steam or epic or apples like cut they're griping about the fact that it's like they don't really need a cut that big but they have the leverage and there's no way to stop them and it would be nice imagine what us creators could do if our margins were a little better and if there was a system where we collectively owned this thing as producers in some sort of a co-op what's the cutting out the middle man it's why can't we have more of the reward falling to the producers creators rather than the middlemen and and this will be the the last thing we'll say because i i wanna you gotta hop off but is that that was also the irony to me is that you you've just artificially created a set of middlemen based not on their creative power but rather on the fact that they were free on a saturday night and that's the antithesis of the web 3 ethos and i i think that the irony there is um is rich okay i'm gonna uh thank you so much for joining here [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked
