people aren't talking about the thing that to me makes web3 utterly captivating as a builder as an entrepreneur as a storyteller for sure is that now based on what you have in your wallet i can customize an experience you could be walking in decentraland sandbox or our upcoming avatar space and a door appears to you because let's say you have one of our po apps that you see but your friend is like what door and then you open that door and you go inside and now get this customized experience and if those experiences have emotional resonance which is the key right now that's some of the energy that's missing from the part of the phase that we're in nfts right now which is largely a trading mechanism and look that's amazing and it's brought all the money and infrastructure and excitement and all of that and i'm standing on the shoulders of those giants i just know that if this ends up feeling like d fire the stock market then it will become the stock market it won't become the entertainment portion that i'm interested in
