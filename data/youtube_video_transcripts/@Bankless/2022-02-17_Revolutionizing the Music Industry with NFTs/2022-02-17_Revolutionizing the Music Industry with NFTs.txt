i feel that the old fan club is a broken model pay 900 bucks to meet the band shake their hand and you're on your way the vision i have is like the discord with everybody in there and the bots that are creating these fun games and a metaverse where people can join and um hang out and ideate and start their own bands and tickets and giveaways and poe apps for ticket stubs and the vips can be run through this nft sort of ecosystem um so that's one thing that bands have to be looking out for then the other is how they the relationship with the record label right the record label model is a model that made a lot of sense in the 70s 80s 90s and early 2000s and then streaming came along and you could upload everything right onto the internet and go straight to your fans when you look at the cut that they get from those earlier models it's you know up near 75 80 percent of an artist's you know income now if you change that revenue stream around and then the artist can share that back with the fans you you start finding some really cool ways to play with these things and i think from what i've seen the blockchain and nfts are really the only way to get that done
