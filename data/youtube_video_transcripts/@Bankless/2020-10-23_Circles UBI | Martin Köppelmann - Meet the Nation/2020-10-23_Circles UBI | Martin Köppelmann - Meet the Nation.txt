here with martin koppelman martin is the brain behind a ton of different uh crypto projects on ethereum uh mainly with gnosis but also with um you know digix no dx dao you have your fingers in uh with it with x exchange you have your fingers in and now also a new product called circles ubi martin can you kind of explain where circles ubi uh got its roots like where did the idea come from and why do we need it yeah it's actually has a it's quite quite longer story but um bottom line uh is um obviously as as many as others i got involved into crypto was was bitcoin and already back in 2012 or something like that i felt like yeah bitcoin is great but to some extent um it's still not necessarily fair or you could you could you could see you could find arguments why you would see starting a new currency could be done in a more fair way so that more people would uh participate from from from the start so the simple reality is easily 10 or something like that of the supply got to yeah i don't know very few people by i mean at least from perspective very few people so basically back then um uh yeah there was there was always almost the idea around okay let's do something like bitcoin but let's just uh do the um do the uh the distribution of tokens on a per person basis and usually uh usually um the problem that always occurs is kind of how do you verify that how do you check who is actually a person and specifically how do you do that without introducing a central authority if you have a state and you say everyone who has a passport okay that's easy but if you want to do it decentralized it's it's a somewhat hard problem um yeah and circles or circle tr always tried to address this problem and it was basically as an idea it was around yeah since the long time i think more or less the system was described and it's actually not too complicated five six years ago and was one of the reasons why i immediately got excited about ethereum because ethereum yeah it was it was always clear that ethereum would make it so much easier to implement such a thing and yeah i mean the other the other uh i would say the one one background is kind of just like bitcoin but more fair or fair money but but the other the other background is that it was always or for a long time uh i am super interested in ubi just like kind of completely regardless of um of cryptocurrency just as a political um yeah kind of a policy i actually think it would be super useful if states would would implement ubi for various reasons we can discuss them those as well but circles uh is also a way to say okay we want the ubi but we can organize it ourselves we don't need states for that so you can also see circles simply as a tool to enable people to give each other a upi okay so it sounds like what you're saying circles is a decentralized identity solution but it sounds like it is a decentralized identity solution as a means to support the circle's money or the circle's ubi asset right it sounds like the asset itself is the point of the project and the decentralized identity aspect is kind of just a means to achieve that goal is that correct exactly exactly exactly so primarily primarily it's a it's a it's a token or it's something like a currency you can discuss those terms and whether it's money or not whatever but yeah that's the primary goal and as you said the the identity system is just the way to get there okay fantastic so bitcoin itself is you know what what um one of my friends always says is it's a very much a merit-based system as in if if you want to be a viable miner you need to you know fight tooth and nail for efficiency right and so it's it's always about like your abilities and your resources that you have available to you in order to become a a bitcoin miner and the same thing with right and owning bitcoin you have to pay for it which means that people that have abilities and merit and financial resources can get more bitcoins and so it sounds like circles is trying to do the exact opposite of that which has you know ubi values baked into it where ubi is very much a non-merit-based system it is a a um what's the right word it's just like a unconditional it's unconditional you just get ubi why are you interested in making a currency that has those values baked into it yeah so i i think the important thing is that this unconditional system should be the basis so of course i very much believe in merit-based or could even call it capitalism or whatever you want but but those things in my view should be on top so the idea is um the ubi and whether circles how quick circuits could achieve that or not that's a separate question but let's just talk about the ubi um the unconditional part enables you to then do to the basically to to work and to create value so so you need to start somewhere and and circles or ubi gives you this starting point and from there you can uh well hopefully create a ton of value and thrive and to build great stuff so when circles got introduced the twitter the twitter world just kind of blew up with all everyone trying to verify everyone else and everyone was posting their profile hey will you verify me and then when people would get verified by sharing their their profile with three other people who would say i trust this person a system of vouching which is how identity works uh people would get their account quote unquote verified and then they would get a distribution of 50 circles uh and so and and then there's also an issuance policy for circles moving forward can you kind of uh explain how circles the asset that the money how it comes to be and the issuance and monetary policy moving forward yeah exactly so so it's actually it starts with an issuance rate of eight circles a day so the 50 that you just get as a starting point will soonish not be very relevant um so yeah it's kind of um heavy inflation and the 50 are really just meant to be um yeah so that if you kind of get started you can immediately like just try it out but long term that those won't be really relevant um and in addition to the eight eight units a day uh there is in addition a seven percent increase of those eight units uh a day every year so next year it won't be eight units per day but eight plus seven percent and so on so it will increase every year by seven percent and basically the seven percent and there are a few uh um reasons to get there but but just high level let's say the eight percent would just be flat uh sorry the eight units would just be flat then over time um the it already existing money would would of course linearly grow uh but the the eight percent per uh per day would be fixed so in the far future the newly minted currency would be basically irrelevant because there's already so much but if we increase the um if we always increase the the the amount that will be newly minted then at the end of the day will stabilize between the ratio of newly minted tokens compared to already existing tokens will stabilize and it will actually roughly stabilize stabilize at those seven percent so in the far future there will be a seven percent um roughly a seven percent increase per year given a constant population okay so this monetary policy is similar to bitcoin in the sense that it is uh planned and you can uh project it out concretely into the future but it's dissimilar from bitcoin in the sense that it's pretty inflationary right we're inflating the supply at seven percent a year and the purpose of that is to incentivize people to spend circles is that the is that the goal uh yeah i mean that's one aspect and again uh there is this fairness aspect so if you i mean if you one way one way to look at it at the system like bitcoin is let's imagine you have an island of 100 people live there and they kind of or somehow 100 people come together on an island and someone decides okay let's let's use a currency or let's introduce a currency um and one guy has has all the currency and says to everyone else yeah let's use this one i mean now obviously the other 99 wouldn't be a big fan of that idea because well it seems unfair why why is this currency and i mean like on a global perspective that's that's kind of comparable with the bitcoin situation so probably less than one percent of the world population currently has has bitcoin so this one percent basically tries to convince the other 99 oh let's use this currency by the way we already own uh 95 or i don't know exactly 90 of it but just let's use it um and circles uh would be would be a way to uh yeah kind of makes this fair and even fair in in time and space that's kind of because even if future generation even for future generations it would be fair because if you say okay there are those hundred people everyone gets one one percent then kind of as soon as the next person comes uh well then basically that guy is screwed because uh all the other 100 or kind of a new person is born let's say the next day that this person's screwed or kind of you could argue it's unfair to this person or that person at least would have an incentive to say well let's come up with a new system let's say a system where we well just take now or account for me as well so in that sense circles tries to be fair forever so always even for um upcoming generations okay so i always like comparing this to bitcoin because there's a lot of overlap with with the values of this project and bitcoin but this project just kind of spins it in a different way a lot of bitcoiners uh speak about bitcoin and how incredibly fair it was from a distribution perspective because no one particular person got to have privileged access to bitcoin say for maybe satoshi nakamoto but we can eliminate him from the equation because he hasn't spent any of his coins right and so no one no one really was able to access bitcoin earlier than anyone else anyone could have accessed bitcoin at the same time and therefore bitcoin is relatively fair in the sense that there's no privileged parties and what uh circles ubi is trying to do is trying to uh turn this on its head but keep the fairness where it it you know some people got earlier access to bitcoin even though it wasn't privileged access they still got earlier access and that gives them the supply of the currency and circles ubi seems to be ensuring that everyone perpetually gets fair access to the distribution no matter what point of space or time that we are in no matter what yep very cool so is the how do circles actually become valuable so uh do they are they trading like i mean i guess they just came out into the market but what's the process for you know we call it universal basic income but it's not income unless these things actually have a secondary market value so where does that come from yeah so one very very important thing is to note is that circles are not or not fully fungible so basically your circle and mind circle are different for that reason it will be also unlikely for the foreseeable future that um it will trade or circles as a general concept um yeah will will not be tradeable because there is not this one circuit coin there are currently 12 000 different users or accounts that each have their their individual circles uh that's that's point number one um so how do they get value um one thing is that it can be it can be very very local um so it can just be a group of five people that decides with each other okay we five we we trust each other we are connected and we are actually not even really connected to the outside world but just within this group we decide to grant each other basic income you could always see it as an insurance policy um that that that we are saying okay if everyone's well off we don't need it really but if someone of us currently needs financial help basically the other guys because they the other guys would then accept the money of that person uh in a way the other four guys would then support this this one guy um so that's one way how how you can can get value into the system the the i also have to say the situation we saw on twitter was only uh one part so the circles app was actually designed specifically not for the crypto twitter world and not for existing crypto users it was designed for basically a local group here in berlin and of course it should go it should go to other groups but but in berlin is where we started it um and and on friday not visible for the for the twitter crowd because it was yeah like an in-person event or people might there be also on twitter but not really in the crypto sphere there was an um in-person event in berlin and in berlin there are like probably currently 10 15 physical places where uh yeah where there's the community uh where yeah some vendors decided to yeah all start selling their their um their things for circles um yeah maybe you're familiar with andrew yang in his kind of uh policies in the united states in one of them which is ubi but he also talks about this uh parallel economy that he wants to spin up with uh social credits i think is what he called where he uh said like you know people and and other economies have used this model in different ways where um you know there's the money that a society has but then different uh like side economies have spun up this parallel currency which is basically like tokenized favors where like you know it was a a mother of one household didn't have cash to pay for a birthday cake for her son but instead she just did favors for that person and then they use a different denomination that's separate from like the us dollar currency or the local currency of the economy but instead uses this secondary credit system uh to compensate people for that and so it's basically saying like hey this isn't money but it is still a token of favor right which you can then redeem and i'll do favors for you is that this is that the kind of gist yeah so so one one uh i i want to quote one message that made us really happy from from us from the circles team so someone wrote i'm a small landlord some of my rents are struggling to pay every month after covert so i'm going to offer them to pay partly with circles if they also accept circles in their business like a bazaar vape vapor store little coffee bar this will create some momentum in a very very poor neighborhood in cadiz uh spain one of the most unemployed cities in europe yeah so exactly that's uh that's one way to yeah and then really important to understand that circles um should or will be a very local uh local thing yeah and that goes back to what i was saying where you know bitcoin got bootstrapped by like it's it's complete fairness in its distribution as in like no one was privileged in accessing it accessing it and it sounds like this landlord is also interested in bootstrapping circles due to its fairness right and so people and individuals who have made their circles wallet gotten their first distribution of circles are interested in using circles simply because it's a tool that is credibly neutral which is something that we talk about on the bankless podcast all the time it seems like circles are trying to maximize their credible neutrality and leverage the value that people see in credible neutrality which is why it's got to be a quote-unquote ubi an unconditional distribution of money i think that's one aspect but but it also really is simply also a tool uh for yeah for people that that want to support others to support to to to to do the support in a um in a um within some structure so basically this landlord i mean he could also decide to kind of just forgive the rent or something like that but now they are getting circles okay i mean worst case those circles won't be worse anything but good case um they are now getting paid circles but at some points they can they can later yeah do do something or kind of go to this coffee shop or have a friend that then goes to the coffee shop and so on yeah so it sounds like circles won't become valuable by trading on binance or trading on coinbase but instead they'll be valuable because you can get someone in your local area to help you do something which is kind of what money is but in a different roundabout way yeah so i mean circuits of course also tries to to has at least the potential to scale so again you can have this this is um it's a small group of or yeah of yeah really just local people that that uh somehow ex expect that okay i'm doing something for you and later later then i have the circuits and then um i i get something in return um now circuits has this yeah it's also trust connections and they are transitive so that means i don't need to be directly connected with the person um i'm interacting it is enough if i'm connected to someone who's connected to someone and so on and in theory the system we believe has the potential to to to to to scale um yeah globally but um it's also very possible that it will remain or there will be some simply some some areas that that will remain fairly um yeah closed i guess and not a lot of money is is flowing uh outside or inside or yeah or is basically the transacting across so i want to turn to how circles was actually deployed on the quote-unquote the blockchain right so you guys didn't deploy on l1 you guys went straight for l2 can you talk about that yeah so um i mean the simple reason is obviously transaction fees are high uh on ethereum which is a nice thing because it means a lot of people wants to use it want to use it but for circles it was way way way too high so we literally expect or hope that people will pay their coffee and do their yeah i don't know two dollar something like that transactions with with circles and um yeah for that ethereum mainnet is is not not usable so yeah we went directly to xty which is um the system that has the highest compatibility to to ethereum it's almost equivalent to like from a technology technological uh point of view and still has very low transaction costs um of course because it compromises uh to some extent on decentralization so she uses proof of authority it just has i don't know 11 validators um but the good thing is um circles would still also be forkable so um if if it would ever be a problem that this is this pure network i don't know kind of something weird would happen it would get shut down or it would would i don't know then then it would fairly easily be possible to fork circles fantastic well it's uh one thing that me and ryan are really excited about are seeing projects deploy straight on l2s rather than starting on l1 and then moving to an l2 it's a pretty interesting growth and phenomenon in the ethereum space martin if people are interested in helping grow circles and helping it succeed what should they do yeah so we are currently trying to support that but um yeah the the the main idea would be that that people locally uh find together so so basically uh there is already a list of uh 40 places where people have have of kind of signaled interest in sao paulo in in in spain in china surprising or at least it wasn't so much on my radar but so far it seems like a good fraction of the current first circles users or people that are trying circuits are coming from china um so uh ideally at all those places there would be yeah meet up groups if corona would allow it uh physical physical meetups and people that locally organize around this idea let's give each other a basic income and let's start this kind of alternative for parallel um economy so that's definitely one way um another way is of course if you're a developer then there are plenty of things to do we got completely overloaded by by the um by by user demand so we just had a and it's a two developer team uh and it was yeah we were not really prepared for that interest so there are a lot of things uh be that that can be developed and then of course um yeah there needs to be a full cultural and norm discussion or kind of like what are the what is the social contract of circles i guess that's also yeah big upcoming um i think that will form over time as well yeah absolutely and i i think the best thing that maybe if people want to actually put this into practice is just you know get your friends to download the app get your family to download the app and maybe if you guys need to trade favors you know carry in the groceries costs five circles or something you know and that kind of like spins out from there like it starts it seems to me like circles is trying to be a very bottom-up movement rather than a top-down movement so it needs to be bootstrapped by stewards who use the system yeah so i mean just just as an example so in in berlin and soon hopefully in other places as well we have those yeah kind of just the telegram group of a marketplace uh i mean a marketplace that's i mean like basically like craigslist where people uh yeah post stuff they maybe use stuff they want to sell or yeah things like that cool fantastic martin thank you for coming on the meet the nation to help us learn all about circles ubi if people want to learn more where should they go yeah um so far uh our website join circles uh you need to check lights.com.net but you'll find it yeah the twitter account forum and hopefully many or many developing telegram groups fantastic awesome we will get those things linked in the show notes martin thanks for coming on to meet the nation all right thank you thanks for having me
