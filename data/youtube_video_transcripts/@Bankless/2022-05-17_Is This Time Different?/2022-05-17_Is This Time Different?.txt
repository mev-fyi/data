you think that maybe this bear cycle in crypto is faster than 2018 2019 yeah it feels structurally different but you know it's very difficult when markets like this when everything looks absolutely terrible you know it's very easy to extrapolate the worst but generally speaking it feels that it's going to be shallower and shorter because i don't think it's driven by the halving cycle any longer i think this is driven by the macro and i think as ethereum has become a more dominant ecosystem over this cycle its own kind of triple halving or whatever you want to call the uh eath to merge is going to be another factor within this market i think the structure of the markets changes and that's just how things evolve over time so i think the structure has changed i think it's going to be shorter because we think the macro cycle's shorter so it's short and brutal but it's not been as brutal as the past ones because the past ones were crushing bear markets don't forget this time in 2018 we were down huge i can't remember what we were down in bitcoin by the 2018 fed pivot but that was the low
