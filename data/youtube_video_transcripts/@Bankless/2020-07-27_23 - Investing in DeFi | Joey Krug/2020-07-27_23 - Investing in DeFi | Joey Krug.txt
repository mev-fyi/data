[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today sir doing just fantastic ryan we had joey krug on the bank list podcast for those that don't know joey is the founder of the auger protocol but even before that joey was a member of the bankless community before the bankless community was a community and so it was really exciting to get him on the podcast because not only is he a builder in the d5 space but not only is he a d5 builder but he's just totally multi-disciplinary since he's been so close to the action he's been able to gather a bunch of different perspectives as to what it is what it means to be part of the bankless world and so getting him on to talk about these various things talking about oracles talking about defy talking about tokens versus equity and what's going on with liquidity mining was a really valuable conversation and we really hit just a wide variety of subjects from someone who's really close to all of the action to me this was an incredibly concise conversation like we hit on so many different topics and he had very concise mental models for each of them it was just incredible from that perspective and we of course asked him about the triple point asset thesis which we are two for two on guess giving the general thumbs up on the triple point asset thesis for ether so you know big fan of that so thanks for the thumbs up joey yeah absolutely we he also talked about uh we we talked about ample fourth too which is something that uh pantera which is his investment firm invested in and he used this term um hayek money which is super interesting we got a new discussion about like like what is money in crypto and whether ample forth can be a good collateral for d5 that was a very interesting threat of conversation that i think listeners will enjoy yeah the the ampliforth uh world is getting a lot of traction and a lot of attention definitely also from the bankless podcast but from also the the greater crypto world so i'm definitely excited to watch that story play out and see how unique and different a currency can be can come into fruition or not it's an experiment so we will see by the way do you know what he meant by hayek money uh something i'm assuming closer to uh austrian money is that right yeah totally and and hayek has this great quote um the bankless twitter handle tweeted it out uh the other day which is he this is hayek he says i don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government we can't take it violently out of the hands of government all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can't stop something government can't stop hayek was talking about a privately issued form of money that's issued in a sly roundabout way that governments can't stop to me that is what bankless is is doing what crypto is doing with bitcoin with ether and even maybe maybe with ample forth i don't know i think listeners can be the judge of that in in this conversation yeah i think that's a good metaphor for what's happening in defy at large right so we also talked about the yfi token the the giphy token and uh it's it's one of these crazy things that's really complicated even for for my standards like i usually get i understand what's going on in d5 but this this yfi token broke through that barrier i no longer understand but i do know that there's a lot of real stuff happening there there's real economic activity with real value being created and you know if it's but if it's blowing by me who spends all of my time trying to follow this space like it's absolutely going to blow by everyone inside of any sort of government or or you know authority and so all of this crazy defy yield farming stuff is just like way too chaotic and way too complicated for any like a party or authority to even like be able to comprehend or follow or do anything about absolutely that's kind of what makes this the most exciting place to be in general right so we're in crypto which i think is the most exciting uh i guess technology uh social experiment that's that's happening right now in the world and then within that within crypto we are in kind of the bankless community the defy community and that's the the locus for everything that's that's you know the center that's the epicenter of what's going on so you are in the right place if you are tuning into bankless on a weekly basis and uh we're just excited to share this interview with joey yeah and that was a little bit of a tangent that touched on a number of different subjects but that reflects what this conversation with joey was like we touched on a little bit of everything you know just trying to retain our grip on comprehension on what's going on in this space yeah so before we begin let's talk about our sponsors as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent-seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today so the biggest thing that's holding crypto back is actually getting fiat into the system moving from that old world to the new crypto world what you have to do is create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's also holding your app back if you are a d5 developer and are building something on a network like ethereum what that means is in the fiat process your users drop off when they're signing up and you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but what if you could make it super easy to on ramp to your application using a fiat on-ramp ramp is that it is a delightfully easy a fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eath and die usdc whatever asset they want in five minutes or less so this reduces the dropout rate and lets you build products for the real world zurion is using it ethereum is using it taurus is using it defy apps that you probably know and use today are using it what you need to do is check this out and visit ramp.network to see how easy it is you can get set up in 10 minutes or less and 100x your addressable market size as a develop this is like the ultimate growth hack and when you mention bankless they'll on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so go to ramp.network mention bankless and get started all right let's go ahead and get right into the interview with joey krug of auger and pantera [Music] bankless nation we are incredibly excited to introduce you to joey krug joey is a d5 og he was the one who tried to build a d5 protocol on bitcoin in the early days ultimately switched to ethereum he's the a co-founder of auger and he's currently an investor of pantera he's got his his hands in a lot of different things these days a lot of irons in the fire and joey we are super excited to have you on bankless sir welcome awesome thanks for having me so joey i think in this conversation uh we we really want to talk to you about your model for things kind of your your mental model for uh crypto you've been in the space for a while you've seen a lot of transitions and transformations you've seen some things play out you've seen other things not play out so we want to understand your model for how you think about investing in the space in particular and just how the the space might emerge you know uh token maximalist are you a web three guy you know fat critical fat money there's all of these different kind of categories uh that we could fit you under we want to see sort of how you think about the world of crypto so maybe could you start by telling us a little bit about i guess pantera's specialty so maybe give some background on the firm where you're working the investment fund that you're working at and some background on that specialty and then we can dig into into some of the other investment thesis areas that uh that you're looking at these days yeah so at pantera you know of course as you know we focus just solely on the cryptocurrency in blockchain space and we're looking at mostly seed and series a stage companies so we invest you know pretty early on um and i guess there's a wide range of things that we help people with but you know the short version of it is we help them with strategy if they need help with that we help them with hiring um we help them with you know go to market and connections um if they ever decide they want to sell the company you know we help them with that um really just helping the founders out with whatever they need help with uh some people don't need a lot of help other other companies you know need more help um and that's that's pretty much it you know it's a it's a simple business uh but there's just always you know the devils in the details so what's pantera's ideal product right so when you guys receive a pitch what are you guys really looking for because i know you guys aren't just investors in like just tokens right you guys pantera also has invested in wire which is an infrastructure company but you guys also have plenty of tokens on your balance sheet if i understand things correctly so when you guys are receiving a pitch like what are you really looking for what's like the golden product that you want to invest in yeah i think i think the most important thing you know like the coolest thing that somebody could pitch me is some some idea that has some traction you know i think um any sort of science attraction is always the best thing um and then you know a little less generic than that i think we're looking at anything that's sort of in d5 somehow or um helps make that vision possible so if you look at a company like wire you know they're helping make that vision possible because they're making it easier to on-ramp into this ecosystem and so that's that's sort of the range of companies is is all the way from actual application you know somebody building some d5 protocol which has an app on top um all the way to companies working on scalability all the way to via on-ramps it sort of spans the range but it's all trying to anything that really helps to fulfill that that core thesis of you know we think uh similar to the internet finance is going to be decentralized so would you say joey that is the core thesis then that you know what we're moving towards is an open financial system and that crypto is basically the internet of money we've created this this new thing called digital uh scarcity with with bitcoin and that's evolved in various ways with bitcoin and with with ethereum but the the overarching movement here and the big thing that people who are in crypto are investing in is is kind of um a new money system for the world uh would you agree with that or do you have sort of a different take yeah i would def i would definitely agree with that um you know i think uh i i think this this sort of innovation of you know letting people create and participate in their own financial markets is is a huge innovation um yeah i consider it to be one that's you know maybe not as important as the printing press but but it's it's up there so joey has that thesis kind of changed over the years or have you guys been pretty consistent i remember in 2017 there was a lot of talk around uh investment funds around this this vision of web 3 which was a bit more like the decentralized internet vision of the world that we were going to have a decentralized version of of facebook and twitter and that those things would become protocols and that crypto and blockchain was the platform to do it it seems to me that the money protocol thesis the open finance thesis is a little bit different from that um have you always held on like the open finance thesis that that's the thing we're doing in crypto or do you see elements of web 3 possibly being true yes i mean i guess that's the answer for pantera and there's the answer for me i think either on pantera side um it sort of always held that thesis without necessarily knowing that that it's held it so what i mean by that is you know when dan started pantera in 2013 there was really basically just bitcoin i mean you had stuff like litecoin but you know people didn't really take that too seriously it was more just bitcoin and you know bitcoin was kind of the original um open finance protocol you know sending money is is very important as well um i think for myself you know i didn't really hold the the decentralized finance thesis until i came across ethereum so this would be well i came across it in like late 2013 but kind of didn't really pay attention to it i really formed that thesis for myself around late 2014 um when i decided to to build auger on ethereum and how would you describe that thesis at the time and how has it evolved or is it basically the same thesis um it's basically the same thesis i've always obviously learned a lot more um and there's a lot more nuances to it now but you know even back then the the idea was sort of okay bitcoin gave us money that's global uh no limit in terms of how large a transaction you can do and well back of the time very low fees um i'm sure i'll talk about that you know later in this in this conversation but with ethereum i saw the same thing but it let you do other things with the money um and it let you kind of do all these other sorts of things using smart contracts and so i thought okay that's really powerful um you know d5 wasn't really a term back then but the the core concepts and like the description of it was you know i don't remember if anybody actually even said decentralized finance uh back in late 2014 but we definitely used the same description which is global no limit low fee way of doing financial transactions would you say even joey that's what icos basically were they were a d5 protocol primitive for fundraising yeah you could you could sort of consider it that you know it's it's probably the least interesting principle of right you know taking people's money is kind of the least interesting one but um yeah it definitely was so joey you mentioned that you guys are a pretty early stage investment firm and that you also look for uh teams with some some signs of traction uh but in the early stage especially in crypto where so many things are kind of up in the air and undefined and really unknown how do you like evaluate or predict value capture or upside exposure in the early stage like how do you really know what projects or teams or products are really going to be able to actually capture value and appreciate in value over time yeah so i think i think my answer to that is it's it's all just about whether it's a positive ev bet and so um you know when i think about you know when i wrote one of the first checks into into xerox i remember you know i'd been talking to will off and on for like six months at that point and i thought decentralized exchanges was going to be something that was big um at the time i met them the only people who'd ever really tried anything were ether x and either ether delta was really small or i forget if it had even been created at that point this is kind of like mid uh 2016. and i just remember talking to him and talking to his his co-founder amir and thinking okay um these guys are gonna they're gonna build something now whether the thing they build works or not you know i'm not i'm not 100 certain but i think they're going to build it and they're going to get it in the market and i do think decentralized exchanges are the future so that's why i decided to invest um it's all about whether it's sort of a positive efe bet another really quick example that we just did maybe a couple years ago is we invested into ample forth we led their their siege round and that one was sort of like the idea is an experiment you know it's it's it's a very wacky idea um and we sort of just did it because it was it was a fair evaluation very early we knew they'd build something and get it in the market and so i think when you're investing really early there's kind of two elements there's can the people get a product in the market and then can they evangelize that product and you don't really know for sure but you're you're sort of trying to get like a an insight into the person whether they'll be able to actually do that well congratulations on the ample fourth investment because in the last uh like month or two that has definitely worked out for you guys and i think we definitely want to circle back around to ample fourth later because i also find it uh absolutely captivating um but before that i kind of want to talk about tokens versus equity and how uh panteras or yours uh mental models about these things have changed over the last like two to three years uh tokens in defy are very hot right now and equity in crypto kind of seems to be this like maybe i'm just biased but like more of an afterthought about like how to access upside potential so over over the the history of pantera how has the tokens versus equity debate kind of progressed over time you know we've we've sort of always thought that there's value in both um you know when pinterest launched it just had a bitcoin index fund and then in 2014 the first venture fund came out um and then in 2017 we launched these funds to invest in icos and then we have like a liquid strategies fund which we launched in late 2017 and you know the the answer that we always tell you know potential investors is you should have exposure to both um i guess the way i think about it though is you know tokens you generally have a faster path to liquidity not always though you know we did a bunch of investments in 2017 and not all of them are liquid yet um and you know it's definitely a bit more a bit more democratic i'd say a token is um i like it that it's it's much more direct you know even if there is a cash flow it's just distributed straight to the token holders there's no like fancy dividend process it's just kind of all automated and you know it's open finance um i like that so joey maybe maybe it would be good to kind of dig more into uh tokens for for a minute because there's been kind of a progression right in in 2017 it felt like um i've used this term before it felt like we had a lot of futility tokens like tokens that really didn't do all that much they were supposed to be used inside of the platform but they didn't have any real governance functionality um a lot of the tokens were like uh had projects behind them that hadn't even shipped to to mainnet what's different now so um we've talked often on bank lists about these uh tokens progressing from like into governance tokens and then eventually becoming capital assets um is is that real are we in a more healthy state when we think about the economics and value accrual mechanisms of tokens today defy tokens today than we were in 2017 uh definitely definitely because when when things are going live today when the tokens going live there's usually some product that's already live um people are building kind of smaller things that have a simpler mvp where they get something live into the market that's that's functional you know curve is well their token hasn't gone line gone live yet but curve is a great example of this where you know it has a ton of traction um at its core a very simple product and they just got it right out into the market and the same case is kind of true for a lot of these d5 tokens were seen recently uh balancer is another one um the iron you know yfi token these are all products that went live fairly recently and also have a token that you know gets you fees and also incentivizes you to do something and that's just way different than what it was in 2017 where most the projects you know didn't have a good reason for why they needed a token and you know often um the project itself wasn't wasn't live this yield farming stuff i mean some skeptics some critics will say it's just kind of a gimmick right we're just juicing yields and maybe the the yields uh don't match the the risk that users liquidity providers are taking on by actually participating in these things um do you think it's and it you know proponents we've had dan elizer on the podcast for instance um you know he'd say look this is this is how defy is actually going to beat um centralized crypto banks right this provides a real incentive towards usage of the protocol it's a great distribution mechanism to the community what's your take on yield farming in particular is it more gimmick or is it is this a real mechanism that's healthy for the open financial system you know i think so some people kind of draw comparisons to two things in the legacy world with this you know they talk about exchange tokens where they where they created these tokens that encourage people to trade on them and then they draw comparisons also to um companies like jet.com when they did like a contest to get referrals or users they actually gave away stock in the company um and actually the interesting parallel here is that those outcomes are very different for jet it worked very well they had a really positive outcome they got thousands of users um and it was a good value for the exchange tokens however uh most of those you know the liquidity was fake people were just trading with themselves um and they were just trying to mine the token but there was no real liquidity there i think for liquidity farming um it's it's you know definitely it's part gimmick but there's also some part reality here too because what's different is these aren't order book based exchanges they're ones where you have to contribute funds into a pool into a smart contract to provide liquidity and so what's different is the liquidity is not actually fake now sure a lot of liquidity the only reason it's there is because it's getting this yield farm token but the underlying liquidity is still real and that's a huge difference and actually really really meaningful i think so the underlying liquidity is real and you can verify that all on-chain as opposed to essentially what you're doing with a exchange token like a bnb for instance is you have to trust uh binance for bnb to actually fairly report on their exchange volumes not only do you have to trust binance to do that you also have to trust uh ceo cz and friends to actually burn the tokens and not change the rules on you midstream is that right yeah the exchange token example i was thinking about was even the ones where they had like liquidity mining i don't think bias does that but there's there were other ones where they like actually said we'll give you took more tokens if you trade on our exchange like really frequently maybe binance did that i don't think they did but um but yeah that's the idea and with binance tokens with something like bnb um also people you know think of these things because they are managed by uh centralized entities um i mean these start to look a little bit like pseudo securities right you know others say no that's this kind of a loyalty uh token um similar to airline miles right but when you start burning tokens based on profits based on revenue based on earnings that starts to look a little security like especially because it's it's managed by a centralized entity uh what do you what do you what do you think about that and are these defy governance tokens uh different yeah it's a it's a good question and you know i'm not i'm not sure to be honest um i think uh or to be frank i guess you know i i'm not an attorney but um i think if you look at the the d5 ones um you know the one thing that's different is they weren't really issued by a central issuer per se and so and so what i mean by that is you know if you look at like the iron one is a really good example of this you know sure somebody wrote the first smart contract that did it all but when you mine those tokens you're actually having to do something so you're having to put in work to get the token and it's not like you know the andre guy it's not like he's giving you the tokens um from like his personal wallet or something you know they're they're in these pools and you actually have to do work to get the token which i think makes a big distinction you know even even if the token does have cash flow there's a big distinction there because you're having to do a lot of work to get it and and you know he's not he's not going and taking the tokens and offering to buy them back from you or taking some cash flow he has and using it to give the token holders you know it's all happening on chain okay so can we dig into that because a lot of a bit this stuff evolves uh so quickly joey right so dave and i were just talking like he he went away for the weekend last weekend um for a hike and a camping trip he came back and now there's this now i know nothing it's all gone it's all yeah it's like so can we talk about that so you were talking about a token called um yfi right and um maybe you can get into what that actually is and and how that came on the scene and how that evolved because i think it's a great example of um how how these open finance systems work to organize capital yeah so so yfi is is something that's so complicated i'm sure i will you know botch part of the explanation here so so forgive me for that but you know the cor the core concept is so there are these things called like y tokens or yield tokens and a lot of the curved liquidity pools actually use them so the y tail can save allocate your money across different stable coins and across different lending protocols to get you the best yield now what happened is somebody said the the people who made the y tokens basically said you know what would be interesting is if you took those y tokens and then you use them for something else so they created like these pools on um on balancer and these pools on curve where if you basically took the curve tokens then deposited them into a balance or pool and then you take the lp tokens from that balancer pool and deposit them into like this yfi system you'll actually basically mine additional yfi and wi-fi like long term it should be like fee generating you should get you fees uh from all these different things that take place in the iron ecosystem um it uses used for governance there's already votes happening on certain governance proposals right now um and you know if you want you can even take your level farther and you can stake the wi-fi token that you just mined and use that to get those transaction fees um and so it's pretty complicated they have a few blog posts on their site that explain it and i actually remember coming across it this weekend with one of my friends sent me a link to it um and uh yeah at first i thought it was kind of funny because it's it was like you know we took like this and then we wrapped it in there and then we wrapped it in this and then we put it over here and and when i first started i just started laughing i was like this person has a really good sense of humor yeah um and and then like i couldn't i wasn't sure like is it is it half serious half half a um poking fun at everyone else is it full serious is it is it full just poking fun on everybody i don't know uh it's really interesting and and it was really cool to see though yeah so so what you're basically describing is that this guy andre who's a developer of this protocol aggregator right he put together a distribution of yfi tokens that would allow the community to govern over all of the parameters across these various defy tokens right including like issues parameters and i saw last weekend uh the community actually voted i'm not sure you know they can unvote this they can change it but they voted to um hold yfi tokens to like a fixed cap of um 30 000 or something right but the interesting thing about this is he didn't he didn't generate or print any tokens for himself or for his or for his team the only way to actually get these tokens is uh to earn them now you can also buy them on secondary on exchanges like uniswap at this point because like nothing can stop you this is uh the permissionless open finance but that that's pretty innovative right instead of having any um any backers or any founding whatsoever or any sort of team distribution he just put it straight to the community yeah yeah it's really it's really interesting and really surprising to see um yeah i thought that was super cool joey based on your understanding of how this system works it's the most complicated system we've seen in d5 like by a long shot do you think all the components that make up this yfi token and the curve liquidity mining system are necessary or like how much of this is really kind of just you know uh just crossing a bunch of wires just for the sake of it like is is every single component of the system actually useful and actually providing value to the old uh the system as a whole yeah it's a good question um and and the answer is it's it's hard to know per se um like the the short answer is there's not enough data yet in terms of like where fees will flow and and how money is going to flow through these systems to know whether all these steps are actually accruing value or whether some of them are are unnecessary a while ago we were talking about the bnb token and the burn model and there's been some debate in the default ecosystem about like a dividend model versus a buyback and burn model uh maker being the the token that you know is most synonymous with a buy back and burn model also bnb and then um compound and balancer are you know theorized to be a dividend model but i guess we don't really know that for sure in the future do you have an opinion on which model you prefer uh and and what are the pros and cons of each yeah so i think there's there's what do i prefer from an academic standpoint and then what do i prefer in reality you know ignoring um ignoring reason and rationality so um so in an academic standpoint i prefer a burn it's more efficient in in every manner it's more tax efficient because unless you actually want to sell your position it's already happening you're not really realizing gains on some distribution that's one reason why companies do stock buybacks it's uh it's pretty simple and straightforward um from a practical standpoint though i don't like it and the reason i like um just straight up distributions better is they usually require staking to get the distribution and so most people aren't gonna stake and so for the people who do they're basically getting a higher return because most people are just kind of too lazy to bother doing it um it's easier for most people to comprehend and understand a lot of people still even in traditional world don't understand the economics of stock buybacks um even people who are otherwise you know very very intelligent and then and then the last piece is that i think they're sort of they're sort of like and this one's really not a rational economist one it's just like a practical reality there's sort of perverse incentives to doing uh buyback and burn because unless the price of the token uh goes up by exactly you know how much was was burnt um it it that can kind of lead to it being lower on on like sites like coin market cap and so you know if you look at something like ample fourth uh you know the reason why it's it's grown so fast is because it's distributing new tokens and the supply just keeps going up and that's how it keeps like scaling the the charts of coin market cap so there's like these practical reasons that you know don't make rational sense but um in reality i think they matter so with the one thing that's always concerned me about the burn model is that uh there it seems to be uh more less salient and it seems to be uh that the value of like the mkr token really depends on the shared perception of the value of of make or doubt because in the event where uh you know there's an mkr minting there there's nothing to back the cash flows right there or there are no cash flows to back mkr there's just this perceived value that in the future there will be more burning and so i i've al the of the burn model while i agree it's more fun and more cryptoeconomic and more novel uh it also seems to be like a balanced on a very thin line and it could fall off based on the fact that like okay all the previous burnings don't actually really matter it only matters for future burnings but i guess that is no different from the dividend model uh am i tracking on something here yeah that that's right um and in effect you know in theory in like economic theory you know you could you could monetize your burn by selling off a little bit of your position whenever a burn happens but like that's like a thing that people don't like to do in practice you know it's it's it's weird to do that it's even weird to do do for me to want to do that and like i understand how it mathematically works but it still feels weird fair enough okay uh what projects and or products on ethereum or d5 are you searching for like what do you want to have someone like come in with a pitch deck for what are you looking to be built into into d5 yeah that's a good question so i think um i think there's more room to to innovate on on dexes so i think one thing that would be very interesting would be like somebody took 0x mesh and then made a dex that ran on something like matic on something like a matic style kind of plasma side chain so you got the benefits of off chain orders with really fast and cheap uh on-chain settlement i think that would be very interesting and sort of would replicate the experience of a of a centralized exchange but but it'd be decentralized um you know i've always thought it would be cool to see decentralized poker um we invested in virtue poker a while back i think they're supposed to be launching launching soon uh we'll see on that um and then i do think you know we touched on web3 a little bit earlier i've always been more excited about decentralized finance but i think there's some stuff that kind of crosses between the two so like you know we're an investor in origin like which is building a sharing economy protocol i'd love to see people build apps on top of that where they're creating like decentralized versions of airbnb and things like that i think could be very very interesting but the short answer is yeah as an investor you know we listen to the market you know so what whatever interesting stuff people are creating we're always interested in it you know we don't have a list of of ideas and we're not like checking it off to see if somebody is building one of those and if not we don't invest money in you you know we we want to see whatever people think whatever entrepreneurs think is worth spending their their you know lives on all right guys we're going to pause the interview real quick and just talk about a few of our fantastic bankless sponsors ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum so what that means is that you can deposit your assets into ave and then take out a collateralized loan or simply deposit just to earn an interest rate so you pay an interest rate for borrowing you earn an interest rate for supplying but what the magic of ave offers you is stable interest rate loans which is a really important money lego for building out a bankless revolution having an interest rate that doesn't change under your fee is really important for long-term thinking and being able to plan out your own personal finance futures but also make strong business decisions based on an interest rate that you can depend on in addition to their stable interest rates there's also flash loans and flash loans are where you can borrow any amount of any asset for without any collateral so long as you are also paying it back in the same transaction the use cases for this are absolutely endless and i'm really optimistic that some creative developers are going to make some really cool tools using the ave money lego system we have been watching ave climb the d5 pulse leaderboard just growing and growing and growing in the assets deposited into their application which just shows how strong of a system they have created so you can go and check them out at auve.com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum while it works so check it out i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5 x 6 x 8 x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this that we'll include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get fifty dollars off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off so another area that's not quite finished i think in d5 has a has a long way to go is the area of oracles right and so oracles of course involve getting data outside of the crypto native system outside of an ethereum for instance into the system so that a decision can be made of some sort i want to talk about oracle's a little bit obviously we want to get to auger that is a potential oracle solution but first joey how do you think about oracle's like how should we think about them is the model you know decentralized versus centralized permission versus permissionless is it you know there are fast oracles and there are slow ones is there uh do you think of it as a model where some have better settlement guarantees than others so how do you think of oracles yeah i think i think i think about them basically in the sense of the question to ask is what's what's the trust model you know or as you said what are the settlement guarantees that you get here and are the guarantees because you know somebody is is a nice person is a guarantee because you're paying somebody a small amount of fees and you know it's still in their incentive to cheat you but you hope the small amount kind of outweighs that incentive over a long period of time or is it you know you know pretty rigorous like game theory incentives where um you know it like the the the math works out such that it's sort of like attacking the oracle will be the equivalent of a 51 attacking a chain or something over a very long period of time i think those are the sorts of models that people love people have come up with how about reputation joey so um haseeb has made the comment that um uh reputation is maybe under rated as a source of legitimate oracle data so if i'm espn i'm going to report on the score after a game because if i don't no one will trust me as espn in the future yeah so that's that's true that's that's sort of the same thing as like you can sort of model that as like an economic stake right so like espn has you know their entire business reputation is is riding on that you know if espn decides to be a liar um that's that's not good for them because espn sells that data to other people too you know they they sell it to sports books that are trying to pay out markets and things like that um there is one issue with that though which um which is centralized services tend to actually accidentally give incorrect data um this is something we've we found out with auger because people sometimes create inaugural market it's like what will the outcome of this question be according to this certain source there's a lot of sources that people might view as reputable that actually have inconsistencies like their data is not available at a certain time or the data is misaligned especially things like with price data or historical price data sites like yahoo finance are incredibly unreliable there's a lot of interesting stuff that i didn't know um about sources that i previously viewed as being reputable just based off what i've seen uh with augur markets that's fascinating and so diving more into oracles right now so one solution that's i i feel like has taken the d5 um community by storm is uh chain link so it seems like a lot i'm not i don't have estimates in fact i'd be super interested to see this but a lot of d5 protocols are using chain link as their source of truth for uh price data what's your what's your take on on chain link and i i'm recalling a uh a tweet from back in uh 2019 where um i think robert lesnar said something like we're you know we're thinking about using link as our oracle system chain link that is and and you replied you said don't do it like we'll pull millions out of compound if you do you had some serious reservations about chain link at the time do you still have those reservations and what's your take on chain link right now yeah so so when i tweeted that you know it's kind of like i just like you know that's that's you know exactly what i what i would have done at that at that point in time um you know and so it was almost easier just to kind of just tweet out a one-liner than it was to like being rob and have like a serious long conversation about it and um and i always like just being kind of upfront and indirect anyway so i thought why not tweet it i i didn't imagine that tweet would get that much like people replying to it and stuff but um so my view at chain link then you know was well the kind of like the stuff that they do for oracle's back then was was pretty centralized you know they say it's decentralized but um you know you're selecting from a handful of different nodes that are just providing the result you could take an average of those notes if you want but back then you know it wasn't really backed by any any economic security um i'm not sure the status of whether these are live yet or not but i know chain link's been working on two other versions of the chain link oracle one that uses intel sgx and one that uses this new protocol that they published um with the pro i think of a professor i think at cornell or something um called deco and those are actually pretty interesting to me um the sjx1 is is actually pretty good you know for for certain use cases if you're comfortable with the guarantees sgx gives you and then the the deco one is um actually pretty solid if you have like a url based source and you want to get that data on chain in a secure way um like the deco one it's actually very very very secure like in my mind the risk there is that it's the same risk though which is that like the source data isn't available or the source gives inconsistent results or there's various things where like it it's just not gonna work but for like use cases where you wanna just get price data you know it's actually probably pretty good i don't know if that's live or not yet though so my my opinion of chain link kind of like it just follows that decision tree which is like if they have one of those two things live um i think it's probably pretty solid if not you know myself i wouldn't use it until one of those two components are live so you like the tech if they're making the upgrades that you mentioned um i'm not trying to get you you know the the the chain link marines upset at you joey so like but i i was wondering about link the asset because it has gone absolutely exponential and a lot of people i think in the space uh don't understand clearly why um is is is there some value accrual mechanism that is is linked for you know to the success of chain link and link the asset do you have a take on that yeah i mean i think the the main one is it's you know it's a utility token where i think you need it to pay for certain things on the network or whatever i don't think there's any fees distributed to link holders per se though or even if they are you know they wouldn't be be very large because doing the chain link oral cord requests is fairly cheap so you know regardless of whichever one of those is the case you know the vast majority of the value is is just pure speculative value um yeah i know like 4chan is super interested in in chain link um they're also interested in ample fourth and so i think that's that's why you have a lot of the value is not because like somebody sat down and indented this kind of cash flow on chain link and decided it's worth 8 billion but because you know it's it's a meme and people want to buy some and and say that they're a link marine and um so yeah that's that's kind of you know the value is is in its memetic value um versus being something like super rigorous that is that's true for a lot of other currencies right and that's it's so bizarre the memetic value we had uh ben ben hunt on the podcast from epsilon theory um and you know he talks a lot about narratives he calls them like when crypto we call them memes right and how those fundamentally set the price of markets the the actual narratives is that something that's investable like does pantera look at that sort of thing like what's the next narrative that's emerging um you know what what's 4chan talking about where these communities of of link marines um you know or communities of marines and twitter army's focusing on it do you guys invest in things like that you know it's really tough to to invest in things like that you know um i wish i could tell you we bought a bunch of chain link when it was at a at 100 million market cap but you know unfortunately we didn't and i think i think it's tough to invest in memes because you know you don't you don't really know where they could go right in the sense of like if say 80 of your portfolio was a differential portfolio of memes um you can't do a discounted cash flow on them and so it's sort of like you know it could be a bubble and it could pop and you know who who knows what's going to happen and so that's that's why it's hard to to invest in things like that um from from like an investor you know standpoint where you have like lps and things like that if you're a retail investor it's much easier to put you know a few thousand bucks into it as a flyer and see what happens going back to the topic of oracles the oracle problem is described as getting off-chain data onto the chain right and so that means that you know these these chains need to have some sort of system that brings knowledge that they can't have internally from outside the chain into the chain so that the economic activity in inside the chain can can leverage that information in order to have further economic activity however on-chain dexes like unit swap and balancer offer an on-chain oracle based on the economic activity that's happening natively on the chain which is really interesting because it requires no outside trusted source of information because the information that emerges out of the uniswapper balancer trading pairs offers an oracle for pricing coming natively from the chain is it dangerous or or worrisome that that in in the future this offers this offers a solution to the oracle problem because we don't need anything that's outside of the chain we can deliver it ourselves but that's very self-referential right is that dangerous do we need to have something outside of the chain providing outside data to ethereum or can we just produce it internally in a safe environment have you thought about this yeah i have a good amount um so agar actually uses unit swap v2 as an oracle for the price of rep versus die and the reason is the short reason is basically you can't really have a self referential auger market where there's no resolution source um and it's on a price because if you say like what's the price of rep on this date there's a thousand different answers depending on which which site tracker you use um how they calculate things even like which exchange it all varies so you have to have a very specific source but if you say what's the price of rep according to coin market cap well if coin market cap's down your market's invalid and we need a price always for the price of rep and first die and so what we use is we use unit swap to do it and what's really cool about the unit swap oracle is you can basically say give me the time weighted price over a certain time period it's not a volume weighted price because volume is very easy to manipulate or make fake volume but whatever the price is on unit swap at a certain time is actually pretty real so for instance if the price of ether on uniswap versus die is 250 and it stays that way for like two minutes you know it's pretty real because if it was invalid somebody would have arbed against the price and um and so you can use that to create a pretty accurate um oracle in my in my view so joey let's talk a little bit more about auger because we want to understand how that kind of fits into the other oracle solutions it's interesting to me that you described auger is an oracle in itself but it also uses other oracles in d5 like the uniswap v2 oracle i would imagine it could use you know even uh sources from a chain link as a as a reference point too how does auger fit in to the other oracles that are live today in d5 is a little bit different does it offer different security uh guarantees yeah it offers different security guarantees so so what augur offers is it's pretty rigorous economic security and so it's it's the concept that like people who are reporting on some event on augur you know shouldn't have been a financial incentive to steal your money versus like you know if i'm just creating a site that's like joe's oracle shop.com and i provide price feeds for people and then all of a sudden there's 500 grand that's going to be decided based on the outcome of my price feed i can easily just cheat everyone and make more money from doing that but with rap you have to stay crap in these like subsequent dispute rounds and you would basically have to burn you know millions of dollars to falsify a market result so it provides different economic guarantees but the fallback or the drawback is much slower you know auger takes i think vichy will take on average you know a day or two to pay out a market now it's improving v1 took like four to six weeks um and i think as augur gets more users there's no reason you couldn't uh in theory dial down the time it takes for a market to resolve um you know you can envision some day where these dispute rounds are very fast and they happen like on 30 minute time horizons so the average market resolves in an hour or so um which would put it on par with like a slower um you know centralized betting site or something like that um so it's possible to make it faster it's just you know today when the amount of people using it is fairly small and it's on ethereum which still like has a bunch of gas for price issues at the moment you know it would probably be insecure to make it too fast but the fastest algorithm resolution is ever going to get in my opinion is probably like you know 30 minutes style time horizons it's not going to give you results every 60 seconds because it just wouldn't be secure because it relies on humans so joey we talk a lot about settlement guarantees on bankless particularly around settlement guarantees of systems like ethereum or various assets on top of it and bitcoin that sort of thing i think it's what it sounds like you're saying is that auger is um offers far stronger settlement guarantees than most oracles but the trade-off is it's slower so right now you know it would take a couple of days you know in the future possibly if you get the liquidity and the usage that sort of thing maybe it's it's possible to get to an hour and a half an hour but that's not great for a use case like an instant price feed right which is what a lot of things on um indeed fire using oracle's for right now what is it a good use case for it's got to be something that's you know super high stakes and that there's a high incentive to essentially cheat or or bribe um what are those types of use case that that you envision when auger is fully formed yeah so so you can envision it being used for things like um well i'll tell you what what we've kind of built around it but but i think the the more high level version is you know if you envision it being used for things like say somebody has an options protocol and there's you know categories of options that expire once a month or something like that that's long enough where if it takes you know a little bit of time to do the payout it's it's fine as long as it's very secure maybe you don't want to rely on you know another oracle for that but if you're doing something like dydx where you're trading perpetuals really fast um you know you auger is not good for that um you might be able to use unit swap but you know depends on what asset you're trading whether it's probably secure or not and so if you look at the good use cases for awkward though specifically tends to be things like betting on real world events so things where you know you're asking like will spacex launch this rocket successfully or not or you know which team is going to win this this game and for those sorts of events you could see large amounts of money being bet on them and you need to do the payout right um you don't want to trust some random oracle um where some guy can just change the results to whatever he wants it needs to be pretty rigorously secure because there's a pot of money uh relying upon that result so joey we have auger v2 rolling out in just a week how do you feel about that are you excited are you nervous uh what is it are you worried something uh may go wrong what's what's your what's your take on augur v2 coming yeah i'm really excited for it um you know we we listened to tons of user feedback from from v1 and you know almost everything somebody complained about is is fixed in that so i'm really excited for that um you know it's it's it's much easier to use um making orders off-chain so those don't cost yeah i'd say a lot of the user experience issues have been fixed there's really two that haven't uh which is like the the ui is a trading ui it's not a betting ui um and uh and it's still pretty expensive on ethereum i'm a little worried about that piece you know gas prices have went up to over the past few days i've seen them up to 150 gray at one point uh which is very expensive so augur v2 couldn't have been made at the time augur v1 was because in august v2 there's a bunch of new money legos that has been leveraged by the augur v2 protocol can you kind of go through some of the developments that have have that have happened in the ethereum space and how that's allowed you to build out auger v2 definitely so you know the first big one was um the launch of multi-collateral dye and so trading takes place in dye in agra v2 instead of ether which is a big you know thing users had an issue with is if you're betting on something that takes place in six months um you know you want to have no volatility in the underlying asset when doing that most people do there's a small group of people who disagree with that um the next one is 0x so all orders are broadcast off chain and over this peer-to-peer network and so that means that when you place an order on the order book it doesn't cost you any money now which is a big deal because on on v1 that costs you know four or five dollars which is pretty crazy um the next one that it uses is of course uniswap for that one price feed and the last thing it uses is um the gsn which is this gas station network that lets you basically do transactions in die where the underlying user doesn't need to own ether in their wallet so it makes it a bit easier for a user who's new to crypto because they just need to get die instead of ether and die why die rather than usdc oh yeah so the reason augur uses die is because it's it's really the only it's the most decentralized stable coin i guess is the way i would describe it right so we just watched usdc get blacklisted from a particular address so maybe some particular market in augur v2 which the authorities don't agree with might leverage the ability to blacklist or whitelist usdc from a particular auger market market that's the fear correct yeah or that like um yeah yeah basically the fears that somebody would try to censor something um and yeah dye doesn't really have that issue agar is trying to be a very strongly censorship resistant platform so it's only as censorship resistant as its weakest link and so any time that you can patch and improve censorship resistance adds to the uh censorship resistance of augur as a whole yep yeah that's exactly right so one thing about auger that i've always paid attention to is the is the debate between you know peer-to-peer i guess not a debate but like the the model of peer-to-peer uh trading like the zero x model versus peer-to-peer contract like the uniswap model uh and so augur use because it uses 0x it's a peer-to-peer uh trading platform because you're trading with one specific other party whereas some of the massive growth that we've seen in the d5 space comes from a peer to contract model where you know this is compound this is unit swap this is balancer where you don't need to find a specific counterparty to be able to access liquidity and we've seen liquidity coming from the peer to contract model just absolutely explode so is is auger locked into a peer-to-peer 0x model or is there a potential for a peer to contract a liquidity model for these auger future agri market markets yeah so augur is very it's very modular so um you know i i'm aware that there's some people actually i think working on making a peer-to-contract model for augur where you know it uses the same markets you're basically buying uh what's known as complete sets so you're buying like you know yes and no in a market and then you could trade those on something like balancer so that's that's something people are working on so joey um auger one didn't i think take off the way a lot of people thought it would or hoped it would there's still some volume there but it's not a tremendous amount of value of volume relative to other things like you know collateralized lending is taken off and recently decentralized exchanges are taking off why do you think that is is it um just a kind of a lack of of liquidity but that's kind of a chicken and egg problem right just like how do you incent liquidity just curious your thoughts and if you think uh v2 will have a different trajectory yeah i think um i think a lot of us just do was just too hard to use um you know when v1 launched um it actually did a few million dollars in volume in the first week and in the first week you actually had to download um this thing called the auger app and it took hours to sync it took you know eight or nine hours uh to even get into the app and so um you know when you can when you look at that and you look at kind of the level of traction it got if you look at the traction in isolation it looks very very small if you look at the traction and adjust it for how much of a pain it was to use i think it was actually you know pretty good and so what we focused on is is making it easier to use so v1 you know took hours to run uh v2 loads in a few seconds right in your browser using ipfs um and there's you know a hundred other improvements like a list off but but the idea is that it's much easier to use i think to really get a lot of liquidity though we need on-chain like settlement to be fast and cheap and you know right now with ethereum gas prices are so high you know it could cost a crazy amount of money to do an auger trade uh when it goes live and so maybe the first users will see what usb people are who are looking to bet you know very large amounts because if you're if your trade costs 50 um you need to be betting pretty large uh for augur to be you know cheaper and better than your alternative um that's something that we're looking to fix though with with v3 yeah can we talk about that so it's not just auger right all d5 protocols are now living in a hundred gray gas price world what do we do about that what does ethereum do about that does ethereum become just kind of a a settlement layer for larger economic transactions or are you seeing ways that we can scale ethereum today and particularly defy on ethereum today yeah i mean i think the lowest hanging fruit is there's you know this eip that i i always forget the name of but it's for improving the gas price auctions and i think you get a lot of efficiency just out of doing that because um you know at the moment the way it kind of works is like you know everyone just kind of fights this gas battle where everybody adds a few way to the transaction to get in and if everybody does that the amount you need goes drastically up too there's more efficient ways of architecting that and i know there's an eip to fix that i think longer term though you know we need a real solution to scalability um the long run solution is is something like 2.0 but that's you know still a ways off from being fully production ready i think the lower hanging fruit to do now is things like these optimistic roll up solutions and things like plasma style solutions like what matic network is doing um i think you know for augur v3 uh we're looking at using matic as a scalability solution so we would throw trading um on like a matic plasma sidechain and you could have transactions for a few pennies um that settled in a couple seconds you know that's like a huge improvement their main net just went live um it's probably the one product project i talk a lot about in the space even though like i i didn't invest in them early on or anything um i just think it's really really cool and their team is really good but joey does that wreck composability right so um doesn't defy have to kind of coordinate on the roll-up solution it's going to use or else you know it's it's hard to um actually compose transactions across these various protocols how do we solve that coordination problem yeah so it definitely makes it definitely makes it harder um and i don't i don't really have a great answer for that um you know i think i think part of is just uh convincing people to to migrate to something so like um for us you know i think we would basically say let's let's get a version of 0x running on matic uh let's make it so 0x token holders can still stake and market make and earn all their fees and stuff um and maybe there's a parallel version of it over there for stuff where it's harder to make a parallel version you probably just wouldn't so an example of this is makerdao you know there's no need to make a version of maker on medic um but what you can do is you can just bridge die over so you're just using the same die but but automatic and so it's it's complex and the answer for each dap or protocol is is is a different answer um you know stuff like uniswap i don't know how you bridge that over because if you bridge it you lose the liquidity so that's a that's a tougher problem and see i don't know the answer to that one don't you think all these protocols are going to be fighting for main chain space though not necessarily want to move because i mean uh main chain is manhattan and everyone wants to be in manhattan right well yeah i guess it depends on what you're doing right um you know if you're if you're racing cars you probably don't want to want to be in manhattan you probably want to be at the track that's true and uh you know there's certain things like right so like when we think about auger we want reporting to be on main chain certainly because that's the part that's most security critical but if people want to trade on an event that expires in two days you know it's probably fine for them to use matic for that and so that's kind of how we think about it is you want to be in manhattan or the main chain as you said when when security is is super critical and um and then for other things where it's where it's less important you know like like i think the incentives behind matic work out if there's only a couple days worth of auger markets trading on there at any point in time if all if rep and everything was on there you know it probably wouldn't be the incentive compatible and so that's that's kind of the mindset which i think about it i want to turn the conversation to uh something that we've that you joy have talked about mentioned a few times uh so far and that's ample fourth ample fourth uh disclaimer is a sponsor of the bankless youtube channel uh but it's also something that's kind of captivated me as somebody who's interested in experiments that can only be done on a crypto blockchain platform so can you perhaps illustrate for us what the pantera's thesis for ample force is and and how has that changed at all in the last few months and let's talk about what your thesis is around ample forth yeah so you know i first met um evan he was he was running this company that basically it made really good pizza and they deliver it to you uh that was kind of the company um it was actually the the best pizza that i've ever had in san francisco um and he got into crypto this is like 2017 and you know i was just really really interested in it and we've just been talking back and forth a bunch about a bunch of different ideas and he somehow got interested in the stable coins i i forget i forget how but anyway so so we started talking about stable coins we started talking about hayek money um i forget if he'd seen the paper where i sent it to him but but either way um got really interested in it and we started kind of helping them like build this this fairly complex system and then at one point um evan came back and he's like you know what if we just take the the mvp piece like the the hayek money piece and just launch that first and see what happens um and i remember it because it was a there wasn't really a board but there was like a group of a couple investors paul myself evan and and maybe one or two other people in a room and he remember he proposed that we were like you know i don't know it seems interesting why not you know see just see what happens it'd be an interesting experiment um and so he ran with that and and has been you know doing a really good job ever since um and you know it launched a bit over a year ago um and then you try to figure out like how do we build a community around this um and it really started growing really fast after they added this geyser thing where basically you stake you put your amples in uniswap because they wanted to boost liquidity for the token you put your amples in unit swap and in exchange for that you wrap them in this this other contract which basically gives you additional amples in exchange for doing so and after that point that was a bit over a month ago um it started to grow really fast so where do you see ample the ample currency fit into d5 right so what niche does it fill yeah so i think it's it's almost like um you know it's almost like a bitcoin it's sort of like bitcoin in that sense right so there's like there's like two types of assets in the space in my opinion at the highest level which is you have ones that are like cash flow generating uh or will someday and then you have ones that aren't that are more just kind of like a synthetic commodity and you know bitcoins in that second category i think apple forth is as well and so it's really just trying to be this kind of alternative interesting asset that you might buy a little bit of um because you think it's interesting and you think it's not really correlated to anything else so long term it's sort of like you don't really want to say bitcoin competitor but it's also not trying to be a stable coin it's kind of this this amorphous thing that's that's it's it's like the closest thing i remember to to bitcoin when i first got involved in in 2011. it sort of feels like that it's just this like weird thing that it's really tough to describe and explain what it is um i mean you can explain literally what it is like it's a stable it's a currency that when the price goes up fifty percent it prints roughly fifty percent of our tokens and when it goes down twenty percent it decreases the supply by 20 that's literally what it is but um what it will be used for and and how that evolves um i'm sort of as clueless as i was when when i came across bitcoin in 2011 you know for the answer to that part right and it's basically up to the market to actually define and what ample forth actually will be right so like just like you said like we can explain technically what it is however is really what what it actually manifests as will be up to the free market and up to just so under some sort of organic adoption over time yep so joey this is like the meanest investment um it seems like maybe pantera has made like i don't know the other but we were talking earlier technical right uh we were talking about narratives earlier yeah it's a mimi is a highly technical term but of course bitcoin is very much a meme at least we we tend to think it is now it's bootstrapped itself based on the scarcity meme of 21 million to actually be a useful store of value money um and it's it's it's done that through several cycles and now it's it's highly liquid so it has utility because it's just a good store value and just a good money at this point um but but the core of bitcoin is really this 21 million meme it seems to me like ample is doing somewhat of the same thing so you guys are investing in memes it seems right joey yeah i mean we don't we haven't done too many of them but um yeah yeah this is this is one of them one of the questions i had um i know david has done a deeper exploration of ample fourth than i have but one of the questions i had is uh to do with um distribution of the token so um bitcoin had this i guess immaculate conception as people call it with um proof of work and distributed through a crypto kind of anarchist sort of group um ample forth is coming at it from a different direction now there is the geyser and that is distributing through you know d5 early adopters and uniswap and i think that is a very very interesting mechanism however a large portion of it is also owned by a venture capitalist the team and a foundation so it's um you know bitcoin or hardcore bitcoiners you could would say there's a pre mine there is that going to be an impediment to adoption yeah i mean i i don't think so um you know if you look at ethereum there there was technically a pre-mine but you know it's it's still one of the most valuable assets in in the space um and i think there's you know there's a few chunks there's like investors um but i know the investors you know they don't they don't own nearly as much as you would like in a in a seed stage startup you know i think you know like we would own 20 if this is a regular startup you know we don't own anything uh near that um and then for for the sort of foundations piece you know that's meant to be you know either like spent or given away over time you know ten years from now foundation probably doesn't own any um i would imagine and so yeah i think it's i think it's some people might be upset about it i guess some people are very anti-pre-mine but they're probably not the people who would be interested in something like this at all in the first place anyway um so i don't think it'll be too much of a of an impediment moving this conversation to ether our all-beloved asset uh i want to ask about your investment thesis with ether but first i also want to ask if you are familiar with the triple point asset thesis for ether and if you uh agree with that or not i haven't seen it what's what's the the tldr uh the tldr is that there are three asset superclasses uh commodity assets uh transformable consumable assets and then um excuse me there are store of value assets commodity transformable assets and that's like that's like wheat or energy and then also capital assets which are dividend paying and uh you know some assets in the world can be multiple of these things like gold is a great store of value but it is also a commodity it's used in industry a piece of real estate pays rent so it's a capital asset but it's also a store of value and the triple point asset the triple point is a reference to chemistry where if you get the pressure temperature if you get those things perfectly balanced you can get a substance to be a liquid a gas and a solid all at the same time and the thesis is that ether is the only asset that can be all three asset superclasses all at once and we haven't ever seen any asset be able to do that at all and so the valuation of ether is going to be some combination of all three asset super classes all at once so a does that resonate with you and b how would you describe your investment thesis behind ether if it's not the triple point asset thesis got it that that makes a lot of sense um i hadn't heard about that before but it but it makes sense um i think my investment thesis on ether is you know sort of like if you could invest in the world wide web early on and it had an economic layer um that's sort of the equivalent here but you're doing it for finance and so um when i think about how ether will accrue value i sort of envisioned okay 20 years down the line if most of the world's financial transactions settle on ethereum at some point that's a huge amount of value and you know regardless of how specifically it monetizes whether it's because of you know ether itself is is locked up as collateral in many cases whether it's because it's just transaction fees people using the system um whether it's you know whatever it is um that core concept of this is the platform for decentralized finance uh full stop it's just so powerful that you know if this stuff works it's gonna accrue a huge amount of value uh long run and so that's that's why i own it joey are you more bullish on ether or bitcoin right now yeah i'm more bullish on on ether on a relative basis you know i think um if you look at 2017 bitcoin dominance went from like 90 to 37 or something um we're currently at just under 62 percent and so i think there's more room in this bull market for bitcoin dominance to continue to slide how soon do you think that'll happen well i think we're in the early innings of it you know i saw somebody on twitter tweet you know do you think we're in a d5 bull market in in what stage and like the options were like it's early we're in the middle uh we're in the end or the top just happened and a bunch of people said the top just happened like there's no way that's the case in my opinion this is just the very very early endings of the next bull cycle and i think um i think we could see a lot higher prices you know sometime mid to late next year is i think when it will really start popping off because that's when a lot of these scalability solutions will be live um now not everyone's gonna be using them day one but they'll see the idea or the potential for this stuff to scale and then it works in production and and i think you know it just takes a little bit of retail buying pressure or interest to combine those two things and you have something really interesting as a result you speak to institutional investors joey like so maybe maybe just to tee this up i very much agree with that idea that we are in the very early stages of uh d5 and particularly in asset growth in d5 and you know part of the reason for that i think is the people who are using d5 today they're not the retail investors who previously bought icos because they saw something on msnbc or because you know their friend texted them a hot tip the people who are using d5 criticals are people who have been in ethereum for a while and stuck around after the bear market it's like a very you know crypto native local community we have not yet seen an inflow of new users and it seems to me that institutional investors retail right now is kind of sleeping on d5 uh at the moment is is that your take when you talk to institutions or even just your pulse on on retail right now that nobody knows about it besides these crazy you know ethereum insiders who stuck around after the the 95 crash no so i think um i think that's true that the traction we're seeing today is due to the people who stuck around after the crash um that's how every bull market starts saw the one and in 2016 started as well um and so i think that's that's natural and then i think if you look at people outside of the space they're starting to get a little interested again you know like there's certain metrics you can use like um one metric is you know when you get emails from people random people being like you know can you explain the difference between uh ethereum and maker or ethereum and augur you're that's like that's a retail person who just found out about the space and is looking to learn more um or when you start getting texts from you know your friends outside the space or your friends from high school i've gotten a couple of those recently whereas like nobody texted me in in 2018. yeah um and and so it's still very early but it's it's starting to trickle out there um and then on the institutional side of things um you know there is some i think most institutions are just they're still just like it's too early i think most institutions like the people talk about like the institutional money or whatever in my view i think it's not really going to come in in earnest until the market cap of the space is over over half a trillion and then we'll see a huge flood of it when it's over a trillion but at current levels they're still kind of like oh it's it's too early um and you know it's not like a knock on the space it's just like you know you could have sent them uber at the series b and they would have said oh it's too early right right that's that early um but we have seen some it's the it's the kind of note of positivity i wanted to end that on you know we have a there's an endowment in our fund that's in the in the digital asset fund and you know that fund is is um a fund that owns a lot of defy assets and the reason why they invested in that fund as opposed to our other funds is they were actually excited specifically about decentralized finance you know they knew the bitcoin thesis but they didn't want a ton of exposure to that they wanted exposure to defy that's rare and that's an outlier but um you know i think it's it's starting and there's some first movers who are starting to get in that's super fascinating yeah i think um investment vehicles like that are are pretty perfect for institutions um back to the case for ether price appreciation some institutions may also just say hey you know what if ether as a reserve currency for this whole defy open finance thing what if we just buy ether as kind of a a proxy to get exposure to the entire d5 price appreciation that to me feels like a narrative that could pick up particularly because the um you know the cftc and u.s securities regulation has uh deemed ether a a commodity um seems like that's similar to bitcoin in that it's a it's a safer play to make for some of these institutions do you share that view yeah i could i could see that happening to some degree you know i think institutions they want to have a pretty diversified portfolio though and um so what i think they could they might do is they might they might buy some bitcoin they might buy some ether and then they'll probably invest into a handful of funds um i think that's kind of what it looks like steady state um long term so if we are right and this d5 bull market is coming we're just in the first inning of it and a flood of new users is coming to the space um are you concerned about that at the same time too because we were talking earlier about these very strange mechanisms of various ways to wrap uh you know contracts we talk a lot about the return in d5 at least that's sort of the obsession the yield we don't talk as much about the risk um are you concerned that defy is just going to get completely hacked like owned at some point and what that could do and you know if it does how will it happen yeah i mean there's always that risk there um it's really tough to write secure code in this space you know you can you can have it audited by all the best auditors but it's it's still no guarantee uh to date most of the hacks that have happened have been when people didn't have their code audited and reviewed um but you know auditors make mistakes and miss things too so it's still no guarantee um the only guarantee you really is just having something live in production for a long period of time with a lot of capital in it is kind of like you know the biggest bug bounty right uh like bitcoin is a good example of that ether itself is a pretty good example of that a lot of the d5 stuff is still is still young um you know as far as what the biggest attack vectors are i think the biggest ones that people haven't exploited a ton are um you know oracles are a big attack factor um you know there's no reason why a lot of these centralized oracles somebody couldn't just hack into their server and tell the the machine to spit out a different result and then when the the dap whatever gets the result it's just something completely off the wall and wrong and then the person profits from that that's an attack that's possible today you don't need to understand anything about solidity or or the evm really to do it it's just a pure you know can you hack into this box in the cloud somewhere uh style vector um outside of that i think the next biggest risk is is just or similarly size risk is just solidity bugs um in in programs that people have written do you think it's inevitable that we'll have another dao style event probably you know i think i think these sorts of events happen they happen in traditional finance they happen in in every ecosystem like if you want to take it really abstract even like forests you know in nature like there's forest fires and and things get burned and and bad things happen and then things start to regrow and you know it's it's sort of sort of similar here joey this has been a fantastic conversation thanks so much for spending the time with us we walked through so many interesting things you've got a great take on all of them thanks for letting us peek into your mind got to ask you this last question so when you kind of zoom out and and look around everything that's going on in open finance um what do you most ex what most excites you now i think what excites me most is is just seeing lots of projects start to go live you know we've been all working on this stuff for for years and you know seeing the new version of xerox multicollateral dye um you know the the stuff that compounds doing with their governance um you know agra v2 and then also seeing all the new stuff people are just starting to launch that's that's more nascent you know things like balance or um things like iron you know it's it's cool to see both these things and see how they interact and it's it's really exciting to me because it feels like there's sort of a wave a new wave of of entrepreneurs and developers building d5 d5 protocols and projects um more so than there was a couple years ago and so that's that's just exciting to me because because it it gives me confidence that you know something real is going to be created here and and this is actually going to work joey the bankless nation appreciates you coming on to the bankless podcast if you had a request of our listeners uh of as to where they should go to find out more about auger v2 to find out more about pantera or just to follow you in general what should they do yeah so i think um if you use twitter it's very simple it's at pantera capital at auger project and at joey krug are all our twitters um if you're looking to you know just dive in and read a bunch of content uh you can go to panteragafl.com awkward.net and uh i don't have a website but i guess the last thing i'd say is you know if anybody wants to reach me or send me a deal or send me something you're working on or just ask for advice or feedback or whatever anything uh feel free to message me on twitter um or you can just email me my my email is just joey kruget gmail.com pretty pretty straightforward joey thanks so much uh we appreciate you spending time with us bankless nation we've got some action items for you today one is to try out the auger v2 protocol that is actually coming in the next week or so we're going to be doing a tactic on the bankless newsletter on that so look for that tactic it'll give you a hands-on view of how to actually use auger v2 and make a bet on something also we have launched a new video show called meet the nation this is different than state of the nation which you are familiar with and david we just recently had ample forth on that right yeah speaking of ample fourth we just did the ample fourth meet the nation and if you guys are looking to learn more about ample fourth that is the place to go i interviewed the co-founder brandon isles about the ample fourth currency where it fits into d5 so if you have further questions about how ample forth works or what even it is and or why it's so different definitely go check out that video we will include that in the show notes and lastly david i just checked we are at 77 reviews on itunes five star reviews on itunes do you think we can get to 100 we i hope we get to a thousand because that's how big the bankless nation is and so if you consider yourself a part of the bankless nation and you also want the bankless nation to grow larger the easiest and most simple thing that you can do is you can go and give us those five star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts that's how we get the bankless gospel into more ears and we pass and get up the charts of itunes of spotify so that people can know what to do when it's time to go bankless absolutely guys as always risks and disclaimers we talked about some assets that are risky this is not financial advice eth is risky crypto in general is risky some of the d5 protocols we talked about are also risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot and that's a wrap
