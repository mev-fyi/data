[Music] bankless nation it is the last week of march david what are we doing this morning we are rolling it up we are rolling up the last week of march getting a full week's worth of crypto news injected into your brain as fast as possible first we're going through the markets what is the market saying then we are going through releases what got released in the last week then we go through the news cycle what what was with conversation like in the news over the last week then lastly we finish up with some ecosystem takes who had some good opinions then we go into what david and ryan are excited about and then we finish things off with the meme of the week guys there is a lot to fit in this week absolutely this comes out at you every friday morning both on the podcast and youtube so catch it that way david you ready to get into markets let's do it all right what is the market telling us about bitcoin this week bitcoin in a little bit of a slump this week we are down to at 52 200 uh you know again still 50 000 still relatively expensive bitcoin but you know from people's expectations of what a bull market is like this is low i guess uh and so yeah we've been having a number of red days ever since i think like march uh the the middle of last week so 10 days ago bitcoin has been in this downtrend uh and people people are bearish honestly is is my my sentiment read of the market it's funny the market certainly has a short-term memory david like when in doubt guys zoom out if you zoom out we're doing pretty well on the year aren't we we're doing okay [Laughter] when we started uh bitcoin started this uh 2021 roughly a little bit over twenty thousand dollars so let's let's remind us of that fact doing just fine how about eve ethan's kind of the same story and i feel like ethereans are even more bullish that this despite our ultrasound yeah bearish excuse me and this despite our ultrasound money podcast this week um so maybe enough folks haven't heard it maybe the right people haven't heard it i'm not sure what is making people bearish on eat these days yeah when when bitcoin trends down ether always trends down harder again and when bitcoin trends up ether also trends up harder so like when when there is a bearishness in the market there is more bearishness with this ether price so we are at the low low price of sixteen hundred and twelve dollars for the ether price only uh a little bit more than two hundred dollars above the previous all-time high versus bitcoin which is uh two and a half times as previous all-time high so like a bunch of ethereum market commentators are just feeling bearish i guess uh which is weird uh but again uh you know i guess it's really about people's expectations versus reality and people people have really high expectations i think i will stick to what we've been saying for the last year so hilariously undervalued even at these prices specifically in a bull run i think we'll see higher highs before this is this is all over let's talk about total locked in uh d5 david actually let's do total value locked in d5 first with d5 pulse so we are kind of flat i guess in this first quarter ever since february 40 billion or so locked in d5 what is this telling us yeah it's just telling us the same thing as as the market at this point prices are going up prices are going down and that's really just changing the value locked in d5 i don't think that's much of a different story other than the asset prices of these things that are in these applications um there's only so much that value locked in d5 can really tell us and especially when you know this market is guided by price movements this is really at this local point in time just a proxy of price movements how about dpi so this is the top 10 d5 assets by market cap captured in this index it's down on the week too so d5 is taking a tumble along with bitcoin and ether what's the story here yeah uh last week dpi was at 440 dollars this week we're at 380 dollars again same same tumble that we're all talking about and then i believe dpi is also down versus eth and so this is just people are being having fear i guess so people are moving into safety which means they're moving up the market cap stack dp uh d5 tokens are moving into east east is moving into btc btc is moving into the dollar um then that's just the general like 10 weeks or 10 days of bearishness that we've seen lately so has this slow slowed down d5 season then in your mind are we maybe kind of in a holding pattern the d5 season is on pause yeah i'm stuck between like we are about to finish this consolidation period and april's gonna be really really awesome and and the other the other thing i'm stuck behind is like oh this could be like a really long flat period and we don't actually break out of this flat period until something like june or july with eip1559 when that gets triggered and if you look at the dpi versus eth on the on those time frames the 2021 time frames you do kind of see this uh this wedge that is is forming um ryan if you hit that uh maybe that six month marker at the very bottom of your screen um yeah yes yeah so so if people are thinking that that this area needs to get filled over the next like three to four months and then and then we can have defy season um but defy season uh unofficially on pause unofficially on pause all right we'll see where that heads in the weeks and months to come it does feel like overall david the market is taking a little bit of a breather during this bull cycle let's talk about this tweet because even though prices are down the ethereum economy just keeps humming this is some analytics and stats from into the block we've got almost 600 000 daily active addresses being used in ethereum an active address is like a bank account these are all representative capital pools 600 000 of them being used daily that is absolutely massive addresses with a balance have increased by over 4.4 million there's about a trillion dollars being transacted on chain 96 and q this is all q1 this is all year to date stats 96 of the addresses are also profitable on their eth and a lot of eth is leaving exchanges too anything else we should highlight on some of these into the block stats yeah this is to me this just indicates the discrepancy between market fundamentals and uh user expectations or price expectations uh people people are expecting things like 2017 to happen now uh and i think that's perhaps why the price maybe got a little bit ahead of itself even though i don't really think it did but like the fundamentals uh that are behind the ethereum economy again just keep on chugging keep on chugging keep on getting stronger as does defy revenue david so we just passed the one billion mark in total d5 protocol revenue one billion dollars in revenue generated by these new money protocols uh that's super exciting david like look at this uh look at the growth so much of this has come since january yeah it's and and it looks like it's kind of that hockey stick parabolic growth that you look for in emerging high growth tech stocks economies high network effect sorts of sorts of areas that's what we're seeing here and this again is something there was no inkling of in the 2017 bull run a lot of projects yeah there were zero defy basically in 2017 and no capital assets so part of this 2021 bull market is the story of the rise of capital assets in crypto primarily being led by these d5 tokens even though prices are down revenue just keeps going up yeah we started this year again at 0.4 billion revenue in d5 and so for that means in q1 0.6 billion dollars of d5 revenue has been made this d5 revenue metric i think is a really blunt instrument because it doesn't talk about um not all revenue and every single defy app is the same not every single defy app captures the same amount of upside of that revenue um for example so like uh liquidity providers and uniswap those are those are 100 percent of the people receiving the uniswap fees and unisopt tokens receiving zero percent of that fees that may change in the future um so yeah it's a very blunt instrument but also it does a very good job of seeing like well it doesn't it call it blunt but like a billion dollars of cash flow is a billion dollars of cash flow like in aggregate defy has made a billion dollars of cash flow and has made .6 billion dollars of cash flow in the last quarter uh and so if anyone tells you that like defy is just a bubble like you can point them to a billion dollars of money being flown around at the direction of these governance tokens which is an important uh thing to note yeah in per conversation earlier this week when we were talking about wall street wall street is starting to understand these defy tokens as capital assets as well so that is a narrative paradigm shift also david have you ever wondered what is in some of these crypto indexes because this chart from uh missouri this table layout from asari kind of kind of shows what the various options are and the question i often get from people who are new to crypto is like what what's a way i can just set it and forget it like buy an index and then just just leave it and here are four different options uh and the composition of those options you hear us all the time talking about the the dpi the d5 pulse index it's an index that we really like because it's compiled of these top 10 d5 tokens by market cap but you can also go the traditional route and buy um indices from what we would call crypto banks there's the bitwise 10 there's the grayscale large cap there's the bloomberg galaxy uh in index of tokens and there's also bitwise which we've talked about this is a new index with d5 specific tokens uh kind of cool to see it laid out in this way do you have any favorites here david yeah i could have some very much some unfavorites here look at the bitwise 10 it's it's 80 bitcoin 15 ethereum and then the next the next biggest largest allocation is one percent to litecoin and everything else is so small point nine percent chain link point eight percent bitcoin cash point six percent stellar lumens this is absolute crap and this is like the bitwise 10 is like the biggest def index for crypto there is and so like my my head is that look at the bitwise top 10 versus the bitwise defy and look at that difference in quality bitwise defies unit swap ave synthetics maker compound urine uma 0x loopering all of those have all of those have revenue associated with them do you know ryan do you know how much revenue uh litecoin made in the last year how much daily the blockchain it took in less than a hundred thousand dollars worth of fees in the last year and so like and stellar lumens i'm pretty sure it's less than two grand of fees in the last year and like fees for store value assets are a different story than revenue tokens that's important to note but like just look you might as well if you're going to invest in the bitwise 10 you might as well just put bitcoin and ether on your balance sheet and call it a day use the bitwise defy index or the d5 pulse dpi index to get your your real indices here because what's the point of allocating 0.3 to eos like what that makes no sense well bloomberg galaxy and i think this index if i'm if i'm correct the bloomberg galaxy index was created in like 2018 or 2019 it has a three percent eos allocation and a 8 bitcoin cash allocation which feels like very arbitrary to me as well so that one might make even less sense than the bitwise 10 but i think the point here david is like um we're still very early stage in these indexes in these indices and more need to be more need to be made that capture the the good assets in the space the good maybe the most bankless assets in this space and i think david we're going to have some stuff to announce along those lines with bankless pretty soon more on that at some future episode but has opinions on what should be in an index let me tell you strong opinions strong opinions so stay tuned for that um let's get to this last one in the markets this is a tweet from joe weisenthal uh wow the gbdc that is the grayscale bitcoin trust of course that we've talked about so often on bank list premium to nav just keeps getting more negative now at negative 14 almost the entire time i've been in crypto while this product has been here david it's been training at a it's been tr gb dc has been trading at a premium to nav that means it's it's more expensive than buying bitcoin on spot the last few weeks that has reversed and it's getting even more negative so you can actually buy gbdc in your fidelity account at a 14 discount to spot uh what we've we talked about this a few times on on rollups but it it hasn't ever dropped uh to to this degree what's kind of the net effect of this yeah this is simply a product of the fact that it takes six months for people to deposit their btc into the trust and then be able to turn that btc into gbtc and then sell that and pocket that premium that six months lead time means that people are committing to this this trade for six months they don't know what premium they're going to get at the other end and so you know when and people have been making so much money on this trade this has been such a common trade the premium for the for gptc was has been positive which means that people have just like institutionalized this premium which is terrible because at some point the premium must become efficient right if it's positive for as long as it has been which it's been positive ever since like 2015 really people haven't really been uh working this this premium uh it really has been about 2019 or later but still um people have been just assuming that this premium is going to work and so they've been throwing bitcoin into grayscale and now now the premium is going in the opposite direction and it makes sense that the premium should fluctuate above and below zero and try to hold zero as steady as possible but because of the regulatory requirements we have to have that six months gamble where people submit their btc and hope that the pr premium lasts and this actually reminds me of like the whole ample fourth rebasing mechanism where it would rebase positively and then it would rebase positively again and rebase positively again and then people got stuck in that psychology as like oh this thing just prints money and so they would throw money into it and at some point just becomes inefficient and it starts to unwind in the other direction i think it's possible that this negative premium is the new status quo for quarters multiple quarters long because that's what it's going to take to unwind all of these people that have made these bets into turning btc into gbtc and pocketing that premium it definitely could be especially as we've talked about before if more competition starts to enter the horizon this is a news item but fidelity has just um filed for an etf a bitcoin etf that is a competitive pressure on the less efficient gbdc product and maybe the market's starting to price some of those things in but i'll tell you what's interesting david is some of the downstream effects of what you were saying um people ask the question like when you deposit your crypto say bitcoin in a centralized crypto bank and you lend it out um to to someone like blockfi uh you earn a decent interest five percent six percent um a lot of that interest was generated off of this gbtc arbitrage opportunity now that that's going away we're starting to see some downstream effects so block fi has recently slashed their their rates used to be you could deposit a fairly large amount of bitcoin into block fi receive five to six percent uh interest on a loan that has dropped down to like the one to two percent um interest rate so we're seeing some of this downstream effect on the the crypto lending markets as well at least the centralized crypto lending markets i think that's going to filter into into d5 now some people have gone so far as to as to say uh well this makes crypto lenders like block fi uh insolvent i think there's a lot of fun going around like that um i don't believe it i don't think somebody like uh block fi is going to unless they're terribly mismanaged behind the scenes going to go insolvent in the middle of a a bull run like this with the the balance sheet they have and with the investors they have but it does change around the market dynamics and there's some downstream effects of this anything more we should say on that david i got nothing all right well guys we are going to get to releases in just a minute but first we want to talk about the fantastic sponsors that made this roll-up possible if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma

couple of weeks ago now open c is raising 23 million to scale the largest marketplace for nfts what is open c and why is this raised significant yeah open c is basically the craigslist ebay amazon of nfts right so like like duh like that's the easiest business model ever so congrats congrats to devon and open c i expect i expect this to work out uh and uh i i would imagine that most listeners of this podcast have been on openc at least once uh and it's really just an nft explorer along with like an nft transaction history right and so you can see because everything is on chain you can see previous offers being made and accepted or denied for any nft right and so pretty cool yeah check out that ask me anything we did with devin who's the co-founder of openc for more info on this you know what's pretty amazing too is the investors who are leading this round people like naval you see but also mark cuban tim ferriss wow alexis ohanian from reddit uh so wow rac a lot of the people who are in the nft scene are part of this a lot of mainstream people too so that's great to see david let's also talk about another past ask me anything guest the folks behind alpha finance this is going to help everyone yeah that's true we're collecting them all guys we produce a lot of content around here all right but this is alpha finance um really interesting protocol when we took a look at it but now they're adding another layer to their token which is token economics they're adding i believe cash flows to their token what's going on here yeah so alpha token holders will actually be receiving fees from the protocol right and so this is this is something i'm i really hope and i'm not sure if this is the future of d5 but i really hope it is and my one of my biggest critiques of and and not mine this is this is an opinion that i share with many other people is that equities on the equity stock market the ones that don't release dividends mainly the tech stocks they're really just a valuation on greater fools right like you'll buy apple just because it's apple and then you hope that you'll sell it for a higher price later you're not buying it because it's paying you money and this is something i'm hoping that defy really doesn't fall into this trap of not like there are fundamentals and then there's a token but there's a discrepancy between those two things so when we actually as an as an industry pay out the dividends generated from the protocol to the token holders that actually is an intrinsic link between the value of the protocol and the value of the token and so this is what alpha is doing so nice draw alpha actually paying out money to the token holders and i hope this trend continues because i want there to be a link an associative link between the value of the token and the actual revenue and value of the application that isn't just association but is actually intrinsic to actually passing value and so nice job alpha paying their token holders good job fees accrued in the first six months would have been 1.7 million so not insignificant and growing quite fast you know i agree with you there david because what else do you do with excess capital that your protocol generates you've got two only two other options besides releasing it in some sort of a dividend form one is you put it in a dow treasury and then the question is what are you going to do with all of that capital can you find a productive use for it if the dow treasury's so large i think they're like it's hard for them to find a productive use for all of this capital um the second thing you can do is buy back your tokens as well buy and burn that's what maker does so all of these mechanisms are super interesting and and i think the future of defy tokens let's talk again about the future of defy analytics these assets of course are open source these networks are completely open source dune analytics which is i think the go-to spot if you are trying to be a defy financial analyst this is the tool that you're using they just released their v2 version it's now live i have to confess i haven't taken an exhaustive look at this but why is why is why is dune analytics why is this important for us to know about this tool david yeah doing analytics is all about uh data analysis of defy and so like we've been saying before on the bankless podcast is like defy ethereum in these these economies are inside out they're completely transparent and by that definition there is so much data it's like as much data as you can possibly need so now it's about how do we parse through that data how do we consume that data and doing analytics is a data consumption tool so i expect this to to really just inject itself into the mainstream consciousness when especially when the wall street bros come over and and want to play in d5 they're going to need data analytics and things like doing analytics are going to be able to provide that to them and so it's really going to be about who can use these data digesters these data processors that is really going to be a very valuable skill moving forward and we are already seeing um vcs and d5 teams and almost every anyone tried and find people that can use these uh d5 data consumers like doing analytics that is a really valuable skill that everyone wants and so uh banging on that drum if you are looking for a job in crypto in dfi and ethereum get good at doing analytics it's really valuable absolutely here's a chart from our friend uh richard chen who's on the podcast the one confirmation podcast um this is defy total defy users over time look man we just silently crept up to over 1.6 million unique d5 users this is the sort of analytics you can get in real time on dune super cool man super cool tool um let's talk about nfts for a second and a release crypto.com is coming out with an nft distribution tool you know what this this kind of i i'm starting to wonder about nfts um we've got people who just kind of said nfts are absolutely a bubble he sold all of his proceeds uh that that he made from his art from crypto into into fiat um we have groups like crypto.com now starting to enter that it just really doesn't feel as authentic as it once was i i wonder if we're starting to see the early signs that nfts are kind of getting overcrowded the lower quality things are starting to flood into the space this just felt like a signal to me you know god bless crypto.com you use the credit card but getting into the nft space you know months in it feels kind of top signaling what do you think here yeah i'm reminded of uh sue zu's metaphor of the shitcoin roller coaster uh for those that aren't familiar if uh go go google search the euthanasia of roller coaster and it's just a roller coaster with that goes in loop-de-loops loops but the loops get tighter and tighter and tighter and the metaphor is that the iterative cycles on these things are just faster and quicker and shorter and of lesser quality because people are trying to get in on the hype uh that's what this feels like to me it feels like we're going through the euthanasia rollercoaster of nfts right now possibly possibly so um but we are just getting started i think on ethereum layer 2. here is hermes this is a zk roll up layer 2 that just came out this week i think this is targeted on payment use cases this is something that's kind of flown in under the radar david we've talked about so many different layer two projects this has been out there building now they're deployed on ethereum for the payment use case i just i i think this is part of the the theme that we're seeing uh going into the second quarter of of 2021 that layer two is is coming with like a force and it's here and the tech is being built out and a lot of different approaches are are being tried so pretty cool you guys can check out hermes at hermes dot io and start using layer twos now now today um david i think you might have some commentary on this what is going on with maker they are increasing their debt ceiling what are they doing here and what does this mean for eth and maker yeah dropping an absolute cannonball into the protocol change for maker dow increasing the maximum debt ceiling for ether as collateral from 2.5 billion die to 15 billion die and so what this means is that each collateral inside of maker dow has certain risk parameters and one of these risk parameters is called the debt ceiling and that's how much dye is allowed to be drawn out of certain specific collaterals right and so ether has this maximum 2.5 billion die that is allowed to be borrowed against ether the collateral type and the the risk the risk parameters can get adjusted in order to make sure that the maker dow system is appropriately solvent appropriately controlling risk uh but they are deciding that it's an okay move to increase the debt ceiling from 2.5 billion to 15 billion die for ether as collateral and so maker dao is letting ether be far more capital efficient as a collateral type in its vaults and so we are i think what we are going to see is an increase of ether inside of maker dow and we're going to see a very significant increase of die circulating supply uh and we're what the the moral of the story is that ether is becoming again the most capital efficient asset on ethereum due to its trustlessness advantages um absolutely massive amounts of die liquidity are possible as a result of this and that's pretty cool yeah and the reason they can do this goes back to a theory that we talk about so often on bankless we turn this economic bandwidth so ether has more economic bandwidth than it did a year ago when some of these debt ceilings were set at 2.5 billion why does it have more economic bandwidth because eath has increased in moneyness it's become more liquid it's it's uh total market cap has increased by a tremendous amount so that allows maker to and die to consume more of this value this more of this trustless economic bandwidth and uh eth is increasing in its its store value property and its moneyness as we would say just for added perspective there's currently only 2.9 billion die outstanding and so going from a 2.5 billion die debt ceiling for ether to 15 billion die is a big deal like that is a lot more die out in the ecosystem bullish maker bullish for eth as a monetary unit as a monetary asset very cool david something else that's very cool is uh the bankless community has offshoots now um this is a somebody who's starting a new podcast inspired partially by bankless hq and ethub about eath life eve culture the story behind builders uh do you know much about this i haven't given it a listen yet but i'm excited to do so yeah i know i haven't i haven't listened to it yet either but i have it in my rotation uh dennis he works at kyber been been in the kuiper team for for years now been in ethereum since before i was i met him in tel aviv when i did my uh ultra triple point asset uh talk uh and and so he's doing the eth life podcast which is a podcast dedicated to the countless ethereans passionately building on the best blockchain in the world uh so dennis perhaps uh perhaps an eth maxie uh joint join the club i guess um and i only point myself as nath maxie because everyone else does i actually don't accept that identifier but i take it as a funny joke i'm a big fan of more more uh ethereum content like please someone else help we need more ethereum content so dennis i'm super happy to see that you started a podcast yeah it's awesome guys check out that podcast definitely all right david let's flip to news we gotta talk about the big news item of the week the alphabet i i missed it what what happened una swap man it's something with unicorns so uniswap is dropping its uh version three this is like long awaited much teased version three we actually put out a whole alpha league video about this that we'll include in the show notes that you can take a look at which is our sort of first analysis first reaction i think we got some things right a lot right we probably got a few things wrong we got something wrong we got something wrong it would be the first time but look um hayden adams is going to come on the podcast and clear it all up for us that will release sometime in the next week or so on the bankless podcast but give us the skinny what what is new in unit swap v3 yeah the cool new feature about uniswap v3 is what they call concentrated liquidity and so previously if you want to provide liquidity for example to the east die pair you would provide it for the full range of possible east die trading valuations which is literally infinite in both directions right like up to one million dollar ether to down to one penny ether right you would be providing liquidity for that full possible range of of money expressions with concentrated uh liquidity you can just provide liquidity for between eighteen hundred dollar ether and twenty two hundred dollar ether and what this means is like you are taking on more impermanent loss risk as in uh take for example uh you are providing uh in just those same parameters 22 to 1800 each liquidity on the east i pair if ether is at 1800 that means you have 100 of your liquidity position in ether and you have zero percent of it in die and then if ether goes from eighteen hundred dollars to twenty two hundred dollars that it flips you uh because you have concentrated liquidity in just that spectrum at 220 ether because you are supplying uh between 220 and 1800 when the ether price moves to 220 you have zero percent ether and 100 of your lp position as dye and so it allows you to market make around a very specific band of liquidity inside the uni-swap curve and that has enormous implications to what it can do and so i i think people are going to get really creative with these um variable liquidity across the same curve of spectrums that una swap v3 is offering absolutely it makes parts of the curve very deep in terms of liquidity maybe deeper than anything we've ever seen in an automated market maker one thing it does not do is what we sort of thought it did at the very beginning is act as kind of a stop loss for a liquidity provider really doesn't do that it's almost more like you are you're adding leverage in a way between those positions you're taking on even more impermanent loss risk uh if you if you um you know do an eth die pair in a specific narrow band more on that when we talk to hayden anything else we should say on that for now yeah hayden's just been begging us to get him on the banquet podcast and so finally now that he finally released unit swap v3 i guess we'll let him come on maybe um i guess i guess i guess yeah we'll let you on this time but you know just because you released v3 just because you guys all right david decentraland casino pays in die this like file this under weird jobs categories like weird crypto jobs categories decentraland of course is this entire virtual world and inside of decentraland this this populated virtual world almost like a virtual reality city we have a casino and this virtual casino is hiring people to operate the casino tables and paying them full-time positions in die in order to do so this is crazy this is like um you know ready player one stuff uh very cool but we talk all the time about the jobs that are available for you in the crypto and the defy economy did you know you can get a job at as a virtual casino table operator maybe at a poker table or something like this crazy stuff yeah imagine working at a casino at home how crazy is that and just think about the and so this is kind of like exactly what ready player one predicted where like the economy inside of like the virtual world will come to dwarf the economy out at the outside world and if that prediction comes true we would see like something like this where um you know some of these very initial use cases would would come to manifest manifest themselves in the virtual world no surprise that it's something along the lines of gambling uh that seems to be where where these things start off with and so that i think that's just absolutely fantastic there are jobs available for inside of vr to operate a casino that's just so cool also you're getting paid in crypto money right it's like people talk about well where are these money is actually going to be used well they're being used in this new crypto economy that is the unit of exchange it's die it's not physical fiat dollars yeah and the other thing that this reminds me of is the sovereign individual thesis where uh people around the world are going to compete in these same job markets and so somebody in somebody in some some third world country has to it gets to compete with somebody from you know the united states and that that wage maybe the the wages uh are less less interested for somebody who is in the first world rich countries but more interesting for people in the third world countries and so this could be a great equalizer for people in third world countries who are trying to access better wages because everyone is operating on the same playing field in vr and online that's pretty cool look man we are entering an entirely new economy entirely new job market and uh i'm glad you're with us because this is the cusp of things we need to learn these sorts of things in order to to stay relevant and to earn wages in the 21st century here um all right let's talk about this uh petition letter coming from the maker dow community and they're petitioning one of their largest investors which is a a16z um chris dixon and team we've had chris on before this is the the maker community actually asking a16z they they own a bunch of mkr tokens asking them to get more involved in governance here um apparently they like they want their input they want their votes on various maker dow proposals and a16z is currently less active than the community would like them to be you know what's interesting here is this is sort of the same uh problem that uh stocks fallen under right so like um you know who whoever votes in in major shareholder decisions like i own various mutual funds i never vote i always use some sort of a proxy and um i do i do think sometimes these dows struggle from almost a tragedy of the commons problem whereas like you know a16z if if the governance decisions are going according to to plan they don't necessarily have to to spend time on these issues and provide governance feedback if the rest of the community is already doing it for them so i wonder if we have to kind of tweak around incentives to get better governance participation in the future for some of these dials like like maker what do you think i i think the other half of this story is that maker dao is trying to you know dissolve the doubt they're trying to dissolve the foundations and so therefore they need the next biggest holder to step up right because and as soon as the foundation dissolves a16z will be the next largest governor of maker dow holding six percent of all uh mkr tokens and so and also i believe when uh a16z bought those mkr tokens they said that they wouldn't use them for governance because they wanted the community to govern things uh they didn't they didn't want to um they didn't want to tinker with that right they wanted to be a bottom-up system but you know the maker doubt that was two years ago two plus years ago and so now that the maker dow protocol is in is in a state where like we need all all players to get involved right because the foundation is no longer steering the ship uh and so this is more i think it's more of an invitation to say like hey like it's cool to play in governance now there's a conversation here to be had about governance by vcs or governance by hedge funds but at the end of the day you know these systems are really governed by capital uh and so i feel like it's going to be a normal distribution between like retail traders who own mkr and a60z who owns a mkr um it's going to be an interesting story to follow absolutely i agree absolutely um okay beeple so he he we've reported on this last few weekly updates he made a massive amount in the nft market 69 million dollar sale and those funds were raised in eth he apparently it's come out that he immediately converted 53 million of his nft earnings that's almost all of them after i think the the third parties kind of took a chunk from the sale he converted that from eth to usd david what what does this mean to you i mean this is just the logical thing to do like people he's got taxes to pay uh he received this money in this volatile cryptocurrency which he wasn't really familiar with uh and so it's like kind of the rational thing to sell this into usd like the guy wasn't rich before like people people wasn't rich and now he has six now he has 53 million dollars and he has it in a volatile crypto asset that he's not familiar with of course he's going to sell it like it'd be crazy not to now at the end of the day like we can say but like he's going to miss out on all the gains like blah blah blah like and i think you're kind of right like this is going to ultimately i think turn into a a bitcoin pizza story this is going to be the beeple east story but at the end of the day i also don't completely don't blame him like he doesn't understand ethan's ultrasound money he doesn't understand ethereum is the native settlement layer on the internet he just got paid 53 million dollars for making some digital art like we don't have to hold him accountable to make sure that he just like holds east so like he can help us pump our bags like no like let the guy cash out yeah i totally agree like full he owes the community nothing he has the full ability and right to cash out i do think at some point in the future you may be regretting this but who knows maybe maybe not you know maybe he's just happy with like he should be happy with 53 million dollars yeah the other thing where he's crying with the cash cash with the tears away from his dollar bill it's gonna be okay for people yeah it's gonna be okay for him but i i do think that um you know the that this is why it's also important to get the the narrative out that that ether is a store of value because people don't quite understand and they might have may be making some decisions that they later regret sort of eat pizza type moments the other thing he said here which i understand the context is that nfts are absolutely a bubble so he's feeling that he's feeling like i just created a piece of digital art it just sold for 69 million dollars i don't understand any of this i'm just gonna like get out while this thing is is bubbling and like end of story because it could be over tomorrow so i i understand that perspective too yeah daily reminder that one year ago ether was 100 so crazy it probably is time to sell if you're people um number of eth validators this is a tweet from evan van ness so one thing that people don't understand is the sheer amount of validators in eth 2.0 right now versus other proof-of-stake chains so this is a this is a table of eth2 validators there's a hundred and ten thousand unique validators versus tezos there's about 400 versus cosmos 125 versus other proof-of-stake networks like nano 117 ethereum is a different flavor of proof of steak i think people miss that you know proof of steak is not all alike there is is various levels of democratization of your ability to actually run a node and ethereum is on one end of the spectrum which is the most decentralized proof of stake consensus mechanism that exists right now some of these other proof-of-stake networks are much less centralized or much less decentralized um any takes here david yeah it's it's important to note that like validators on ethereum are inherently different because like you could be running multiple validators on one machine right like one validator equals 32 eth two validators equals 64 eth if you have 64 eth you can take it on one machine um tesos and the 397 values there they that might actually be 397 unique machines i am i think that's true um still only less than 400 is incredibly like not decentralized that is not a good number uh and so like there is some parsing apart to fully understand the impact of this number but at the end of the day the economics the the game theory of this is is uh converges upon decentralization no matter what because you know you know maybe you have 3200 eth and you have a hundred validators well you have the hundred times more incentive to protect ethereum right and so the the the game theory holds up absolutely all of these proof-of-stake networks have different trade-offs with respect to decentralization other things uh elon musk another tweet came out this morning don't defy defy so now elon is talking defy so it was like dogecoin it was you know uh nfts it was bitcoin and now it's defy what does this mean is he just trolling all of us david no no he's this is him i mean no i don't know but here's my opinion he's going down the d5 rabbit hole and he's figuring it out um maybe he read ethan's ultrasound money we i'm pretty sure he he came across bankless earlier in his lifetime um and so who knows who knows yeah we'll we'll have to see definitely elon you are invited on the bankless podcast that's a standing invitation so you just let us know when you're ready yeah um let's talk nfts david starkware is raising some funds this actually isn't specific to nfts but it's a technology that immutable x is using to create sort of a an nft trading chain we've talked about that a little bit before but starkware has just raised a whole bunch of money as well it's part of the story and they've got technology that allows you to kind of scale on ethereum's layer two it seems like so many layer twos are using starkware tech what should we talk about here yeah i think what this means is that immutable x is going to launch sometime maybe next week question mark and immutable x is uh this it's got crazy tailwinds behind it it's both nfts plus layer two uh and these are this is the team behind the gaza unchained these guys have really been optimizing for scale and gas optimization since day one right uh and so i think this is really people are going to always ask like you know how is ethereum going to do anything for the world if it costs like 200 to mint an nft well the answer is darkware and immutablex i'm looking forward to seeing that immutablex story play out over the long term because i think they're going to be really important nft scaling infrastructure and for anyone that's read my article digital cultural revolution i have high aspirations for what nfts can do for the future world of creators and art and general digital culture short term there might be a bit of a bubble in the nft market we're not sure but long term all of this stuff is hugely hugely bullish uh definitely um twitter ceo jack dorsey sells his first nft tweet for three million dollars sold it on an ethereum based platform called scent so jack dorsey is getting in the scene as well this is kind of a defy nft combo and uh he's active jack dorsey has been a pretty strong bitcoiner i don't know if i'd call him a maximalist but i would uh hasn't talked you would okay he hasn't talked much about any other network so talks a lot about the the value of of of protocols decentralization decentralized protocols but only talks about crypto in the context of bitcoin do you think that's going to change oh god i don't think so unfortunately i think jack dorsey is pretty well entrenched um for some reason bitcoin maximalism kind of just like takes hold in people's brains and when it stays there it stays there yeah well we we'll have to see he's doing something with nfts um but um he's donated all of this to charity maybe that's a part part of the rabbit hole for him or maybe just stays a bitcoin or forever i want to know why he did this though because that is really the bigger question is like why is jack dorsey nf nft tweets and we know that jack dorsey is interested in uh turning twitter into more of a client system where where twitter itself would just run one client but open it would enable more uh more open source technology to twitter and allowing different clients to make tweets and so he wants to decentralize the actual twitter protocol so that's interesting um and so that and that comes from his very deep rooted knowledge in distributed systems in crypto systems and so why is he minting nft tweets because that's also highly relevant i want to see what the long story he's doing it for a reason this is a research and development type move from jack dorsey here yeah there's definitely a lot in the broader crypto market for uh for what jack's trying to do which is kind of create a create protocols out of social media platforms we'll see where he goes with that nifties backed by major investors buys into meme v2 date announced this story is about the meme founders maybe you could explain this project a little bit um they've just teamed up with some pretty large investors to launch something new something called nifties mark cuban is involved in this uh joe lubin other vcs the the whole meme story we had jordan from mimon a while back to kind of tell us about the inception of this thing but it's a crazy bizarre story how this organization formed and now it's actually receiving like traditional mainstream investment to extend what it's doing which is like what building out meme based nfts and and selling them like an nft production house yeah uh the the crazy this is the my through line for this story is like how much demand there is for good projects because if people who are familiar with meme the mean story meme started off as a joke where people minted this token called me and then they airdropped it to people and then all of a sudden the people that it got airdropped to just decided to start doing work for it and they asked they accidentally created this meme protocol which is now receiving funding and legitimate seed investment to carry the vision out and so i i'm fuzzy on the details but it's something along the lines of like you can mince your nft and deposit it into meme and meme will issue you like rewards it's kind of like some bank account like savings interest system for artists um you'll i'm again i'm fuzzy at the on the details but like the fact that this thing started off as literally a meme and is now receiving uh vc funding is pretty crazy and that just indicates to people how much demand there is for good investments in this space yeah absolutely um time magazine is also getting in on the nft this is our last nft story this week they've got three special edition covers one says is god dead the other is is truth dead and the third is probably my favorite is fiat dead so time magazine uh timed the company of course like just this is this is traditional media right now they're joining the nft um the nft i guess hype train engine and they're they're selling these magazine covers the the third one is fiat dead is kind of interesting to me david because it's like it's clearly targeted to uh the crypto market to for crypto culture essentially it's it in a way we are incenting mainstream media to give crypto what it wants which is more crypto culture and i find that that kind of interesting too they're definitely trying to sell these to crypto natives my my head is at the uh is god dead one actually and that that takes a little bit longer to explain but uh god uh god is dead is that najitse quote where uh he ran through the streets and said uh god is dead god is dead uh and really what that was a parable of how nuzzitse became terrible pronouncing his name but he was saying like our our old institutions no one pays attention to anymore and so what is going to organize us in the future that is what he meant by uh god is dead and to me that's like a heralding of like are we about to migrate from one set of archaic institutions into what and that is that is the question is god dead like well if if our previous ways of organizing or are defunct what do we move into um that's my takeaway ah absolutely time is trying to tap into something that appeals to crypto natives for sure with this very cool to see them enter uh bitcoin stuff david fidelity the massive  the massive bank the massive asset manager in traditional finance they have now filed for a bitcoin etf david if fidelity can't get this done massive right who can get it done i think traditional big banks get what they want from the federal government so i think what this means is that an etf is all but inevitable there's no way regulators are going to hold out when their their lobbyist bankers even want bitcoin etf so a big big move i think for for bitcoin big move for crypto in general yeah that's exactly right uh if if fidelity can't do it no one can and if fidelity can't do it again i'll re-echo what i said in the last week weekly roll up if if fidelity can't do it then this is definitely a political move to protect the interest of the us dollar and they're putting those interests ahead of retail investors who are getting f'ed up by trusts as we talked about with the gbtc premium debacle earlier uh and so the the listing of an of a bitcoin etf is does not help the us dollar it hurts it um but it's what the people want and so we're going to see this play out can fidelity break through to the sec and get the bitcoin etf hopefully they can well we're on the subject david maybe we should touch on uh regulation as kind of a category this is the the people's bank of china has now officially said about their central bank digital currency of course we've we've told you that they're moving full steam ahead on deploying a digital currency a central bank administered digital currency in china the quote is that a completely anonymous central bank digital currency is not an option this is kind of one of those headlines which is like yeah we knew that surprise surprise central banks government coins do not want when they go digital will not preserve anonymity will not preserve privacy they want to track all of the transactions um for for for many reasons i i think david that this is going to be true not just for china but for any country western countries europe anybody that deploys a central bank digital currency there's going to be a there's going to be no incentive for these states to actually implement privacy measures as part of the deployment like civil rights groups will fight have to fight awfully hard to make that happen and it feels like such an uphill batter battle so the digitization of central bank digital currency means the death of privacy at least in my mind that's my prediction yeah that's exactly right i have no further takes all right well let's get to this then uh fadiff is drawing up some cryptocurrency guidance i think david we should um this is not this is not really good news they may be targeting d5 and nfts but people need to understand what fatif is because it's not um central to any one nation state sort of an association of nation states can you talk about what fatif is and the implications of this guidance that they've just put out yeah it's kind of this just this global advisory group that all of these global powers like united states countries in the eu even more um that they just listen to and generally subscribe to and and people are talking about well since they're just an advisory group does this even matter but apparently like the social contract between all these people that subscribe to the fight f as an advisory group um according to coin center uh if a member of the nation state was to refuse to implement fedex guidance then there could be severe diplomatic or financial consequences could result so there there are three specific things that this slew of guidance brings to and brings to these uh brings to these countries who apparently are supposed to listen to the fat app one is surveillance obligations for non-custodial entities and so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna read here because this is outside of my domain of expertise the draft advocates for an expanded definition of vasps virtual asset service providers the persons or businesses obligated to register and conduct aml surveillance that that these people could now include non-custodial custodial participants in cryptocurrency networks such as multi-sig minority key holders and various participants in smart contracts and layer two mechanisms and so i'm actually a git coin multi-sig signer and so i would have to actually prevent present kyc aml's to i don't know who uh maybe maybe bitcoin i guess i don't i don't know but uh because i'm a multi-sig minority key holder for something that spends money and manages funds that's that's weird and then there's also scrutiny of peer-to-peer transactions and privacy enhancing technologies the draft subtly advocates against peer-to-peer transactions and transactions involving privacy enhancing technologies i think zcash monero but also zk money that got released on ethereum recently this draft argues that regulated virtual asset service providers should limit support for transactions with non-regulated parties so-called unhosted wallets aka un-custodial wallets aka your personal ethereum address and insist that developers of new protocols should limit the availability of private and peer-to-peer transactions by design ooh don't like that and then last one is customer counterparty identification the draft recommends that virtual asset service providers should subject all transactions to the travel rule this would obligate exchanges to collect specific information about who their customers are paying or being paid by this is a similar to the proposal counterparty identification requirements in finnset's fincen's ongoing midnight rule making the one made by steve mnuchin which said that like uh if you ever want to withdraw money from a crypto wallet you have to attest to your ownership of the money that you are sending it to and then vice versa if you're sending it from your crypto wallet to coinbase you have to attest that those your wallet as well um so just overall just more and more surveillance going on or uh suggested for the surveillance from fat f so yeah we we don't like this we this is bad yeah i i guess it's important to realize that this is just kind of guidance or some sort of a proposal that they put forward to this country these countries um but david this definitely feels like final boss type stuff right and it's it's throwing down the gauntlet and saying we want all transactions to be identified we we want to know aml kyc we we want to know the sending and receiving parties on both sides of those transactions and we don't like peer-to-peer transactions and we don't like we especially don't like peer-to-peer private transactions so this is final boss stuff this is stuff that um you know is is going to be hard to to fight and i'm not sure what the implications of all this are you know some folks are saying look it's just a proposal we've seen stuff like this over the years for crypto um all along and uh others are saying that this might have teeth in the future so we'll have to watch this one and see how it plays out i guess in good regulatory news there are some people like hester pierce crypto mom as uh as people in the crypto industry know her hopefully she's coming on the bankless podcast at some point too we've been in touch who take up a much more rational view on this growing industry so here's a quote from from hester pierce in a recent speech i believe perhaps government officials should pause to consider the flip side of crypto its value in protecting people from illicit activity she has always been very pro crypto seeing this industry blossom seeing all of the good things that come for countries and citizens that adopt cryptocurrency and advocates for things like we should have an sec approved etf for mainstream so there are some good people in in regulatory bodies and government that actually understand the space and wherever possible david i think we need to uh to elevate the conversation to them and and elevate their roles in government bodies yeah and at the end of the day this is a nuanced subject but you know crypto is a populist movement it's bottom up it's it's money and systems by the people for the people and there's a certain amount of resonance that we see certain uh people in governmental bodies have resonance with that populist movement we saw people like aoc immediately align with what i call a populist uprising with a whole gme debacle the the people versus the hedge funds and so many members in government just immediately aligned with the people not the hedge funds and so there's a certain amount of like pro populism i would say in the united states congress and i think certain things about crypto if as an industry if we represent them in the right way we can get them convince them that this is actually like populist technology for the populist movement that they are also helping support and so we need to figure out how to uh share that populist message in this technology because you know what the what the fat f is really is doing is helping entrench players and people like aoc and bernie sanders are the very populist left movement don't like entrenched players that's exactly who they're going against and so there's an angle here that we can definitely work with yeah and the same is true i think for the for the populist right and uh and those groups as well but this is absolutely a battle for hearts and minds uh and that that is uh certainly important we we need to propagate these narratives and to win that battle david have you kept up with this this is uh big clout maybe we'll end on this what is bit um this uh story says it's an insider's only pre-launch uh but it's really a social media revamp so it's almost like a twitter on some form of a maybe a bitcoin forked blockchain have you kept up with this story yeah i have not kept up with it but my what i have gathered is that they it is a supposed to be a a censorship resistant platform for you know general defy stuff and this defy stuff uh this version flavor of defy is leveraging the clout of celebrities to help people speculate and monetize and so where this censorship resistance comes into play is like celebrities are getting their image monetized by someone else and if this thing is truly censorship resistant then that'll just happen regardless because it's interesting resistant um and so it's going to be tested i guess on on that spectrum but i don't really know much more about it other than that yeah so i looked into it a little bit and i actually um like tried to use it and started using it and so what one one of the interesting things they did is they took about 15 000 accounts from twitter and they just auto ported them over to to bitcloud right it's almost like almost like you know how uh sushi swap sort of did a vampire attack on uniswap it's almost like a vampire attack on twitter and trying to bring those profiles over but the other thing that they're doing is like crypto economically incenting all of these accounts so every every individual who has an account on bitcloud gets a certain amount of these bitclout tokens that can be claimed and then people can buy or sell them trade trade the the various assets and trade the various accounts so like uh i don't know if you know this david but like you're in here too like if i look up trestle state um how much am i worth let's let's find out is that how it works i think i think it will show you at least it will show you how much uh let's see trustless three s's there you are this is you i'm pulling up your big clout account okay so this is your coin price 749 okay 750 smackdown you've got two followers people will trade that up or down and in order to claim this you have to um actually create a a private key for yourself and then tweet out something from your twitter account to actually claim it but uh i don't know if you know this dude but you've got some creator coins already so you've got 25k worth of uh creator coins now i have twenty five thousand dollars i can go get yeah i'm pretty sure that's it you can't actually go get it though so here's the thing you can go claim your account but apparently there's only a way to buy bitclout tokens with bitcoin okay so you can buy them but they haven't yet turned on withdrawals so i don't know i don't know if actually you can like by the time you go to withdraw this whether it'll be worth that much but um that's how they're incenting people to start using these like look at uh tyler winklevoss here let's see how much money let's see how much big clout value he has uh so almost 900k it's market value that tyler's been awarded with uh the tokens he holds so all right anyway maybe an interesting interesting experiment yeah maybe yeah the other thing is like a whole bunch of insiders got in first right so and these are insider vc firms that are pre-invested in this um so that's like all of them it's it's almost like it feels a little bit like the opposite in some ways of uh some of the fair distribution sort of community distribution trends that are going on this summer so um some people don't love that about big clout yeah if the if the actual account holders made all the money not the vc funds that i bet this would have made a much bigger splash it's possible but uh yeah we'll have to see where this evolves david are you ready to get to uh takes yeah let's do it okay what's the first take here nfts explained in two images what are we looking at here yeah so we are looking i don't even know if this is an image we just see a white box uh with jpeg in it and then we see another white box with nft in it except the nft box has a little blue twitter check mark on it authenticating the legitimacy of the nft and this is what we've been saying about nfcs all along it's not about the image it's about the legitimacy it's about the authenticity and so if you want to understand why nfts are going for millions of millions of dollars when like you can just take a screenshot and get the same thing it's because one is legitimate and one's not and people fight over these twitter blue check marks all the time and and vitalik actually recently just put out a a a blog post on his blog talking about how one of the most underappreciated forces in the world is legitimacy and so i see this as a extension of that uh nfts are value of our value because of their legitimacy yeah metallic's blog post was just like brilliant this week and right that's the same thing that gives gives cryptocurrencies it's value right why is why is ether more valuable than um ethereum classic why is bitcoin more valuable than like bitcoin diamond or bitcoin satoshi's vision it's because legitimacy people make it so people make it so and the social coordination mechanism underlines all of these crypto economic systems and underlines like all of our traditional legacy systems as well it's like this hidden force that operates everywhere um and um it's it's it's very clear to see i think in nfts the the aspect of legitimacy coming out and and being assigned some level of value totally ryan this one's you tell us about efficiency yeah so i you know what what's really striking to me with uniswap v3 launches uh how they did it with so few people right so wells fargo has about 200 000 employees right one of the largest banks in the world 200 000 employees coinbase is an order of magnitude smaller in terms of its uh its number of employees and so in order of magnitude more efficient they have 200 2 000 employees and again like coinbase with a a you know 100 billion market cap is getting is closing in on wells fargo's market cap as well but they're doing it with much fewer employees right uh and then we've got uniswap which is even an order of magnitude more efficient they're doing everything that they're doing or two orders of magnitude yeah that's right david like two orders of magnitude more efficient and because of all this it it just really feels like traditional banks don't stand a chance right you can do everything you need to do with much fewer employees when you use crypto as a you know economic settlement and then when you get into defy we're even talking about more orders of magnitude more efficient like the amount that that uniswap has done they've grown uni tokens to a 15 billion dollar valuation with just 20 employees and that's the benefit of deploying something on ethereum and i think like what's the net benefit for the worlds in society right now uh the finance industry in the us consumes six percent of gdp a lot of this is like rent seeking low value finance just like a lot of you know there's some efficiency there there's a lot of paper pushing there's a lot of inefficiency there and what if we could allocate all of that gdp to something better that that is the promise of defy the arts you know social good public good who like who knows what we could do with that but um this technology is really transformative you can do everything that like a bank can do with 20 employees rather than 200 000 that's the bottom line yeah the unit swap has a little trick up its sleeve and it's really 20 employees plus ethereum and ethereum is where it gets so much tailwinds right ethereum is providing security to uniswap intrinsically and that's why ethereum as a piece of technology is so powerful free security to anyone that builds on it and so that's where so much of that efficiency comes from yeah free security a basically a banking layer to plug right into with uh without the overhead of an entire nation state um david this d5 pulse i know caught your eye this was a poll done by d5 pulse a twitter poll and the question was asked which quality of the scalability trilemma do you find the most important decentralization security or scalability decentralization won with about 50 percent second came security third came scalability what what is this uh you know twitter poll survey telling you well yeah what's the takeaway so happy to see that decentralization is coming in first at 50 but it needs to be way higher than 50 because you know we have security in the legacy system like we have encryption and and uh sha 256 like encryption for that protects your bank account we've got that uh we have scalability we already have that as well it's decentralization that is the unique thing that cryptoeconomic networks bring to the table so the fact that like people are saying well we know we need priority and or we need to prioritize more security and more scalability is missing the whole entire point and so like the people that who are in crypto who don't value decentralization are missing the point like decentralization comes first and decentralization is why this is a movement by the people for the people and so again i'm glad that decentralization came in first but also it basically needs to be a hundred percent right because this whole entire industry is based on top of decentralization if we don't have decentralization we don't have anything how do you change their mind then probably answering to more scalability because i think what people are talking about is just like i don't want to pay gas fees and so like the way that you don't pay gas feeds is you use a centralized system uh and and i think the way that we change people's minds is by solving security and scalability so that people can be reminded about why decentralization is so important it's difficult to know that how important decentralization is until something like really bad happens like i feel like the the gme moment where everyone realized that you know all of traditional finance uh is completely rigged yeah gated backdoor deals that's when they realize the value of decentralization but absent that like you can kind of go on your your merry way and not realize that you're on um you know a centralized system that that has these people who can pull the strings granted though if ethereum and crypto at large is doing things right people should forget about decentralization because like it's securing the system right like we have decentralization therefore we can kind of forget about it it should just be in the background um you're totally right that like decentralization only becomes relevant and when somebody rug pulls somebody or attacks something or et cetera so maybe maybe perhaps that people are devaluing decentralization is actually an indication that the the decentralization is actually working david um i don't know if you saw this report by ryan watkins but it was talking about um creating an independent monetary system on top of ethereum and the the difference between stable coins that are really pegged to the dollar versus this new crop of non-pegged stable coins that we've talked about so often uh on bank lists and here's a graphic i i liked in in particular let me see if i can find it um it paints ethereum and ether as sort of the the base reserve asset of the system in the same way that gold was a reserve asset of the you know the legacy traditional financial system before the the 1930s and then these new assets like rye which we might talk about ohm and float being sort of based on top of this reserve asset and then d5 protocols being kind of the banking layer i was really struck by this this comparison and this analysis because on the on the ethereum side this is really a a self-sovereign completely you know um parallel monetary system from the central banks that has no external dependencies and that's really the vision that that we're building for and building towards on top of ethereum is really cool to see a massari analyst put it in this way and like really understand that bankless is the end destination here yeah i made a very similar graphic um back when my ether triple point asset asset article and i'm pretty sure that's where ryan got the inspiration for this one but when i made it i made the the ethereum triangle inversed because ethereum is being built we are building on top of ethereum and ethereum ether the asset gets injected upwards into d5 right it gets sucked up into the d5 economy to make these new products with a legacy system it's very much a top down system where gold is captured by the central banks and then forcibly makes the people below it use the dollar and so i i do think that illustration of a bottom-up first top-down system is important let's talk about uh something else because this is one of those uh self-sovereign reserve assets that are being built on top of um ethereum an asset we've talked about called rye um you said get your brain synced to this new paradigm usdc die are dollars or dollar coins but rye that is a true stable coin what's the difference between a dollar coin and a stable coin david yeah we have crypto dollars in usdc and die and usd uh tether um and and those are crypto dollars and then there are stable coins i'm trying to get people to re-architect in their brain what is stablecoin is because you know previously stable coins are things that are pegged to the dollar but that's because we didn't really have any alternatives i think the more accurate definition of what a stablecoin is is something that is stable that isn't a dollar if it was a dollar we would just use the word dollar but stable is its own thing and when we call dollar stable coins that is using this false anchor of the stability of the dollar and people should be reminded that the dollar is actually not stable we just don't have any other anchor better than it to anchor things to and something that could come out of cryptoeconomics could come out of ethereum is new paradigms of stability and so i think rye which is again a new paradigm instability is the new stable coin and so ryan if you go to my my next tweet uh i think um i what i say when i'm when i'm talking about this to uh stefan from the uh from the reflexer project ceo of uh reflux or the the team that put out rye i've said i've become a huge fan of intentionally using the less optimal word stablecoin even though it's still accurate on a technical level as the mechanism is a claim to claim semantic territory and so i say rye rye is speaking this next quote no you you're one dollar i'm a stable coin uh because again the dollar is not necessarily stable it's only stability is a referential you need two points it's relative you need two points to claim stability and what rye is is it's a new paradigm and stability it's a new paradigm and uh what a stable coin can be so die usdc those are crypto dollars rye is the stable coin and that's my take yeah that's a very cool take i think that's going to become increasingly important to the um the ethereum economy and to the crypto economy to have our own source of self-sovereign non-central bank dependent uh monetary assets out there uh that's that's definitely a cool difference david we are going to get to what we are excited about and of course the meme of the week but before we do we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's

gemiini.com go bankless all right david what are you excited about this week i'm excited about i think a lot of a narrative tailwinds coming for ethereum um first off as we all know money printer gopur is the meme of the year the meme of kovid and we're about to have ether burner go burn noises for ether yeah and that's coming in in july eip 1559 eip1559 the one we know and love um but also what i'm also kind of worried about for the industry at large is that the these are coming massive coming headwinds for bitcoin because of the energy conversation and this is something i've really been thinking about lately yeah i've actually kind of changed my mind on the whole bitcoin energy debate because while bitcoin itself is useful and i'm glad that it exists that doesn't mean that the energy consumption of bitcoin is actually useful energy consumption because bitcoin can be a useful product but literally the way that it works is it becomes a useful product by wasting energy and so there's an important nuance there because people think that like um whether what side of the the energy debate that you land on is determined on whether or not you think bitcoin is valuable or not but i think there's a more nuanced take where you can say that bitcoin is valuable and it's made bitcoin is made by a race to waste energy right proof of work is also proof of waste and so bitcoin can be valuable but it's secured by wasting energy and like maybe it's not a waste and when we encompass everything because bitcoin is useful but it's still wasting energy the energy is still unproductive uh and so i don't think bitcoin big the the climate change narrative and bitcoins is wasteful narrative i think will actually be the biggest threat bitcoin has ever faced and as a result that's going to put massive tailwinds behind ethereum in its proof of stake form i don't think people are ready to assume that like ethereum is is going to be this green efficient energy savings system that the the ethereum community knows it to be because it's not there yet but once proof of stake is here there's going to be a massive juxtaposition behind bitcoin's intentionally wasteful usage use of energy and ethereum's absolutely zero use of energy and and that is something i'm i'm perhaps i guess i'm excited about but i'm really just like that's going to be a an interesting story to follow yeah yeah absolutely i think so um today i tweeted something out you know we had our uh ethos ultrasound money episode which is you know just fantastic i thought there were a lot of arguments about about ethereum there but there were a lot of um i guess criticisms about um bitcoin's engine right just justin drake at least compared the bitcoin engine to the ethereum engine and uh said that the bitcoin engine economic engine was much less efficient and i tweeted out and i asked if any bitcoiners would like to kind of respond to these criticisms rebut them um any like bitcoiners who are like rational and can uh you know make an argument um it seems that way but one name that always comes to mind is is nick carter right and someone actually tagged nick carter on that tweet to come respond to some of these you know criticisms and he said i can't i'm too busy busy fighting people over the energy debate uh eco socialists uh he called them about the energy debate and i just thought to myself um man i'm really glad i don't have to fight that debate right on the like when when we're talking about ethereum in like 18 months uh once the the network merges and once ethereum transitions to proof of stake there is no need to go into the into into media and fight the eco socialists as as he called them on any of this you could just say yeah and the answer to the energy problem is a more efficient engine and it's called proof of stake and we're not burning energy anymore um so i i think you're right this is the early phases of bitcoiners having to fight that narrative and what they're going to have to do is justify bitcoin's value proposition not just for consuming all of this energy but for consuming this energy uh and and and like in the while there's other systems out there like ethereum proof of stake and that's going to be a hard case i think to to make and it's not just a a one month you know media picks up this story it's going to be like the next 10 years of fights in this whole climate debate and we've already seen bitcoiners really struggle to explain bitcoin's value proposition outside of proof of work because people don't like to admit that bitcoin is valuable after it's done like a ten thousand percent three years for the three years after you said it was rat poison squared right people have the cognitive dissonance of not wanting to accept bitcoin and then like they and then they just get to align themselves with well it's wasteful right right and like also imagine not having imagine trying to fight like the the the climate change fight the whole world is against climate change right and then all of a sudden bitcoiners are having to align themselves for better or for worse with like the climate change deniers like those those are the bitcoin allies right which is kind of weird like that's not the most ideal group of people that you want to align yourself with and it's just not they're not finding themselves in good company again regardless of whether bitcoin is a useful useful end result of all of that energy that's where bitcoin has found itself to be which is not a favorable position yeah agreed definitely ryan what are you excited about um you know i'm going to say uniswap v3 and the reason is we get to explore a whole new money lego i feel like the the version three design is just a it's a significant departure from uniswap v1 and v2 it's like a whole new design space that that that's opened up and the cool thing about this is we've said so often david anything that can be tried and made on d5 will be right this is a whole nother design but we don't lose the uniswap v2 design that's still out there that can still live that can still accrue liquidity if the market selects for for v3 and uh v3 wins over v2 then that just means v3 was superior but we don't lose anything in the process and even um you know forks uniswap formerly uniswap forks like sushi swap get to execute on that original v2 design so we've just created this whole new potentially revolutionary automated market maker design called like uniswap v3 and we don't lose anything that made the previous iterations of this uh work and then it's all going to be deployed on optimism come springtime right so this is ethereum layer 2 an option in action a whole new automated market maker design it's just super bullish and then of course david we finally have hayden adams coming to the podcast finally let's talk about all of this yeah finally letting him on um seriously he's a hard guy to to track down we got mark cuban on bankless before we got hayden adams so this is a much anticipated episode so i'm pretty excited about all of that yeah for those that aren't understanding the uh the joke about hayden adams is we've been trying to get hayden adams on the podcast since the genesis of bankless like since we started yeah we did this like intro series of like all the basic defy apps and we got like mariano from maker dell to talk about maker dow fantastic representative we got robert leschner from compound to talk about compound we got stani from ave we got kane from synthetics and then we had to talk to to not not uh hayden we talked to caleb who again fantastic representative for from uniswap but uniswap was the only application that we couldn't get the actual founder for so a whole year later we're finally getting hayden on the podcast it's going to be a good one we asked him to specifically set aside two whole hours of recording time to make that podcast happen yeah absolutely so that's much anticipated a year in the making podcast all right david let's get to meme of the week the whole point about the weekly roll ups the whole point the meme of the week this is why the rollups exist here it is it's uh you know look it's justin drake week so we got a drake meme what what's what's going on in this meme yeah this is the traditional drake meme the one where like for the first panel is drake saying no and then the second panel is drake saying yes so the first panel is drake saying no to learning finance at school and then it's drake saying no to learning about finance through crypto and i can say yes he's saying yes oh yeah saying yes to learning about finance through crypto and i can personally a hundred percent relate to this because i don't know about what you studied in in college ryan but i studied psychology and health sciences uh and so all of my financial like and like learning has happened through crypto uh and i kind of consider myself to be pretty well educated with how finance works i can keep up with all my my like my finance bros that went to actual finance school uh and so you know learning learning about finance through quote unquote the dark forest where you have to get to the other end of crypto to really understand crypto and once you do you know about finance yeah it's funny because i actually took finance as part of my undergraduate and um i feel like i actually didn't truly learn finance until i started learning crypto and it's because what they teach you in in business school like you know you know traditional uh education is like corporate finance which is the small sliver subset of finance right it's like finance for the old world um they don't teach you the history of money they don't teach you like in-depth uh economics they don't teach you about the social coordination systems behind all of these monetary assets they don't really teach you anything from a personal finance perspective in terms of yeah game theory how to grow your net worth like individually you know long-term games all of these things all of that came through studying uh crypto so man if you want to actually learn finance like not just like corporate finance lower case finance but finance with the capital f crypto is the crash course man i think uh even writing for bank list and doing these podcasts david it's been a massive education experience for uh for for me certainly and um you know i haven't i haven't learned anything as fast as uh as in crypto and the cool thing about it too is like every decision costs you you know like or or benefits you so you get to um you get instant feedback that's why did that work or did you fail yeah exactly so look if you're trying to learn real finance uh listening to bank lists learning crypto is the way to do it i think there's some truth in this drake mean absolutely absolutely this is a good one all right man i think that's all we have of course wrist and disclaimers defy is risky eth is risky so is crypto you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us for another bankless rollup bankless nation it is the last week of march what time it is kill it kill it restart what time it is [Laughter] will yoda speak for you on a friday friday morning we should do that for the uh april fool's weekly roll up oh that's gonna be fun all right that'd be terrible i would rather shoot myself how would we do it in an accent do you have any like you have a british accent or something that's what makes it good all right if neither of us can do accents all right i'll just copy anthony's daily great intro have you listened to anthony's daily grade intro it's so funny so we'll try to speak like an australian and he'll try to speak like an american sure all right ready yep
