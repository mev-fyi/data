before i had money i thought everything was a scam and it was all rigged and blah blah blah and now having money and being able to help my family out for example and seeing um my parents personalities change because they don't have to worry about certain things anymore like making ends meet or like what's gonna happen when they retire seeing their personalities change and getting to know them more as people because some number changed on a screen makes me aved like everything seems like a giant scam but b feel like i was also slightly robbed of experiencing that while i was growing up or while i was younger because they had these burdens and had to worry about them so it doesn't weigh on me so much but i do think a lot about about that like it feels like everything is a bit of a scam for some like weird numbers on a screen and it means that people like live their lives in ways where they don't get to properly know the people around them because everyone's always worried about short-term stuff
