2022 was good for crypto the way I justify saying something like that Eric is the counter factual of like what would have happened if crypto got to 10 trillion dollar asset class it got to three what would have happened if FTX had grown 5x 10x larger what would have happened if Luna got that much bigger and then blew up the counterfactuals actually scarier to me than what happened in 2022 is it a good thing that we went through this I think counter factual would have been very scary to have had crypto create real Financial stability issues for the global economy would have been devastating and I think as it stands there were some deep embarrassments and humiliations but it didn't infect the broader economy and it didn't infect the financial system and that's really important
