do you actually think this industry can self-regulate I don't think complete self-regulation in the long run is enough let's let people experiment more and sit tight and wait that is somewhat underrated it's psychologically a difficult thing to do but often it's better to wait and I feel right now we're in that situation do I think we should wait forever no I think there will come a point where the demands of legitimate institutions for regulatory Clarity will be more important than keeping it completely unregulated but I don't see that we're close to that point today
