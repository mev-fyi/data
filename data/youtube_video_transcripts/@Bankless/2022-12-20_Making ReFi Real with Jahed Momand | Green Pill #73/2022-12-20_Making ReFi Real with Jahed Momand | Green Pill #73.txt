foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we've got Jed who is going to be joining me to talk about how we can make refi real so um really interesting conversation Jed is a uh his co-founder and general partner at Cerulean Ventures so he's an investor uh also is a product guy in the space a steward to Prime Dao and stenosis Guild and and basically we are talking a lot in this episode about how can we regen the world with web 3 what are the opportunities in the bear Market what kind of stuff does jahad like to see in the space and specifically this question of how do we make regen web 3 investable because if there's money there and it's investable then you're going to see more talent and capital and attention flow into the space we talk about his experience at the cop 27 climate change Summit uh we talk about post-capitalist Network societies towards the end what needs to happen in the next one to five year years for web3 to become more regenerative for the world so just making refi making regen real is the theme of this episode and I think that you're going to enjoy it so without further Ado I'll give you making refi real enjoy Goldfinch is a

hey man good to see you again yeah great to have you um so I remember just this really going on for a hike with you when I was writing the green pill book and we were talking about our various regen uh uh feces so maybe I'll just Tee It Off with an extremely broad question how can we web3 regenerate the world oh man that's a big one too it's a good thing I gave this talk many times this year uh so like this reminds me of probably the one I did at eath Barcelona where it was like I think it was legit that title was like how can web3 regenerate the world or something you know really um you know think boy like that but basically uh how can it I think it's a number of things man but one like um you know when I'm explaining this to other investors or to people like what the hell is refi I'm like well basically you have this economy that exists that doesn't really give a about do we do you cuss in this podcast by the way I should have asked that first not not gratuitously but sometimes yeah yeah cool so I think this is this is apt you know like this economy really doesn't give a about it's hard to make it care about people about uh carbon dioxide about you know environmental degradation and stuff like that so what we call the externalities yeah exactly and wouldn't it be great if we could design a system that could internalize some of those externalities price them and make it such that we could decide make decisions about how much of them we want or don't want all right so I think that when you really dig into that sentence and you're like well what what does that actually have to do with web3 there's some things that stand out right you need accounting uh you need the ability to make some things legible that aren't you need to have one of the proven web three cases which is just uh being able to trade or have markets and stuff that's actually one of our really well proven out use cases um basically you put all those things together and I just like to say that we need more people in the space we need more money in the space and we need to turn those things to positive ends positive summons right so it seems like kind of price the externalities put them into a market and then try to internalize some of those externalities into the economy and then once it's proven that that can be work working in one place then channeling more talent and capital and resources into market pricing lots of different externalities and then you know once the market is pricing them and then there's there's money flowing into into correcting whatever asymmetry was wrong with the externalities then you're starting to have web 3 regenerate the world and bring in the things that it was not otherwise is that a valid summary yeah I think so when the the big part that I left out which I'm always actually embarrassed that I did uh is one of the things that I think you and I I've done early too is just ownership too like making sure that all of the people who are involved in these systems uh one have governance systems that kind of reflect their participation in a polycentric governance of some kind and then ownership that reflects their contribution in it right so like the thing I'm thinking about in particular is a you know I just came out of uh the un's cop 27 the climate conference and one of the things that stuck with me is um we were at this little side event called the world climate Summit it's the world's biggest capital allocators in public and private Partnerships and they were one of the things that they said during that was hey did you know that roughly 80 of the world's biodiversity is stewarded by a small amount of indigenous people spread across the world and did you also know that they get paid next to nothing for this and and all of that stewardship is basically an input to the economy right it's the this ecosystem services that people talk about so going back to you kind of you're like when you kind of remixed and you know presented to me what I had said I think the big missing piece too is also making sure that people have ownership and upside in all these systems right so I mean I think that what would you say I I think that there's a certain bad taste in in people's mouth you know particularly people who are traditionally on the left when it comes to taking markets and applying them in these new vectors um and and I'm wondering if we could talk about that a little bit because I think there are some valid criticisms there and we should unpack them anything to say about that oh for sure I think you know you and I did a panel on this two I think at East Denver right like you're in February and one of the things I said there well it's like the first thing actually is two things stick out to me I think that one you are going to like I would say in some ways we already have like markets and we have really bad markets and things right like even think about like um let's take even the sort of indigenous people example right there's across let's take South America and places like Paraguay and and Brazil you have um and you have various indigenous people like the kayapo and other folks who are stewarding uh basically forest in those regions and you today can only value those forests by what they are worth when you cut them down and sell them for Timber on a market right so I'd say the market are in that in their instance for what those folks depend on already exists and is existentially threatening them right it would be great to have another Market or another Market Force that says actually the things that these folks are doing living their lives normally as they would anyway Matt has another contribution that's much much much much much bigger than you know letting illegal loggers and um in some cases paramilitary go out and steal their land and kill them right so like that's just one sort of toy example right I'd say like in some ways the market forces have already happened to them so it'd be great if we could find a way to include them and create either opposing or orthogonal Market forces that can offset some of that stuff so I guess like the argument here is that in the case of the loggers the market forces have only made the forest legible to the market wherein if they cut it down and they sell it then that's how them it's eligible to the market and what if it was it what if there was a sort of a stewardship stipend that was given to people who were maintaining the trees and maybe that was offset by some sort of carbon credit system that because the trees weren't being cut uh chopped down that's where it gets funded so basically making it legible to the market in an opposing way to the traditional extractive capitalist way is what you're talking about here totally and I think like carbon is just the Tipping Point like or just the very tip of it right because you could zoom out and say uh this is the thing people have been talking about for a couple decades if not more what are what is the value of ecosystem Services right so like what is the value of carbon captured oxygen-produced biodiversity supported Watershed quality all that kind of stuff right so I think when you you take that you know today some of the numbers that are thrown around by economists are anywhere from 16 to 54 trillion dollars is the worth of the inputs of nature into the economy and so you know when someone says like well markets have been really traditionally really terrible I'm like yeah the problem a lot of the problem with them is that they're dominated by the interests of a few uh there they become uh distorted by Price making by Price making versus price taking literally they just become dysfunctional markets and then lastly a bunch of people are just shut out from you and participating in them right like you have if I came today actually thankfully there are a couple refi projects are kind of working on this but if you wanted to do that exact thing that I said where someone said hey actually I would like to not cut down this forest and I would like to actually make its value legible to you in other ways and have that market value be available such that someone can say oh I would like to purchase the ecosystem Services of this region and not cut down the trees that would actually be I think game changing right at least from my perspective yeah one of the things I I run into sometimes when we're I'm talking about this uh which I'm doing a lot uh is is where's the money gonna come from that sort of creates that opposing Market Force to the loggers and and I didn't know the answer for a little while but then Griff green started talking about how there's like tens of trillions of dollars of money going into public goods if you count all of the existing Charities uh and local government and um State and national government in the United States and and sort of like one of his ideas is that the money that would have gone into some like hierarchical high administrative overhead program to regenerate the world coming from the state or I guess regenerate your local economy since states have local jurisdictions could then be channeled into these kinds of stipends and they can just be more efficient because they're being deployed through a network based system and smart contracts and stuff like that so so I guess like two-part question what do you think of the question of how do we fund this world regeneration um what do you think of that and and also you know what do you think of Griff's thesis about that trillions of dollars that was going to the state now being channeled through smart contracts oh well I have talked to Griff about this quite a lot actually on the uh and I'll take that part of it first I think that um you know when you think about all the folks involved in this it is and truly is like it's it's just a mess right like when you think you have to zoom into like what level of the ontology you're talking about with respect to jurisdictions and states right like um and at every level it gets more convoluted but at in theory I actually do agree with that like that is public good spending right the problem much like you know you've probably done a couple episodes on decentralized science right the problem yeah I see the problem is similar to science in that you have the production of you know an epistemology facts a bunch of things scientific facts being you know put out there that is also entangled with reputation uh Prestige career advancement all these other things right um because of the bureaucratization of Science and that's not to say it's good or bad it's just a fact right so then take that and say maybe look at your local jurisdiction the thesis for Griff here is that a lot of the funding and a lot of the projects are actually tied in these hierarchical structures to things other than their outcomes right they're tied to things like uh this person gets a promotion for getting it through the other person on the other side might you know back scratch the private sector employee to come in and run the thing on the public side in the next go around and all this right I think that's the real promise of if Griff's thing leads anywhere that's the real promise of it right is that it disentangles uh these status hierarchies that actually prevent us from making what we what people would ostensibly say are objectively better impact-based outcomes right so I'd say I mostly agree and if I'm curious I'm really curious to see if that plays out right if you can actually say let's make a you know a local city Dao or a neighborhood Dao even that says hey we're gonna we're actually going to take the local actors as being the experts on what needs to happen here and we're going to let them maybe use something like bitcoin's quadratic funding Primitives to decide what needs to get out there for them right and now that is a super cool experiment now the only thing the only problem it runs into is how do you bootstrap that system and how do you make it like either you know City State Global right that's the hard part yeah yeah I mean for me each of these mechanisms you need a mechanism to distribute capital and then according to who's doing the most public good um or regenerative work you know I'm I think public goods are a horizon they're they're a little bit technocratic because you know as soon as you start giving out something that's excludable or rivalrous in some Dimension then um but anyway you need a mechanism that gives out the the money to people who are doing good and then you need a mechanism for raising the money and I think it's easier for people to grok that oh some of this money that was coming in through taxes which was designated for the public good could be used to fund these dials but there are more advanced mechanisms of raising that money like you could create a dow for that local neighborhood and create a local currency for that of which you know most of the treasury goes to but then you get into all these problems of bootstrapping a new local currency and why is that worth anything and and you know it's just simpler to say oh we're going to take some of the taxpayer money to to bootstrap it but I actually think it's really interesting to think about the mech mechanism Legos on the distribution side and then the the the plurality of ways that you could raise money to go into the Legos and then like eventually through all the permutations will eventually find something that works and then starts to work at scale with these things absolutely and I think for me the real interesting question is can an investor of any kind whether it be a venture a debt or even just patient Capital which is kind of becoming a popular term these days can a person like that come in and bootstrap these systems can a group like that come in and say hey this is a super interesting outcome the potential Market is in the trillions and we actually care less about having like 12 of it at IPO the notion of IPO doesn't exist here it's actually just more of a network play and we could take one percent of it and create massive massive economic benefits for everyone right that's really a big part of my you know experiment in this whole regenerative economy thing is is that possible I don't know yet well do you know any investors we could ask how do we make regen stuff investable oh well actually it's funny you say that that's literally what I think about and all in my free time I'd say maybe it's Gotta Be maybe at least 50 of my deal calls are just trying to figure out with an entrepreneur or the founder like hey uh how can we shape this into a thing that offers some clear value to investors but also Isn't So hideous that it just you know takes over your whole network and makes it the BC chain right because nobody wants that I don't want that all right like but how do you make things I mean really it's a great question because I I think this is fresh on my mind too coming out of cop because like I said you have all these huge huge Capital allocators who are sitting here going like I'm talking just to be clear right like you know um Schroeders which is one of the uh the UK's biggest asset managers 700 billion under management you have like um Cafe Holdings which is a near a trillion in management you have uh LGT who is the world's biggest family office sitting on like 5 billion um and these people are coming together and saying hey um we've realized that we've learned some interesting things about impact specifically about climate in the last 20 years but all of the things we've kind of done are just little you know like dinking and Duncan here and there they're not tied together like in a cohesive Vision there's no there's no technology behind it that can really help scale it up right and so I think making regen stuff investable you some of it has to do with you know Kevin you're a you're a multi-time Founder right they have all these things in Silicon Valley and such around customer development understanding the various folks in your uh you know your customer segmentation understanding the various parties involved in your network I think some of that stuff applies almost one to one to what we're building here but some of it doesn't right and so like making regen stuff investable the first thing I always ask is like one why does this have to be a blockchain right like this is because a lot of the stuff we talk about even I think you did an episode on carbon credits right like a lot of the stuff around carbon credits even it's unclear to the market players why it has to be on a blockchain right because you can do a lot of it with a database um so I think really number one there is like why does it have to be a blockchain and there has to be a really compelling reason for that and there are compelling reasons for it right like you want to make something that's difficult to make legible legible to two computers in a way where it can't be spent in a way where the data can be tracked with provenance great we're in business right that's you're you're probably on the right tact to something that's going to be investable the other thing too the next thing I kind of look at is are you really are you solving a real problem for an actually existing human and how do you justify that belief right it's like um what you'll find I ask this question just because Upstream of it is going to be the next thing which is you know can you go to market or go to community right like when you actually launch this thing what I see from a lot of people building refi protocols as well is um I think this is starting to get better but what I've seen in the past year is just honestly a lot of opium man people are like Hey we're gonna put this thing together we're gonna launch it and people are going to start using it and I'm like well this is where some of the most heinous technology companies in the world like Facebook and Google have really understood you know behavioral loops and how to get people engaged so I'd say that ends up being a really big determinant of you know who are the actual who are the markets involved who are the people involved and how do you get their attention in a way that isn't just you know extractive and nonsense right yeah yeah there's a little bit in there about how you have to play game B game game a to get over to people to you have to play game a to get people to to build in game B which is one of those sort of paradoxes of Milwaukee and paradoxes of um you know doing something a little bit uh naughty in order to get people into your more regen stuff um I guess I'm wondering you know so I think I I sort of playfully asked that question about how do we make regen web 3 investable but uh you're actually a professional investor working on this so like you know what's your what's your investment thesis uh how's it going with Cerulean VC um you know I I'm just curious what what kind of Trends you're seeing as someone who's been a capital allocator in this space yeah for sure so I think like the thesis I you can maybe even obsessed out from a couple other answers but really I just think that we need you know you and I think we kind of agree on this is that we need to build a regenerative economy and we need to build it because our lives dependent depend on it on in this Century basically our lives and our children's lives right um and uh what does that entail I think it entails basically you know when we we touched on this a little bit with Griff but uh how do we get the attention of the biggest Capital allocators just in the world period to realize that they all realize they need to build a new economy but they don't know necessarily where to do that and how to do it and so for us one of the big things we look at basically three things how do we make blockchains in interacting with them easier safer more secure so we look at a lot of stuff around user experience uh smart contract wallets uh decentralized custody stuff like this because we deeply believe in you know what actually is happening under the scenes but we need to make sure that dude if if you have like Deloitte or someone in here coming in to meet their Net Zero commitments on Toucan they're not going to use a wallet right like we and if they are going to use a wallet their CFO is going to have a conniption that's got to have access control permissions and a bunch of security features right that doesn't mean that we need to obscure or not build it on blockchain it means that we need to actually figure out maybe with multi-party computation or other fancy things how to make that viable for them right and so we look at stuff like that the next step really for us is that there are there exists right now in these natural asset markets like carbon and other things there's no real way to help Capital make a return on its risk right so what I mean by that is you go to any of these account managers or ESG managers sustainability managers and you say hey what's your carbon strategy what's your Net Zero strategy and they'll be like great I just you know I basically just have to buy the stuff that's a huge cost center on my balance sheet at the end of the day because you know either the government said so or we did it because of the voluntary carbon markets and you know other being pulled into it by NetZero pledges it would be really great and it's a thesis area for us if you could make investing in in the refi economy something where you might actually get a return so like you look around at even the Commodities markets for carbon it's really hard for you to get into things like uh Chicago merchantel Exchange there's three different types of carbon Futures right there aren't perps there aren't options there's no way for you to hedge really on your positions and I'm talking about in the normal world right not in crypto world and we know this stuff pretty well even with the FTX collapse like crypto drives a ton of volume in perps right so we look at stuff like that and say how can we look at this through the lens of a person who's trying to allocate Capital to this asset class if they own a bunch of nature-based solutions how can they actually say how can they treat it as risk capital and not just a cost center on their on their balance sheet that involves building new D5 Primitives with decentralized custody and the trust that you need for Enterprises to engage in this market and so we are very interested in folks who are building cross-chain cross-chain perps cross chain options cross chain refi assets basically so we look at a lot of that stuff and then lastly we're just looking at what I'd call the actual refi Solutions themselves right so we work really closely with regen Network who's uh basically the community owned registry for Eco asset issuance and we you know we've touched on a lot of stuff this year we've made like 16 investments in refi this year um actually sorry we made about 10 16 we made 16 10 of those a refi we would call we put in that refi bucket and for us it's very much just saying how can we begin to build on that vision of like more people more liquidity and price Discovery and more actual regenerative Solutions right yeah it just feels like there's this Loop where if we can get if we can get like a regen Market category leader it can kind of create this gravity well that pulls in more attention and talent and capital and then if you go up the food chain from like talent and capital to like Dows that are successful and then you get to like funds that are having good returns through regen then there's like this copycat effect where like you see one that's success one dial that's successful and then 100 other dials launched you know we saw it with ohm we saw it with yams um and and there's like the same effect with funds where if if Cerulean could generate outsides returns by investing in regen web 3 then that creates this domino effect where all these other funds are just going to follow into it and so for me it feels like the highest thing that we can do is create a market success um in returns in in in this category and and that'll just create this gravity wall that pulls more and more people into regen now it's there's a little bit of like a draw the rest of the owl here because how do you create a giant market success when you're working with public goods in and you're competing against um projects that are you know that are extracting in order to create higher returns so I think that there's a little bit of like an uphill climb to do it but that's that's at least how I think about this movement growing bigger I think you're spot on Kevin because the thing I I had this little you know almost aside in that last bit talking about the thesis where I was like oh yeah in region the community the community owned registry it's like well it's a big part of our strategy just because um we think like look you can go out there and sort of Dink and dunk with your five million 10 million dollar rounds here when you have your interoper if you know you can make up you know pie into interoperability and cooperation but you really have to ensure that if there is a natural asset issuance happening in the web 3 economy that it is going through like you know Dallas have governed how it's issued those Downs are composed of people who are scientists land stewards people who actually understand what's happening um with this asset and that it isn't just you know cornered by one VC chain only that owns all the upside in it and then it's just going to you know then they'll dump on retail that's I don't think that's an outcome anyone wants basically all right we have to find a way to in my opinion I think we have to have polycentric governance for all of these things we have to make sure that most people many of the people who are involved in a cross-chain economy for maybe if you just take carbon credit issuance have bags in each other and so that so that we all have pieces of each other and are not just uh well well it seems like they've aggregated all the demand and they've aggravated all the supply we should just go with those two and then we have another Monopoly Dynamic emerging yeah Monopoly is this pluralism as far as capital goes exactly working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work while opolis manages the back end there's a lot of nation state overhead when working in web3 and opolis takes care of all of the back end stuff freeing you up to do what you

now with a prize pool of over a hundred thousand dollars so one of my ideas of how this space can beat the other spaces because it's so anti-fragile the pluralism creates anti-fragility and um the other thing that it does is that I think that it creates a better system over the long term um so can you tell me about the the meme of patient capital and what that means to you yeah absolutely so I just came back from this big impact conference in Zurich called Noah it's um probably all of the Major Impact investors from the UK from Germany and from Switzerland all in the same building and this is like a very specific phrase that you keep hearing people say there it's like we're I mean I had entrepreneurs approach me and like they're like oh you're a crypto VC well we're looking for patient capital I was like wait on what Horizon do you think I'm talking about here right like we're uh to give you an example what is patient Capital there's a group that we invest in called Odyssey Network and they're building a multi-party computation blockchain to power uh amongst other things decentralized custody but also the types of permissions and access control that normal human beings are used to on the internet right so for wallets and one thing that really caught our attention was that their Founders All gave themselves 10-year best right and so like that's an easy deal where we actually we're trying to get a lot of our other group a lot of our other folks to actually look at this and say like we will take this with you right like patient capital is not come sending me a pitch deck for a refi project where it's like hey dude you get 18 month cliff and a three year vest or two or two year invest in your tokens then you can dump right that's the opposite of patient Capital right like I think um it's very much making sure that your Founders and their teams are adequately capitalized such that they can have some breathing room for 24 to 36 months at a time in terms of capital and that you're there to support them in their pivots with the I you know your eye on a vision of something that's maybe 7 to 15 to 20 years out right like yeah our fund's life is you know 10 years like everyone else but at the same time we're talking about if I remember if I remind the audience of some of these numbers a 20 to 54 trillion dollar natural asset economy that's basically unaccounted for for the most part carbon accounts for two billion of it and there's a maybe a little bit more of it tied up in um in Ocean and offsets around that but not much right so if we are patient with this we can all we can all win pretty much what what can you tell me where that trillion dollar number comes from because I hear you know I got one I got Griff on one on one shoulder talking about this 10 trillion dollars of public goods if you add up all the spending yearly from from local governments but that sounds like a different number uh of the market size of regen web3 yeah absolutely I'll I'll send that maybe if you have show Notes too you can stick it in there but there's this paper in the Nate that's published in nature like in 1997 or so it's called Uh the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural Capital assets and they basically go through this framework where they try to look at the oceans the forest soil um air quality and try to price uh like like the economists they are um what what is the impact from you know air quality let's take air quality right um air quality is a really difficult one to price so they actually take the opposite view of it and say what is the impact of negative air quality in terms of deaths per year and then what is the price of a human life right and they basically come up with something like of negative air quality takes two trillion dollars away from the global from the global economy every year because of you know early deaths childhood deaths uh lung diseases all that kind of stuff right so then they'll move on to stuff like forests and they say great what is the economic value of a forest well if we price it straight up on Timber only this is the number we get at now let's try to include in that as well uh let's try to tie what if so then they kind of walk through some scenarios here and they say well forests produce x amount of oxygen they also capture particulates so the stuff that is actually coming into the other side for the air quality argument is kind of coming in on this side with the particulate matter capture that the forests and other things do of course and you know trees and all that so through this framework you know I'm like summarizing a huge paper but that's essentially a good kind of thing they walk through and say great Boris 2x the oceans do y let's then also look at you know Fishery the sea shellfish all the value that comes that feeds people out of the ocean let's also try to look at the value of carbon credits and how much carbon the ocean captures it's a substantial amount something like a I don't remember if I'm making this up so maybe they'll call on me in the in the comments but it's something like 70 to 80 percent of all of the carbon on Earth is captured by the ocean right so uh that's a substantial amount that we're just walking around going like isn't it great the ocean does that most of us have no idea right and so um that's kind of where these numbers come from yeah well it just seems like you know it kind of reminds me of Bitcoin started off focused on open source sustainability and it's since grown in scope to think about lots of different types of public goods but it reminds me of the study that was done in 2014 that they basically figured out that the value of all open source software is that it contributes something like 400 billion dollars per year in economic value huge society and answers yeah and so like you know I think we've got these similar situations where the economic value of the of the the oceans the biosphere as you said and in in my case coming from open source of Open Source software these things are public goods that generate value for all of us but they're not integrated into the markets in such a way that people have an incentive to Steward them and it feels like that's the great great question that's a great question of of our time is is how do you basically reward the people who are stewarding the you know we can put in economic terms the generators of this economic value but there's also a moral you know we want to support them because they're good in their own but like but like how do you find the funding for that in a in the information age like does that come from taxes does that come from Dao's like the sustainable funding I think is like the the missing part uh and just like creating experiments that work at a small scale and scaling those up and proving that it can happen I think is the big opportunity yeah absolutely and I think you know part of my answer is that it has to come from corporate balance sheets these guys many of them uh to be clear for through no real fault of their own right like I'm not saying they're blameless but um you run the simulation and you have the agents play take the steps in front of them and you you're going to lead to many of the same choices right like you can't rely on people to be like well well I'm just trying to make some clothes bro I don't really like I'm I'm trying to do fast fashion here I don't I don't have my impact on this River priced in because I don't care right I'm just gonna do this but I think um I really turn to corporates in a lot of my arguments because I think that they're already participating in some of these markets to a certain degree and we just have to make this more palatable for risk their risk Capital because there's just so much of it man and it can be massively sustainable I want to give you an example actually so um there's a one of our portfolio companies is stallow they're building a carbon registry and Marketplace um cross chain on a number of chains but what's interesting is they've you know they've locked up some Supply with some very specific partners that no one else has kind of you know looked at biochar Registries I won't get into exactly what biochar is I'll maybe I'll send you something for the show notes but what's really interesting here is that they also have built a token and staking Dynamic where they're really trying to court Traders Commodities Traders right they want them to have incentives to trade they want them to have to come in and see token go up but uh what doesn't exist today in I and just to like kind of peg this to a real life example I went to s p Global carbon markets which was a conference here in Barcelona and CME Group Chicago Mercantile Exchange was talking about um you know the types of options and Futures that they offer in carbon and what they're building and you need a very specific type of asset to trade in these markets in my opinion because you don't actually just want people to come in and speculate you want people who will speculate but then are actually going to have participate in the market fully and what I mean by that is is if you have an option running even option position running you should have to claim the asset underlying it and retire it you should have participation in the market right you shouldn't you shouldn't just be a guys like I'm trying to make some money out of this and so thallo has thought about this quite a bit and then also designed a dynamic with the credits in their Marketplace such that they actually do want people to make secondary and diversary transactions on these and they're going to basically collect and because they are eventually going to build a options Marketplace too or something like it they're going to have a fund that collects a percentages of each transaction and delivers that to project developers on their marketplace right this is the kind of stuff that I really want to see in the world where you have hey we're going to have some serious dgn Behavior we're going to actually make it uh you know a a safe place for that we're going to make it possible we think it's good at the same time we're going to make sure that some of it goes back to the coffers of the people actually developing the carbon projects in real life and we might even begin funding our own projects right I think that's super cool and that's really like that's the kind of thing where you can say how do we make this a sustainable public good well we've got this place where everyone is incentivized to take the DJ action and then we can kind of slice off a little bit of the top for some regen action I love that um I I want to uh in there's a there's a question on my on my question list that I've wanted to ask you as as we've been going through this um and and I think that it might poke at your larger Vision in a in a different way um why is your Twitter handle against Utopia uh is question number one and then the second question is why is your Twitter name post-capitalist Network Society let's unpack both of those oh for sure man so I mean I made up the handle on a lark like I don't know seven years ago six years ago um you've read you've read seeing like a state right James C Scott yeah yeah yeah so like but but the audience may not have so just make sure yeah sure I'll unpack it a bit so we use some terms here that these are the terms you know when you you hear someone use a term you're like ah they probably read X book so like legibility has become one of these terms it predates blockchains by at least 25 years and it really came was popularized by James C Scott and seeing like a state where the overarching sort of point of that book is that is how plans for you know modernist authoritarian Visions fail right and one of the key points is that they fail by this concept he calls it heroic simplification right like in order for a group to make a decision about a a really complex territory they have to radically simplify the information that they actually are looking at so um this leads to a lot of really adverse outcomes because Central planners uh you probably heard this argument before have to clean away at information and some of that information is really meaningful to the local actors on the ground and so you end up with really what ends up being the exact you know uh situation for adverse outcomes Things No One planned for right and so for me I looked at that book and I was like whoa this is the first time I've actually felt uh what I am like as a person right it actually very much made me realize that uh and I had this sent me on a longer sort of you know down a longer Rabbit Hole around a a area philosophy called uh epistemological anarchism which basically I'm not going to get into but that's where the name kind of originated because Scott's really what what I took of Scott's main point is that almost all technocrats who have to sort of radically simplify to make these types of decisions whether in their their municipalities the localities states whatever are really utopian in their Visions but if you talk to them about the sleep like absolutely not I did means testing I like did this and the other um but at its heart it's very trying to do these things on this Grand of a scale without the feedback loops of local actors and the people who are actually being affected is in my opinion very much utopian and so I look around at a lot of the systems that govern our lives and I think they're like a hideously utopian sometimes with really bad outcomes right and I think you may have even talked about some of these in your pod before right but that's really where the name comes from is that I think uh you know I'm I'm against that entire idea and I think there are none there are there are not really any of them and I think the only ones that exist are the ones that can include as many people as possible and integrate these Visions in a polycentric way pretty much so I mean I guess the the the definition through the Oxford dictionary of Utopia is an imagined place or state of things where everything is perfect for that's the definition of Utopia there's the idea here that that is that like that's a mirage and you're actually like Trojan horsing in dystopia when you're imagining that you're going into Utopia and that's the thing that we all need to check yeah and actually that was a really good remix my friend that that's exactly right okay cool tell me about post-capitalist Network Society oh and you know I I kind of played with my Twitter name here and there but this is the latest one I like so like uh I'll also see it as a black a Black Flag there post capitalist networks inside of you Black Flag Emoji oh of course not to be not to be mixed up with a bankless style for to be clear um okay because I because I do think that um I mean I don't know different group of pirates yeah exactly for me it's very much uh the Old School Plum line Anarchist flag right basically um what is anarchy to me it's maximizing the agency of every human being against hierarchies right that's all it is and so it isn't anything more than that and for me when I think about a lot of the stuff that's come out in our space in like the last year I think about you know you had Bellagio on I actually still have to chat with him we were in DMS and Twitter about him coming on my pod to talk about Network state which is funny I just went out there and I don't know I hadn't read the book yet and I was just like Network State it's got the word state in the in it now but I was just I was just being stupid right but he was like hey actually you're gonna like chapters four or five or whatever I was like all right fine I'll read it before I talk palaci um but anyway like post capitalist Network Society basically that's what I think you're trying to bootstrap with this network of impact hours man like basically how do you get to a point where like I don't actually think that that capital is such a word for where we're at post 20th century so I do think like it just scrambles people's brains when you even talk about it right you're like are you a capitalist are you not are you a socialist are you this that and the other I'm like honestly capital is just things that we have all decided are meaningful and we want to dedicate some of those resources for people to support themselves while they do some things that we want them to do right and I would like us to get past kind of like this uh oh is that a capitalist thing is it not a capitalist thing it's like I how can we just bootstrap new systems right of agency that's all right and then how can we make sure that everyone who's kind of wants to move roughly in the same direction can have a network of support that does that um because I do not think that the state is society though I think that people some people really try to make that argument and it's like this thing is 200 years old it doesn't represent all of this right we need to have for me going back to the original thing around the Black Flag I would like the I would like anyone to have the ability to say what degree to what degree do I want to participate in the money system or in this system where I have to go to this one office and get a passport because I was born in this arbitrary plot of land and I have to because they said so right so um that was a bit of a rambly answer but that's kind of all that's wrapped up in those three words yeah well no it's reminded me of I've been listening to this lecture series on YouTube called post-capitalist desires by Mark Fisher and is this this this um this really beautiful vision of you know a uh what what comes after capitalism but it's also a critique of the left and and sort of the over consumption and uh uh the the sort of like uh the 60s and the 70s it's a critique of that critique of capitalism in order to arrive at what a more post-capitalist Society uh could look like and then how do our desires get handled in that so um I think it's a really interesting idea space that maybe I want to explore more in the future for sure and I think Mark Fisher check out capitalist realism if you haven't read it it's uh it's a quick little read and it kind of it definitely changed my mind a lot of things but the whole the point of it is basically he had been dealing with a lot of depression at the time and basically thinking like um how how is it such that in our in his time or I think he had committed suicide in 2017 or so but um you know this is like 2012. his whole point with the book was essentially how is it that whenever we try to imagine new possibilities they all happen within like market-based capitalism right how is it that capitalism subsumes how and why right and so that that ends up being that like a quick little study on that and um the other thing too like you're talking about with the left um you know he that was basically is that was the last few years of his work I'd say the last two or three years this work was very much focused on that um not not like necessarily punching left but more just saying like how can the various groups of people who call themselves the left work together through the left and get past this concept to something that's a bit more viable because I'll tell you why do I you know why do I do it I do I think that there's a lot of folks who are you know you going back to an earlier thing you had said about you know Charities or what have you right like are some of these things Charities or not it's um I one of my Theses is that if we open up participation to these systems to more people expand the agency of humans we should be able to compete against you know Market capitalist firms monopolist firms duopolis foreign parts of the economy because we are better information processors we're more resilient and offering some of the things you touched on earlier too with the anti-frat with anti-fragility and all we need is the right is just to be able to compete and see what happens right in my opinion and that's really what I see is like the promise of the stuff mm-hmm yeah well um I think it's been really great to have the have you on and to have this conversation is there anything that I didn't ask you uh that in the last couple of minutes we should jam on you know I I don't think so man I think we touched on all of it to be honest you know because we we could have covered that thing I did have one thing like what needs to happen in the next year or two through the bear for uh refi Builders to really concentrate down but I really think we covered that man like yeah I think so I think we're good great well where can people find you online ah yes so you we already did the quick little study on my Twitter handle against Utopia you can find me there um I've been pretty quiet lately because it's uh at end of the year it's kind of a there's just a lot to do but yeah you can find me there you can find us at cerulean.bc if you're building the space please find us let us know what you're building always happy to look at anything related to refi and um that's it yeah all right cheers man thanks for joining you around me sir
