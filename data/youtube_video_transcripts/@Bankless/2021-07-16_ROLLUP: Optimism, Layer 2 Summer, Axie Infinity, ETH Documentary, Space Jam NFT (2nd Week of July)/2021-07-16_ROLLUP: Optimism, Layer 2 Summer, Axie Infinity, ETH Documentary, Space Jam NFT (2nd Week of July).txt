hey bankless nation happy second week of july what time is it david it is friday weekly roll up time where we take the whole entire week in crypto and condense it down into one single episode ryan i'm actually particularly stoked for this weekly roll-up episode because so much stuff happened in the last week there's so much stuff to talk about so much stuff to cover and so we are going to go through all of it with the bankless nation this is going to be a tricky one to condense because as you said there is so much to talk about but let's get into it if you're new to the roll-ups they come out every friday morning and our job is to boil this down into markets releases news take what we're excited about we end with the meme of the week we hope you enjoy this it comes out on youtube and also on the podcast david before we get into it we've got to talk about something big that is coming to crypto that is the smart contract summit that is happening august 5th to august 7th and this is like it's it's put on by the the folks at chain link but this is almost like a free defy conference because everybody's going to be there they're having like 200 different projects discussing d5 nfts blockchain they're talking about mev we're going to be talking about layer 2 david you and i are going to be there we have a special panel that we've got lined up on eip 1559 which hopefully on august 5th will have just happened by the time we do this panel uh i'm super stoked about this it's going to be eip1559 week and this is going to be part of the weekly orchestra of eip1559 content going out that week so definitely stay tuned to the smart contract summit get a ticket or sign up the tickets are free so sign up for one and get and watch the eip panel that ryan and i put on we will have a link in the show notes to the smart contract summit so you can hook yourself up once again a free conference like a two-day conference huge value in that uh and um it's gonna be happening here soon one other thing we should talk about david is the staking services panel that we did last night was super late for me but this panel was definitely worth the wait uh do you want to give folks a preview yeah so we did this uh 8 p.m last night from my time 11 p.m for ryan slime yesterday and and the reason why it was so late is because eat staking is a global phenomenon therefore these staking as a service providers are found all across the globe so we brought on darren langley from rocket pool who's from australia we brought on vasili uh chapalalov from actually don't know where he's from i think eastern europe uh and then we also brought ejazz from coinbase and so we have three different staking as a service providers coming and giving their pitches their opinions their approaches towards staking eth and there was a ton of knowledge got dropped there uh definitely check that out that is a panel that you do not want to miss it went out on the podcast yesterday morning and a youtube yesterday evening as well uh so definitely watch that once again it'll be in the show notes all right david you ready to get to markets let's start with bitcoin price bitcoin price started the week at two thousand dollars went to the high highs of thirty four thousand and a half dollars and is now down to the low lows of thirty one thousand eight hundred dollars uh is this more crab season are we starting to get into bear season this is like i hope it's i hope it's crab season still i still hope because it's starting to like you know push on that bottom boundary of crab season right it's starting to be like ooh crab crab bears i still feel like big pointers bitcoiners feel okay as long as it's above 30k and uh ethereum's feel okay as long as price is above uh 2k and i'm not sure that we're there yet for ether we'll talk about that in a second but you know what has been growing on bitcoin is capacity in lightning so this is actually some fairly decent growth a growth rate i would say over the last um 40 days or so in lightning there's 1800 bitcoin in lightning as of right now what's your take uh yeah we bitcoiners pay attention to lightning network and so seeing that growth actually follow through is really important at the end of the day this is like one micro strategy purchase worth of bitcoins in the lightning network so like still small numbers but fast growth rate so definitely something to keep an eye on yeah definitely um and let's talk about ether now so eth price we are below 2000 so if ethel's not feeling great yeah the holder's not feeling great maybe maybe we're dipping into you a little more of that um bear with crab arms or crabs with bear arms whatever you said uh what's what's your take on eath price yeah youth price started the week at 2100 got up to a high of 21.75 so really didn't have any much of an week momentum uh and now we have fallen down below the two thousand dollar level currently at nineteen hundred and twenty five dollars crab with bear arms bear arms all right you know why i find it hard to be bearish and there's lots of reasons but here's one of them uh ether this year is on track to do 8 trillion in settlement value transactions 8 trillion large number on its network in 2021 that's absolutely incredible this is like a three or four x of of paypal and these numbers are absolutely staggering like a huge chunk of this probably 50 percent or so is settlement in eth denominated in each the rest is in stable coins i'm not sure if this even includes i don't think it includes all of the the tokens on ethereum which would put these numbers even higher no one's talking about this like this is becoming the a settlement network for the world's bigger than paypal and still mainstream doesn't know the word ethereum this is why i find it so hard to be bearish when i see metrics like this yeah price does not matter here like settlement value settlement speed settlement volume going up and to the right it doesn't matter what price is stable coins don't change in value and even with ether dropping in value the value of ether being transferred keeps going up uh you know keep in mind eip1559 directly translates this settlement volume into each scarcity and so while we are seeing crabs with bear arms we are also seeing lots and lots of economic activity on ethereum which would ultimately lead into ether fundamentals i know we're not going to talk about eip five 1559 and all of a sudden i don't even know what that is yeah no no more talk of that okay let's go to um eth and the bitcoin ratio so where's the ratio hanging just above point zero six and so each btc is in straight-up crab season with crab arms no no bear arms there uh but it it is bouncing between that point zero five five and that point zero seven level um not really much of a story here it's not going down not not going up it would be nice to see eath hold that .06 level which would set a higher low um versus the .055 that we set right before july at the end of june um but other than that uh neutral neutral territory you kind of need as we discussed last roll-ups you kind of need eath to run if we are going to remain in a bull market uh definitely feel that way let's talk about total locked value in d5 this is crab crab arms crabs crab with crab arms just hanging out 55 billion i feel like we've been at the in in the 50 billions or so for quite a long time right i guess we have the north side 55 and above i think has been like pretty pretty common ever since uh you know the the mania kind of left the markets mania left uh that was may that was may when we had all-time highs of close to 90 billion times in total remember those days remember those days they'll be back don't worry all right let's talk about defy tokens the d5 pulse index this week where are we and where did we start we're down on the week looks like we're down on the week i think the the start of the week we saw i think 320 dollars and we are now down to 300 280 so down on the week down 16 or so um but let's let's take a look at uh usage because this is such a cool metric these things never line up prices and fundamentals are not ever aligned it's like they are oil and water industry look this is the thing i you know i tweeted this out the other day it's like don't ex don't join crypto and expect to be a millionaire overnight right like just be patient the big moves happen in just a few days you have to be in the market during those those big moves when you see fundamentals like this why would you exit the market i just don't understand like oh we haven't even talked about what the fundamental is three million defy users that's what it is we now have three million d5 users when we when i first started um talked about this metric david when we were talking about it originally richard chen used to put these out it was at like 150k and i remember thinking oh that's about the size of a you know a small american city right and then it grew to like a million we're starting like you know decent size metro yeah now we're at three million right so we're creeping up to like new york city levels and and beyond and pretty soon this number is going to be the size of like a country size of canada or something size of australia but like three million defy users this is not active this is not um number of addresses this is actually uh defy users um i believe cumulative defy users are using unique addresses and so this is probably less humans yes but still yeah it's still bank accounts call it bank accounts the trend is phenomenal the trend is what's important which is up and to the right the last time richard chen tweeted out one of these and he's you know keeps on retweeting his own tweets of the last milestone we made two million defy users came in april 25th and three million defy users came july 12th so the rate of growth is impressive to what you were saying at the beginning of this segment ryan where you were talking about how like people you people come into the world crypto but they say oh look at the like insanely strong fundamentals behind this asset i'm gonna buy it and then i'm gonna become rich get in line buddy like they all have good fundamentals we're all waiting to become rich like every single thing there's so many things that we talk about in the bankless world have awesome fundamentals it just takes a lot of time for the world to figure it out yes it takes a lot of time and yet it doesn't take that much time you know what i mean yeah in hindsight it wouldn't yeah wait a year wait two years right like uh these fundamentals are gonna aren't a catch up market's gonna catch up with these all right let's talk about what you love maybe you like this this week the deepai the dpi to eth um ratio index i guess it's above your number so you feel like you guess yeah it definitely is i am you know claiming victory left and right here so far like i know it dipped down but like point one three is the number and like i i'm sticking back when it dips below point one two you're not even gonna show up that week are you you're just gonna like raise your mind i can't do the roll-ups i feel kind of sick yeah well you're hanging in there but um no moves it's definitely not uh d d5 season it's not we are we're not bullish but uh your boy is just excited that 0.13 is still a really good number to call okay all right and once again that that tracks um d5 relative to the price of eth through the dpi index david let's talk about this this token has been on an absolute tear we had axi infinity on we didn't really discuss price right at all we were just talking number of users we had them on um state of the nation on tuesday but look at their token price dude yeah it has the market cap has just absolutely exploded what was it right before it jumped the market cap was 250 million dollars to where it is today at 1.5 billion dollars it was at 250 million dollars uh just like i think at the end of june i think if i'm reading that chart yeah at this at the 27th of june it was at a quarter billion dollars now it's at 1.5 billion at dollars that is insane growth you want to check this out let's let's go to a year ago what you could have bought axs this one don't no we don't need to do that no no i want to see this we need to see this we need to appreciate this this is what is this this could have been you this could have been me i'm just saying like so the end of a d5 summer i guess it wasn't out yet but it's like d5 summer was over and we're in kind of this lull period november 2020 market cap of axs tokens 7 million wow seven million seven million gotta find those yeah and a half ago wow gotta bet on the communities before everybody else knows about them uh and they were hustling they were this is why it pays to use defy like if you just even had like i don't know what would a hundred dollars have gotten you it would it would have turned 100 would have turned into like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands yeah i think you're doing quite well if you're buying axes in november december of uh of last year when the market didn't think much of them anyway let's move on maybe that's a sad story for some who are not in axs um fully diluted valuation divided by monthly volume per dex this is an interesting index from richard chen what's this about david yeah so this is a comparison of uh dexes on ethereum and it compare it divides the volume that or the excuse me the evaluation the fully diluted valuation of the token divided by the volume going through the exchange uh and so this kind of just tells you the valuation over volume ratio and so richard has compared against you know all the common indexes that we know 0x sushi swap bancor unit swap curve balancer kyber and he's organized it against like the the ratio of how much volume versus how valued the project is uh 0x coming in on top followed by sushi swap as uh extremely favorable volume to market cap ratios and then coming in last is balancer and kyber as in uh a involve a high ratio of market cap versus total volume going through the system uh so potentially overvalued on this metric versus one particular metric swap are potentially undervalued on this metric which is interesting to look at i i love that we're getting more granular in our sort of valuation metrics for this asset class particularly exchanges it's super cool um i wanted to show this off too david this is a website called deepdow.io these are the people that are most active in governance you know on bank list the newsletter you remember that newsletter we have david what um yeah it's pretty cool you should subscribe if you haven't uh check that out we published a post it was called um i don't remember what it's called but it's about building your your device building your uh resume on ethereum is the idea that your ethereum address is your resume and this is what i see this is uh the people in governance who have uh the most number of proposals most number of votes are involved in the most number of dowels and this is like a leaderboard right for them so we've got a person by the name of van gist we've got um peter pan whom we know pat on bankless we've got uh koopa troopa he's number four i've had him on bagless before um top tokens bankless dow nice all right yeah exactly and like um it's super cool to see that some of these dow participants are are getting recognized on a leaderboard this start thinking about this as your new resume your new digital reputation right like back to the josh rosenthal episode you know new medici the crypto medici this is the crypto renaissance what what are you doing to build your resume um these people are are building it through participating in governance participating in dallas and um you're being recognized for this because all this is open can be displayed in these kind of leaderboards and benchmarks super cool yeah the right takeaway is that if you work and contribute to dows you get noticed to the point where somebody will make a website and put you on a leaderboard that's pretty crazy here's a little bit of a ethereum trivia for you for the listener also this became relevant when we do trivia top signal in the future that's going to happen peter pan number two on the leaderboard uh he the author of the uh before bitcoin series which we read on on bankless a while ago uh he was actually he applied to become a moloch dow member which was kind of like you know the original dao that really spawned the dao revolution uh he applied to become a molok dao member and was actually rejected by the molok dao committee uh and then he turned into one of the greatest dowers of all time so mohawk dao definitely did not make the right choice on that one yeah he eventually got he eventually did get membership into the dow i'm pretty sure yeah he he is absolutely dowing it up and become quite good and become a thought leader in the space so super cool all right guys we are going to get to the releases in a moment and the news and all the other exciting things on the roll-up but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrom is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrome arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrome so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrary and join their discord all right guys we are back talking about the hot releases david we have to start here uniswap v3 on optimism we've been waiting for this for months years even and now it's here uniswap on its own layer 2 and you can actually use it today in fact you used it didn't you used it i've used it and it was positively glorious oh is this a video of you using it this is a video of me using it in real time by the way so this is not sped up and so you can kind of see my mouse like erratic mouse movements as i'm kind of thinking like oh no no you're just excited i'm really excited that's exactly right uh and so i made five swaps on uniswap i traded like 200 of each or 350 of each to die to eat to die to eat to die i did wasn't even trying to be fast i was just doing it just to do it i made five swaps in under like 30 seconds and that was just me tinkering around right and the cool thing is is like as soon as i hit confirm it's done it's done uh as well okay so the the gas cost to get my ether into optimism cost me about nineteen you got 19 you get across the bridge right across the bridge cost me 19 at 39 gwai i think so great price not too high not too low cost that's the most expensive part the most expensive part uh and then it's each swap cost me like point zero zero zero zero something eth so like there was like i think there were four zeros before the first number of eth transfer fees on optimism and so swaps were costing me pennies and they were going instantly the cool thing and here's what i i think this is unconfirmed this is my speculation but when i hit the swap button and then confirm on metamask the website ui already showed it as completed right and so the website ui showed it instantly and i think they are doing a clever little hack where they are saying it's completed even regardless of whether it's actually going to the optimism chain or not but that's the power of optimistic rollups because as soon as you sign the transaction the strength of the settlement insurances allows the website front end to just say that it was completed regardless of whether it checked or not because it has such strong assurances i'm speculating on whether that's true or not maybe they are actually talking to an endpoint and getting a confirmation i guess the transaction was included into blockchain but it happens so fast that i think they just skipped that step because they have such strong settlement insurances that it actually did get included so they can just say that to you the user yeah your transaction went through you know this is this is super cool and i haven't used optimism yet but it's got to feel like a similar experience like on on polygon which which i have used is it it feels like um a bandwidth upgrade right feels like you're on an old like i don't know 56k modem using these websites and suddenly you get broadband right cable modem and then it's the same thing except it loads 10x 20x faster right i think i think that's a good metaphor but uh polygon feels like the broadband moment and this feels like fiber optics because when you press a button it's done it's already done with polygon you actually have to wait a few seconds you know the other thing i used to be worried about with this is i don't know have you withdrawn anything yet they have a little uh bug on there on their withdrawal bridge uh i so i wasn't actually able to withdraw because if you hit the withdraw button it sent me into this loop where i need to depict the network but once i picked the wrong network there was a bug in the ui is this a ui bug it's a ui bug yeah i'm not talking about that yeah i i used to be more worried about that like crossing the chasm because you know you paid twenty dollars to get across the bridge low gas prices i mean that could be like 50 that could be 100 that could be impediment but after our conversation with uh arbitrary i realized that this is there's going to be so many other bridges into these roll-ups right the main bridge maybe the most um trustless bridge censorship resistant bridge will be the bridge that you used but bridges from exchanges are coming right like directly fiat directly eth from an exchange into optimism that's coming um bridges from other chains like a polygon for instance to optimism that's coming we're going to talk about that in the releases so i'm way less worried about this and uh it's super exciting now david correct me if i'm wrong but optimism isn't like generally available they are sort of going through a process of kind of permissioning and rolling out uh defy apps one at a time is that right that is correct and so uh uniswap coming first because it's one of the easiest things to deploy unisport doesn't really need any other infrastructure we have more to talk about with optimism further on in the roll-up but synthetics is also coming as well as some infrastructure projects as well um before we go on ryan there's actually so much more to talk about uh you talked about how the the bridge uh you know the optimism bridge the optimism bridge is like the bridge of last resort right in the future right like the bridge needs to exist the optimism bridge needs to exist but that needs to exist so that if other bridges that are going to spin up which we also are going to talk about in this weekly roll up if those don't work you have the option of using the optimism bridge the optimism bridge existing is just to have the option you know the ability to escape under your own terms and then other service providers other bridge operators again who are going to talk about in this weekly roll up are going to offer better experiences better you know better times better speeds perhaps even better fees i don't know uh but they will be able to compete for you to use their bridge but if they are malicious if they go down if they break whatever you have the option of using the optimism bridge uh with with the slowest withdrawal periods of seven days and uh not super duper fast uh deposit periods of like i think 20 or 30 blocks um so that's what's up with that yeah and there's also a decent amount of uh if actually if you scroll down in this twit uh tweet and and we'll link the tweet in the show notes first off there's a meme uh so there you go uh and then there was also a decent amount of uh communication uh nick kunkel from the maker dow he talked about how there's a already the the die bridge is getting spin up and running uh maybe it's not showing here but um they're like maker dow already has plans to build like the super fast die bridge uh so there's already plans to like have multiple bridges on and off optimism i just think this is the this is the theme for the first part of releases david you mentioned synthetics they are launching on optimism the full synthetics um platform i believe and that is coming possibly uh the week of july 26th so this is coming governance so we've got uniswap synthetics will be number two i think um optimism will will go more generally available a little bit later but they are permissioning apps one at a time we also have this david which is getting back to these bridges some of these this is hot protocol so hop protocol has officially announced the hot bridge they're starting with instant usdc transfers between ethereum polygon and xdi so two side chains and ethereum obviously expand to arbitrary optimism as layer twos and this provides the ability not to you don't even have to go to mainnet you can just move your usdc assets directly from polygon to xdi or in the future directly from polygon to optimism if you want uh and this is super cool and i believe um state channels is actually the technology behind uh hot protocol the the in the future when we say like oh yeah i used to have all my assets and do all my trading on the l1 that's going to be such a crazy statement in the future there's so much infrastructure getting built out that means we will never actually have to touch the l1 like the l1 the floor is lava like you don't got to touch it like you can just go from side chain to l2 to side chain to l2 all using payment channels we'll never actually touch the l1 anymore no the rollups will be touching it uh yes and this is the thing again i was worried about that is diminishing over time which is like a couple years ago sort of realized that the entirety of d5 would need to be re-architected on layer two right but it's happening look gnosis gnosis safe is live on layer twos so they deployed on polygon binance smart chain these are not layer twos we can call them side chains die but also arbitrarium coming soon then optimism so that's some key infrastructure that we need we've got coinbase wallet now supporting polygon so you can actually switch from the ethereum main net to polygon you also see the optimism mainnet there so we're getting wallet support we also have the set protocol launching on polygons so you can buy your dpi and in the future your bed index guys coming soon on the polygon network as well i'm just running through these and infura is now supporting arbitrim2 so the process of d5 being re-architected on layer 2 it's happening like right before our eyes and um it's going pretty well so far imagine being an eath killer right now i don't know that's all i have to say i can't imagine i cannot imagine you cannot nor would i want to imagine i mean the prices are doing okay though fundamentals and prices are separate things as we know as we know okay uh so where are we now let's talk about this dow jones is launching just launched five crypto indices you know what's weird about this david is so first of all um this is uh the s p dow jones indices so this is a big deal right like every everywhere here in index quoted for stocks it's like s p 500 or dow jones industrial average now these indices players are coming into uh crypto and they're creating indexes of their own what's super weird is i have like no visibility into what these things are right like clicking around trying to find actually what these indexes are composed of and it's very difficult we couldn't find the answer we spent like 10 minutes trying to figure it out before the show we couldn't find it and what was crazy is just there's such a contrast between open finance like if you want to peek into what is inside of the dpi that's that's um you know the token set technology that's index co-ops index you can see exactly what it's composed of in real time you could verify that and check that on chain and for these indexes you have to i don't know dig through their methodology call customer support i don't know i don't know either the the categories are a large cap index and then they have another index that excludes bitcoin and ethereum and then they have another index that excludes bitcoin and ethereum and other large caps so i think it's like different scales of market cap but again just tell us what they are and also the waiting like what's going on here like i guess and co index co-op are leagues ahead of you guys and you guys have been doing this for centuries yeah well it's just they're they're building it on on close finance and traditional finance and that's the constraint there but i guess it is a big deal that um snp continues to come up with these indices and mainstream cryptos and they're trying they're trying their best they're trying they're doing it work harder work faster guys all right nifty island what what's this so nifty island is a new game a game verse is what they're calling it and it's a place for you to take all your nfts and put them on your island so uh in crypto we all want to get our islands uh now you can go get your island and you can put all your nfts there and so it's a place it's a virtual world a metaverse world where you can physically place all of your crazy awesome nfts that you want to show off all of your friends uh and i think the the grand vision is much more uh you know grand then that it goes and goes uh goes from there but the idea is that this is a a game a physical or a virtual reality virtual world where you can come and put all of your nfts and so you can go and check out other people's nfts go to other people's islands the the vibe i'm getting is kind of like a second life type of game where you actually like exist in this virtual world and you can go from place to place uh and then you can have your own island with all of your own nfts this is appealing millionaires will be made in the metaverse so david david come to my um come to your millionaire island yeah billionaire island and check out all my uh i wanna i want to go to dc investors island because i think his his island is probably you can't afford to get to his island dc will let me into his island maybe all right um ultrasound money ultrasound.money is now a website wow the meme became a website and a nice website at that i don't even know who's behind this but um good job whoever is behind the ultrasound money website this is displaying we have 19 days 22 hours before eip1559 which we weren't going to say in the show but we absolutely have to um this is a chart of the total eath supply over time with projections uh you can you can dial this up or dial this down based on assumptions around staking amounts based on gas price really great user interface for this and that you could join the 167 1672 members who are wearing the bat signal in i guess their social media profile twitter yeah you're there um super cool i this is a cool place to send people when they ask about eth's monetary policy because it just sort of sparks the conversation and displays in real time what is about to happen i think this is really just illustrates how much excitement and energy there is behind the ultra sound money meme at the end of the day memes are memes but also in crypto memes are also fundamentals and so this is just a really strong indicator that the ultrasound money meme is turning into real website infrastructure to help you to help support the metrics and the ultra soundness behind the ultrasound money me uh and so after you know after 19 days after eip1559 gets integrated i'm excited to see what this website turns into right because now the next step is the merge and so i think this is just going to be a website that really illustrates this ultrasoundness behind ultrasound money absolutely and it definitely projects um as justin drake has said we'll never have above 120 million eth which is which is very likely so super cool all right um let's let's talk about this the infinite garden this is a documentary like a movie yeah that somebody is making about ethereum um they're gonna be talking to like folks like vitalik people in the ethereum ecosystem what's this about yeah so this is exactly as we just said there's a documentary being crowdfunded on the mirror platform which is pretty cool uh with illustrations uh coming from people pleaser the uh the artist that made the una swap nf uh x times y equals k uh nft which is the thing that started off the people pleaser dao uh and so now she has been uh being recruited by this uh documentary this team making this documentary to make uh ethereum's first movie which i am absolutely stoked for david do you notice this dude i just noticed this yeah who's that in the corner that's that's kevin he might be in this yeah that's kevin and walkie probably doing our uh state of the nation with him yeah so we're on the other side yeah we're we're on the other side maybe we'll get it um maybe there'll be a cameo god that'd be amazing that'd be sexy i've always wanted more more documentaries more ethereum content like more high production value stuff because i think there's just there's more attention needs to come to the space obviously i believe this um and i'm glad to see some like high production uh efforts being made to you know tell the story of ethereum it's a really good story so many cool stories coming out of ethereum all right let's uh breeze through the raises really quick this has been like raise week so superfluid uh has raised nine million dollars this is kind of a real-time finance protocol basically you can do payroll this sort of thing it's all deployed on a layer two using stable coins um using essentially crypto infrastructure any thoughts here yeah so this is this is a kind of a an evolution on what um sablier was trying to do streaming payments making payments as discrete as time itself uh and so you know in ethereum we have 12 second blocks on l2's it goes even faster and so there's no reason why pay periods need to be two weeks or any like you know time barrier like that all of a sudden we have we are able to link the concept of time and payments time and value transfer and that's what super fluid is doing uh disclosure i am part of the seed investment team congrats thanks all right let's talk about this uh can next raise 12 million dollars as well in a in some new funding um this is similar to hop in that it's it's providing chain to chain sort of um changes in payment channels and transactions right so when we were talking earlier about all these different bridges that are going to be spanning ethereum and and optimism and arbitrary connext is one of those service providers connects is payment channel infrastructure they've been around ethereum for forever working on payment channel technology kind of trying to figure out what the best place to apply it is and you know ethereum in its current forum up until now really hasn't needed payment channels above and beyond really specific use cases but as soon as we have like you know the optimism chain the the arbitrary chain the polygon chain x die like maybe even more optimism chains even more arbitrary chains because there can be many of those all of a sudden we have like a whole entire net mesh network of layer twos and it we need more efficient ways to route orders between all of these l2s right and so uh you know uh connects is being the payment channels between all of these different chains between ethereum and l2s l2s and l2s l2s and sidechains uh other other l1 blockchains and so uh connect says payment channel technology is finding finally finding its place where it's really going to thrive and congrats to the raise we did a fantastic meet the nation with arjun bhutani from connects forever ago really really good episode to understand payment channels and how they fit into ethereum also disclosure ryan and i are both uh seed investors into connects network congrats congrats to you sir i'm gonna say that every single time all right block native as well manpool um dot eth super cool the mempool is a dark forest this is basically the place all transactions go before they're fully processed a lot of mev takes place there so these guys are providing visibility to d5 protocols for this to help the d5 protocols design a bit more tightly illuminating the dark forest right of of the mempools is kind of how i'd summarize this they just raised 12 million dollars in uh season series a financing so cool to see this infrastructure being built out and funded so just what i was saying with all of these different l2s and side chains each one has a mempool every single chain has its own unique mempool and block native is mempool infrastructure so imagine a world where there's like a bajillion l2s there's going to be multiple different ways to do from to get to point a to point b right like you have usdc on arbitrom and you need to get die on polygon there's gonna be like seven different routes to get there and block native and its mempool infrastructure is going to help you or route your order across you know the hot protocol or connection network or like different different l2s different different bridges block native is going to find the most efficient route to make your point a to point b transaction the most efficient and most beaty and that's what uh the mempool infrastructure allows you to do disclosure ryan and i are also seed investors into block native congrats you beat me all right d5 wallet phantom uh the d5 wallet phantom just raised 9 million series a funding led by a16z this is not a wallet i've used before and um it has actually been deployed first on solana so i think that's where it's kind of made its initial home then it is going to deploy on ethereum here shortly and also all the side chains polygon arbitrary optimism zk sync maybe give metamask a run for its money i'm not sure it's cool to see this infrastructure funded though i'm pleased to see that for sure also guys crypto is of course hiring crypto is always hiring banklet's just published a job board there are some great positions on there over 27 are ready we've got a senior solidity engineer quant finance if you are dev check that out chief investment officer cio for yield app a software engineer for arbitram check that out to you senior designer for pull together editor and writer for bankless you got to plug that one we are still looking for an editor or writer go over to the jobs link in the show notes to check out all of those jobs we update them on a daily basis and then also weekly expect fresh jobs that was just the first five jobs there are 27 total jobs on the job board so definitely go check those out crypto's hiring all these seed investments are being thrown around there's money being thrown around in this industry people are hiring to help build out this industry that means you whatever whatever the ethereum version of uncle sam is he wants you to come work for ethereum so go to the jobs board and find a job all right david let's get to some news um let's start with this news so the news of the week was uniswap's defy education fund and worries around this i've been following this story a little bit i know you've jumped into it why don't you give us the high level what what this story is about yeah we covered this on the weekly roll up i think two weeks ago and so you know you know swap has that massive treasury uh and there was a uh an education team that came together who wanted to get some funding out of the unit swap treasury to help promote defy education to regulators you know institutions i think i think more formal education rather than than like what i would call whatever we are doing at bank list where like these people are going to seem like a lot of lobbying is lobbying lobbying i think is a lobbying education type of things like uh you know jake survivor educate lawmakers was on there and he has you know a strong interest in educating lawmakers uh there seems to be a story here about how this group came together and some of the decision-making behind the actual funds and so um the the there's a little bit of controversy with the actual proposal to uniswop where the defy education fund proposed that they received uh half a 1 million uni tokens which would be like 15 20 million dollars total um and they express intentions if they were to receive the uh receive the money to sell it over time uh there there's also a little bit of controversy as in members of the dfi education fund voted yes on their own proposal which is totally kosher but also just you know raise raising eyebrows um and so then the defy education fund proposed uh or indicated their intent to sell the uni tokens slowly over the next four to five years as soon as they got their hands on the actual tokens because apparently the governance proposal passed so they got their 1 million uni distributions they sold 50 of them immediately for 10.2 million usdc uh and and so there's a little that caused a bunch of hubbub uh and this has you know caused bunch of controversy with dow governance and you know is what's really going on here is there has there actually been any malicious you know activities that's up for debate like you know people are communicating one thing and doing another thing is that really is that's bad is it what's going on here people are confused and they they're all having their own their own takes about it but overall this has caused a bunch of drama and controversy in the space yeah so i guess the facts of the case were 20 million got funded for uh by education fund they said they were going to sell it over three to four years it turned out 50 of that 20 million so 10 million was actually insta-selled yeah fairly quickly and then there's also the concern that um some insiders maybe are benefiting from this right so like and some whales within uniswap are kind of voting this in to sort of push it through um and i'm not sure the validity of of those concerns either but um like kobe had an interesting uh interesting proposal here i like i think it's satire but absolutely satire yeah so what's this what's his proposal he published this on the unit swap governance um forum and uh yeah what's he saying here yeah he's proposing a one million uni token distribution same amount as a d5 fund uh for the removal of established cranial follicles he's talking about shaving his head so he wants to be paid one million uni tokens to shave his head so he's making a farce out of the whole defy education fund uh thing and and he's kind of just making a trying to you know use satire as a tool to illustrate what the problems perhaps were with the defy education fund proposal what are the problems what do you think you know perhaps some insider dealing some you know some some people that are inside the industry talking to other people who are having a privileged position saying hey like accept this proposal like use my legitimacy to accept the proposal and then send us the money again like the money hasn't been to my knowledge hasn't been allocated anywhere and so maybe the biggest error was that they just sold the tokens faster than they originally communicated maybe they're maybe maybe they don't have a good treasury management team in place and so maybe the whoever was in charge of of the uni tokens got spooked by the market and it was like oh i've got to sell all these before the market goes down maybe maybe there was some immaturity and treasury management i don't really know um but you know a lack of standardization and best practices was definitely present uh i think the story it could fizzle out into nothing it could turn into a much bigger story i don't really know what's interesting about this though but isn't this just like um token vote yeah isn't this how token votes work right like the token votes are essentially like shareholders of the protocol and they get to vote on how the treasury is used right like that's what a governance um token is for so at some level like i'm not surprised that um whales are dictating governance proposals right because that's the design of token vote protocols right and like the reason i say that is because sometimes i'm a little bit annoyed or bothered when people talk about like decentralized governance at you know to and equate that with with um token vote no it's not quite decentralized governance right it's like open permissionless governance but it's the same core governance mechanism we use to see corpse and a set of shareholders and board of directors and there definitely needs to be some accountability in all of those processes but um i guess part of me is like not surprised that wales can push through a vote because of course they can yeah and i think maybe maybe this is no different maybe this is kind of the status quo but importantly we can all see it we can all see it happening and so if we don't like that the community you know raises a hubbub which is definitely what's happened yeah so we'll have to see how this progresses but definitely interesting um david this is cool brazil sec has just approved an ethereum etfs 100 ethereum when sec when u.s sec are you going to allow us to have even a bitcoin etf let's start there we're falling behind is the us just going to be the last country to have crypto etfs in in it like i remember i remember asking hester person when she was on the podcast like yo like the longer and longer i said yo i did not say yo the longer and longer that the us does not have a bitcoin etf or or crypto etf the more and more it becomes like a political statement right and she completely rejected that premise but my conspiracy hat is still on like to some degree like the us is the last country that technically wants crypto etfs because it subverts the dollar and it'll and they're on the on the right path to literally becoming the last country with a crypto etf well you do have to ask why and so i don't know what the explanation is that's one possible explanation but it is super weird that all of these other countries are getting crypto etfs and the us doesn't have one the us wants the crypto etf the most as i mean the us populous at least right and so like the us regulators are just not responding at all to what the people want yeah absolutely we'll see when the big banks start to get involved um what what happens with that i bet it moves forward wouldn't that be ironic is that the banks got our ets before we got our etfs yeah stani is saying a new version of the ave protocol is now in audit this team just keeps shipping i'm pretty excited well this is just a tweet but i don't i definitely believe him huh but yeah honey or excuse me stanley just said new version of ave protocol in audit i wonder what they got when what uh tricks the new version of ave has i'm excited to see um shapeshift is turning into a dow we're gonna have eric voorhees on the podcast on tuesday to talk a little bit more about this um but what is this about david yeah so shapeshift has had this crazy trajectory crazy story started off as a a a place where you could swap tokens in a non-custodial fashion um and so they you would um like say you wanted to trade this was very big in 2017 say you want to trade bitcoin for ether or like ether for monero these are cross-chain swaps so you would go to shapeshift you would you know they would tell them hey i have ether i want monero so they would give you an ether qr code you would send your ether there you would also give them a monaro deposit address and they would send an arrow back so it's trusted but they it was more or less atomic right like you would send your ether there and they would make the trade for you with their own like liquidity providers their own trading deaths and then they would send you an error on the other side uh the sec did not like or maybe was the cftc can't remember uh regulators did not like that they weren't taking there were no user accounts and there were no sign up no kyc process and so they had to shut that down and start you know forcing uh people to actually sign up and kyc with them which kind of ruined the whole value proposition of shapeshift then dex aggregators came along and a shape-shift turned into uh you know a normal permissioned exchange which they didn't want to be and then they became a dex aggregator and that happened that was the last actually the last time we had eric voorhees on the show uh was when shape shift turned into a dex aggregator uh one of the benefits is that with dex aggregators you can go back to the model of not having kyc information forced upon your clients uh so people can just sign up just like and we use matcha or one inch you can now use uh you know shape shift now shapeshift is going into a dow so they're trying to just cut out all of this the you know the the company basically and turn their their organization into a dow lots of questions here how does this even work you already have a company how do you turn that company into a dow right this is not like bankless llc spinning up bankless dao we spun up bank list all separately we kept the llc what's going on with shapeshift is that they are turning the llc into a dow uh why are they doing this i don't know how are they doing this i don't know we're going to find out on the state of the nation on tuesday with eric voorhees yeah he's eric for he's whenever you talk to him i love that he always starts with values and principles right and he said um unorthodox but it is the only way to maintain fidelity talking about shape-shift decentralizing um is the most important principles of cryptos why they're doing this specifically self-sovereignty over money without that principle upheld we're all just larping um i'm excited to have that conversation give me good yeah david let's turn to nfts american express is doing nft nfts as a credit card uh perk yeah so interesting very weird the company is offering its card holders a chance to purchase 14 unique digital images from from a recent performance by the r and b singer zah that's the perfect i'm pretty sure it's me all right well you know what we're not even going to google this we're going to just let um like comment twitter will let us know all right anyway what's what's the story here oh gosh a very weird perk right like do american express card holders really want za nfts uh i'm gonna go with no they don't um not really the right perk for the for the specific clientele but you know they're trying they're trying they're trying i guess that's interesting this i think is much more product market fit so space jam is getting nft's new space jam movie coming out it's going to be accompanied by nfts super cool i think the meme protocol is involved with this as well you can claim a free nft right now you might just get a legendary lebron is the tweet heading uh pretty cool what's happening here yeah uh they are launching an official nft collection for the space jam movie uh which i didn't even know was getting a sequel uh i'm not sure space jam needed a sequel but i guess um uh hopefully every 20 years or so whatever i guess so 30 years um yeah and so we'll we'll see what's going on with this yeah all right super cool let's go bitcoin stuff so jack dorsey wants to build a bitcoin hardware wallet definitely doubling down tripling down quadrupling down on bitcoin yeah um i didn't know the hardware wallets were an unfinished product problem in this base i kind of considered hardware wallets as generally a solved problem yeah i don't know what he's going to do to add to it you know it would be cool i think if square's listening jack dorsey if you're listening uh go build a really awesome smart contract wallet right that'd be cool it's all software yes yeah and the the competitive landscape for smart contract wallets is rich especially with all of these l2s right like new playing field absolutely that would be way cooler but you know he'll get there okay all right bitcoin all right cool regulation trad five let's talk about this uh the former uh new york stock exchange president is taking a crypto exchange public via a spac it's interesting this this exchange is going to be called bullish um what's crazy about this david is a whopping 9 billion dollar valuation for an exchange it's not d5 this is something more akin to maybe a coin base that hasn't launched yet has no users no volume no revenue no branding bullish yeah my name is i am not bullish i'm not bullish you're absolutely might be trying too hard if you're calling yourself bullish maybe i'm just being overly skeptical here david but like what what is this i know obviously crypto banks are huge like coinbase gemini kraken these are all very successful businesses but you you have to go beat these other right organizations and you're starting with nothing and you're already valued at nine billion dollars what gives right like coinbase is already public like all these other exchanges they've they've gone through some of the trials of getting an exchange up and running they've already overcome some of the obstacles all of a sudden there's this brand new crypto exchange with a terrible name valued at nine billion dollars well the reason why is valued at nine billion dollars is because um block one is an investor into this back and block one is the company that spun out eos and took four billion dollars of incoming revenue to make eos and then turned it into bitcoin didn't sell it and then that bitcoin has now you know gone up in price and so i think i if i remember correctly they are putting six billion dollars into this back for some reason there's something going on behind the scenes on this story that is not making it to the forefront uh and so it will be a story that we will have to keep tabs on um anyways through line not bullish on bullish that is a true line i am bullish on this though fidelity digital assets this is a um a bank that's been in the crypto space for a long time like 2015 or even before they are planning yeah pioneers a big head account boost in response to institutional interest in crypto that's two levels of bullishness so one they're seeing this institutional uh interest right and two fidelity is just hiring like crazy uh cool to see that yeah it's hard to claim that the whole institutions are coming as a meme when you see fidelity digital assets hiring as many as a hundred employees to help bolster cryptocurrency projects in response to institutional demand right like no if institutions are coming that's not a meme they're they're actually here like yeah fidelity wouldn't just randomly hire 100 people if it actually wasn't legitimate no they're making another big bet here they are doubling tripling down on this um let's talk about inflation david did you know we are at 5.4 cpi inflation year over year as of uh this month i think those are uh for the month of june you're ending june like this is probably 10 higher than what anybody anticipated getting hot 5.4 is getting hot i mean we're just another doubling away from double digits here i don't know that that's going to happen but this is something that is going to impact not just crypto but everything everything right and i want to learn more about like why this is happening what the story behind inflation actually is too i saw a funny meme about this earlier where it talked about how like economists and the federal reserve they're all super surprised about five point you know almost 5.5 percent inflation meanwhile bitcoiners we're telling we're telling the you know the whole entire world that this was coming for the last three years bitcoiners know the economy better like the inflation schedule better than you know economists right and i was at the bankless dow meetup on la i had i thought what i thought was a pretty good take is that if the the number one thing that bitcoiners are right about is the fiat commentary commentary on fiat money and like the value of the dollar and the inflation of the dollar they are on the ball when it comes to you know fiat monetary policy and inflation more than they are about bitcoin they are more knowledgeable about the dollar than they then they are about crypto which is hilarious that's my hot take uh anyways we are actually recording with lynn alden on monday about this specific topic about inflation um this conversation has proliferated into all corners of finance right i follow some of the uh you know big twitter accounts in the the traffic space who kind of just do commentary on you know um just wall street culture and finance culture and they all are just making a complete farce out of the federal reserve and the inflate in the world of inflation right everyone who's observing the the individuals the humans rather than the firms or the regulators no one is surprised about inflation it makes sense to everyone and ever all these all the individuals all the you know the meme accounts the twitter accounts are making fun of you know economists and and fred board members about their surprise about inflation or talking about how they're trying to say like inflation's transitory or no just kidding inflation is good they keep on changing their their approach as to inflation meanwhile the people know the people who are paying attention figure it out like the value of the dollar is declining and the the the powers that be are trying to ascribe some sort of you know reasoning or rationale to it when in reality it's like no it's like this is just what's going on in the world of the 2020s the value of the dollar is declining and it's absolutely something i think people need to wrap their heads around in order to be equipped equipped to survive and thrive in the 2020s because an inflationary world's going to be a different world we had asset inflation last decade looks like this decade might be seeping into consumer price index inflation so something everyone needs to be cognizant of we're going to continue to talk about this you know i ran across this story in one of one of the newsletters i read this is um fintech is is um basically trying to get better access to fedwire which is the the payment system that undergirds the entire u.s banking system um so fintech if you're a you know paypal or a square uh any fintech company you want better access to using fedwire directly well the banks don't want this the banks want our lobbying for tighter controls on fintech in their access to federal banking systems basically they're saying no you have to be a bank and you have to walk through all of the hoops step through all of the hoops that we have stepped through in order to have this privilege you know what's so interesting about this david is as fintech and the banks kind of fight on this like the banks are threatened by fintech but they're going to absolutely win this battle but they're just going to push fintech into the arms of d5 is my take right oh we won't we can't use fedwire we'll just use usdc whatever exactly exactly so i'm not sure that the banks are fully equipped for for the next battle that's coming but i do think a battle will come there and the banks are not going to like it if if fintech starts using usdc for banking bypassing the banking system uh there's going to be some issues and i i wonder how regulators then and the us is going to handle all this but it's interesting to see yeah define crypto it's like the ultimate escape patch it's like oh regulation got in the way of what i wanted to do i'll just go do it in d5 yeah absolutely all right david let's go some through some quick um ultrasonic news here alchemix a uh all eth volts they're back up they're already maxed out um pretty crazy that they had an issue where they had to take them down but now they're up yeah so they had that little uh bug where you could accidentally uh withdraw your collateral after you minted al eth uh they that's in the rear view mirror now you can now you can mint al eth again those valves are back up and running already oversubscribed they'll need to raise the debt ceiling in order to keep that going uh congrats alcomix um binance squeeze is getting a little tighter italy joins the list of of countries and global regulators that are warning against binance a continuation of a story that we've started over the last couple of weeks yep uh binance not really domiciled anywhere uh and the regulators of the world don't like it and so they're squeezing finance david you do this one bitcoin uh more hashrate migration what's happening here yeah so bit digital migrating 14 500 bitcoin mining units to the us after china crack down um so continuation of the great westward migration of hash power which also brings us to our next story which is minor migration towards ohio and nuclear power and so ohio is spinning up not the state of ohio in inside of ohio not not from the actual state representatives or anything in the state of ohio there is a new nuclear power plant getting uh powering a bitcoin mining facility uh and so the my chinese dirty coal mined hash power getting replaced by u.s domiciled clean nuclear hash power so i consider that a win hey last thing this is cool metamask just turned five i can't believe it grass metamask happy first fifth birthday that's really old ethereum six years old yeah and and look metamask just it still feels like a kind of a brand new product in some ways and it's already five wow congrats to dan finley and the yeah team guys we are going to be back with some hot takes we're going to start with a take from jackson palmer that you do not want to miss but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swap dow apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back with the takes of the week let's start with this one this one echoed around the twitter sphere and i think it was beyond far beyond uh crypto twitter circles this is a take from jackson palmer i'm going to start reading the thread first off jackson palmer is the creator of dogecoin uh so he's the guy that originally forked bitcoin called it dogecoin and that's how we have dogecoin he used to do a whole bunch of crypto education videos i don't know if you saw these in the early days but i remember tracking following him give good commentary good education so but he left crypto quite famously a few years ago and this is his comment on why he left i am often asked if i will return to cryptocurrency or begin regularly sharing my thoughts on the topic again my answer is a wholehearted no but to avoid repeating myself i figured it might be worthwhile briefly explaining why here after studying it for years i believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance diminished regulatory oversight and artificially for scarcity despite claims of decentralization in quotes the cryptocurrency industry is controlled by a powerful cartel of wealthy figures who with time have evolved to incorporate many of the same institutions tied to the existing centralized financial system they supposedly set out to replace the cryptocurrency industry leverages the network of shady business connections bought influencers and pay for play meets to perpetuate a cult like get rich quick funnel designed to extract new money from the financially desperate and naive i will go on financial exploitation undoubtedly existed before cryptocurrency but cryptocurrency is almost purpose-built to make the funnel of profiteering more efficient for those at the top and left safeguarded and less safeguarded for the vulnerable cryptocurrency is like taking the worst parts of today's capitalistic system for example corruption fraud in equity inequality excuse me and using software to technically limit the use of interventions like audits regulation taxation which serve as protections or safety nets for the average person lose your savings account password your fault fall victim to a scam your fault billionaires manipulating markets they're geniuses this is the type of dangerous free-for-all capitalism uh capitalism cryptocurrency was unfortunately architected to facilitate since its inception but these days even the most modest critique of cryptocurrency will draw smears from the powerful figures in control of this industry and the ire of retail investors who they've sold the false promise of one day being a fellow fellow billionaire good faith debate is near impossible for these reasons i simply no longer go out of my way to engage in public discussion regarding crypto it doesn't align with my politics or belief system and i don't have the energy to try and discuss that with those unwilling to engage in a grounded conversation i applaud those with ener with the energy to continue asking the hard questions and implying the lens of rigorous skepticism all technology should be subject to new technology can make the world a better place but not when decoupled from its inherent politics or societal wow what a thread what's your take so many so many uh so jackson palmer left the industry in 2018 and so uh he in my opinion has a 2017-2018 perspective as to what crypto is a lot of what he is saying i've i feel is very much coming out of when all of what he was saying was exactly true in 2017 2018 we didn't have defy and we really just had you know big players um uh you know the the uh bit maine was a big player the binance was a big player bit max arthur hayes like a lot of what he was saying is it's totally true it's absolutely totally true and it's a part of the crypto world that we are trying to leave behind and grow and mature out from and that has been the story of crypto in my opinion since jackson left in 2018 and so he's critiquing an old version of crypto that still exists to this day um but is becoming less and less about the more the core part of what crypto it means to be crypto he talks about how he doesn't agree with his politics and how he talks about how crypto is like a bastion for right wing hyper capitalism that's not what i see that's not what i see at all and i'm i'm somebody who would very much get very turned off by far right wing politics in hyper capitalism like i i used to be a hardcore socialist uh i've grown up since then but the point is i'm i'm lean left and the economics and capitalism of crypto really resonates with me uh and i really think that jackson is missing uh the core part of what crypto has turned into in 2020 and 2021 that completely answers to what his problems are in the first place um and also one of the one of the which is what by the way is it defy yeah defy tran defy and transparency and and one of the reasons one of the things he was talking about is like how like crypto just enables all the worst about financial markets or does it just make it really transparent right and we can actually see all of the nefarious negative things better than we otherwise could have and that's what jackson is disillusioned by like no it's actually the same but we can see it all better and now we can self-correct as an industry right and so with you know transparency and defy the creator economy which is direct in direct opposition to all of the negative things that jackson is talking about the creator economy is about enabling the individual financing the individual rewarding the bottom up rather than the top down jackson is is just illustrating a part of the crypto world that hasn't fixed its own problems yet yet it is doing that the whole dow movement and glenn glenn weil retweeted this thread glenn wilde who's an economist part of the radical markets movement retweeted this thread as like you know really great points and i and i commented under glenn weil and said you know this is largely considered unnuanced and outdated by people in the industry uh and glenn said yes but i agree with that but also i still agree with jackson's thread i know anyways um jackson doesn't pay attention to crypto anymore uh and he he left he and i don't even think that he really came to crypto in the same way with the best intentions in the first place just a big reminder jackson palmer is a software developer who took the bitcoin code base forked it changed a couple parameters called it dogecoin and now people are treating him as if he is the most knowledgeable person on the planet no the guy just forked bitcoin and the big biggest innovation that he did was he called it a meme instead of litecoin or ripple or something the innovation was calling it out and was naming it after something funny uh and so like as somebody who is giving opinions about this what's what this space could be and is like jackson's he's not dumb he's a smart guy but also who is he he's not really an authority uh and so for just because he's the creator of dogecoin he's getting a lot more attention than otherwise would be deserved yeah i think those i i think that's definitely a good take you know what i saw seeing this is kind of uh two two major critiques right a first half in the second half in the first half he's talking about like basically crypto bankers i think and this tendency to consolidate which is sort of a a a bitcoin thing and um cz sam bankman freed yeah generally people i don't find myself aligned with and especially the bankless movement doesn't find themselves aligned with exactly and uh the other thing he's talking about is um is scammers who've jumped into the industry and there are tons of scammers there are people you know that have nefarious projects and you know projects that aren't creating a better more decentralized uh world but it's just kind of marketing and hype and there's not much substance to it right that's another critique so that's the first part and i'm like yeah i agree like yeah crypto has these things you know um but the first part of his thread just focuses on all the bad and none of none of his uh thread focuses on any of the good things the benefits that crypto brings the openness it's like he's denying that they even exist he is not acknowledging them at all and so you could look at any industry david and like just be like yeah i mean corners of the internet i mean like terrible things happen in in corners of the internet if you're if you're just magnifying those things then you could say the internet is a horrible innovation set humanity back and it's you know terrible a terrible thing so that's the first part the second part is is interesting where you know he says lose your savings account password it's your fault fall victim to a scam your fault billionaires manipulating markets they're geniuses you know he's kind of talking about some of the early um ux problems of of crypto right like we have to build this entire thing on a decentralized trustless system where there are costs for losing your your your private keys otherwise we get centralization but like user experiences is moving beyond these things and i i just get to the point of like i feel like it's almost like jackson is judging kryptos imagine if uh it was the the birth of the internet right and um somebody created uh you know some sort of news article that criticized the internet for all of these email scams like nigerian print scams and we get all of this spam and isn't this spam terrible and people are innocent people are like clicking these links and like the penis enlargement pill didn't work and all of these things right like and you just emphasize that right and you're like there aren't any singles in my area yeah let's throw the whole thing out because of those things um i feel like that's kind of what he's no um spam filters will get better right the scams will be processed out um like people will learn the difference between spam and real email and they won't click on the singles in my area and it'll all get better so just right be patient just wait a little bit it's just this whole entire thread just seems clouded with pessimism here uh and and anthony cesano retweeted this uh this thread and said oh jackson palmer who is like kind of if you read between the lines kind of like on the very far left kind of radical left side like oh jackson palmer hates capitalism more news at 11. like this is kind of a guy who just is a representative of closer to what i would say the far left the radical left radical-ish left uh and he's it's betting things that are having to do with money i think it's made waves in like um radical left circles and my worry about this is with when you when you have um elizabeth warren talking about this it's like my everything in america is getting politicized these days uh and this this um this comment in particular we talked about it's a far-right movement crypto is not a far-right movement it's just crypto it's just not it's it's completely apolitical it's anti-authoritarian absolutely it's it's a movement about self-sovereign individuals and self-sovereign communities absolutely it's a movement for the people it is not a far-right movement i did not come to crypto to participate in politics okay but like here's the thing not that kind of politics right like but um here's the thing if this gets painted as something that can be like canceled by one political group or another right um i don't know what's going to happen next yeah it'll be an interesting uh i guess season or time um i feel like this is sort of the waves of that maybe building right now this this to me this feels the same energy of that will uh that elizabeth warren rant where she just ranted about bitcoin and crypto where almost everything she said was just like wrong like feels like the same energy to me here's the thing what is the solution to these things right i mean like when he's talking about like what about our existing financial system that is fraught with scams right millionaires manipulating markets they're doing this in the stock market right now um lose your savings account to password how about losing five percent of your savings to inflation every year right right like what's the solution here right jackson because we're building a solution yeah say something positive jackson stop being such a negative nancy all right that's enough of that anyway long thread what about this uh crypto exchange ftx sets sites on blue chip acquisitions the the take here is it looks like f uh sbf from ftss he wants to go buy goldman sachs and the take is that's not a good thing or is it even rational like that's my okay you you we i think we have different approaches to this take what's your take all right so here here's my take so sam bankman freed wants to buy goldman sachs i have no idea if he can actually do that or not right that's why okay but but first of all give him five years give him 10 years i don't care cz yeah sam bakeman freed whatever um i don't understand why crypto is cheering this on what i see david is a new class of bankers being established and creating a new system where they are the elites in charge and rather than have jamie dimon of jp morgan we get sbf of ftx and it's the same banking system except it has some uh crypto rails underneath like bitcoin and all this but the rest of it's centralized that is not the crypto vision that is not the bankless vision that is not what i'm signing up for and i'm frankly i'm tired of the industry cheering this sort of thing on because it's not good i think crypto banks and crypto bankers can easily become the the villains that we are essentially rebelling against right now and that's a real threat that um i don't think that the crypto industry is uh taking into full account that's my take this my take is that this feels very elon musky as in he just like says some very grandiose things and because he has this like branding and track record behind him all of a sudden people take it as legitimate ftx is not going to buy goldman sachs is not going to happen ftx is a is a cryptocurrency exchange valued at like seven or eight billion goldman sachs is valued at like 70 billion he also talked about and buying the cme which is another 70 billion company i'm sorry goldman sachs is 135 135 right okay so he he between goldman sachs and cme that's 200 billion dollar valuation that ftx wants to buy ftx is valued at seven billion dollars those do not compute uh and so what sam is saying is like well yeah well when you know my company ftx is going to grow also the cryptocurrency industry is going to grow ftx has probably has a bunch of crypto on the balance sheet crypto is going to 100x and then we're going to buy them as if we weren't already in crab season that would be the biggest top signal of all time he's like no sam you're 29 years old you're not buying goldman sachs like go home and take a nap there you go two different takes maybe some accuracy in both of them david i know there's accuracy in this one uh give us your take here uh this is a tweet from my favorite twitter account me uh we are just one paycheck period away from eip one five five nine so you got one last paycheck to buy eth before we start burning it wow that's a good take uh we're gonna end takes with that one super cool so let's talk about what we are excited about what are you excited about this week david uh i'm about to take a flight to france which will be my first ever trip to europe going to eat cc i'm super soaked for etcc uh this was the conference i've wanted to go to but i haven't been able to go to now i'm finally going i am bringing my microphone and my setup i'm going to record a bankless podcast there for all the people that are going to miss out on ecc who didn't get a ticket because tickets sold out so damn fast uh we the bankless banquets podcast is going to produce the ecc experience so if you weren't able to experience ecc we are going to get that done for you uh so it's gonna be three days the 20th 21st and 22nd all in france right in the heart of france in paris uh and like almost everyone who you know all the big names in d5 and crypto are going to be there and i'm really excited to just like experience hey paris never been to paris uh and also i love crypto conferences crypto conferences are so much fun uh it's basically a festival of you know cryptoculture and i just find myself vibing in that environment so i'm really stoked for it i'm i'm excited that you're going david because i feel like i'm going to be able to experience it to you you know like i'm kind of the hermit you know i'm not i'm not traveling these days very much and i'm living vicariously through you so i'm excited to to hear that podcast and uh hear about your experiences there all right ryan what are you excited about i'm excited that uniswap shipped on optimism because um there's an article in bankless that will have already been published by the time you guys are listening to this about the experience of of optimism but d5 switching architecture like i mentioned earlier in the episode and this with arbitrary with optimism this is the first time i feel like uh hey we're gonna make it it's gonna be okay like layer two not just coming it's here and for those that have been in crypto or ethereum for a long time you know that layer two has been promised forever and there have been so many disappointments i remember thinking for a while you know state channels would be sort of the solution but it turns out good for payments not a lot of adoption there's some issues remember thinking plasma would be the way out and getting really excited about some projects that were developing this new plasma architecture um turned out that had major problems it feels like we've been waiting waiting waiting and then the hope was in roll-ups and like are they actually going to ship it was almost like you know should we even hope i've been disappointed so many times uh now they're here now they work you can actually use them this is uh super gratifying and i just feel like um layer two ethereum scaling we're gonna make it fam it's gonna be okay d5 is going to be architect and it's going to work out i forgot to say this while we were showing while we were demoing uh the transactions on uh optimism earlier in the show but like the fact that we are actually showing what optimism is on video on the show yeah we're here like this is it we're like we made it like yay like celebrate like it took us years to get here uh and and so the fact that we've the fact that we finally have it and can actually prove it i remember doing pov crypto with christian and he's talking about oh yeah great like another ethereum thing that you guys are promising like i'm not going to hold my breath and i was like a like damn it good point because it's not here yet but also b it's totally going to come but you know for the last three years kind of kind of took it on faith that like you know scaling was actually going to come not sure i never concerned oh i i never doubted it i just didn't know when like i knew scaling was coming was it coming in 2018 2019 2025 i don't really know always knew that it was coming cloud is finally here but it's one of those things where like you know you don't bet against ethereum like that's how you lose uh and now we finally got the scale uh we act like after i think you and i have been doing this at least for nine months where we are having like oh l2 is coming guys l2's coming guys like on the banks of the show weekly roll up l2 is coming no no no l2 on this as of this show l2 is here david i feel like that with a lot of things i mean like 2021 is kind of the year for that remember uh you wrote that out at once if you're missing puzzle pieces eip1559 and talk about this monetary policy you wrote that like two years ago over two years ago it's like now the puzzle piece is coming right right and we have staking triple point asset things we were talking about are happening it's really exciting and now layer two is happening scalability is happening super cool all right man let's get to the meme of the week that's what the people have been waiting for that's why people watch this uh roll up it's for me of the week what are we looking at this week we are looking at a meme of beauty and the beast uh i actually wasn't familiar with this meme format i think this might just be right out of the creative head of michael wong but we have uh the the beast who is you know dying on the floor and the beast is titled old random wallet you know your old ethereum wall that you forgot about maybe your first price set of private keys and the the uh pr the old ethereum wallet says you came back uh and then uh bell else yeah is that your name bell yeah uh yeah you someone here clearly has kids uh and bell who's holding her old smart her old wallet goes uh of course i came back except bell is labeled me checking for airdrops [Laughter] it's all of these wallets that you forgot you even had that you only go and search for as soon as you hear some airdrop that that might have come to you um i mean people are probably doing that with um fox tokens fox yeah fox tokens with um the eric voorhees shape-shift airdrop so yeah dude every single time an air drop time happens how many wallets i mean it does pay to be disorganized when it comes to your crypto walls let me tell you you have wallets tend to uh to collect over time um yeah i bankless twitter tweeted this out basically like um hey the measure the the most important measure is are you more bankless this year than you were last year and a bunch of people said yes and you know some guy goes yeah i think i am and i definitely have way more wallets though that's the thing you have fewer bank accounts but all of these different ethereum crypto wallets uh that tend to compile over time
