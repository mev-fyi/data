duncan what are y'all and then crypto art the nfc world in general fixing about the broken traditional art system the physical art world it's not something i really understood well before nifty gateway and it's something that i've learned a lot about and it really has a lot of nuance and complexity i think the biggest issue with it is that it's very static it's not very good at helping artists get discovered and helping their work be distributed widely the model for being a successful physical artist is you move to new york you spend a long time networking until you finally meet the right gallery owners they agree to do a show with you and you're one of the lucky few who's made it in nfts the model is like you open up social media you tweet out your work your collectors find you you know you open up a discord for them so it's really a much more open engaging format and i think you know nfts are still very new but the amount of money that's being paid out to artists and creators via nfts is already in the same ballpark as the amount of money being paid out to artists and sort of other creative domains
