difference between getting wealthy versus staying wealthy what is the difference Morgan they're almost completely opposite skills which is what throws a lot of people off because getting rich requires being an optimist swinging for the fence is taking a risk staying rich is almost the exact opposite you need a degree of like conservatism and paranoia about what's going on in the world and the people who have done very well over time learn how to get those skills to coexist with each other having both of those at the same time which is ideally what everybody wants that's a much harder combination one of the way I phrased it is saving your money like a pessimist and investing your money like an optimist I am a scaredy cat of the short run and I know the short run is always going to be a constant chain of setback and disappointment and surprise and bear market and pandemic and recession but if I can survive all of that and endure it financially I'm a huge optimist about the next 20 30 40 50 years so I'm like massively optimistic about the long run and I invest my money accordingly and I'm pretty pessimistic or just I have a big question mark about the short run and I save my money accordingly getting those two things to coexist I think is difficult for some people but you need it to do well over time
