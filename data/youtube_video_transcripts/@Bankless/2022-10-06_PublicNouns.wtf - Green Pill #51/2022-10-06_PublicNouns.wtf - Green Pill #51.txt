foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we have public nouns so that's a nouns Fork that is a new experimental way to fund public goods in the ethereum ecosystem basically it's a nouns derivative and if you don't know what that means then you'll learn it in the episode basically one public noun which is basically an avatar being auctioned off every 12 hours forever right now they're raising 40th every 12 hours which is quite impressive I've been involved in a lot of public goods funding conversations they don't usually get off with this much of a bang and on the Pod we have vengeist Skye and Niche from the now public nouns project to talk about public nouns so nouns has proven to be a strong mechanism for continuous funding along a simple and effective governance framework and this is a collaboration of people from the projects like metacartel panvolo radical optimism CLR fund get coin and moloch that are focused on an experimental way of funding public goods using noun style auctions so on this episode we talk about the nouns ecosystem we talk about public nouns and its relation to the nouns ecosystem how it derives value from all the different nouns Forks that are out there that are also building tools for nouns dowels we talk about the future of public goods funding which is quite an interesting discussion something that I'm interested in is how do we build scalable recurring legitimate funding that is deeply weld for public goods so kind of a fun conversation because this is the tip of the sphere on public goods funding it's not going out hat in hand raising money for public goods it's actually auctioning off these PSPs in order to support public goods so public nouns.wtf is the website and vengist Skye and Niche are the people who are on the Pod today to talk about it so without further Ado I give you public nouns.wtf coin shift is a leading treasury management an infrastructure platform for Dows and crypto businesses that need to

thousand dollars what's up y'all okay yeah what's up GM all right so uh this is a this is the crew that that was involved in public nouns so WTF is public nouns yeah what the is public nouns I mean I feel like just like historically is probably how it emerged probably makes the most sense at least to me but uh but I mean the tldr you know it is a announce extension uh just like a fork of nouns uh that you know aims to bend the incentive uh away from just that pure meme of nouns to uh supporting public goods basically but yeah yeah it started I'd say it started with a group of people um these people are mostly in the public goods related space and and uh nearby spaces and we actually were quite interested in nouns in general and maybe even acquiring a noun and we started on that on that journey and it very quickly uh turned into getting more people from the public good space involved in the project and originally we were going to like buy a noun in order to ask for funding to create public nouns and then we're like that doesn't really make sense like we don't need that funding we don't need to buy a noun to start public nouns so we just went on the path of uh yes just starting public nouns and and defining it and over of course a few months at Dao Palace and on and Discord and telegrams we brought more people from different projects in the public good space and related into the group and then we kind of organized the the initial co-organizers who helped launch it um which is like seven organizations but with a plan to bring more and more organizations uh in over time through like curation and as the as the as the public nouns Dow grows to yeah to add to that is just um it's just another mechanism by which we can fund public goods which is why uh it's like the first nft project that I've been that I got excited about um in a while um so that's why I you know decided to jump in yeah and this you uh you're one of the early hodlers of of public nouns is that right uh yeah I think I I got the first the first one with the panvala stamp head so that was exciting got it and what excited you about public nouns as opposed to the Litany of other nft projects out there yeah I mean like um a final nfts in general as like cultural artifacts um for us to propagate memes and Brands um so as we saw with the like the 10K pfp boom like it's been a visceral way for us to form a sense of like identity and belonging as as part of a collective um but uh yeah like what we've seen with those like other sort of 10K pfp ones was that it kind of reflects this thing in crypto where like an opportunity to join um to join exist in like a really narrow uh time window where you just happen to be a part of the ethereum crowd sale you just happen to be a part of you know the year and telegram group where the drop happened or like the crypto punks meant um so I think like the noun-ish sort of distribution model was um an interesting way to like perpetually fund a treasury um and so like this infinite aspect if it was interesting to me and then also of course like this orientation towards um public goods um was a way to kind of like what what drove me to um actually jump in as opposed to like observing it from the sidelines yeah that is like why we got I think or at least a lot of us got uh excited about nouns in the first place really is like the governance elements of it which is you know which is the self-perpetuating uh treasury that has built-in governance in it basically like when you participate in it uh amine called it he was like what is this like molecued out with nfts and I was like yeah basically uh where you you know you put in Ethan you get immediate power in a dow you know so like in the nouns case that's obviously been wildly prolific um and here it was just kind of like turning that into experiment of like well can we just add this incentive of like we're gonna do this now like Nisha is like with this like you know ongoing uh auction so it's like this nice Cadence of of community growth but like there's actually a purpose to this community which is like to support public goods uh however we can you know not just with funding but um you know I like to think that we've already contributed to public goods even before the first auction was settled you know like uh this course has already been raised in places where you know maybe public goods work being talked about but they weren't being talked about to the degree that they are now already which is really interesting uh and like various things like that so um yeah it's really cool though the governance element in funneling into the uh the purpose of supporting public goods once you get there is like super cool and one way to think about it is there are a lot of people in the space like and he's just mentioned but Kevin maybe yourself people like vitalik there's a there's a whole bunch of people out there in our space that obviously like public goods and they see nfts out there but like my personal opinion would be like I don't think um metallic would ever buy a noun like I I don't mind I don't think he Minds that they exist but like he doesn't buy a board ape he doesn't buy a noun but if you think about what public nouns is I think it's yeah it's an nft related project with a tie to public goods which is also if you buy this thing it is you know can be used as almost a badge of support for something that you want to show public support for and so it's almost like that badge but it can be used as your profile as well and like it's almost built for someone like vitalik um you know you could see vitalik buying an optimism uh possum public now which would be super cool um and so the other cool thing is you have these communities which are already built and then you have um different public noun heads from each of those communities and and that has an automatic attraction by the people from those communities who already love public goods and now they have a reason to buy an awesome nft that is like gets them governance in this cool experiment and they get to show their support by showing their their public now yeah there's like the three layers of Engagement is cool it's like you could totally just get a public noun and and you sent East to a Dao that you know their purpose is to fund public goods that's cool and you have this pfp that's great um The Next Step if you don't want to participate in governance yourself you can delegate that power to literally anyone else in the world who you think would contribute to that conversation uh in governance uh or if you you know are someone who actually like wants to get in contribute as well then there you go you have that path as well so yeah there's like so many different ways that just by participating and battling in the auctions uh you can uh you're supporting public goods even the bidding is just supporting public goods so yeah so uh looking at public nouns.wtf it which is the site where you can see the public nouns uh looks like there's a bidding experience and then there's a new noun every 12 hours forever that is generated and it seems like the on-chain artwork is based off of the public goods Dows that this dial supports so metacartel pinball or radical optimism CLR fund get coin and moloch so uh it looks like there's there's there's uh metacartel Chili Peppers there's molec Devil head nouns there's Bitcoin robots there's CLR fun orbs there's radical plants and I think it's neat that every noun is kind of like a subtweet of the various dowels that are public goods dolls that you all support yeah the other well the other so just to clarify that like sentence those organizations are not necessarily the um organizations that will be supported with the with like the treasury that goes into public now initial organizations who helped are a part of launching this this project but actually like this money that's in the treasury we don't actually see it like going specifically well it could it's up to the the public nouns Dow but it's not like this is going to be donated specifically to certain public goods out there what we think is more interesting is if this money is used to fund people and projects and crazy ideas that are that are new and that are people experimenting with in and around the public good space so like The Meta example is public nounsdao would love to fund projects like public nounsdao right so like is public nouns now a public good I don't know not really like maybe but actually we want to experiment we want to actually fund more stuff more  like public goods uh public nouns now yeah so is this the future of public goods funding uh nft launches I mean we need all the different sources of funding possible Right to public goods like that's the problem with public kids it's like the sourcing of funding and how funding can like alter its motives and purpose and value uh creation so I mean we need as many things as possible this is definitely a pretty radical example of it uh super fun so far and like the yeah the governance elements are really cool it's not just a thing that's you know an nft project that's raising money to a centralized treasury that is going to go to one thing you know it's really a dow that one can participate in and over time and help to like um you know raise awareness around public goods in general and build new experiments together and and also funding you know lastly basically uh but uh yeah I mean I think it's going to exist alongside things like Bitcoin and CLR fund and radical and all that and and sort of it's like like a new Avenue for different types of users to to come and and join and and fund public goods um because you know like certain certain Avenues feel more like a donation where it's like you're selecting you know from from a card of things and it's more passive certain things are more like active you know there's like doing good which is also you know a way for artists to launch Collections and and fund um social impact projects on the side um and so like public nouns I think it's like a way for you know the people who um would be interested in like bidding for something that's um that gets released like in a very controlled manner like an nft to to join like the the excitement as part of that initial experience but also participate in governance uh moving forward and I think it's also like a nice uh governance experience as well um because you know one public noun equals one vote which is um you know there's like one token one vote in in the context of the RC 20s in in terms of like treasury governance thus far and then there's also you know uh like an ongoing effort to you know do uh to to launch um to do civil resistance which is like one person one vote so I think one nft one vote is somewhere lies somewhere um between like in that Spectrum so it's um yeah it's an interesting experiment to see how um how things are being governed um if it's like one of nft one vote yeah quadratic making it quadratic has actually been a suggestion from uh some people in nounsdale in like some of the public nouns here like eventually which is interesting to think about because it's not really too far off from the one to one but if you have like a lot of public nouns basically you just wouldn't be able to um you know really over exert your power basically so yeah I don't know it could be really interesting and yeah and that we've like we've already been talking about the different ways to bring identity obviously or proof of of uniqueness into that if we're going to you know go for something like quadratic so that you can't just like split up your nouns but um that's something the things that we also want to solve are like same similar issues that like nouns Dao probably needs to solve in the long run and every derivation of nounsdale you know we are in touch with the nouns with now's Dao people and you know what's cool is they also do public goods like they've given some money towards the I believe the git coin Grant round um but but they don't really have time to like Focus only on public goods right and so public nouns be an extension of nounsdale allows this mechanism to like really dive in and focus on us on a very specific vertical and I think we'll well we already there are other um nouns Dow derivatives that are also doing that in other areas but we'll see that more and more um and then we can all also borrow all from each other so we're already going to start putting a lot of the tools that nounsdale has created for their Community we're going to use those tools in our community and we're going to build new ones that they'll be able to use as well yeah it really is an incredible the nouns ecosystem is really incredible like yeah we've only really forked the first part but uh now that everybody's kind of getting involved there's kind of a lot of other things we should probably Fork uh and get involved there's like the uh the fomo nouns mechanic uh fomo nouns dot what the which is where um you can go and vote at the at the time that the next noun is going to be minted you can like like the community can vote on which one it is basically or try to like upvote or down vote uh to kind of sway which one I think that could be an interesting mechanic in this uh public goods space I think uh whether like communities are wanting like less or more of a particular one to make it you know uh yeah like there's lots of different things and then with the different communities like the different public goods communities that are already as a part of public nouns and there will be more we've talked about some interesting things that could happen with like for good cartels within the public nouns ecosystem right like Niche and her friends get together and you you have a Stampy and you guys love panvala you're gonna like you may try really hard to drive like more experimental money into the panvala ecosystem versus you know Kevin's gonna aim for the get coin ecosystem or something and so like you could have these weird cartels but they're all like four good cartels which is kind of crazy yeah cartels for good I think that should be a meme yeah um I think it's really interesting to see this pattern in the space in which you have these punctuated equilibriums and then it completely changes the game I mean molok Dao for me just like everyone forked Mo looked out and then there was a ecosystem of tools that were built around that uh when yam Finance came out everyone sort of was building yam forks for a little while there's the ohm Fork summer that we had and now it feels like we're in this nouns Fork uh ecosystem build out and punctuated equilibrium and I I I think it's neat the The Meta kind of changes every time one of these new things happens and then there's a ton of forks I'm wondering if if you have any comments on on that or uh I guess I'd just love to further dive deeper into the nouns ecosystem fomo nouns is really cool the fact that there's a builder where you can generate possible upcoming nouns is cool are there any other Cool Tools in the in the nouns ecosystem that you want to fork and bring into into public nouns and what is there relationship between public nouns and other nouns forks and nouns itself yeah I think we're definitely starting to build those relationships now we're trying to like reach out because we're real we're realizing we need some of these things uh so yeah if anybody's in the nouns ecosystem hit us up for sure uh but uh I don't know yeah there's a lot of cool stuff out there yes guy yeah yeah like there's tools to because these things are one every 12 hours right and not everyone has time to like every day look at these twice a day there are tools for auto bidding um from your community or from you as a person um there's ways to like better analyze what's what's out there and what people have obviously we're new and small so it's that's less important like the actual data at this point um there's fractalizing so there's already been some Dows that have as a group acquired public nouns um and some other Dows that have been bidding on public nouns and so then you get this really interesting um yeah there's not just individual people but you get teams of people that maybe can pull together and acquire these things and then they'll yeah in one in in one scenario um like there is probably going to be a Malik Dao that actually owns a like a set of public nouns and so you can actually just join that dial probably to to have influence in the public nouns ecosystem via holding and this is all stuff that happened with nouns like shark Dao I think acquired two of the first five or six nouns um and so like this has been this has happened all along um and it it also it also opens the opportunity for people that might not be able to buy a full public noun themselves yeah and one cool thing that another really cool thing they have over there is uh prop house they call it which is where they like they I mean they do pretty big initiatives from nounsdale itself but then they send uh but they fund these other they fund this prop house basically where like a larger Community can uh signal and vote on on smaller ad hoc proposals basically so they kind of like uh recurringly kind of fun fund that for to to do even more like uh throughout which is a really cool mechanism which definitely has been talked about with us as well there's obviously a lot of people who care about public goods but you know there's only two per day so like you know how can I contribute and that kind of thing so I think that'll be one of the highest priority things for us to start looking into really is getting that kind of stuff up and running working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work well office

access to those who have historically been shut out of the tradify system learn how you can put your uscc to work empowering real business growth worldwide at goldfinch.finance it seems like uh so prop house itself is kind of interesting it seems like uh it's basically where you go to submit proposals and get your projects that are noun-ish funded in in the mechanic there is is interesting so you all think that you might adopt that for public nouns right yeah exactly yeah I think I mean I think it'd be really cool it'd be a way I mean I think I mean public goods is uh there's a thing with public goods where like the public should be involved right so like I think just because we're now I think we should be looking uh very be very very cognizant about you know being uh receiving signal and input from uh you know up the public that we are trying to serve or whatever so yeah I believe I believe one of the main um functions of it is actually you know to borrow from Bitcoin rounds right instead of having continuous git coin donations forever every week every day like in a continuous Thing by by creating rounds you have the focus and attention of people to make decisions like for the week that it's live and they can decide between the all of the options and they don't have to follow it every month right all month long they only have to come in one day during that round and make a decision and so prop house I think part of the point of that was instead of having continuous proposals all day long every day you you focus them in batches and then you get to pick and choose and focus your and it takes less time and attention and so it's all you know it actually probably came from the frame from how Bitcoin rounds work yeah yeah I think I think how it works is um it kind of turns uh it on its head where East is the thing that's actually being auctioned off and uh proposals are the the bidders and people go vote on it and I think if you're above a certain a certain threshold of votes that you get funded with the youth that's being auctioned off for that time period so the community kind of submits proposals and then the Dow comes in and fun it's almost like a reverse proposal mechanism to I think how a lot of Adele's were yeah yeah there's lots of interesting stuff if you go to prop.house that's the website for it and I see people submitting proposals to have little nouns in the World Cup 2022 put down if I escape Park in Singapore for uh to eat and and and nouns has a treasury of 4 000 eth which is oh I'm sorry 29 000 youth yeah which is which is like four million dollars right now so uh there's quite a lot of opportunity to to nonify a lot of different things with that kind of decentralized Intelligence coming to the Dow and the Dow having that deep of wallets I think that's neat yeah how much did you say in dollars uh 29 000 eth which is four million dollars may have gotten that wrong I think it's more right okay how much is Heath today yeah this is the part of the episode that won't age well but uh I thought it was sweet yeah that that makes sense to me four million dollars and 29 000 youth so Oh no you're I had a top five order of attitude 40 million because it's 29 000. okay yeah all right all you just want to listen through to me stumble through doing math but um yeah I mean I'm interested in seeing lots of things getting notified as the noun ecosystem grows and diversifies and has that much Treasury and that much Innovation and how it's funding it's really cool it's a really cool mechanic uh I mean part of the I mean one of the things that really got us a lot of us to start staring at it so obsessively at the beginning was its problem though uh which is like the 51 attack thing um you know it's uh we still haven't really figured out coin voting and it really isn't that different from that you know you can buy a public noun you can buy Power with capital um therefore you are always at risk at about 51 attack um so they have so they you know they saw that veto right as we do still too for yeah we can't submit proposals from from the peanut or multi-cig and neither can the nounders but they can be two things which in our case which in our case is kind of interesting because we're like yeah we are actually supposed to be doing something with the like with a purpose with the funding um but regardless I think we would all prefer to get rid of the veto as soon as possible but it's a hard problem to solve that we really haven't solved in the space yet so um and you know it's uh I think well yeah I think that's definitely why I got super excited about navs in the first place was looking at that problem and like thinking about that problem and like where uh you know coming from like the more of the molecular ecosystem myself but also interacting with like many many coin dials and like I've seen those those differences over the over the years in the kind of like the The Duality of those um announced out kind of feels like somewhere in the middle potentially if we can solve that 51 attack with nounsdale then I think we might have something really awesome for for governance for large communities of you know yeah like coin LED governance kind of potentially yes I mean I'd love to turn the conversation towards public goods funding one of my sort of views of public goods funding is that we're going to need scalable funding for public goods that's legitimate so accepted by a number of ecosystem participants recurring uh and a deep well of funding and so you know there's a lot of different things that check those different boxes but if we can find something that's that's legitimate recurring and deep then then that gets really exciting to me and I think the public nouns is off to a good start because it's legitimate it seems to be beloved it's recurring every 12 hours it's raising four youth right now we'll see how long that that lasts and how it scales and seems to be well supported and uh uh an ecosystem that that supports new creative ways to to fund public goods seems like it's pretty high upside to me I'd be curious if if you all have any uh views on on how public nouns is going to is going to evolve in the future and whether there's any other criteria that you'd that you'd add for scaling funding for for public goods yeah so even though that that sounds like a decent amount of money like if you actually think how many public goods need to be funded in the world we're talking like billions or trillions right so like public nouns that that was not gonna be able to do this so we need like this exponential effect and and so I don't know in like a normal hackathon in our space like I don't know if there's a lot of like prize money at those hackathons for people working on solutions to build and solve what you just described to solve that need and so public nouns now could put more funding towards the bounties for people that could figure out bigger Solutions and other solutions that can scale that but yeah I don't think we can't just make a bunch of public nouns Dallas that's going to like solve all the funding but we need to like create this so that there's this honey pot for people to make more stuff that can then solve that problem or start start the process to solve that problem and then build from there and then eventually I think you're going to need kind of some of the you have these things like built into protocols like I guess optimism would be the example where this big protocol and a portion of that thing or a portion of a project is going towards public goods like and it might get to the point where if you launch a project whether it's an nft project a D5 project a dow project it would be weird not to give some of your money that goes through your system towards public goods and so if you can create that Dynamic that's how we get to like billions and trillions I think yeah in public nounsdale JK I like that's a good question like how to scale the the funding of public nouns that was interesting and like I mean I do think that there are I'm still trying to like there's a lot there's a more primitive I don't think we've really uncovered the real primitive power of what the noun style system uh is capable of um I think there is a more primitive thing there that we haven't revealed yet that likely does have broader applications um which is my guess I think this is kind of a you know it's one of those Frontier problem spaces that I think is really very hard and challenging so you know I don't I don't fault you for getting lost in it it just seems like it's one of the most high upside for the space Also and it's it's really impressive how how nouns has sort of grown into this ecosystem that it not only creates a lot of funding but also has innovated in how that funding is distributed with things like prop house so it'll be it'll be interesting to see what public nouns can do um if I'm you know a median green pill listener maybe I work in D5 or web3 or at an L2 or maybe I even work in public goods how can I support public nouns or how can I get involved in the community I mean bid bid Wars get in get involved in the mid Wars uh and for the for the Regens out there who don't know how to win a bid War you have to pay attention to the actual end of the auction because there will be a battle uh if you want to get it now then you're gonna have to battle for it uh at least for a little while it seems like um so the degen's I think that you were talking about they should know that already and I think they're probably just going to clear it clean out the public down so if the regions don't pick up their pick up their game a little bit uh but yeah otherwise I mean um you know I think this is public goods uh and we need as many we don't need we don't just need as much funding as possible for public goods we also need as many brains and hearts on this stuff as well so um you know definitely encourage anybody to hop into the Discord and just yeah start figuring out a way to contribute um I'm sure any of the public nouns that would be like welcome to that there's documentation there's lots of things that could use some support yeah and one of the I think early tasks of the of public nouns Dao is gonna to also help better Define what kind of public goods are because public goods is so broad right now that like everyone's like oh everything's a public good and and the definition can be you know tweaked lots of different ways and so helping to Define that is a community like goal um and then what that allows is most of yeah most of these earliest organizations that are part of the public nouns organization are like good with funding right like focused on funding and so as we grow with and open to more organizations we have already talked about maybe having more builder organizations um that are public goods related like in the next cohort maybe so um that you start to balance the skill sets that are just even in the Public Public nouns Dow ecosystem and so making sure that it grows with thought um and and anyone that has ideas around that or other organizations that could be a good part a good fit for that should reach out in the Discord and and share their ideas um if I remember correctly like every 30th public uh public noun gets sent to um like certain places so there's like one that gets sent to uh like non-style itself this one that gets sentenced to like um peanutter so it might be a way to um you know get like Sweat Equity um like the price point to enter right now is much much lower than the uh than the nouns now I think like we're averaging we're at the 12th noun and like the average is about five eighth which is like a far cry from uh the 600e that like the first actual noun have been sold for um so it's still like kind of um Hefty but uh yeah it's still manageable nice uh is there anything I didn't ask that you want to tell us about public nouns uh I don't know but I did think of one other thing though that about something you said earlier which is right well what I lost earlier was the your question about how to scale the funding which I think there is some interesting things there but why would we want to scale the funding is why I got lost in like one reason that I'm interested in that question is because there's a uh uh what was that guy's name on the on the green pill last week with the network ology stuff uh Chris oh Christopher vitelli yeah and he was talking about those like four properties of emergence which are like uh diversity I think like connectedness uh how distributed something is in like the stability or meta stability more like the not really being stable but like stable enough basically so like so like applying that to like something like public nouns and like figuring out where the emergence is and the emergencies in the community right so like the and one of the the you know if you think back up and think about those properties like the connectedness is public goods so that's like the connectedness that of the but there's like all these different people from all over the world from different communities and that's the diversity part but then the meta stability and the uh distributed modes of organizing or whatever um those things I think are the things that are going forward basically that if if it if if it happens if a community stays together like all these people basically came together into this place and are still coming in together to do it but if that if there is emergence there then it could be a place of a lot of people who really care about public goods and show a track record of supporting public goods and they may become a dow that can be a recipient of retroactive public goods funding um that could scale their funding but you know first I think track record and all that like uh legitimacy part like you said I think basically would be yeah it's pretty cool so far but I think that yeah there's more legitimacy we need to start actually like making some impact and like all those types of things uh but yeah I do think that's it one part of the interesting meta to the whole thing is just us all getting together from the public good space in one place and not on our silos to to talk of them and uh Discord about public goods yeah some some uh already I think we talked about a little bit about some ideas around retroactive and retroactive is really interesting so doing like some public good um I don't know what you call them in a nice way bombs like some retro bombs of public goods funding to like people that have done awesome stuff in the in the public good space so just to lay those out send us out there and then like hopefully more people do it and and they can get that award as well need anything to add yeah I think um I mean it's it's early days like we we have kind of a soft proposal like our first soft proposal to um for funding um going out uh I think we're discussing um being a part of uh CLR funds um uh funding round or like matching pool uh during Devcon so I think that's a nice kind of starting point for us to experiment with you know um what what the community wants to find um how much uh to fund and like setting an initial Cadence around um like how how we want to get involved in that and so this this specific round is um focused on funding public goods in Colombia um in particular um so it's a nice way during Devcon to kind of get our our name out there initially um and also we have yet to like ratify our our Manifesto so it's um yeah like I'm curious to see like what the community or like the early initial people who bidded uh what their ideas are about uh where public nouns could go and and like why they why they uh came in early um and like got some initial ideas in there yeah you said it earlier a little bit dish but yeah the you know yeah right now it's kind of like the time to get in like it's just a community that's forming I mean obviously there's like a lot of love and thought in it already but uh it's yeah we're just kind of getting together right I mean it's cool that yeah we already have little proposals kind of spinning up and and whatever and that's that's great to see uh but uh but yeah we're still forming so like Now's the Time to kind of get in and like shape this thing to make sure that it does do the thing that we hope that it does right so um and if you're listening to this it now means you're slightly late to get your public noun and so you should have gotten it before this was published but still come and check it out yeah some little listener trolls uh end the episode on we're well uh where can people find the project online yeah public nouns that what the follow us on Twitter for sure uh we try to uh drop all the auctions and we're always just showing public goods so yeah right and public nouns on Twitter I think oh yeah and totally come into the Discord yeah yeah I mean we like to troll in there and uh we can also talk about contributions and serious things as well great well thanks for coming on the pods y'all keep up the great work yeah thanks for having me thanks for having us [Music]
