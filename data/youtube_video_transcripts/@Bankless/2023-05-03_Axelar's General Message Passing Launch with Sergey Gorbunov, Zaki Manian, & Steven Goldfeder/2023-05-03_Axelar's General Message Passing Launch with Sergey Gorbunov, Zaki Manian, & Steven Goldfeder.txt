Bagel Station we got an extra show for you today here we got a panel of cross chain experts we got zachimanian from Cosmos we got Stephen goldfinter from arbitrum and new to bankless Sergey gorbenoff from axilar axelar is a newer IBC chain on the scene it's been around for a while but it's new to me uh and it is working on inter chain composability so not only is the world of Cosmos and ipz chains a world of interoperable mesh network of Cosmos layer ones but also axlar specifically is working on interoperability beyond the IBC realm and so the announcement going out today is that axelar's new technology what they are calling General message passing is connecting the world of arbitrum to the world of Cosmos which is why Stephen goldfeder from arbitrum is on this panel as well so previously we have been skeptical at bankless about cross-chain bridges uh generally the position that everyone that we've seen so far is fundamentally insecure and I am still cautiously optimistic about axelr but there is a lot of new technology that they are bringing to the table and so they are able to produce what seems to be a meaningful integration between Cosmos and arbitrum that has both communities pretty excited and according to Sergey from axillar the interconnections between different chains doesn't stop there because if you can connect the IBC language of Cosmos to the evm language of ethereum you can actually kind of connect any languages from any blockchain or at least that's the idea and so if you are into the world of the many layer 1 landscape with with Bridges connecting all these things this episode is definitely for you and so we're going to get right into that conversation with Zachy Steven and Sergey but first before we talk to Zaki Stephen and Sergey on this show

ethereum bankless Nation we have two returning guests and one new one Zaki manian from Cosmos Zaki welcome back to the show it's great to be here and Stephen goldfederer from arbitrary what's up Steven how's it going great to be here thanks for having me and also the new entrant into the bankless nation we have Serge Sergey gorbanov from axelar and this is the the center of this announcement Sergey welcome to bankless hey good to be here So today we're talking about chains and bridges and a particular new type of expressive bridge that axelar is bringing to the table so Sergey since you're the new one of the bunch to to the bankless uh podcast uh could you just explain a little bit about axler what it is and you can just tease up for this announcement that we are going to be talking about here on this episode today yeah for sure I mean high level axillary is a network that connects other networks right so it's a decentralized uh you know blockchain technology that allows you to connect different layer ones and layer twos and send information across them right and so uh we build a kind of a full stack of interoperability that allows you to compose your applications across different ecosystems right so you can have Smart contracts on one chain talk to Smart contracts on another chain and really enable kind of very simple uh developer and user experience to interact with multi-chain ecosystem that we live in now right and so our axle is a decentralized layer that you know enables a lot of this functionalities and axillar is a cosmos IBC chain uh and so like many of the other Cosmos size BC chains It just fits right in into that mesh Network landscape of Cosmos trains correct that's right yeah so actually is powered by kind of a tender man right and you know a lot of the uh rules around the consensus have been customized to go beyond Cosmos right so be able to connect different ecosystems like ethereum like you know layer ones like arbitrum optimism and so on and so forth and kind of a really be the the connector across different software language stacks right so this is this is where the explanation for XLR kind of gets a little funny because we have Cosmos which is a network of chains and then we have axillar which is supposed to connect the cosmos network of chains to other chains so can you just like open up that that can of worms and help explain that a little bit yeah for sure I mean I think Cosmos has been built right with interoperability mindset at its core right and so kind of IBC protocol you know can be used quite well to connect a lot of the cosmos ecosystems right uh but but the reason IBC works and everything else is because the cosmo stack has been designed with interoperability in mind right so IBC is kind of a very uh native to the cosmos ecosystem all of the chains speak the same language and so you know IBC helps you put uh packets back and forth across them now if you want to go outside of Cosmos right to evm chains you know to arbitrum and so on and so forth you have to speak a different language right then you have to have a different protocol in mind to connect those chains right and so this is where axillo comes in right so our protocol you know can be used to connect an arbitrary EDM stack um you know and then uh be able to compose those ecosystems with each other right and with other Cosmos chains right so and you can think of axillary actin as a sort of a translation layer in that in that process right so you have messages of transactions that can be executed on uh EDM chains that can be translated into the sort of the packet formats or messages that can be executed on Cosmos chains and vice versa right and so accessor allows you to connect the software Stacks that speak very different languages and you know sort of unite them together so previously generally on Bank list we were critical of cross layer one Bridges uh generally as a form factor we kind of think as a as a structural pattern that they are insecure um they tend to kind of collapse down to just a multi-sig uh so how is axillar different in that respect yeah so connection is one of the only one of the very few networks that serve fully decentralized and the powers you know interoperability right so it's powered by you know tendermen it's an open you know valid data set anybody can participate anybody can join you know and security to something we took very seriously kind of from the ground up right so a decor and networking layer you know the network is decentralized it has you know robust security policies like quadratic loading right for progress and cross-chain requests you know validator key rotations and so on and so forth so that's sort of the base layer right it's very secure very decentralized Network um on top of it you know if you're thinking about security for cross chain you have to have very robust engineering practices right so everything from you know we've done over 40 audits on the network right multi-million dollar bug bounties you know lots of rulers like unit tests and so on and support so so you have to have the operational you know um Excellence right if you want to ship anything cross-chain um you know and finally what I call is like application layer security add-ons right so if you are transferring value between chains then in your code right or in your functionality you maybe want to have things like rate limits right that would prevent you know worst case disaster attacks you know the networking layer um so that's how we think about security kind of a from the ground up uh full stack approach making sure you have multiple robustness um you know uh protocols in place throughout it and and the rest the end of it can be actually very very secure you know and scalable architecture um you know and the final point I'll mention there kind of a new paradigms things like you know General message passing that we have a lot of applications building with actually enable you to build different class of applications that don't rely on explicitly token Bridges right don't rely on token transfer in particular and those designs can be a lot more secure and you know we can go into the details of it but I'd say that's the new wave of how cross chain applications will be built out is using kind of General message passing paradigms that enable a very new architecture and design space that's more secure by default and that that's the subject matter of the announcement that's going out of axillar today correct that that is the the big thing so like there there's a big thing happening there's an announcement that axelar is making it's called Uh some samlier is that correct similier similier I'm not French uh simulator um so so exactly maybe maybe I'll turn to you can since you're the one wearing the uh sommelier shirt uh yeah what is this announcement and technically what does it do yeah yeah so co-founder of similier similier is a project that I started with my uh with Christy uh my co-founder back in like sort of early 2021 right around the time when IBC was launching um but it was really you know it's been a passion project about the combination of ethereum D5 and evm D5 and Cosmos Tech so the idea was to build us a decentralized active strategy manager so like essentially like think of it as yearn 2.0 um it was like you wanna because urine strategies anyone who's used them has seen a pattern you know you start out apis are really high you put more as more money comes into them the the the returns get diluted um and you gotta and you've got to Pivot to the next year in strategy and it's just sort of this uh sort of endless process and so wanted to build a a protocol for strategies that adapt evolve over the time but didn't give up decentralization and it was always sort of a core value for me that like we wouldn't be bridging tokens bridging tokens super hard to do well and a lot of risk right there's all this risk associated with it but what we wanted what we thought realized is by bridging essentially data and rebalances um like sort of Trades we could manage the trades on the cosmos side so you could have like strategy signal providers um that are you know defy experts talking to validators those validators agree on uh and process proposed trades before they happen like they agree and it gets bridged over so we've been using our own bridge for over a year um to run our strategies and we have like we have two strategies right now that collectively have about 17 million tvl we have the best stable coin yield on ethereum real yield USD uh and the best denominated yield on ethereum uh really old eat um these two strategies are these adaptive Market adaptive strategies they can scale they can do they can allocate into multiple strategies they don't have to compromise decentralization for this and they never Bridge the tokens so you know you uh you aren't taking this like security risk of the bridge when you use the system like the hot the hot B and D fight right now where all of our strategists are like where how can we get on arbitrum when can we get on arbitrum uh uh you know it's clearly the coolest hottest place to be in D5 right uh most protocols most exciting stuff lots of volume lots of TBL um and so been looking for what would be the right way of doing that um and have been keeping an eye on axelr uh for a long time um and realize that this composability between IVC and uh evm was possible and realized you know we could almost we could in a very short order get access to the ability to run our strategies you know sommelier strategies on arbitrum and you know many other EVMS uh and like you know it's like I mean people don't really know this about me that I've been you know building this massive like a very large scale very sophisticated ethereum project I'm like you know we just joined the erc4626 alliance we were like we're I'm like basically D5 Maxi at this point like uh and like love using it um and uh yeah so this was like huge enabling technology um and you know I think you know it took us basically two years to get similier to like full maturity and a lot of money and a lot of time but like the next generation of Builders the builders who come after all of this can just use axolar and immediately take like combined Cosmos Tech and eat Tech to build something like bigger better amazing in like you know months okay so my understanding of this so far is that axelar Cosmos IBC chain fits right into the cosmos IPC ecosystem and then we have Arbitron with this very vibrant defy ecosystem on the other side and these things are disparate they are disconnected while axlr does have cross-j cross-chain um communication capabilities I don't think that they are meaningfully differentiated from bridging from from the cross-trained bridges that that bankless has previously been uh concerned about but this is when some some sorry familiar sorry Zach it was Amelia uh I might have to do that at their time some and then but this is where Psalm comes in and changes the game correct so just at a high level brush stroke that's that's what we're talking about is that is that a way yeah I mean well we're like the first of what is a category of applications right okay I don't think the bridge applications of tomorrow and today really look like the bridge applications of the past like the bridges of the past were like okay I need to like I want to go like ape into this like high apy to cool on like some weird chain I'm gonna like Bridge my stable coins or my other coins over and like that's you know that's that's been the bridging experience of you know the last two years um what similier is is like no we're getting you the best ethnative yield we're going to get you the best arbitrum native yields we're going to get you the best we're not sucking your liquidity into some new ecosystem we're making your liquidity more effective more efficient more powerful in its in where it's natively um so you know uh for for arbitrary native D5 protocols all like the gmxs the uh the options protocols the the camelotexes of the world we're building optimized experiences there using the cross chain attack okay so I think I misspoke so some sommelier is a defy app it's in it's an application it's in the application layer and so I misspoke and I said that it is the thing doing the magical Bridging the magical bridging is Axor we are we are the application layer of and like we're the application layer that's really highlighting what can be done now so Sergey where where is this go for it yeah I mean just just to add to that right like so traditional like axler's been kind of composing Cosmos and a lot of evm chains for the one of the you know exciting applications was the bridge and moving tokens around right um and I think like like I said I think sort of moving tokens around is is cute but it's kind of a turned you know humans into manual routers right that they have to move their tokens back and forth just to use one application right and so you know I think what we're doing like with the upgrade for the general message pass and what me what it means is that you can have applications on Cosmos you can have applications you know on arbitrum they can talk to one another by issuing contract calls and send in messages right and so what that enables you is to have liquidity wherever you want it to be but manage the contracts and manage and compose the applications you know in the same way as you could compose them if they were all like on arbitrum right but certain applications you know could not be built on a layer one or Layer Two on its own like sommelier it needs its own valid data set it has its own uh secure to model and things like that so those those need like separate stacks but now they can have the same level of composability with all the applications and you know all the liquidity on these chains as if they were actually reside in there so I think that's you know that's exciting part and sir that's the the general message passenger Paradigm right that we've had to open it up between these two software stacks so I was talking to to Zaki before the show and we were talking about just like the war against non-interoperability and I called it like a front right a front that we need to advance in order to create interoperability and there's like marginal improvements you get you get across chain Bridges you get some language efficiencies you get you get to improve and uh so I was trying to like wait the magnitude of what is being announced today which is just to make it really specific axelar's General messaging passaging is the announcement that we are talking today the GMP uh and so like the the answer that he gave me was like I was trying to measure it between like a small incremental step and like a breakthrough that we've never seen before in the world of crypto economics and so I'll throw that question to you uh to Sergey the the general gist I'm getting is like this is a large step forward it's not it's not like a zero to one breakthrough moment that we have totally upended the world of crypto economics but this is not just an incremental Improvement help me understand like how big of a deal this is and for the world of cross-train interoperability yeah I mean I think this is the first time where you can have very two different software Stacks right like a VM stack and a cosmo stack being fully composable with one another right um you know through Excel and through the through the general massive question on evm land you know it's much easier to compose things you know an actor have been doing like General message passing there but across different software Stacks like Cosmos and admits you know it's much harder to do right um you know like like Zaki said they sort of spent you know kind of a two years building the initial version that connected to you know ethereum right so how do you do that for all the chains for all the cosmos and all the you know evm chains and that you know that's what we've done with the very simple architecture so um you know what I view it is a step forward to have better developer and better user experiences where people you know don't have to think about bridging don't have to think about moving their tokens that would in turn you know enable us to have more users in the ecosystem because I think you know right now it's very painful if you have you like to play with an application oh it's on a different chain or let me find the bridge let me move my token it's a different token you know I need a wallet I need to pay gas across all of those things so all that stuff we can remove away right and so you can have if your user assembly or you can just interact with arbitrum and vice versa if you if you have an application on arbitrum you want to submit a request and that request needs to be executed in an application in a cosmos ecosystem you'll be able to do that so much much simpler you know user experience much better you know liquidity properties I think that's what you know it all enables the so Sergey the the when I I said like hey bankless had previously been critical about cross chain Bridges I think it is that um migration of tokens across train is where we start to get scared and I think I think we are in agreement in that philosophy it's like that is where the insecurity comes from uh and so this is the new strategy that axelar's pioneering is not token transfers but data transfers so you call it General message passing to just allow chains to talk to each other communicate messages to each other not share assets with each other and so I think it's it's uh it's uh saying that this is the new way to do interoperability is to not not share share assets but but share data how does one actually achieve a fully expressive level of interoperability if only data can be passed so you the way that you and Zacky are talking uh it's a it's as if the full vision of interoperability is equivalent in this world are there any trade-offs in just like the message passing versus token passing world and do we actually get the fully expressive interoperability world that we would get if we had secure token passing too I mean so you can build secure um but yeah I'll say briefly I'm taking the head on uh you can build token transfer as an application on top of General message passing right so if you want to transfer tokens you know you can build that as an application you should have you know robust security there maybe rate limits and so on and so forth so that you can do and so I guess what general message passing allows you is to go you know sort of beyond that like we said right um and sort of the analogy that I like using right these are we traditionally move the liquidity to where the application logic lives right and that's what creates like the painful experiences fragmentation you can still do all of that if you know if you want to move liquidity and like build a bridge in application but um you know with this new software sort of Paradigm through General message passing you can move the application logic to where the tokens are execute that logic and then return the result back to the user's wallet okay so I submit it with my wallet on like Cosmos chain the transactions executed on arbitrum and I get results back to my wallet liquidity is not moved it's the interaction that we have you know um within it so you can build it gives you kind of a you know you know an ethereum right that I think everybody knows that evm is sort of touring complete right means that you can build anything and so with General message passing it sort of sort of incomplete way to compose you know chains and ecosystems that you can build anything in you know bridging could be one of the applications if you really feel like it but it doesn't get you the same level of experience yeah exactly you were going to ask something yeah I mean I think that right now the user experience that is most familiar to most users most capital is like the evm like the metamask nurses safe type experience right um that's primarily an experience that you want you know you want to be able to give um so like when you interact with sommelier you don't you know you don't know about the cosmo side really as a user of really the real and the same thing will be true for our arbitrim strategies right like you'll interact with all of them from metamask you'll you know it'll feel like a complete it always feels like a completely native arbitrim or uh experience but you're getting all of these benefits sort of behind the scenes and I think that that kind of application Paradigm and you think about how much more accessible it makes everybody uh it to how to be able to like embed like we need to be able to move away from this like current world where like when you want to do something like every time you want to like access something new in blockchain it's like okay I gotta like learn a new wallet learn a new ecosystem learn new block explorers learn everything right it's too much um the similier version of multi-chain has been like you get all you get on you're getting these enormous benefits of that just get expressed as better yields from the multi-chain world but you're just like your user experience what you know you know you can go look at a similier strategy on D Bank see where the assets are allocated you can you know you can your transactions are all on either scan you know this is what the world would people want

arbitrant part of this conversation from the from the arbitrum perspective uh if you could if you if one could speak for the protocol why would the arbitrim protocol be interested in this like what's exciting from the arbitrary side of things yeah I think from a from a technology perspective you know I think it's all about access which is I don't want to repeat the the points have been made but the idea is there are different um ecosystems with different properties and allow you to do different things and the question is are these siled uh or can you access one from another and you know to zacky's point um you have the sommelier I'll let you there just kidding you have a similier um um Cosmos chain and that that has some really nice capabilities for example I think you know one of the things that I that I'm uh uh most excited about is the ability to ingest private data and use that to inform these strategies and um now the question is um do you have these strategies you have this data these strategies what can you access there I think that's where axelr is helping oh now you can access the artwork from ecosystem you can access this as well and um you know fundamentally um you know bridging is is is really really important and actually so I'll talk about the arbitrary roll-up bridge for a second um many people don't know this but that's also just the bridge between the native bridge theory of an arbitrum is a general message passing passing Bridge which most people you just use to bridge tokens but obviously there's a lot more uh to explore when you when you look at General message passing uh be in between ethereum and orbitrim would be in other ecosystems and um yeah I think some of the real really important value here in connecting these different chains in these different Technologies is not being siled and having the ability to uh via you know securely that's the key word here and that's where the you know um you know the questions you're asking David um uh of course and I think that's uh you know us is sergey's focus here is to securely be able to to Bridge and access these different ecosystems because uh you know just two things one is like there are different levels of expressiveness different ideas what you can do you know what you can do with private data you wouldn't necessarily be able to do directly in in these ecosystems also the idea that you just want to access multiple ecosystems from your strategy I think these are all really important I think from um you know the orbital uh from technology perspective it's nice to have uh to be open and accessible from from these different environments and and also I'll just say one more thing on a multi-chain uh you know on a multi-chain vision that I have which is you know we get very focused here or I get very focused on like you know the values that I care about which is you know security and decentralization and that's obviously what led to a lot of decisions that um off chain made early on when it was you know initially designing the arbitration technology or I was doing back when I was with Ed and Harriet Princeton um that doesn't mean though that we have to ignore the fact that there are others that make different decisions and I'm not talking about um any of us here I'm talking about some other say other layer ones or other layer twos that have different properties um they can have different values and different decisions that allow them to make a different set of trade-offs throughout it's all trade-offs so they're always pros and cons but the idea of being able to uh talk to each other is still valuable right you don't always have to be so maxy and say it's either you believe in our set of values and and and and interact here or else you know get away from us it's like no okay you have you know this environment there's this other environment and um there's different set of properties in them maybe Express to this expressivist maybe security but can we Bridge these and I think the axolar Via you know is is uh you know one of the great great a great project that's working on exact he's solving this problem and similier is uh one of the first users or the perhaps the first user of this particular integration that's showing the power that can happen when you um Grant this access from one ecosystem to another so the image that I have in my mind about how this is I I try and turn these into like visual metaphors just because I understand those better and so we have the uh the ethereum multi-layer 2 landscape I always kind of view as a tree with a tree trunk as the base layer and then it branches out to the layer twos and then a layer three is on top of that and then we have the philosophically aligned version of the cosmos mesh Network app chain system which is like a like a like a bush or like a mycelial network my ceiling network is a really important metaphor because what I'm seeing with axelr here is that we are actually seeing the first cross connections the first Bridges being made between the arbitrum layer two and the cosmos Master Network I don't know if you call it layer one but the flat landscape of chains uh and so uh this and in Sergey correct me if I'm wrong but the idea here is that this starts with GMP the general message passaging it starts with data as perhaps just like these small thread of connection that connects these two endpoints but I'm assuming that it grows from there and it becomes a more robust than just data and can the the actual threads can actually combine in a more robust way that's my intuition uh can you reflect on the accuracy of that metaphor and maybe perhaps they can make it a little more tangible for us yeah no so you're right right like so kind of a the data itself that you can pass right can be like I said sort of arbitrary right uh and so when I guess like when you when you talk about reinforcing what can be done is that where you know this is where we rely on Builders like Somalia right to actually build the application logic into that data right so you know performing those types of uh you know cross-chain calls um you know an actual will help you um uh facilitate all of the communication in parallel right I guess just just to add one more thing to I think what Stephen said right like I think why it's important um you know to interoperate these ecosystems is to really allow Innovation to continue to happen across the software Stacks right I think we're still in the early days I think there's still a lot of decisions to be made on how to scale there's still a lot of decisions to be made like how evm should evolve a lot of decisions how Cosmos should evolve right and so the interoperability between that means that you know you know you can innovate serve any way that you want within Cosmos stack you can innovate any way you like your application within the arbitrum stack right but they can all still be kind of composable and and talk to one another and uh yeah kind of as more Cosmos chains right like use the sort of the axle for the general message passing you know you can think of them as more connections being made right through the axiller and that axle helps facil data with arbitrum so lots of data passing and arbitrary you have a lot of applications that can consume the data from all of the cosmos ecosystem through you know what we call like as a Gateway smart contract so you can talk to one contract and you have access to you know now like or hundreds right of Cosmos chains for free essentially right so that's and kind of a one connection but many to many on both sides of the equation correct me if I'm wrong but I think the way that this works is that if you can connect an evm chain like arbitrum to a non-evm chain like anything in Cosmos uh can't you do anything like you that's those are just two language types like you could do other language types as well correct correct yeah we've already working with a lot of you know different uh layer ones right so Stellar you know uh we're working with kind of sweet right like the capital so integration so pretty much anything that um yeah kind of has a smart contract capabilities can connect with EXO and that was one of our requirements right uh as we were designing the protocols to make sure we can plug and play interoperability right so don't require any changes from layer one or Layer Two be able to come in and just serve a plug and play make sure the protocol is like as light as possible you know requires as little effort as possible to integrate and uh you know again like um that's very important I think in this phase of the ecosystem to allow Innovation to happen across languages across settlement layers right across consensus protocols um and having this server Plug and Play approach that you can talk with you know any different language or virtual machine is um you know pretty important and that's what we're following okay so I hate to get fixated on the bridge conversation but just like remind me one more time about the security model for axillar and how it's compared to to bridges in the past like we've seen the the Wormhole hack we've seen The Nomad hack we've seen the Ronin Bridge hack uh we have cross Chain Bridge hack PTSD and so I really want to just like drill down into this like what's the security model for axlr and what's this defense against uh something like this yeah so security models that Excel compared to a lot of the protocols that you mentioned is actually fully decentralized Network right so it's not relying on a small like multi-sig like three out of five or whatever was the the Ronin hack where the keys got compromised right it's a decentralized network where you have lots of validators that are collectively process in all the cross chain messages right and so what that means is that you know from a security side you have security that backs you know the same model as backs a lot of like layer wants on their own right so layer ones have a decentralized validator set that sort of secures and processes and you get security through you know having a consensus right and so that's what Axel is it's a kind of a security through a decentralized open and you know permissionless validator set augmented with a lot of robust engineering and a lot of like application layer you know security features right like right like rate limits if you want to do a bridging application right or things like that but it all starts at the very core which you know you have to have the right sort of decentralized design to be able to diversify software deployments to be able to uh you know encourage as many participants as possible and not have a close you know multi-save between a few people so does that that makes it sound uh something similar to like Ren protocol where it was a decentralized network of uh of nodes along with a native token that would do a lot of cross-train infrastructure it's spiritually are we in the correct area yeah so I haven't looked at like the rental design I mean I'm not sure if they're validated participation was fully decentralized that anybody could actually join and anybody could participate um but but yes like you know in principle if that's what they're doing then yes okay cool okay and so like the the the main question is like man like why didn't we get here sooner so uh I mean the the a lot of the Cross chain layer uh cross train Bridges were just like multi-cigs right and so kind of egregious in hindsight um but really just seems to be the the main the main big novel Parts about axelar is that it's hooked into a pre-existing ecosystem that stood the test of time being IBC and Cosmos uh and it's leveraged this General messaging as like the base level of cross-chain bridging and then it's it's done just a lot of I'm assuming technical engineering lifts to get to the point where it's been able to connect the evm to IBC and then also all the other chains so this is my mental model of uh so far as a result of this episode is that right yeah I think that that sums it up um yeah and I think you know the one thing that I just want to add right is that kind of even if you have General message paths and or things like that you still have to think about how do you build the types of application experiences that we talk about right so when you know when when a user submits a transaction somewhere like how do you make sure it actually gets executed on arbit term right who's going to pay gas there and things like that and so you know we've augmented kind of the the network itself with a lot of services that allow you to do those things right and so um I think the developer experience building in a multi-chain world is very very different you have you know asynchronous message passing and you have execution on the remote chains and things like that so you actually have to build you know a lot of services around these um core protocols to make sure the experience is like as seamless as possible right and that sort of you know the the final piece that we're working on is is uh actually building the types of tooling that developers needs to build these types of applications and sunny if we can uh put the cosmos hat on just how would you when we Zoom all the way back out and view Cosmos both as a um an ecosystem of many many chains and also a long-term project that started I think sometime in like 2016 or 2017. what what does this technology mean for Cosmos how does it fit into the whole Cosmos Vision so I mean there's no one Cosmos Vision but my Cosmos vision is has always been the sort of Cosmos ethereum merger Vision right um you know the success of ethereum l2's arbitrum op stack have kind of brought the like toolkit for building blockchains uh Innovation Marketplace that Cosmos already is conceived of to the ethereum ecosystem um the and you know there's also you know with eigenwair things like ideas of like sort of subsetted validator sets you know uh uh uh like sort of uh you know partial you know shared security all of these things so like there's just been this General sort of convergence that I've believed in for a really long time of you know Cosmos ideas ethereum ideas into the one like ultimately like we're not here to I'm not I don't care if like Adam is about is like the most valuable token or or like what the price of eat this like ultimately we're here to build a sec like a a secure infrastructure for for the entire world right that's the ultimate goal and so to me it's always been about like how do you blend these like all of these different technology ideas to get to that and so like to me the vision is Plasma's ethereum it's all one thing uh ultimately for the users um and the users are just getting like robust secure Financial Primitives and other you know interactions transactional derivatives um that like they couldn't get anywhere else um and so you know in the Ordinary World if you wanted to have something like you know sommelier you'd be you know sending your money to a hedge fund um and instead you have like a decentralized secure system that like protects its users um from like strategists going you know off the rails doing anything malicious um it's actually able to have a coherent security model but allows for extracting Alpha that you wouldn't be able to get it Stephen part of the uh the recent uh arbitrum announcement was not only the launch of the arbitrim Dao that made everyone very excited but um the idea of multiple arbitrome Trains being built in a stack uh and so we got layer twos and we got the layer threes and everyone loves all the chains uh how just from now that arbitrim is on like kind of the receiving end of some lier gosh I'm so sorry Zaki uh song and and the interoperability efforts from from axillar is there like how is all of these chains going to interoperate with the axillar bridge and overall what is the net in that effect upon Arboretum uh AKA like why is this bullish for arbitrine yeah so so a few things uh to be said well I think you know just getting um you know more access to arbitrum you know I think the fact that just starting off with arbitrary is very you know it's a good sign for for our trim and you know the strength of the ecosystem and that's where you know a lot of the strong Defy is so you know it's it's exciting to see that the decision has made to expand to arbitrim first but when it comes to the um l2s and other l3s so yeah that's a great question which is like so how do those fit into the to the bridging uh environment if I understand and then like um how how basically you know will they use axillar or something else so um the answer is like oh I think a little bit of both um you know there is some particularly when it comes to layer three chains arbiting morbid chains there is um the ability for these things to talk to together a little more natively um so to actually have some native uh interactions so in a roll-up for example an orbitrum you know then there there's a there's a few out there that says all rolled up sorry is a is a bridge right so um you know there's just like uh one of the framings of what Roll-Ups are or what chains are even more generally and um you know so there is you know the arbitrum obviously has a direct bridge to to ethereum um and one of the interesting things though is um okay but what about these other change what about true R which would change right today there's already one opportunity no but can they talk together so today they don't talk together um better than that right they can talk together via ethereum so there is room and there are these fast bridging solutions that go ahead and talk to one another um you know can bridge that Gap I think over time um there are opportunities to develop technology that can allow different layer threes to talk together um more broadly or differently or twos to talk together um uh more you know more directly connected but you will have that will always only be like you know the same family and Technology but if you want to reach past that say to get to the cause or ecosystem say to get to the um you know our ecosystems you're going to need interoperability solutions that don't have those same native properties and or don't have those same native abilities and those were I think are we going to be very important one other thing we know which I would all mention which I think is very interesting um not to digress too much into the uh into the optimistic uh or the roll-up Wars but what really one thing that comes up a lot with Roadhouse people like to talk about the benefits between like different types of Roll-Ups and bridging is one of those that comes up right away you know people say well ZK rolled UPS have a faster bridging which is which is uh you know which is true right if the proofs are faster it's not instant it's usually hours to today's hours to half a day or so depending on the robot but I think what people miss and what this show actually highlights is that's looking at a very very narrow bridging uh example right when you talk about bridging from ethereum to a roll-up um people like to focus very much but in a multi-chain world or a cross chain world or whatever the term you want to use um both DK Roll-Ups are not optimistic Roll-Ups or any type of world that want to access other ecosystems or other or go across the boundary not just to the chain that they're built on are going to have to rely on other other bridging uh Technologies um they could be more native they can be third-party Technologies they can be axlr um and they're all going to be kind of thing important to this to this big ecosystem so um you know from an off chain technology perspective I think you know interoperability is the frontier right now and this is uh very very exciting to uh to see today's announcement well Zachy Steven Sergey I really appreciate you guys uh walking me through the the story here and so Sergey I'll let you end it here uh if listeners are peaked and they want to learn more about this maybe they're a developer and they want to open up the docs or they're just a user and they want to use uh where out they go yeah I mean I think a good starting point is just to go to excel.network website you know and from there you can find links to Discord we have you know developer channels uh um and you can find links to the docs so it's docs.axel.dev and you can take it from there awesome guys thank you so much for joining me here on the show today like always bankless Nation risk and disclaimers crypto is risky eth is risky D5 is risky cross-chain Bridges probably are still risky yeah at least they are headed in the right direction you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
