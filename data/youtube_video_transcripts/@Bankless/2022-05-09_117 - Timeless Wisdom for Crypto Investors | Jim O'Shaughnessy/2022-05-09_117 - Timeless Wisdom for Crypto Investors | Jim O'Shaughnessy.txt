everyone on this planet is running human os and if you're running human os you're gonna fall for this unless you figure out a way to make that impossible welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys today we've got a special treat we're talking timeless wisdom for crypto and investors these are the things we need to know we've got jim o'shaughnessy who is an expert in investing and comes to us with some fantastic ideas we can implement in crypto a few things you should take away number one you suck at investing and be real with you and jim makes the case as to why not just you so do i so does everyone number two how to short circuit this monkey brain that we're dealing with jim calls it human os there are all sorts of traps we can fall into and we need short circuits and number three some really tactical hacks we got at least 10 of them maybe a dozen actual tips for how you can avoid crypto fomo and fear uncertainty and doubt and maximize your long-term gains david this was a once kind of a very wise and practical episode what were some of your thoughts yeah i was completely reminded of this uh one book that i read called devil takes the hindmost and it was a it was just a book about the history of financial bubbles going as far back as financial bubbles existed and the the main takeaway that i learned from reading that book was that you know it's there's one common denominator to all markets no matter what asset class no matter what decade no matter what century and that common denominator is human dna like humans perceive value and that's what comes to define markets and so like jim has seen many markets across many decades and so he has just like wisdom he just has seen a lot of markets and has seen the same patterns play out through all markets and so while crypto it's a new paradigm it's a new technology we're going to change the world it's still going it's still operating on what jim calls human os and so there are still going to be the same tricks the same traps uh and the same things to know to make sure that you can actually navigate through markets because crypto is not different it's just another market it's just the structure is different yeah absolutely and that's why this conversation with jim is so valuable and there's so many things that crypto investors can actually learn from traditional investing because to your point david it ain't changed i mean we're still the same human beings and we're going to make the same mistakes as traditional investors and so he gets right to the heart of it david i'm really excited uh to record the debrief with you though because there are some other quibbles that we probably have about like i some bones to pick actually yeah some asset allocation and like whether crypto is a store of value and these sorts of things but guys if you are a premium subscriber of bank list did you know you get an extra podcast that is the recap that we do after all of

the founder and chairman and co-cio of o'shaughnessy asset management they've got over six billion in assets under management that number could be up uh outdated jim i'm not sure how many you guys have now yeah it is outdated it's uh like seven and a half billion now ah there you go keeps going up uh up only and uh jim has decades of investing experience in a world of crypto uh like podcast and investing where many of us have mere years so we are looking uh at gym to tell us some timeless investing wisdom something that would last us in crypto for the long haul i think jim we want to cover three different things in a few sections so the first is what's changed with investing throughout your decades of experience like you know some trends some changes that you've identified maybe different seasons of investing and and kind of fundamentals and narrative and then secondly what stayed the same that might be actually an even more interesting conversation to have and then lastly what does all this mean for a crypto investor uh as most of the bankless audience are like we're kind of getting into crypto now many are young many uh have their first investing experience in in crypto and actually don't know uh investing in the traditional outside world so that's what we want to cover does that sound good sounds great all right um let's start here though first we'd love to hear a bit about how you learned to invest in your early years what did that look like for you jim so uh let me take you back to the paleolithic era before internet where like if you wanted to do something you actually had to go to the library i i could i don't have it handy but i could put up the uh cover of my first brochure which took like four months to do because i had to physically go to the marble uh query to take the pictures because i wanted it to look really cool and and then after getting the one i liked i had a design firm an entire design firm try to work it in we can't do that we you know i i was telling him what i wanted three months later it looks okay but like you do it now one second done so um so when i really started to learn and became passionate and a bit obsessive about investing uh was in the late 1970s early 1980s so i was a teenager uh 19 in 1979 and then a young guy who got married young and then a young dad so uh i had people who had to put up with all my craziness so um i found a library i used to live in saint paul minnesota i found a great research library called the james j hill library where they had literally all the data literally all of it the problem was was getting it from here to there and you guys probably have never even seen one but they used to have big big spreadsheets paper spreadsheets that were like this long and so you could have i can't remember like 18 rows across and 50 rows down and so i started uh with the dow because just 30 stocks and i'm you know uh legendarily lazy so uh start start it there uh but it was all by hand literally and and so then i got every book that i could find on investing and and i read all the ones that most people do you know securities analysis by uh graham and dodd the individual investor by ben graham himself just on and on and started to build a thesis around investing which was that the biggest problem in investing is that people are probably looking at the wrong things and back then again paleolithic era everybody just talked about people right so my i had my aha moment when i was invited finally uh to the big dinner when my uncles and aunts were in town uh and you had to be a certain age to go to the grown-up table and i was so excited because like anyway so there's 14 of us uh around the table and my father and my uncle were having this like really intense discussion and fight about ibm and its prospects and i listened and didn't commit and uh just kept listening and i just noted it was all just talking about the ceo that was it they were not talking about what its earnings were how much you had to pay for it what its prospects were and so i finally interject it and and i'm like you know uncle john who was more uh on this than my dad i think uh that's totally wrong and he's like oh okay well so enlighten me um and as you know well if you might not know if you're if you're at a mostly irish uh families table and there are 14 people there's probably a minimum of 20 opinions and so so but it gave it gave me that push that first push right and it's like i think they're wrong but i might be wrong so let me do let's go to the videotape as the old sportscaster used to say and thus was my first uh dive into empiricism and now call systematic or quantitative investing jim i'm wondering what the context or like zeitgeist was around society and investing at the time because if you're telling me that you had to go to the library and go through like these cumbersome uh like documents to get an edge to like do your research that seems to be that you were doing it uh if it was hard then you were doing things that other people weren't doing and that it reminds me of like the early days of crypto where learning and researching and like evaluating things was just there was no consensus about these things and so there were only people carving their own path was that what it was like and how how easy was it for you to like generate your own like understanding and models for for how to invest back then so that's a great question david and um it it speaks to the zeitgeist of that era every era has its own zeitgeist right and and that era because we were coming off the worst bear market 1972 through the end of 1974 for stocks since the great depression inflation was rampant sounds familiar um and like literally so i was like 21 right so all of my contemporaries said you know are you out of your [ __ ] mind why would you be interested in stocks stocks are for widows and and orphans i mean the the real money is in hard assets so like all of my contemporaries were going into real estate they were going into commodity trading they were investing and trying to figure out how to get into hard assets and uh so the the attitude toward stocks was just grim i mean it was like everyone thought i was crazy to be interested in stocks and like i gave the the standard well you know they seem to have done pretty well over the last century so i think that they'll come back but the the question always also highlights something that anticipates your question on what's changed it was really hard to get good actual data to study and most people did not if you go back like i i was reminiscing with a friend about there used to be a very popular show called wall street week with louis rukizer and so i watched the one that they did right after the crash of 1987. i turned to my wife and i'm like that world no longer exists and like it was because everything they were people were still basing their actions on what their broker told them to do and and i used the term specifically broker now we've seen a huge change to registered investment advisors who who um like their pitch and everything is very different than a broker's right so brokers were there by this why because it's going to go up why because i said so and and basically even like supposedly sophisticated like corporate pension plans they had no idea how their money was being managed in fact the first company i started at australia capital management started as a consultant and it was because i uh had done a lot of research by this time i finally had computers so it made it a little easier and uh so i had come to the conclusion which i wrote extensively about in my first book invest like the best that you could clone any manager you want it to by not paying attention to what they say but paying attention to what they do what they do is accessible in their portfolio so i would take their portfolios put them on a huge database of stocks and suck out the most relevant factors right and it gave us what was at the time called normal portfolios in other words the portfolio had the same characteristics as the manager and so a the the pension finally got to see are they doing what they tell us they do and again spoiler alert most weren't uh and and secondly um are are they the manager adding value through their trading right through their buying and selling throughout the year um we got about three years into that and that's what i decided holy [ __ ] i got to become an active manager because the so-called clone portfolios were killing the managers that they cloned and my my my thesis was that's because like the old pogo cartoon suggests we we've met the enemy and it's us so that got me involved in the whole human nature stuff and i mean like i've been studying that ever since and it's just so remarkably clear that well our world has dramatically sped up our access to good high quality information it's the highest it's ever been in my lifetime and things like uh crypto great example um so invented it had it had a thesis supported by a white paper um i like the little razzmatazz of it being a anonymous uh uh white paper but but it had it already had the the part the defense of the thesis built into that white paper back when i was doing it no way so so people like and this sounds weird but it's true like you might the highest indicator of who you might hire as a money manager again you were like a pension guy was who you golfed with and so like th that world i think for the better is is gone so jim there's so so much to uh unpack there and i think we're like hinting at uh you know the conversation to come on this podcast but i've already gleaned one learning lesson for us that that is probably timeless in crypto is you have to put in the work that's the edge right because there's a lot of people who are looking at crypto and not putting in the work right now and if you want to make outsized returns and outperform them you can't just like watch youtube videos and just consume bank lists do consume bank lists but you also have to put in the work uh the the maybe one of the more timeless lessons that you alluded to that we'll get to later is also that uh humans it sounds like they kind of suck at investing like we want to talk about that a little bit sure i think uh encrypted there's no exception but first yeah you talked about the um the the zeitgeist of the era in kind of the 1970s when you entered and i want like you've seen some decades so you've probably seen different zeitgeist different narratives different movements and uh you know many as i said in the intro many of us in crypto we've been here for years like and when i mean here is investing yeah uh and we haven't seen decades play out so we haven't experienced the paradigm shifts of different zeitgeist and different narratives and different investing temperaments and i'm i'm wondering what you think about on this topic of how has investing change is kind of like how has the narrative changed across generations like we growth versus meme versus value uh investments and what are all of these things one um illustration that comes to mind is a chart and i'll show it on screen for people who are watching on youtube but if you could visualize this forest gym so it's tesla versus the market cap of all of these other car companies all right tesla market cap one trillion dollars all right every other single uh like car company combined the market cap of that is less than tesla it's 0.9 trillion dollars okay so that's top line oh it's not top line sorry that's market cap that's valuation of these assets but if you look at the gross revenue tesla is 53 billion dollars in gross revenue and all of the other companies combined it's like 1.6 trillion right so there's a mismatch here what era are we in jim how does this even make sense so um great question um and let's take a step back and say if you study all the various eras of mostly stock and bond investing but it includes real estate all that kind of stuff what what happens is that my thesis around markets all markets are that they're complex adaptive systems with feedback loops and that they work very very well when beliefs of participants are heterogeneous in other words i may have some apple stock that i want to sell because i want to help set up a college fund for my grandson you might have want to buy something for your children if you have them or anticipating them um and both of us are right right in terms of if you're just looking at it from a transaction point of view we're not both right about the price but we're both right about my reason for selling makes a lot of sense your reason for buying makes a lot of sense so that's the majority of markets market environments and in those kind of market environments uh markets are amazing they they clear and you run into trouble when you when you hit on uh one of these crazes okay and what happens is those feedback loops speed up and they create what i call information waterfalls and what are they information waterfalls are are just a a a fire hose of information hitting your perception field but with all the same story all the same story and so what you see over time is that investors expectations move from heterogeneous to homogeneity in other words everyone's thinking the same thing what most people don't quite understand is this is the way it has always worked i mean you go back to the south sea trading company and isaac newton losing his entire fortune in it and the reason for that was what i just described everybody they got the information a lot slower but they still got it and they he got hit with so many oh my god saucy is going to make everyone a millionaire everyone a millionaire everyone a millionaire and and so if you if you looked at the chart of the south sea company it looks like the nasdaq uh prior to the crash the dot bom crash and then afterwards so so so this chart pattern basically you see it everywhere where a craze uh or what like a mine virus takes over so it starts back there uh you know fast forward to the united states we're the biggest market so there's a lot of examples here railroad stocks i mean people who think that like tesla is overvalued go back and look at how they valued some of these railroad stocks i mean they were totally insane and yet people kept believing the story they were telling themselves right i am smart because this brand new technology is going to be revolutionary there is a really important lesson if you're if the object of investors desire is an innovation and a technology that's when they get super super whipped up about saying it's still early and you know i could give you a million examples but i'll give you three so um rca radio came out right so you got to remember before radio like you listen to other people talk that was it so radio comes out and everyone is like holy [ __ ] this is amazing so they ran rca's radio corporation of america's stock up to a price that was priced not only for perfection but for deification and when when the when the ultimate reckoning came and we'll get to that part later that's the not fun part uh but rca never got went higher than that price of 1929. warner brothers the movie company they went up 600 percent in one year why talkies and so our human reaction to these new technologies seems very predictable we get super excited about it and by the way it's not wrong that we're super excited about it because we're often right about the ultimate thing right like this is this bad boy is rewiring our minds right now and it's very powerful and it's very cool but jim is holding up a cell phone for the podcast and but but so you know rinse repeat and and every era has uh an idea right that becomes dominant as well so back then it was all the tech right and it's hard to it's kind of funny to think about uh tech as radio and talking pictures but this is how far we've come but another narrative like the one uh discussed earlier is like stocks will never go up again uh you know bonds will never go down you know and that's just idiocy if you if you take the time to do a little bit of homework you can see that like we all think that we're we're different than other generations no we're not we know more but there's still so much more we have to learn and and so many lack the humility of understanding how little they really know and that's why like one of the things that i base all of my stuff on is evidence right i directionally more times than not i'm right that's about as good as i can get for you directionally more times than not i'm right well that's quite an edge and and so it also has the ability to negate as to mean stocks so this is one where people you'll like after this comes out you'll get lots of angry comments uh and that is because the evidence suggests that price follows narrat or sorry narrative follows price not the other way around and so obviously the from from the stock market the the good example is the meme stocks right and all these people with their diamond hands and all that kind of stuff and like i was talking to a another guy's a writer on my age and he's been an investor as long as i haven't you know uh he's like so uh what do you think of the whole uh you know amc thing and i'm like well i i said i feel really bad because there's a lot of earnest people and i really do mean this young people especially a lot of earnest young people who want to learn about how to invest which i think which i'm massively in favor of uh being manipulated because you know the chat rooms right uh wall street bets and all that kind of stuff if you don't understand that there weren't probably a dozen employees of some of the biggest hedge funds in there under assumed names you you need to maybe splash some water in your face in the old days that was called painting the tape so william harriman who was a railroad baron but was also a really good stock speculator a syndicate which is what they used to call people uh in the 20s that poured money together to try to manipulate the market essentially uh came to him and they said to to herrmann can you get the stock i can't remember the name of this company but can you get the stock of xyz which was then at 100. can you get that to 120 that's where we really want to sell and harryman goes no way he goes on the other hand i can move it to 200 and you can sell it on the way down he intuitively understood that a 20 move doesn't ignite anyone's passion or imagination a hundred percent move back then did and so the the whole um diamond hands thing all of that that was a highly manipulated market and there were people from those hedge funds who wanted to punish each other playing a very different game and and the narrative just writes itself david vs goliath like so stories work really well in explaining what happened right if you if you want to explain what will happen oh that gets a lot harder to do but if that that one was just so juicy and so i guess the takeaway that i would offer your listeners and watchers is if you get enticed by a story don't say oh that's just a story and that's being manipulated go back to your original point do some homework say okay this story seems to be here and now that i know uh what that old guy that they had on uh their podcast said i'm going to look into like whose benefits and and who doesn't and you know the simple rule is follow the money and like when you do that it you might become a little bit disillusioned so that's that's what i guess i would say about that bankless listeners there's so there's two lessons that we just heard there that i think is incredibly relevant and applicable to everyone who is doing anything in crypto which is this narrative follows the price not the other way around okay so when you're looking at narrative uh investing in all of these assets that that are pumping based on the narrative realize that the price influences these things something we can come back to and also let's not be naive painting the tape as jim is calling it happens all of the time in crypto it just happens with a youtuber who's talking about a specific cryptocurrency or a twitter thread or an anon who is you know is is pumping their bags in various ways so let's not be naive to these facts but jim i do want to go back to this tesla thing just for just for a second because what's super weird about this is like you know people who went to uh business school or like the traditional investing sort of thing is how do you value a stock well it's price to earnings ratio right and that's how you value a stock and so but like we see the price to earnings of all of these car companies exceeding tesla and yet tesla is an order of magnitude higher in terms of value and i'm asking you about this like are fundamentals dead or is this just another narrative that we've told ourselves right now and by by the way this is this is true in in stocks and equities of course but we also see this playing out in in the crypto world where there are assets in crypto we we might say look at look at these look at these uh revenue inflows from it look how much cash is being generated from this particular d5 protocol or this particular asset uh but that seems very disconnected from the reality of of the market caps of these things and what's actually going up in price is this just an error that we're in where fundamentals don't matter and do you think we'll reset to the meme so um i let me preface it by saying i i i can only speak to my personal experience in markets and additionally studying prior markets before i was around so it's different this time right that's that's the that's the call that's the the thing that gets people really excited my thesis is that as long as human beings price securities or crypto or whatever asset class this is ubiquitous to and it's applicable to all asset classes as long as human beings determine ultimately their price um you're always going to have situations like this we i have seen it personally just so many times that you know you you get this when when you see a pattern endlessly throughout your career your intuition gets very imbued with understanding that pattern and so i'll just give you several examples in the late 1960s one of the most speculative decades for stocks since the 20s they had a thing called the nifty 50. the nifty 50 were 50 stocks that essentially serious or apparently serious-minded analysts said buy them at any price because these 50 stocks are gonna like always rule well they were the consensus stocks yep and you know i you don't even have to be terribly bright to go to the end of this story um they got absolutely hammered in the correction and bear market actual bear market in 1973-74 flash forward to um oil when oil was crazy in the in the late 70s early 80s everybody was buying every oil stock that they could do you know multiples be damned oil because we were running out of it every magazine was screaming peak oil we're going to run out of oil in 20 years the world is going to be completely without oil right and so like i went i did an exercise i went through what was then called the pink sheets uh which were stocks that didn't weren't worth enough to get listed on an exchange and in under a week i i'd highlighted all of the stocks that were trading under a buck right so under one dollar in under a week there was not a single one trading under a dollar okay so guess what happened after that [Laughter] they they realized that uh maybe those predictions that the pessimistic journalists like to spread were maybe wrong um and then of course let's come up to the the granddaddy of all similar things to what we're seeing right now was the dot-com craze and you've got to understand and this is so difficult to understand theoretically i'll give you a good example though in in april of 1999 i wrote a piece it's still available somewhere online called the internet contrarian and in this piece i said when the crash comes 85 percent of these companies are going to be carried out feet first they're going to die they're going to go away and then i used amazon as an example of a company that i thought was a winner but i said in the essay but amazon when this happens is going to go down 95 in price that's exactly what happened a year later but here's what's interesting and this is the better part of this story in my opinion i wrote that right based on just data what did i do next i started an internet company [Laughter] you should have been shorting amazon did you do anything exactly exactly but but what i wanted what i want to underline here because it's so hard if you haven't experienced it yourself it's so hard to learn from the example by example our world back then was so mono maniacal about the internet is going to replace everything so don't ever invest in a bricks and mortar company they're dead they're dead don't have anything to do with anything and every every example every lunch you were at even with people you didn't know hey did you see that new store that you don't even have to buy shoes anymore they you'll put your foot on this thing it'll transmit it over the internet and the shoes will come right to you and so like everybody had this fever right and not unlike i think newton and back in the day much slower back then of course you know uh but uh that's another part that's changed the ability for these cycles to to speed up and play on themselves creates these emotionally because these are not intellectual thoughts because remember i had written a piece based on empirical fundamentals that said dead and it has to be right and and so but i was so taken up in this idea of the internet that i started a company net called netfolio which interestingly enough o'shaughnessy asset management now has basically what i was trying to do back then we call it canvas that allows us to in individualize people's portfolios but the point is that that came and the price plunged and suddenly there are all sorts of narratives and this is where the understanding of human beings and by the way me too you too anyone who is running human os unless we have aliens among us like men in black suggests my guess is everyone on this planet is running human os and if you're running human os you're gonna fall for this unless you figure out a way to make that impossible and so the what's gonna happen uh in in crypto i have no idea i have no idea but i can tell you that it seems to me that on the plus side they've tried to kill crypto so often and it hasn't died that's a really interesting sign to me because like back in 1930 whatever fdr decided yeah the gold standard will go broke man so they passed an edict and they literally went house to house with guns give us your gold and we're gonna pay you 35 bucks and we're now going to fix the price of gold and you know that was that we don't live in that kind of world anymore but so so what i believe will happen is that uh as crypto evolves as the various protocols of the blockchain evolve there will be early on uh many many different competing things to your tesla example right and and they each one of those various coins or protocols is going to have what i call true believers true believers and this is very uncharitable of me but they're brain dead they have replaced the thought process with a set of talking points which like you look at the most fundamentalist religion in the world and these guys trump those guys all day long because like because like if you if you are ignoring against the one true faith man it's lucky that we don't have otto de fuzz which is burning at the stake anymore because they'd kill all the heretics that's how passionately they believe but that gets chipped away at until when you start getting a bit of a history which is happening now by the way when you start getting a bit of a history over okay did that work or did that not work right and and people become a little less committed more people come online that like listen to the the uh proselytizer on behalf of that particular coiner protocol but they are not immediately brainwashed they're a little more skeptical and then the whole thing is eventually washes out let's stay with cars in 1900 there were over 200 car companies in america 2 0 0. and by the way about 15 of them were making you guessed it electric cars and so they were all competing they were all doing this and then the big three won and now it's the big one so about the question do fundamentals no longer matter yeah they still matter and but it's going to be a little bit like the famous conversation between hemingway and fitzgerald when when one asks the other you know how did you go bankrupt and it was slowly at first and then suddenly and that's what your price patterns are gonna look like so you're gonna you're gonna be bumping along and it'll run up and that'll get people excited they'll buy some more and then the people who want to get rid of their holdings will you know go down and then and then all the way down and you know so that that's that is an outcome that you really do need to consider um for your particular passion uh whatev whatever that might be but as i said crypto has a lot of interesting things in its favor um and its inability to be killed i think is one of the strongest ones the lesson here of course is that there are dangers when it comes to just consensus in in communities where like if everyone is believing the same thing the opportunity of being the the contrarian in that is perhaps strong but jim i i want to present the devil's argument because there are plenty of times where in examples where the having consensus about something kind of feels like well we all see the same thing and we're all early uh and i mean there was consensus in amongst you know the early bitcoiners if you saw bitcoin between 29 uh 2009 and 2013 all like all the crazy like libertarians who saw bitcoin that early had consensus about it and that was before it was a hundred dollars and the the other trap that i'm seeing is that when we talk about just like these communities that have these same like the thought leaders of every single community have like the same lines and the same tropes about uh how we're all early we're all in on this thing that seems to be uh normal in crypto for every single asset like every single asset has its tribe and you talked about the mind virus right don't get infected by the mind virus well literally the bitcoiners will you will use the phrase like you get infected by the bitcoin mind virus and you never you can never like you know get it out you just are compelled by the bitcoin vision and ryan and i talked about this in uh frequently on the weekly roll up where like crypto is a one-way street like when once you learn about crypto you can't go back like ever everyone has consensus about crypto and then there are different tribes and different communities in crypto some with varying degrees of like tribalism and toxicity some will objectively like lean into these strategies in order to get people on their on their ship others will use more like pragmatic strategies like talking about fundamentals that's what i like to think that we do um but like in crypto there are no there is no absence of tribes and so therefore there is no absence of just complete consensus inside of communities that this is the next big thing and like the thing is that i think some at least one of these communities is going to be right and many of these communities are going to be wrong but some will be right probably over the long term and so i'm wondering if you have just any thoughts or wisdom about how to navigate just like the timing of when these communities uh decide that they're right or not because again if you were 20 2009 to 2013 bitcoin you were super right and there was consensus among those communities and i think that perhaps there's evidence to say that some communities in today's crypto are also going to be like the 2009 to 2013 bitcoiners if they are right about the right thing and so like yes consensus global consensus is like a big like red siren we should be totally scared of that when everyone believes the same thing but also aren't there enough examples to illustrate that well i mean if we pick the right one then we are right right yeah so that's a if you take any logic courses there's a thing called the planted axiom a planted axiom an axiom by its definition is obviously true okay so you don't have to argue about it when you plant an axiom that means you're saying something is obviously true that is not obviously true and and so like if you if you if you study logic a little bit you can see if you can get away with planting an axiom right which is the planet axiom here is that those early guys were were right and they were totally right and look at all the money they made okay that factually that's true right but when you need to you need to do a much deeper dive on that and some good metaphors are wars right so everybody thinks that god is on their side everybody thinks that they are fighting the righteous cause everybody thinks that you know we are the one true faith we are the one to true belief we have access to the truth that others don't have that's why this intertribal rivalries often get so violent in the old days thank god it's mostly just people flaming people on twitter but like in the old days that you killed them you literally killed them because they did not adhere to your belief that was the the definition of a heretic somebody who was like no [ __ ] you uh or an apostate even worse an apostate was somebody who used to believe but then leaves the tribe uh because of his or her insights about what's going on with the tribe the second thing you need to think about is that and and this is a little harder to be honest but i i've always been a big fan of alternate histories right and if you can run enough alternate histories you can see all the times when that original tribe wasn't the winner um and and trying to like getting back to my definition of markets all markets crypto markets included complex adaptive systems complex adaptive systems are very different than simple systems a complex adaptive system all of the innovation and emergence comes from the bottom not from the top so if you get people like the idiots in washington i don't care what party you support if you'd be all the way over here on the left or all the way over here on the right you're wrong and like the the you're you're members of a cult and a mind virus and you know you shout at each other all day and it's ludicrous because the one thing they share is this belief that there is a top down system that will work and we can rule the world this way if we just do it you know this way if you're on the left or if we just do it this way if you're on the right they're both wrong emergent systems which are why things got the way they got right if we weren't in a complex adaptive system society is one if if you have like a couple of things that are also defining of that particular society or system if you have a rule of law and you have the basic freedom for people to do whatever they want well guess what type of country goes to the top of the league table in inventions in material wealth in in in extending rights that would have been thought of as privileges long ago that type of system and so the thing that i would also add is there is a i mean it's just like this is now we're gonna get into why we're so hard to like figure out and why i opted to just tie myself to the mast because i realized that i was going to be just as dumb as everybody else because i'm running human os so so my friend annie duke writes about this really well and and she calls this process resulting in other words let's say you don't think about an underlying process at all you don't look at fundamentals at all you don't you know you you might just be at a party and like your friend shows you this cool coin and you just go and buy it i've heard that many many times all the time right so here's the part that really screws with your head so you do that you're at a party a friend tells you about this new coin you buy it it goes up you immediately say i made a great decision no and my friend's a genius and my friend exactly thank you for adding that um and and so what you've done is you have created a thought process in your mind that is so difficult to reverse and the only way it gets reversed is when you get wiped out because what you're doing is you're saying okay cause a friend genius tells me to buy [ __ ] coin a result i think i make 200 you know in in a month genius genius good good way to do it no i'm reminded of pavlov's dogs right now exactly exactly and like we're listen we are domesticated primates i know people don't like to hear that but that's who we are and like you can program people the same way you can program dogs and and like the it happens and the the challenge there is there's a concept that can break you free of that and it's called base rates what is a base rate a base rate is okay i did i used this process to generate my buy and sells how often did i win and as you go forward in time your base rate gets longer and longer there's a big reason why i'm a big believer in testing historically because you can get massive base rates right and and when you do that you suddenly realize oh buying that [ __ ] coin at that cocktail party was really really stupid maybe i should have a process that is repeatable i'll give you an example and by the way everybody is guilty of this me too you guys all of our your listeners we're all guilty if we're a human being because that's the way human os runs we haven't had an upgrade to human os in a long long time and unless you are very skilled at meta programming it's going to be hard for you to have an upgrade so uh you put up a chart it's 1968 and you show for the last five years if you had just bought the stocks with the highest gain in sales right so their sales went up the highest uh over the previous five years right and then you looked at the results like just smoked everything else like they were 28 per year first like the market was at 10 right and then if you really want to add some symmetry let's add what happened to the ones that had declines in sales like nothing t-bills right and people are looking at this and they they're looking at it and they're thinking well that's a process not enough time right because first off does that make intuitive sense that you're going to buy the stock that just doubles its sales keeping everything else equal i don't know could what i would be driven to is huh that's an interesting idea let's test it and that's what i did tested it all the way back to 1927. that was a highly anomalous cherry-picked period where that actually happened you look at the long period of consistently buying the stocks that whose sales go up the most return is less than t bills so so there are just so many mind traps and other traps waiting for we gullible naive humans to fall into them you ever see the simpsons episode where uh the krusty the clown everywhere he turns he steps on a rake and it's it's shown from like up here it gets to the rake and he he's just surrounded by rakes we're a little bit surrounded by rakes and and i do not advocate that people beat themselves up over making mistakes like everyone makes mistakes i made a [ __ ] ton of mistakes uh over my career so rather than like beating yourself up over that mistake learn from it say oh you know what maybe maybe he's right maybe if i could start building out my own ideas about why this particular coin or this particular blockchain or this particular process is going to work better you'll you'll at least keep your mind in that keeping the mind open zone what we often do again all of us including me we often go looking for it's called motivated reasoning when i want to buy crypto because i want to get rich really fast my reasoning is motivated by that and i only go looking for reasons why i'm gonna get rich by buying crypto right and i block out or reinterpret all of the reasons that are out there that are legitimate reasons for why that might not happen and when you add in the research on how unreliable our memories are um it's a perfect storm man it's like our memories the brain thinks it's doing us a kindness and what it does is it upgrades our memories to make them consistent with what we believe now and we don't make us feel good exactly and and so like if you if we swung the camera over here you'd see boxes and boxes and boxes of journals that i've been keeping since i was 18 years old and when you do that you you realize that uh well i would never be that dumb and then you go back to like 1989 and read what you wrote and i was [ __ ] i was that dumb [Laughter] this is so great jim this is like exactly i think what we need to hear and i just want to you know link this because all of the terms you're using we use in in crypto right now and we we can identify all the patterns you you talk about you talk about survival ship bias um you know there's also this term uh that crypto often uses of like fomo fear of missing out right and so many crypto investors get caught up in the fomo of whatever whatever narrative is is popular also many fall into the trap of becoming brain dead maximalists where they only have one view of the world and they can't escape it um but i think the bottom line is this like some things have changed in investing right and you have different eras and different zeitgeist and and narratives that are popular but actually more has stayed the same and the thing that stayed the same is we're all still a bunch of monkeys with human os yeah and like a question to you listener is like would you let a monkey handle your investing decisions because if you're making them that's what you're doing effectively and so you've begun to provide a glimpse for us jim of kind of the way out maybe these are like quantitative methods right uh you know and i i think what we're looking for is some some practical tips on how we short-circuit human os if we're if we're ready to come to terms with the fact that we're all kind of [ __ ] at investing right now and then crypto included we might have some good ideas from time to time but like we're not really good at controlling all of the cognitive human psychology biases we have well what are some hacks what are some tricks that we can learn to actually short circuit and create some process create some guard rails in place so we don't screw it up and one that you mentioned that seems super practical is like the base rate method where you're like doing active logs of what you're doing and over a a long enough time frame you can actually go back in time and see the mistakes you made where you were right where you were wrong you could go into that a little bit another method that we advocate often on bank list is just like dollar cost average in you know if there's an asset that you think is going to appreciate in the long run and you you you know you slept on it you've thought about it you've done your research you've done your deep dive like you don't necessarily have to buy all in now you could just dollar cost average in over time and that's kind of a human psych trick that that works for many listeners but how can we get out of this how do we short-circuit human os and not screw this whole crypto opportunity up yeah so that's a that is a the ongoing and eternal question and what i have come to uh believe is that there is no one you know external strategy that works for everybody right so so my solution of being an entirely a quant right it negates all of my emotions because i obviously i built the model right but once i've built the model then i set the research team on improving the model right because you're always going to be able to improve no model is always right right again what i said at the beginning directionally over you know seemingly a majority of day of time right so that was my solution right my solution was i know like i'm wise in the socratic sense of knowing how little i know and i'm very willing to admit that and i'm very willing to admit that i would probably fall into every one of these behavioral traps just like everybody else and so i have that little bit of wisdom and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use empirical evidence and i'm going to arbitrage human nature okay other people might just say you know i just i can't do that well there's all sorts of what i call interrupt methodologies that can work with people i have a good friend who's a traitor in europe and he's he's a he's kind of an intuitive traitor and what he does uh which i which is very effective for him is like when the market starts going against him he literally closes his workstation down he keeps he keeps running close at his office he puts him on and he goes he lives in vienna if you've ever been there it's a beautiful city so he goes for a five mile run in vienna and like what he stumbled onto is when we allow for these cool down periods the emotions are like oh i like this this is nice the weather's nice it feels good to run and what happens is the brain resets and and the emotions get calmed down and and like if you want to really whip people up just keep going at it right you must believe you're the maximalist way and all that kind of stuff if you if if more of your style is deep breath got to think about this i feel like really compelled to do this i know that i have this huge fear of missing out yeah i'm going to go for a run um another way that i have found that is like really um worked for some younger people that i work with is um to to write it out that i i have been a passionate believer in writing your ideas out forever because it just it it's almost magical a first off when you have to write it out when you have to get it out of your head and into the world on a piece of paper or you can i find using your actual handwriting works best and there's some studies that show that it engages different parts of the brain uh but write it out what you're going to find really quickly let's say you think coin a is got is going to be the winner right and and you're sitting there and you're talking to your your significant other or your friends or whatever and you're making the arguments and they're like countering and you know it's a conversation if you do this part instead of that part sit down and say i'm going to write why my thesis for coin a is right and then you're going to start writing what you're often going to find is that you have no reasonably good argument for why coin a is going to win and you teach yourself it's a great way to give yourself feedback on your own thoughts because if you can't build a cogent understandable argument for why you believe what you believe and by the way this is a ubiquitous process you can do this for anything it doesn't have to be just crypto it could be whatever um if you can't write it out or after you've written it out you read it and you go what dumbass wrote this this is [ __ ] right um that way you've interrupted yourself and you're like oh i guess coin a isn't going to be the winner another thing that could happen and sometimes happen by the way the first one happens more frequently than the one i'm about to describe is you write out your thesis it's pretty compelling so then you run into the trap of the curse of knowledge so if you've got a if you've got a very compelling thesis um and let's say you're pretty smart um and this is the really i mean i love the irony of this the smarter you are the better you can convince other people and yourself of your argument [Laughter] so it's just like oh my god so if that happens you still got to go on to the next the next stage you have now written down a cohesive thesis that is compelling for why coin a is going to work find somebody that knows nothing about krypto and have them read it and then listen to the questions that they ask you what you're gonna find i've never yet uh worked on these mentoring things with these some of the younger people i work with but one guy came close um the questions that you're they're going to ask you are going to change what you think about point a point b or point c right because you're going to realize you're going to take your notes and again this is back to your initial assessment uh ryan it was like do the homework well this is homework and so third part of the process you take your compelling thing have them read about it they're going to ask you questions you write those questions down and then you redraft your essay does it get stronger or does it get weaker and so the whole point here is less important about how compelling your thesis is you could still be wrong right nothing's 100 ever and nothing ever is certain we live probably we live we're deterministic zero to 100 thinkers who happen to occupy a probabilistic world and generally that leads to hilarity or tragedy so but what you're doing here is you are giving yourself a chance to slow down and letting your deeper thinking part of your mind get involved that's the real secret here by by taking the time to write it out all of that guess what goes away fomo you're no longer like i gotta do this now like these are the sad part about this is there's a guy edward bellamy who was a real [ __ ] he was freud's uh nephew or cousin or something anyway he's the guy who was the master of propaganda and of course he changed his name to public relations much nicer sounding uh that there are a lot of of these techniques that are like automatic that just hack into your base code of being a human another book i would recommend for your listeners and what and people watching is a book called influence by a guy by the name of childini he also has a pretty cool website if you prefer to learn by watching him talk about it but what he's good about is is showing you no no no no man those are routines let's you know we always compare the brain to whatever the latest technology is i love that i mean like back when steam engines were it everyone compared the brand to a steam engine and then you know it was whatever the the current new technology was and so now we're all saying well the brain is just like a computer it's not really but it's it's convenient right so there are ways to hack in to those roo those subroutines running in your brain silently that just take you over and so a lot of duplicitous people do that and this slows that down and it kills for the most part i haven't i haven't yet worked with somebody who said who actually did this who actually said you know jim that was [ __ ] and at the end of it i felt even more fomo uh because i was doing this ridiculous exercise of yours um and then finally um would be the kind of okay i i think that crypto's gonna win and i think that um that the blockchain is going to win and permissionless protocols and all that kind of stuff i think that's going to win they're finally building indexes of all of the various coins and stuff like that buy one of those and and so that makes it a lot easier on you because indexes are really momentum funds in disguise right because as back to tesla tesla keeps getting to be a bigger part of the s p 500 so these innocent investors who think that their powers of investing are actually investing in a mutual fund that is based on momentum because they have to reallocate the cap weighting as tesla grows and they have no idea that they have in their s p 500 fund a huge position in tesla and that tesla could [ __ ] the bed and they could go very very wrong however it's the it's the cleanest way for somebody who doesn't want to make it kind of like their life's mission um and to participate and um if you get it wrong well then it's better than trying to speculate in all the coins like because if the index fund goes to zero it means we were wrong right we we got that wrong and something happened whether it was the us government outlawing crypto or whatever there was some exogenous external exogenous event that blew the whole thing up um so those are those i would offer as as ways to at least think about it it's it's really good it's really good advice jim i just want to um you know plus one one of those in particular and then talk about a few others and then ask you a question actually so i i just want a plus one to write out your strategy and everything that jim said is 100 true you know bank list has a newsletter it's it's effectively what we do in podcasts too we are basically like you know talking about our strategy and ideas the the one i think ad that uh we might have we have the benefit of the internet now is you could publish it to social media and then everyone in the world can tell you all of the flaws of your idea in fact they'd be happy to tell you the flaws of your idea let me guarantee you you will find haters on anything you post in social media so even developing a social media a presence developing a a blog that's well read that can be a way to get that feedback cycle a little bit tighter um also i want to plus one on the go for a jog another a strategy is like look if you're listening to bank lists you're probably checking crypto prices like half a dozen times a day okay i know that because more than that david's like dave is like uh how many times you gotta pump those numbers up he's checking right now he's checked three times since we started the podcast um i think go for a jog also stop the amount of times you check crypto prices all right it's like what new has happened what what's the market telling you like if you believe in this asset class for the long term do you need to check it 10 times a day no what if you checked it once a week yeah how would that change how you're thinking about things go ahead jim that's a great those are both uh plus one great you know i i started moving all of our my work to social media like when i saw the trade because i owe a lot of my success to the traditional media right i was on cnbc all the time i got written up in the journal and all the various things which was really great and i i am incredibly grateful that at that's the point in the cycle i was able to you know have that advantage but i i study these things and i started to see that everything was moving to social media and and so that's when i got active on twitter even though i'd gotten an account earlier um that's a great idea so let me just endorse that idea because man if you can if you can you know strap on your armor uh it's it's it's gonna be very helpful but uh the the the checking prices so there is a thing called hyperbolic discounting and i know we need i and i'm guilty of this it's a term of our what it really means is it's you're shortening your time horizon without knowing you're doing it every time you check the price of crypto or anything like 10 times a day what your brain is saying is oh we need to pay attention to these short probably very meaningless moves up and down and when you become a hyperbolic discounter you are you pull triggers way too fast and almost always to your detriment so like another idea that i have been playing with which i think is now getting some pretty good support which is this idea i always say arbitrage human nature well there's this other thing about temporal arbitrage right what's temporal arbitage it's basically like i'm just gonna this this particular uh algorithm that i've developed uh does it pretty well i'm just gonna let it keep running right and you get a massive advantage over people who are running around like what's crypto now what's crypto now what's it doing what's it doing i you know like literally if you'd walked into my office when we were still at when we were still in the office we moved to work from anywhere uh but all you would hear is bach you wouldn't see a tv you wouldn't see um uh at bloomberg i didn't have any of that [ __ ] in my office arbitrary is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrarium

is really really missing that would make this whole thing a lot easier this whole thing being able to be sober about our thoughts removing emotion from investing uh and looking for the for the long term is that there's so many competing ways to value crypto assets like and no one really knows how to do it uh there's like different uh tribes will give you their version for evaluating crypto assets and it will always favor their particular crypto asset right there is this is my shock face there is no consensus on valuation models and and i think uh i think when when you were getting into the world of investing with stocks i think perhaps that was about a similar context as in there was no general consensus with how to value equities um maybe you can correct my memory because i i wasn't around back then but something that we're really missing in the crypto space is like of an anchor to all ground ourselves in about how to measure the valuations of these things because it's all there are no fundamentals there are no fundamentals it's all in our because no one can agree what fundamentals even mean right so and so is this is this an important point that we're missing in the industry that we should really work on so um ryan's interjection there uh is is hit it on the head there there are no fundamentals that like you can you can't move over the fundamentals of companies right uh to crypto right because i i used to use a joke meme that was essentially uh crypto ceo needs to raise prices so um so the i have in my thinking about crypto i i think that the the the best way to to approach crypto is to use momentum filters right that's the wisdom of crowds and um you know a quick and dirty you wanted another way for people to kind of approach this is momentum uh has a solid history uh going back my book works on wall street takes it back to the early 1920s other books the data is really sketchy and so i i'm load to like recommend them but momentum is essentially wisdom of crowds um it it's not always right of course but it's right a lot more often than it's wrong um and and so i don't know that that would be an evaluation approach but it would certainly be an uh an external way to say i'm not going to listen to the story as to why coin a or coin b is better i'm just going to look at the momentum which one's winning the most adherence and which one are people buying the most of um i think the other thing about crypto that i always i i always have just like tried to get my head around this because in the early days of crypto i'm an early adopter i love listening to people with new ideas and and because you know there's a lot of great ideas out there but you know the early days as you guys said it was mostly the sovereign individual types the you know anarchist libertarians and and and they were making the case that it was a store of value right what is what what what are currencies well in in an ideal form a currency is meant to be a store of value that doesn't change a lot right so inflation screws that up um you know other other exogenous events screws it up but then you got to look at okay another way you could say store of value is is this going to be the most acceptable thing like could i go anywhere and trade the crypto that i have on my phone for something i want right i want to go i don't know i want to go on a uh uh riverboat uh tour of the nile um and can i go and will they take my crypto so i always try to get my head around that because it didn't seem especially by its price action it seemed like a perfectly designed speculative asset um and not a store of value so i think i don't know um i don't know if it'll ever turn into store value i think that you know that would be one way i would kind of think about the fundamental side of things and that would kind of be along the lines of okay so if we're thinking of this as a store of value then it becomes applicable to say how many people will take this as payment how many people are willing to accept it in terms of a worker you know we have a new mayor here in new york and he was went on and on about how he was going to take part of his paycheck in bitcoin uh the mayor of miami who i've had on my podcast like he's mr bitcoin um and and so that would be the way i would try to understand the adoption rate so that could that could be kind of a fundamental thing right so if suddenly a country or a bunch of companies or a bunch of investors say yeah we'll all accept fill in the blank right as legal tender that's probably going to be the winner and so keeping an eye on you know what's getting accepted the most what has the most adherence what has all that kind of stuff i guess and those are quasi-fundamental things right because in stocks are so much easier right it's company a they make x dollars there's always going to be that crazy stock like tesla that has it's a it's a what i call a cult stock and i don't mean that as any disrespect on elon musk i think it's hysterical watching the haters who hate him and the people who love him i really i just think he's a very interesting guy and i think that like i try to divorce the person from the achievements and like that guy can land rockets on platforms in the middle of the ocean i don't know how you don't respect that and and so like so you get that kind of cultish thing and absent that though most stocks are like based on you know people saying yeah no i'm not gonna pay uh a hundred times for every dollar of earnings um and or they you know see the light and it's funny because they all collectively see the light at the same time um so i guess that's kind of a bad answer but it's because i really haven't been able to like come up with a way of systematizing uh a way for us to look at crypto the way we look at investing i think uh increasingly jim we might find ways ways to do that in the future and uh what we do like have to all be cognizant of is man this asset class is just so young right but the the the depth of data available for public networks like bitcoin or ethereum in terms of like amount of addresses that are like bank accounts that are holding bitcoin essentially or holding eth uh you know how much these addresses actually move bitcoin or eth right how many of them are holding what's the time horizon there's so much data i feel like that could be plugged into quantitative models in the future to help us predict some of this stuff um well i i do want to go back to kind of those tactics for a minute because um i was like also getting really excited about some of the advice you had you mentioned momentum funds or momentum filters right and you said one of those is an index i think that's another takeaway for people's like hey use crypto indexes and there are crypto indexes that capture the total crypto market cap right now uh and or also capture like segments like decentralized finance that you can look at and purchase and some of these index will hold up better than others um another like i guess a grab bag of strategies that i want to run by you jim and see if this resonates with with kind of your experiences um uh one thing that david has mentioned in the past is that he does like there's so much opportunity i feel like crypto is all of the behavioral uh traps that you find in the regular you know stock market and such you find in crypto only it's like it's 10x it's on it's on freaking steroids because there will be that guy at a party who just made like 100x on some nft that he purchased right and you're gonna think immediately when you hear that story that you can replicate that strategy and that here's the next uh you know asset or token or nft that you can buy to replicate that strategy but one thing that i learned from david is what he does with the portion of his portfolio is he creates like a a d-gen portion like a degenerate portion he's like this is the portion i'm serious about and that's going to be like i don't know david what is it like 90 90 or whatever but you're going to take this 10 and you're going to get it out of your system right and do sort of the the more degen activity the scratch the itch portfolio scratch the itch portfolio that's it that that's a great way to do it um yeah that's not crazy that's actually a really good psychological hack um and i love the degenerate um because you're just calling it what it is right and and so it it scratchy-ish is good too because if you can scratch the edge you don't feel the need to go all in on that scratch right uh so i think that having what i would call play money right um that you're actually putting in the market that is like that that can solve a lot of fomo that can solve a lot of that other stuff we used to uh keep a um portfolio at my first company i was obviously capital management uh that was the what we call the eat uh drink be merry and because tomorrow you die so it was all the vice stocks right so it's phillip morris it was all the alcohol makers the pharmaceutical companies hospital stocks funeral homes that kind of stuff it killed it i mean it was like always up and again it's taking advantage of we humans you know i mean come on if you're let's say you want a diet right and and you walk into the kitchen and there's a brownie there i can tell you the brownie always wins and again that's back to the time horizon and the way you you discipline yourself right you think to yourself okay i'm gonna lose whatever 20 pounds and you walk into the kitchen there's a beautiful brownie that someone's just made and you're like i can just have this because i'll go back to the diet after this right and you kind of never do so the warning that i would have on the degenerate portfolio is you are at risk of like inevitably you're going to hit a really great string of wins in the gen portfolio and you're going to pause and think i should this this should be the 90 over here and and and the other one should be the 10 and again human os man that we're all the same well i think that so as long as like if you lock it in that it can't be any more than 10 you rebalance out of it and take some of those gains and and just do put it on automated right so every quarter you gotta you got to add to it if you've had losses bring it back up to 10 of your portfolio or more importantly let's say it doubled and in that quarter and you're now 20 degenerate sell it down to 10 again that helps you do that david do you do that yeah i thought that that part's hard see the hard part well listen man i mean like one of the greatest investors in the world sir john templeton um like he what he used to do is really interesting so like if he if he was worried that the markets were getting really frothy and everything he would put good till cancel orders in on stocks that he really liked except let's say that the stock when he put that good tail cancer council order in was trading at 100 bucks he'd put it in order to buy it at 30 and just leave it right and they ask him why do you do that and he's like because if that stock ever got to 30 there is no way in hell i would have the emotional ability to call in a buy order at 30. and when you think about that that's genius so he was self-aware enough to understand that he's not going to have the willpower and he's making that decision where everything's great right and and so he puts those in and like i talked to somebody who knew him and it's like that's where he made like the biggest killings ever was when when that happened it's jim it's just such a good freaking idea and this happens all of the time in crypto okay so like one one thing i recall is um you know ethan bitcoin price in uh march of 2020 right and so we were hanging out and that you know i don't know eth was like the 200s or the 100s or whatever it actually dropped down to like 80 at one point in time and 80 going down to like double digit for an asset that i fundamentally believe in with all of my freaking heart like the fundamentals are strong incredibly excited about holding this thing for like 10 years but in the moment when covid was happening and you hit a spike down to 80 eath you're like oh my god what's happening it's all over and you get had i had double digit buys in an order book at that time would have snapped up the cheapest it's probably ever going to be for the rest of my life and didn't do it it's the order book hack it's so good let me ask you one last hack here uh because this is something i have uh i've trouble with personally okay so how do you not get too attached to your assets so when i make mistakes i think in investing it's actually not that i don't hold long that i don't hold long enough it's that i hold too long and i'm like oh you know what like i want to hold this a little bit longer because i because i believe it how do you know when to sell how do you make sure you don't get attached to your assets so now now we're pushing into you'll understand why i made such a study of human nature and and the way we are so it it's literally um there's a great old wall street saying which is a stock doesn't know you own it and and and the idea is that we anthropomorphize our stocks and we like people naming their cars or their boats right oh that's betty and you know whatever um and it's just human nature do that right and so like i train myself to be completely dispassionate um like if you ask me right now what are your biggest winners in your equity portfolio i have no idea none and um i do know their underlying factors i do know what portfolio i bought them in right but because i automated it i automated the sell process too and i guess we'll go back to talking about david's degen portfolio if you can automate the process and what whatever it doesn't have to be just degenerate it can be your overall portfolio it's like you know what um just to keep it easy let's say my net worth is a hundred thousand dollars and i'm a passionate believer in bitcoin and so i'm going to put half my portfolio this is not an investment recommendation people aha just let's underline that uh but so you're such a believer you put 50 in that and 50 in other stuff right stocks whatever whatever that other stuff is and you just continually rebalance when you do that bringing it back to 50 50 right when you do that you're forced to sell when your conviction is the highest in that bitcoin is going to rule the world right and you're forced to buy when your conviction is at its lowest right because so time a 50 50 a year later bitcoin 70 of the portfolio the other stuff is 30 you're forced to sell back to 50 50. man that's hard because every part of your emotional being is going to say well this is different right it's finally caught on it's finally you know fill in the blank right and you're going to have all your reasons and they're going to sound really good to you but then on the other hand right bitcoin like you said had you simply had those double-digit orders in the book like you would have never had the guts to pull the gun then right uh but when it's in the book it's done for you so the other way right all of a sudden stocks are 70 percent of your portfolio bitcoin is 30 and you're like well these stocks have fundamental at least these companies are actually earning money and i guess uh you know maybe i should just probably leave bitcoin at 30 because you know i'm you know and your reasons will sound equally valid by the way to yourself so that's the way i would do it like so i i'll give you an example in 1999 we ran a uh mutual fund which was a small to mid-cap growth fund and it was like my most aggressive strategies right and so 99 was a vintage year for rampant speculation and that fund got rebalanced every six months and uh there were several stocks in the fund that on the rebalance had already gone up 600 percent from january to june but they still qualified and i was i still remember this like it were yesterday my trainer came in and he's like we are going to override this right this this went up 600 percent and it's got to go down it's just like there's no way it's going to keep going up and i'm like no we're not going to overwrite it we're going to follow the model and you know at the end of the year it's up 1300 from the first buy in january and then same trader this is what's so fun same guy walks into my office and he goes that was right man it's probably good for another thousand percent and the stock no longer fit in the model and i'm like no sorry man you're selling it what you know and so having this built-in rebalance i mean like that works in a lot of asset classes and it's just dispassionate right it's just like yeah okay whatever is right for you right and by the way i'm using 50 50 simply because it's easy to illustrate if i'm giving you investment advice and all of your listeners don't put 50 of your uh portfolio into any speculative asset okay um and i think that that uh bitcoin still can still counts as a specula uh speculative asset um but you know other people make the same mistake in you know penny stocks or whatever and and and the other bit of advice is you tend to do things like that because you want to get rich quick and what does that bring us back to brings us back to hyperbolic discounting and how that always ends up having cost you a ton of money um slow and steady which to other people might seem this guy's reckless look he's got like he's got all this crypto and everything but within your your intellectual framework um you might think of it as boring right but it works i think i think that's honestly it's the bankless philosophy of sort of like get rich slowly um but like we're doing it in crypto right and so there's there's so many encrypted that want to play these short-term games but if you play the long-term game that can be your edge um jim this has been so much fun we've got a lot of insights and i feel like i want to summarize this uh at the very end but um last question for you do you have anything like just impart any any final thoughts so again the listener was listening today maybe they're the bulk of their experience in investing comes from like kind of a crypto world and that's how they they'll learn things and so it's like if if somebody dropped you in into a a foreign country where you don't speak the language you're just kind of learning as you go you're missing a lot of the fundamentals of how does the grammar work and how are things spelled so i feel like people listening are probably missing some key pieces of of how to invest and this behavioral short circuiting is is probably one of them do you have any just parting thoughts for us anything else we should keep in mind as we're going on this investing journey in into crypto and other lands sure um thanks for having me first um so i guess what i would say is like maybe one of the wisest lines i've ever seen in my life is this too shall pass and when you think that way you the losses that you take and you will take losses uh become less painful uh and the gains that you take and hopefully you will take gains um are excite you a lot less in terms of um you know look at what a stud and what a genius i am um and the other parting thought would be read as much as you can like in history and look at what happens to people who there's a great quote from one of the ancient greeks which is whom the gods would destroy they first make great and and when they make them great they get filled with hubris and they get filled with i am the greatest individual that has ever lived and we all tell ourselves these stories we're all confabulating unreliable narrators and again me included and that's just the way human os works and we have this incredible desire for certainty and like there is nothing certain in the world other than death and taxes right and you know like if we go into anarchy maybe just death so so i mean like there's precious little that that is um that ultimately important right and and so the other thing i would say is like i love people who like people who really get obsessed about investing it's great because it's never ending it's a wonderfully it's the olympics of investing of business right because you gotta you gotta understand a bunch of different things you gotta understand human behavior but like leave room and go with what resonates with you and by that i mean um everybody's different you got to find the right process the right thing that you can vibe with and just like keep learning just keep learning listen to your podcast read books do as many things of those things for yourself education that you can because in the real world you got to teach yourself like everybody gets oh well but i studied finance at you know wharton i don't care it doesn't matter short one futures contract with your own money and you'll have more experience than the wharton guy that freshly mint it and i don't mean to pick on wharton all business schools right so lessons are hard and and unless you can understand that this happens to everybody you know me you everyone else every successful person you're looking at right every single one of them has a bunch of failures and what made them different they got back up and when they got back up they looked and went oh i really [ __ ] up what can i learn from this and then they just keep going and so and and just don't fall in love you you talked about maximalists like not a good look because it's just like oh man just think about it in terms of a religion and if you're a maximalist you would be the one holding the torch wanting to burn that heretic who you've got tied to the stake you don't really want to do that because there is no one true faith or one true method or one true anything find what's right for you um and then like if you're passionate maybe you'll make it a career maybe you'll have a podcast on it that's great if you're not learn as much as you can and then like automate and let that work for you that you know i wish i could give you better parts of wisdom but that's what i got for you now i think it's fantastic jim and you've given us a lot of wisdom ending with that uh stay humble and keep leveling up at the same time uh jim this has been a lot of fun thanks for joining us oh thanks for having me it was a lot of fun hey guys i just want to stop and just do a quick recap of that episode because i feel like there's so much many pearls of wisdom and i'm just going to sum it up for us here uh number one jim was talking about narrative following price not the other way around take that into your crypto journeys also putting in the work that's the real edge here you got to put in the work uh humans suck at investing we all have these monkey brains with human os think about that when you're making your investment decisions and this i'm just gonna rattle off some tactics to put in your bag on how to short circuit human os number one jim was talking about writing out your strategy then publishing it maybe on social media what get get gets written gets clarified also dollar cost averaging in number two we talked about that uh next time you want to fomo go for a jog instead clear your mind okay also maybe uh only check the price once a day or once a week slim down on your price checking because every time you check price that shortens your time horizon every time you look into blockfolio and coingecko you're shortening your psychological time horizon also using momentum of filters one of those is an index where you can capture upside opportunity logging your ideas uh creating a degen portion of your portfolio that's david's idea that jim seems to like as well setting your buys on the order book now okay and maybe also your cells because you have to continually rebalance i don't know how many that was but it's at least uh over close to a dozen of practical tips to help you guys survive in crypto and uh once again this has been jim we appreciate you joining
