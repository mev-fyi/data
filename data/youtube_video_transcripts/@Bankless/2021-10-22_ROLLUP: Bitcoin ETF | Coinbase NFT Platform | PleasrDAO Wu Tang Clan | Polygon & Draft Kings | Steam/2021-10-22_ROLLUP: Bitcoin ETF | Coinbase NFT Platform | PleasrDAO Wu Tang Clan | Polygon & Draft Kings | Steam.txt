[Music] bankless nation happy third week of october or david should i say october we're talking all-time highs right now this has been all-time high week how are you doing you got a big smile on your face you must be happy you're in your spongebob sweat sweater something's going right high fashion fridays this is awesome yeah gosh there's so much so many awesome things happened this week like you said all-time highs for bitcoin we got the bitcoin etf as well lots to unpack there also a dao takes the mysterious unreleased famous wu-tang album from the cold hands of a hedge fund villain and is now making it accessible for the rest of the world uh tbd on that as well and also draftkings and polygon a 40 billion dollar public company now on polygon whoa that's pretty cool so much to talk about yeah we got some details on the coinbase nft platform as well we're gonna cover uh so much going on david hard to fit it in but you know we managed somehow sometimes it's uh it's an hour and a half sometimes it's two hours we jam-packed this episode with everything that you need to know in crypto this week uh so we'll attempt to do that once again you think we're gonna be successful we're gonna try and go real real fast so let's go ahead and get right into it ryan but first we got some announcements want to take us through them oh the first is pull together has just rolled out their v4 they wanted bankless audience to know about it and um this is like my number one when somebody asked me what's the first thing i should use in d5 i always refer to them to pull together it's either uniswap or or pull together but i do this because this is a no loss lottery right so they can't get angry at me if they lose anything because they won't lose something by depositing their funds into pool together you put usdc in it's fun easy to use user interface just connect metamask and boom you're in a lotto where you can only win there's there's no loss in the principal they generate the earnings based on prizes that are pushed out to the platform and based on the yield the assets are uh earning so it's like a it's like another way to save it's like a high interest lotto savings account actually and their v4 has even more prizes also it's whale proof it's really friendly for the the smaller minnows only depositing smaller amounts of money um there's near zero transaction fees too because the hack is you can now deposit into pool together using polygon and not have to pay gas fees and they're launching with a million dollars in prizes so uh really cool to see this um i've won the lotto before i don't know if you've ever won the lotto and pulled together but it's like a magic feeling you go and you check and you're like oh my god i won this week isn't that awesome yeah if you ever i wanted to check the box of winning the lottery pool together might be the best way that you can add that to your instagram bio or maybe your your tinder dinner bio just let let the people know that you won the lottery you should not tell anyone you win the lottery if you win the lottery that's like uh yeah it's a recipe for um you know too many acquaintances calling you up and wanting things anyway guys check that out that's at bankless.cc slash pull together and jump in the pool with us david all right all-time high week you ready to get to markets let's absolutely do it it is all-time high week for bitcoin we crossed the previous all-time high of 63 500 setting a new all-time high of 67 100 taking a little bit of a tumble back down to 63.63 200 but still broke the all-time highs that's big man that's big so the last previous all-time high if i recall correctly was sometime in april april 13th 191 days ago so bitcoin holders like through this whole bull run they've been they've had to be very patient because they've watched all of these other assets pump since april in particular like we had this alt layer two layer alt layer one summer we had sort of a d5 2.0 kind of resurgence as well and bitcoin holders if you are a bitcoin holder you've been waiting patiently for this time to come the big news was going to be the etf right and here it is it happened this week and that's why we're seeing the bitcoin pump does that explain all of this david i think that a broader question that i want to ask is like we went through a all-time high at where where we are now 191 days ago 27 weeks ago then we went through like this period where bitcoin just got slammered with flood after flood after slammered huh energy flood yes like regulation fud and it took a beating it went all the way like how how low did it get like nine thousand twenty six uh seven thousand or something before returning back to back to all-time highs uh and so like pretty crazy right uh and like what is it 27 weeks half of a year like there's always the conversation about bitcoin goes in cycles like was that a mini cycle was that a full cycle does does it even matter as a cycle to talk about did we just go through like a full like seasonality cycle i don't really know um important story is um we are back at all-time highs yeah the other i guess uh what that means as well is bitcoin is rising up the ranks in terms of global currency so it just passed the swiss franc in terms of value total value there's there's you know bitcoin total outstanding supply is more valuable than total outstanding swiss franc so it's the 13th largest world currency by market cap at this point in time unbelievable right where are we 12 years 13 years into this experiment at the same time it makes it feel so low i feel like does it that's it like bitcoin's only beyond like the only number 13. friends we are early we're still early right it's going to be moving up these charts let's talk about something else that is moving up the charts and that is the price of eth this week so eth had a good week not quite ready to call the all-time high though david we wanted to so much but we're not there we we almost we just touched it right like barely touched it almost got there but not quite what is eth right now and what was the previous all-time high yeah currently clocking in at four thousand one hundred dollars we started the week at three thousand eight hundred dollars and the previous all-time high it was 75 dollars higher than was being reported on coinbase it always changes depending on which exchange you're looking at previous high was 4 375 ish dollars uh and so oh look i actually got closer than i thought so we almost said we missed it by 20ish dollars give or take but interestingly ether was up 14.5 on the week whereas bitcoin was only up 11 on the week on the week that bitcoin had the etf announcement which is kind of kind of interesting good news for bitcoin is good news for eth as well right so people are just asking like well if bitcoin's going with an etf then then when eat etf it's got to be happening and it is rising up the charts as well we don't have a global currency chart open but we do have this ethereum is now larger than all of the world's global banks okay so it just passed in terms of market cash jpmorgan in market cap um i've been watching this for a while just because look this is bankless and ethereum is kind of the you know bankless money platform for the world and now it just passed the largest bank in the world um i don't know that they know this is going on but it's like it's happening it's picking them off one by one yeah do they understand that ethereum is actually a banking competitor to them uh it's pretty cool that ethereum is bigger than the world's largest bank but i think the bigger lan uh milestone is when ethereum is bigger than all of the banks combined that i think is the the real time to celebrate well let's talk about the bitcoin to eth chart shall we so bitcoin and eth always in this tug of war and this in this tension what are we looking at on the bitcoin to eath ratio this week yeah it was a flat on the week a little bit up started at .064 currently at 0.065 um but it's also when looking at that pattern you see that again lower higher lows getting painted over the course of the last like uh roughly 200-ish days or so again interesting to see uh ether especially in the last two days really run up against bitcoin uh on the on the after the news of the bitcoin etf so interesting dynamics the ether bitcoin ratio really putting up a fight do you know what i tweeted out this morning because i genuinely feel this way um i was i have not been previously at the point of saying like the flipping of ether exceeding bitcoin market cap is is inevitable but now i feel like i'm at that point like it's going to happen well i mean i had a very i had a high confidence interval probably at the beginning of the year that that would happen call it 80 um what changed is eth became ultrasound bunny that narrative stuck eip 1559 where we're burning eath every single we every single you know block every single day every single week okay um the eath as an internet bond has taken hold talking to institutional investors in the way we have they're all buying eth okay it's being recognized as a reserve asset now we have the merge coming and i have incredibly high confidence that that is going to be shipped last year at this time none of the things i mentioned had happened all right that's where i was like eighty percent confident that eth would flip in bitcoin now i'm like closer to uh 100 like i think it is inevitable now we've just seen probably the most bullish thing that bitcoin has in store short of another country maybe adopting bitcoin in some way which is the the etf right that's kind of the news that everyone is waiting for and it's up but like it's not up that much compared to eth so i'm kind of ready to to state that i know you've been more bullish you're always like yeah it's going to happen 100 um and now i'm feeling like very close to 100 as well i think there's some things to unpack here first off i actually think that this etf is not the etf that should make you bullish because it's a futures based etf and we'll unpack that what that means later in the episode but as opposed to a spot based etf where actually like demand of the etf actually creates buying pressure on the spot markets uh and so like there's there's something to unpack there also uh this is just the beginning of the etf uh the bitcoin etf story and overall i think uh really meaningful bitcoin price appreciation is going to happen when that the uh bridge of the etf actually translates towards more and more companies actually putting bitcoin exposure on their balance sheets and so like wow it's just like the first week of the bitcoin etf a lot of institutions are not yet uh moving their money to do that but they definitely will in the future and so my take here is that like uh bitcoin didn't react so strongly to this etf other than breaking all-time highs like decent like still pretty strong that's good in and of itself it's good but there's there's just speculation as like all right when does this meaningfully actually change the fundamentals of bitcoin is it like right now or is it in the future when these institutions actually come and start using this product and i will also say like i'm also very very bullish on the merge but i think there's gonna be a similar game being played as does ether really uh move up against bitcoin right before the merge or really like is it gonna happen maybe up to a year or two years down the line after the lack of issuance from proof of stake actually does show up in the market because remember where bitcoin has institutions putting it on its balance sheet ether has just like not issuing any ether and actually being ultrasound money ethereum because of the concept of ultrasound money the combination of burning transaction fees and minimizing the amount of ether issuance counts as like we get as many gray scales as bitcoin has every single year like recycles so it's almost like on ethereum flipping bitcoin it is definitely like on a timer because like they get ethereum as a protocol just gets to generate its own gray scales like putting putting ether on the balance sheet anyways there's a lot there's a lot of dynamics to unpack with the flipping yeah for sure and i'm not going to call a timeline on it i'm just calling a probability of flipping has gone way up whether that happens before the merge after the merge sometime in the next three to five years i'm not sure i just think it's going to happen more bitcoin etf discussion too we should we should have that when we get to news because i feel like the big thing is actually the narrative is actually the us government saying okay guys you can have your bitcoin etf now we won't stop you from having that anyway let's talk about another all-time high david which is something we've been waiting for for the entire year and that is d5 pulse the total locked value in d5 what did we just hit david the magic number 100 billion dollars i'm pretty sure we said it was going to happen last week uh we definitely did and now we said we wanted it to happen we wanted to happen yeah clocking in at 100 billion dollars locked in defy and then the dpi the mod is 345 dollars so the defy tokens not following the amount of value locked inside of their applications look at this uh where were we let's see 2020 this time last year look at this david 20 and 22 billion five x in a year yeah and that was right after you know d5 summer it's pretty impressive and if you go back like before defy summer yeah nothing nothing you remember when we talked to like two little numbers vance spencer from uh framework and like total of locked value is like i don't know five five billion or something yeah didn't he make some insane prediction about how there's gonna be a hundred billion dollars locked in he's like 100 billion yeah yeah for the run yeah and and we were like wow vance are you allowed to be that bullish is that sure is that legal is that a legal amount of bullishness yeah like it turns out pumping everything like yeah stop pumping everything vance but uh he called it and we're not stopping here i mean it doesn't look like the bull run is showing any signs of stopping speaking of which let's talk about dpi this is the um the top d5 tokens what are we looking at on the week we don't have to talk too much about it it's a very flat number it's it started the week at like roughly 340 dollars it went up to 365 and now we're back at 345 dollars so flat ish it's funny like some defy 2.0 tokens so-called they're making a run but the uh the blue chip defy tokens are not right now that's a really really good important point i think we might be actually actually able to make the claim that the dpi is actually not tracking all of d5 because there's a lot of new protocols that have done extremely well recently rari capital uh olympus dow that aren't included in the dpi can you double check and make sure that's true can you scroll down and look at the holdings oh i'm pretty sure that's true because many of these tokens are like too young basically yeah too young yeah so young younger defy is outpacing older device yeah catch up old man come on let's talk about this no we don't have to the eighth dpi ratio is getting slaughtered at point zero eight four uh oh my god so i'm moving my my flow of my bottom call from point one three to point zero one three don't make calls anymore david just stop calling the bottom okay there is no bottom right here um well look ethan's just looking really strong particularly against these these blue chip defy tokens and i don't know when that's going to change i think it i think it will eventually but um it's it's not looking that way right now in the traditional stock market we're used to indexes going up against the dollar but i guess in d5 where you see indexes going down versus ether just because eth is ultrasound money absolutely and you know i think to be fair what you have to actually do in crypto is like you should like something like eats should be your denominator for me personally it's my denominator it's not actually us dollars and it's not bitcoin i know some crypto folks denominate everything in bitcoin i don't personally i denominate in eth and so when i'm making an investment outside of ether i ask myself do i expect this investment to appreciate versus eth not against dollars dollars is easy man that's easy it's easy come on but can you actually appreciate and realize gains versus eth is the question and d5 did for a long time it hasn't recently um let's talk about the way you can't lose though which is you buy all three you buy bitcoin you buy eth and you buy dpi in equal 30 30 30 uh sorry a third a third a third split this is the bankless bed index what are we looking at on the week david started the week at 155 dollars hit a high a new all-time high uh for at a 186 dollars in line with all-time high season currently clocking in at 174 dollars oh that's nice hitting alt so bitcoin all-time high total luck value in d5 all-time high bed index all-time high and just like 20 22 off each all-time high so we're doing it oh another all-time high layer two beat the total locked value in d5 is also all-time high in this october season this all-time high week uh what are we looking at in in total locked value in layer two clocking in at four billion dollars so nice to see that four number there uh i think this is just going to be another uh following the total locked in d5 margin up to 100 billion dollars so some of the the leaders this week arbitrary dx optimism all uh individually up about eight percent uh loopering clocking in at pl plus 15 percent at 130 million nice job arbitrary got 60 dominance right now uh dydx coming in second place with 22 but this is so early like this is not even the first inning of the game here uh but this is a chart to watch over the next 12 months for sure as things shake out uh token terminal let's talk about this man this is a story of eip1559 another reason i'm i'm bullish ethan bullish on on the flipping look at this users of ethereum have paid one billion dollars in transaction fees over the past 30 days okay so let me think about that ethereum as a protocol has received one billion dollars worth of revenue if you look at ethereum like a business that has sustainable economics ethereum billion a month billion a month a billion a month not too bad and uh here's the part that where eip 1559 comes in people used to say well you know so that's all going to minors well no it's not 83 almost 83 of that was burned that's almost a billion dollars 824 million was actually burnt and returned to eth holders so remember this is as if every time apple sells an iphone right um a portion of its stock is burnt is it 83 of the value of an iphone gets burned 83 right what what is that worth even from a ignore the ultrasound money case i suppose or the like reserve currency monetary premium case just from a discounted cash flow like if you're if you're viewing this as ether as you would a stock it is uh it is supremely undervalued even at even at this valuation and it's just crazy to see so look we got room to run david that's what i think and last time yeah go ahead yeah last time that eth hit these current prices here's a nice little summary tweet uh last time eth hit 4k uh one five five five oh gosh one five five nine was not live ether issuance was roughly 57 percent higher uh 2.3 billion ether were not burnt optimism and arbitrary were not launched nft volume had not done like an insane 4x uh and then eat staked in 2.0 was literally half the amount it is right now and the total value in d5 was 20 lower so nice summary of where we were just about 27 weeks ago in ethereum land almost three trillion uh that's the total value of all of crypto and like you remember when vitalik asked this uh in 2017 that question of uh have we earned it right uh we we're almost at it you know trillion dollars back then have we earned it and his answer was implicitly no yeah this time i feel like not all of crypto but i'm talking specifically about ether maybe some other assets as well the question of have we earned it i feel like is a resounding yes right just look at the cash flows that block space demand is generating right now and look at all of the development and the path forward and uh it feels like this is the beginning once again of a bull run and not like well maybe we're kind of the midpoint i suppose but it's not over yet in my opinion none of this is financial advice of course let's talk about um polygon as well because they're hitting some big numbers what's this number 100 million unique active addresses on polygons so congratulations on the polygon team and with one of the big stories coming out later in the roll up it's going to be obvious as to why polygon has done so well it's relieving some traffic from the main chain which is great as well uh look elon musk once again summed it up the meme master i guess what are we looking at here yeah elon musk the markets were so hot this week that elon musk tweeted out this meme of just a guy and a girl obviously a couple guys like hugging the [ __ ] excuse me hugging hugging his girlfriend really really hard uh and they are together watching a tv on the wall where bitcoin is priced at sixty nine thousand dollars and ether is priced at four thousand two hundred dollars so elon musk the meme lord nice job just just a romantic night what are you doing you're not watching netflix you're just watching the price of bitcoin and eath go up it's been one of those weeks uh guys we will be right back with some of the hot releases of the week and after that news but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible matcha everyone's favorite decks aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage matra has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on mantra is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stable coin into the alchemics vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's i a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomix fi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance all right guys we are back after all-time high week still in all-time high week now we're talking about releases this is the reason that we are getting to all-time highs so much as being built on top of ethereum on top of d5 on top of all the protocols we talked about let's talk about future swap future swap is a perpetuals protocol they just went live on mainnet david what's going on here yeah fun fact this is a nice piece of ethereum trivia but actually started off with the yield farming model before compound actually introduced it to the world it's so successful that they had to shut down the contracts because so much money flooded in they were worried right they were worried it was like too early yeah too much too much money came too fast into unoddity contracts but that was a long time ago we are now into the v4 of future swap so if you are a perpetual trader and you want allegedly 10 times more liquid markets with 30 times more capital efficiency and it's fully composable including exotic assets like nfts future swap might be for you ah exotic assets like nft entities i'm actually going to leverage very cool this is cool too ens just keeps getting better that is of course dot eth you know it well but if you have metamask and you type in a dot eth domain name like in your browser window as long as you have that metamastic extension in your browser window and you put a slash at the end of it it'll just load so if you go to vitalik.eth you have metamask slash then what pops up it's the decentralized version of italics website i'm going to try this right now yeah let's do this actually see if this works when didn't mine didn't work look at this you're wearing ens you might not be logged in i don't know and then boom where are we this is an ipfs link to vitalik's website which is not loading laugh out loud we're getting there i tried it earlier this week and it worked but like i think the redirect works for whatever reason the link is down on oh here it is it was just slow just a little slow ipfs is slower decentralized decentralization is slow that's how it works it's so permanent it's so permanent very cool to see that uh addresses just keep getting better this is really cool to see too david have you ever like tried to use a state website right it's trying to register an llc or a c-corp or something like that not if i can avoid it now you're trying to pay your taxes or something anyway estate websites are absolutely terrible it's like they were developed in 2003 and then just like left they probably have something on staff called like a webmaster who just like maintains the website i mean they're absolutely terrible every single state is like that anyway one thing that's cool is the wyoming website state website where you register a business has just gotten updated and it's got an update and you see this one you can register an llc you can register a non-profit you can register a corporation what's this you can also register a dow a decentralized autonomous organization hit that nice start now button with the uh the hover and it's very it's very cool like wyoming law now allows this bridge between daos and llc's and you know entities that are you know state recognized and because of course the state of wyoming recognizes a dow then that means the entire federal government of the united states recognizes a dow i haven't tried this haven't done this i know there are some things that are lacking from this uh kind of dow registration but just the fact that you can do this is a huge massive step forward this always reminds me that like crypto is this nebulous like organism from space with a bunch of tentacles and it's just like grabbing on to the real world in like every single way possible and now it's found its way to the real world via daos the crypto octopus has you in its tentacles wyoming that's what's going on you are now part of the hive mind yeah connects as well so this is a bridge protocol we're really excited about these but they just released an explorer so you can kind of visualize this um david this is loading up right now but what are we looking at here in the connex dashboard yeah i think cross-train cross l2 volume transfers are like across uh cross transfers of uscc ether usdt matic all these tokens it's gonna be really really fun to watch as because this economy is transparent and connects has done a fantastic job making a dashboard of all these metrics so you can view the cross chain l2 world volume number of transactions which chains are going to what assets are being transferred uh how much total liquidity there is how much total volume has been transferred so congratulations to k'nex for also cross chaining a hundred million dollars since going live with their protocol yeah that's huge um guys okay those have been the releases let's talk a bit about some of the raises this week and i think the theme david is money is just rushing into this space it's piling in and it's not just piling in one area right it's not just like the protocols or the layer one level with like the blockchain level it's saturating all of these different areas areas we didn't even have a couple of years ago during the last full cycle so we got like at the protocol layer investments are flying the defy layer investments are flying new funds are being created massive like hundreds of millions of dollars we've got crypto banks that are continuing to raise we've got nfts we've got even mining like there are all of these different pools of capital that are raising right now maybe we should touch on a few um the first is from obal so this is a they just raised 6.15 million dollars and i think of this is it's making staking more decentralized there's some cool tech behind this com some cool um crypto magic i would say but uh that's at the protocol layer and really cool to see this race very deep down in the protocol layer and this is uh the technology here is a shared secret validators which allows you to split a validator key among multiple parties kind of like sharing the password for running a validating node with 32 ether in it and this is really really important for organizations like lido that have not yet fully uh figured out how to protocolize the whole validator network that they have and this is a very important puzzle piece for actually turning that into a completely trustless organization oh the obel team actually got a grant from lido 100 thousand dollars to help develop this technology and this is something that we can also see rocket pool using and also overall just makes it easier to spin up a validating a decentralized validating network uh so pretty cool innovation here congratulations to colin myers he's been in this world for a while yeah he's definitely been in syking for a while a polynomial is another one so this is a i i believe you know the characterization of like it's a one inch it's an aggregator for all of the various defy option protocols that are happening right now they just raised 1.1 million dollars to build out this one-inch style marketplace kind of cool any comments the options ecosystem on ethereum is definitely like uh it needs to get built out so it's really nice seeing these aggregators getting added into the whole options marketplace i mean options are very basic financial contract uh if your makes a it makes a ton of sense to have them on ethereum hasn't really seen the adoption that we've wanted to see it yet but maybe it's something like an aggregator that is really what needed to happen to make this done the next one is element uh doing a big boy raise okay so 30 32 million dollars in a series a round led by polychain and a16z but the valuation here is 320 million dollars for d5 protocol and what these guys are doing is they're sort of um splitting the principal in an interest rate uh and and they're they're making it so that um you can essentially get like a fixed rate you know all of the default loans you get from compound or ave they're all variable rate and element is changing it so that many of these things can be a fixed rate but that's a big valuation and pretty impressive that they're able to command that another x consensus individual i believe behind this uh super exciting to see yeah we've had them on the show before uh so an old state of the nation if you want to go find out more about element also really pioneering into a brand new governance model which has gotten a lot of praise from people that i really like in this industry like mariana conte we should mention that david and i are investors in the like all three of those protocols actually we believe uh we believe in them that much um also david polygon they're getting a bitwise invest fund so that is happening bitwise of course is the largest indexing organization i suppose they're they're they're centralized of course but now they're launching a polygon fund primarily to invest in polygon ecosystem of applications what's happening here basically it's just a wrapper around the matic token and then making it available for institutional investors who want to invest in the bitwise fund so i mean there's a ton of hype around matic there's a ton of like growing adoption of matic and so manic token in the same way that ether is a great tool to get exposure to basically everything that happens on ethereum matic is simultaneously a great token to get exposure to everything that happens on matic and now you can get that exposure if you are a legacy tradify boomer investor and just want bitwise to do all the hard work for you uh you can so there's actually going to be just like it's a great bridge it's better to do that than nothing right the worst thing you could do is just sit out of these markets for sure because uh you know so if you can't do a meta mask then do this is what i say okay so also some funds david so um the first is variant that's a fund we've been pretty excited about we've had jesse from variant on the podcast before they just launched another 110 million dollars fund i think this is either their second either second or their third they've also added some new talent whom we've also had on the podcast lee jin talk about that uh we actually had both of them on the podcast on a panel at the same time talking about the ownership economy also on that panel was cooper turley who was an advisor for the variant fund so now all these three friends are just now running a fund together focusing on building out the creator owner economy uh and so they are have always been bullish on this industry so congratulations the variant fund uh just becoming an absolute giant galaxy digital interactive is also raising 325 million uh as well david any comments on this another fund a16z you know polychain continues to raise all of multi coin as well like there's so many we can't even list them all but um everyone is raised all of these funds are raising money and they're doing that on the back of these massive successes and he takes on this uh galaxy race yeah the galaxy is of course mike novogratz fund who has been as bullish as anyone on this base and also been here for a while beating the same drum uh we we're big fans of mike novogratz if anyone knows him and can get him on the show please connect us so we've been trying uh anyways moving on answer our emails mike just do that uh the crypto banks are raising too look at this david 420 million dollars and this is a mimetic number uh 420 million 690 thousand dollars from 69 investors this is ftx raising at a 25 billion dollar valuation so uh you know sbf just continues to to grow pretty incredible raises here not surprising that ftx is now worth 25 billion so like coinbase is i don't know 60 billion it's 60 70 yeah i don't know what binance is i i heard rumor that binance was trying to raise at one point in time earlier this year at 300 billion dollars which is but like big money i mean these are some of the largest banks in the world now and they're crypto banks pretty crazy how funny was it that we were last week talking about how sam itself reportedly is doesn't really believe in crypto and he just has the most nihilistic number of of a raise for his company at 420 million 690 000 from 69 investors like it's he's in the right industry to do that but like come on like you have ftx behind you can you take things seriously please it's memes all the way down david you know this so uh yeah good good for them on that race but crypto banks continue to to raise and they're all in a competition to to raise funds and increase their value of course the there's so many raises david you and i can't even keep up look uh candy digital no it's a casual no clue who these are it's an nft startup okay so look at this line nft startup candy digital raises 100 million dollars in a series a round okay so it's a group we've not heard of it's a startup and they're raising a hundred million dollars at a 1.5 billion dollar valuation like on a unicorn insta unicorn by their series a how is this happening uh softbank i think might be the answer there they're they're involved but but yeah like it's crazy the one thing to take away from this is like the nft industry is so incredibly large that things are happening that even the the crypto community isn't being aware of this is like a part of the nft world that's just invisible to us because it's so many people that just are not connected to us or the other take is that damn like things are getting real frothy people are raising way too much way too early uh maybe both are true both might be true peyton manning was in on this one if not some of the you know crypto natives that that we kind of know but um that's what's going on like nfts are going mainstream the last raise we'll we'll mention here as a category is the mining category and this is a mining company called stronghold they just raise 121 127 million dollars in an ipo absolutely uh insane astounding look man how how much did we just cover and i bet we covered like 10 to 15 of the raises that happened this week but it's happening across like funds crypto banks nft market defy base level protocols mining companies it's happening not just in crypto there are all of these subcategories that now have multi like unicorn level companies inside of them wrapped around them that's how big crypto has gotten in the last 18 months or so and and that's just the ones that we know about exactly uh one thing we do know of course is this is the weekly reminder for you to get a job in crypto get a job get a job in crypto guys i know some people listen when we say this david because not a week goes by that i don't hear from somebody who's like oh i listened to what you said i actually got a job in crypto thank you very much for that right thank you for the kick in the butt you kick in the butt sometimes that's what you need right and or an opportunity to explore and we have the bankless jobs board where you can explore some of the opportunities that bankless has listed i'll mention if you a cto from uh e agro agronomy god i'm gonna grow agronomy thank you thank you david uh general counsel at smart d5 finance and operations guru at smart d5 as well senior backend engineer you can also be a blockchain cto at merit a community manager at argonne a founding blockchain engineer at highlight and a senior software engineer at popcorner community lead of course the senior front and web developer is open as well that's not even like a fraction of all of the job opportunities that we have on this board people from the ethereum foundation they're hiring a team lead some people from gauntlet we've had them on the podcast everybody is on this board go check out the board uh go scroll if there's a job that fits your skill set and description something that piques your interest and then go hit the subscribe button so you see updates and we don't have to remind you every week you'll actually get an email when a new job uh launches that you might be interested in you can just get these automated reminders to get a job no one comes into crypto gets a job in crypto and he's like i regret this so just like just let that be known it does not happen has not happened never met a single person impossible impossible absolutely okay guys now let's get to the main event news items david let's start here man bitcoin etf this is history it's been eight years in the making all right the winklevoss twins all the way back in 2013 they started this they first applied for a bitcoin etf in 2013. hoping that the market was ready to get some retail exposure to etfs didn't happen year after year after year didn't happen eight years later it finally happened okay so walk us through this david what's what's going on with this new bitcoin etf what is it yeah the pro shares b-i-t-o futures-based bitcoin etf using the cme uh um cme for the price reference rate uh and so uh congratulations we finally got the bitcoin etf yay how happy are you about there's a big asterisk uh there's a big difference between a futures-based etf and a spot-based etf and while we are happy that we have a bitcoin etf the game is not up it's just a start because okay what's the difference okay so the future a few bitcoin futures offered by the cme they have monthly contracts that end at the end of every single month the last day of the month or the last trading day of the month i think that's how it works uh and so there's one for october that'll be up in like 10-ish days there's one for uh what's the month that comes after november december january for the next six months every there's it's a rolling six months and then there's also the next december and then also the december after that so you can pick like which which date do you want to make your bet about the the future price of bitcoin sounds good right and there was recently a report that was submitted to the sec saying that the few on the onshore cme futures markets are actually driving the price discovery of bitcoin over the spot markets which i'm a little bit confused about but i'll take it on faith because because people who write that report snow way more than me the the problem with this as a etf model is that the way that the etf works is that it tracks the price of the most the next coming futures exchange so like if we if it was like november uh second right uh the etf would be tracking the futures price of the next month and they it would be rolling in to every single as the contracts the futures contracts settle because it resettles once a month every every month it rolls into the next uh the next futures month uh and so there's these things this thing's called contango where there's actually a discrepancy between uh the bitcoin futures price of one of month one to month to two so like say for example the bitcoin futures of month one is is uh clocking in at sixty thousand dollars and then the next month people futures traders have predicted that it's going to be 62 000 the etf will sell all of the 60 000 valuations of bitcoin into 62 000 valuations of bitcoin and they will actually lose shares along the way of course that this can actually happen in reverse so in theory it cancels out over time but really what this does is this allows a bunch of middlemen and traders and who want to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity to just kind of milk out just the leakage of value out of this etf right so like do you know how to trade around terms like contango like is that something that you know how to do because other people do and other people are taking advantage of this but you basically all you have to do is you just like the value of an etf is that it's in a brokerage right so it's in somebody's schwab account their fidelity account they don't have to open up coinbase you just buy it with all their other stocks they buy the etf but what you're saying is because it's a futures etf and not a spot etf it's less capital efficient for them to do so and it's more expensive for them to do so versus a spot etf right the best thing you can do of course is get over the hump go open an account at gemiini or coinbase and just buy spot market and let like them custody it and then graduate into you know going bank list that's the best thing you can do but if you're locked into a retirement account an etf is the second best the problem is this etf is a futures based etf it's not a spot based etf and so it's more expensive for you you're actually losing money versus buying bitcoin in in a spot market on something like coinbase is that right yeah that's exactly right so if you are interested in just buying and holding btc bitcoin on your traditional brokerage this is actually just not you're going to lose money over time than if you had just bought actual bitcoin uh and so that actually just puts people that actually compliantly can't go actually buy bitcoin at a disadvantage because they have to pay all these fees all these uh these traders their arbitrage opportunities uh where they could have just done a spot driven market and the difference is a very important difference about a spot driven market is that when people buy a spot driven market etf that etf goes out and buys bitcoin and puts it on the balance sheet right there's actually bitcoin there and so etf demand is actual bitcoin demand and so this a whole futures base etf if if it has a ton of demand it might not actually translate to actual bitcoin demand or at least it will it will but it won't be immediate in a roundabout way in a very roundabout way and really that roundaboutness puts money into the hands of intermediaries and scalpers and like when it comes to the sec who approve this by the way what is their job their job is to protect investors and so they are just shoveling investors into the place that they just get scalped like what the hell dude it's it's it's not the best etf uh absolutely right i mean the thing that they could have done is just approved a spot bitcoin etf i guess the argument is that this is a step in that direction and this is a more gated regulator-friendly type approval because they know all of the intermediaries all of the incumbents that are you know are doing this uh so i guess it's a big deal that they did approve it right that is a step in and of itself that the government came and said okay fine you can have your bitcoin etf after eight years of retail asking for it the question is how long will it take them to get to a spot etf which is much more are we going to have to wait another eight years god i hope not are they going to use this as like a defense like we already gave you your etf why do you need another one also i really want an eth etf i mean if we have bitcoin etf then where's our eth etf that should be coming down the pike too so it's kind of like it's good news but it's also a little bit like come on we could do better can't we i hope this is just the first step uh one thing that sec tweeted out shortly before approving this this is the week before i guess is a reminder before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts make sure you carefully wear the way the potential risks and benefits this is what this is the tweet that tipped everyone off like oh my gosh there's an etf coming yay i i just think that there are some hidden risks and hidden costs that this type of structure doesn't actually tell you about and it would be nice if those were acknowledged as well in this kind of a warning um i think in summary like we can zoom out and say oh the etf that got approved is the one that is exactly what the incumbents and and the the current institutions would want the most and benefits them the most uh shocker weird but like this is this makes sense because regulators know the incumbents they know how to regulate them they know how to you know put the stranglehold on them if they need to and all of these new entrants are outside of their control right so they feel much less comfortable so who are they going to let do it they're going to let kind of their friends the existing organizations whom they already already regulate do this um i mean but we want spot we want spot etf spot we want spot we want [ __ ] uh great great scale wants grace right right so grayscale has made a big etf push filing to turn their gptc fund into a btc and the ticker name filed for bit ticker name btc etf uh and so they are taking this opportunity to take they took opportunity by the horns and they are now making a very political move saying like hey give us the spot market give us a smart market so more power to grayscale well it it it's interesting because it puts regulators in this position where they're kind of king making right i was like we're going to approve these etfs but not these etfs right and so what's what's the set of criteria by which they'll prove someone's etf and i think that's where grayscale is like hey people are buying our trust anyway we have massive amounts of bitcoin inside of this thing why not just make this an etf let's make it official all right david second news item of the day is the coinbase nft platform we talked about it we mentioned it last time that it was coming that was the news last week the news this week is that we have more details on this let me rattle a few more details coming out because this could be absolutely massive i think in the nft space as far as mainstreaming nfts even that much more the coinbase nft platform will be open so it's not going to be an invite-only platform okay we do know that we also know that the coinbase nft platform will rely on decentralized storage solutions like ipfs rather than centralized service so clap clap clap more decentralized better um you can mint nfts on coinbase and sell them anywhere else okay so they're not going to do this weird lock-in that maybe some other platforms do maybe a flow i don't know list any non-coinbase nfts as well so they're opening this thing up another smart move i think you will be able to use different currencies and different wallet solutions they're not going to lock you into the coinbase proprietary wallet app store experience thank god also coinbase nft is going to start with support for ethereum good move and also plans to support minting in markets across other chains as well look that's all good news this makes them a bit more like you know open c i think custodial open c that's basically what it is a custodial open speed and i don't know i think you'll have the option to do it custodially or non-custodially it sounds like as well like i think a lot of this minting is going to happen directly on ethereum i don't know the coinbase wallet is non-custody as well so i don't know about because because um you know custody versus non-custody they'll definitely have a fiat bridge as we talked about last week which will give them an advantage too anyway if they're non-custodial it's really the custodial nature of this that is the actual value add right because we actually don't have a custodial nft platform and uh there's just going to be so many more people who are ready to want to get into nfts but don't really want care about crypto and coinbase is a solution for them i think that the value add is just the uh making this easy right they provided the easy button for bitcoin you buy it back in like you know 2013 2014 and they they did that for eth now they're doing that for uh nfts which is a good move and they're also mainstreaming it so this is a breaking announcement huge okay coinbase is now partnering with the nba women's nba league as well like all of the subsidiary nba and i believe david though correct me if i'm wrong this is like a a brand marketing ip type relationship right so coinbase nft platform nba partnership means they can license uh nba's ip right so they could create their own i guess version of nba top shots or maybe whatever else the nba and coinbase have in store this almost went under the radar last week i guess well maybe this is like you know 10 000 likes but um this is huge don't you think it's a very big deal yeah just collecting the ip from these massive massive ecosystems which are basically all based on ip anyways uh really nice victory really nice w on on coinbase and uh and wherever coinbase puts these nfts and i think they'll be able to just let the user deploy the nfts where on whatever training they want maybe um so yeah anything and everything crypto related from the nba is now coinbase so congratulations this is one up on sbf who you know put uh ftx's name on on some um uh stadium recently right where was that uh miami miami miami okay that's right that's right and also all the empires of the mlb well let's talk about this wu-tang clan forever wu-tang foreign what happened here wu-tang and pleaser dal okay that's made in heaven the the story here is there's a there's a famous mysterious wu-tang album of which there is only one of if there's one cd and it got sold i think for it got auctioned off for two million dollars as kind of like a middleman towards the the or excuse me a middle finger towards the middlemen of the music industry this was before blockchain this was before crypto so what are we talking about uh i can't remember like 96 something like that uh i don't know um so yeah they they auctioned off their only their one-of-one album that they produced the the wu-tang produce and album uh yeah that was it yeah and this guy martin shkreli who's this hedge fund manager who you got everyone might remember for going to jail in 2017 for securities fraud and he's just the guy he's the guy that jacked up the price of an epipen from like 16 cents to 750 dollars like he's literally this hedge fund insurance guy like villain super villain hated by the internet and he has all these douchebag videos of him uh listening to the wu-tang album and he's like i'm going to destroy this just because i can and then he also says um uh uh some reporter asked him hey are you ever going to let anyone else listen to the wu-tang album and the guy with like this anger in his face goes absolutely not there's no way yeah the guy's just really mean like to say he's just a cartoon villain he's just being literally that's great he's a cartoon villain and he's also in jail now for securities fraud he'll be in jail for 2024 and because he had to pay off his debts uh for this fine that he got for securities fraud he had to auction off the wu-tang album and so pleaser dao bought it pleaser dao bought the wu-tang so there there's jameis right there who's the chief pleasing officer over at pleaser dow taking a photo of the one of one famous wu-tang album that has never been released to the public and jameis i know and pleaser dao has a ton of plans as to what to do with this uh here here's a picture of them and a bunch of other pleaser dial members as well dude this story is such an amazing story uh so congratulations to james congratulations to pleaser dao uh of which i'm a member um here's your take as well what's the juxtaposition here yeah so so this this story got onto the front page of the rolling stone uh and rich who uh used to work at maker dow an old friend of mine said this might be the first time i've ever read a trad media crypto story that wasn't dripping in sarcasm or ending with a smug and alarmist hot take this is a significant shift talking about the tone of the rolling stone article and so i followed i guess it's like because crypto are the heroes the crypto people are watching that right this dude's hand so here's my take on this i said the juxtaposition of a dow of homies buying a rare cultural artifact from the hands of a scumbag hedge fund manager is exactly the kind of positive pr that crypto needs oh more of that energy please yeah that's cool this is the how it started how it's going right so here's the story of pleaser dao where layton from pool together uh tweets out anyone want to create a quick dial to bid on this this being people pleasers una swap v3 x times y equals k uniswap animation uh and so leighton just tweeted this out a bunch of people said yes i do uh they all hopped into a dow they pooled their funds there's a great story we ran it on bank list forever ago about it uh and that started off pleaser dao which it was a doubt that was created to buy people pleasers art and then pleaser dao went from just a dao of people that wanted to buy that one thing into a dao with people that wanted to buy like all the cultural artifacts so edward snowden nfts are in there the doge nft is in there we had jameis on a state of the nation to talk about this now the physical asset the wu tang one of one mysterious album is now property of pleaser dao and i know that there are plans in the pleaser dao uh world to actually open this up so let me actually read out uh something that james said in the uh in the rolling stones uh article piece of pleaser dao has grand but loosely articulated the ambitions to make the album more available to the public perhaps through listening parties or gallery style exhibit exhibitions or even to expand ownership of the album two fans although how that would work would remain up in the air we believe that we can do something incredible with this piece said jameis to enable it to be shared and ideally owned in part by fans and anyone in the world again think of the juxtaposition behind the hedge fund man who's like i'm going to destroy this so no one can listen to it because i can because i my brand is being an actor because i'm rich because i'm rich and then this dow buys it and like hey we're going to allow everyone to listen to this thing like it's perfect it's such a perfect story i hope it's good after all we don't even know but uh i guess we get to find out that's really cool man very cool and exactly the kind of press i think uh crypto needs at this point in time mm-hmm um let's go to the next one so many big every one of these have been big this is really big in and of itself a polygon and draftkings have just entered into a strategic partnership so draftkings is a 40 billion dollar publicly traded company for like sports betting i believe i've never used it this is kind of outside of my area but um i believe they are going to include some of their ip and licensing like nft type forms they're going to start deploying that on polygon also i wouldn't be surprised if some of the sports betting payment networks shifted to polygon over time they're not just announcing this partnership but they're also becoming validators on the polygon network which is pretty cool and look a side chain is a great way to get started in crypto like low gas fees um you know the polygon team is is pretty good with the onboarding process it's all evm so if you ever want to go to mainnet you can quite easily but major company in a different space that we haven't seen which is sports betting now coming to crypto it's pretty cool in and of itself i really think the draftkings potentially becoming a validator to the polygon network is really something to to unpack because we all know that something like polygon is going to take a decent amount of capital to run a validating node uh they got to be like pretty beefy computers and so it's nice to pair a beefy computer with a 40 billion dollar company that has things at stake on the polygon network to lose right their own business uh and so that seems to be a really smart strategic alignment between incentives so really congratulations on the partnership polygon well deserved and i mean it gambling gambling is is and like speculation is what draftking's all about and yeah that's in our wheelhouse that's what we know about somebody we do yeah that's kind of what we do of course other people yeah i don't know yes i've known some people in crypto who have speculated a time or two let me say that that's cool you know this is also cool again almost equally uh big news i thought so do you remember in 2019 facebook was creating its own ethereum killer sort of thing uh a blockchain it was going to have a smart contract system they were launching uh something at the time that was called libra which was going to be kind of the bitcoin and eth killer on their entire new blockchain they they came out with a whole um like virtual machine that's you know comparison to the evm and a whole scripting language rather than solidity they had flow and they were just going to eat ethereum's lunch with this new facebook chain that was going to like own the entire world and bring crypto they were also inventing their own currency before libra was or or the currency was going to be a dollar stable coin but instead a basket of currencies exactly and i remember at this time david like uh the market was in the doldrums this is before d5 really took off everyone was like oh no they're going to come and destroy ethereum and bitcoin and facebook's going to be the new champion they'll have co-opted this amazing technology okay what just happened is the novi wallet from facebook which is their their wallet that like like is the user interface for this whole thing they just deployed their first stable coin they announced they're going to deploy their first stable coin david guess what it is man uh on ethereum it's an erc20 coin on ethereum weird how that works yeah don't don't fight ethereum just just succumb just like that's what just that's what they that's what they did right so it's an erc20 on ethereum this is uh not usdc it's a stable coin put out there um by paxos basically but using ethereum as the settlement network and essentially resigning themselves to an app on top of it rather than be the base layer protocol and the reason it's quite simple is something that like we predicted for a while it's just the protocol sync thesis right facebook simply does not have the credible neutrality to be a base layer system for the world for identity for uh money for finance how do we know this they can't even get their own country to like accept them okay like every time zuckerberg goes in front of you know congress it's cheap it's just like zuckerberg punching bag time it's and the reason is like maybe some of that's deserved maybe some of it's not i tend to happen like i tend to believe that like much of that is deserved but there's also politicians scoring points like i get that whole world too but like of course they can't be a credibly neutral base settlement platform for crypto right of course they can't be ethereum on the other hand is not owned by any single individual it is a public girl good for the world and of course they would use it for their staple coin their money system anyway it's just for me that was kind of full circle and um really interesting to see web 3 or web 2 can't even compete with web 3 now they are using uh protocols like ethereum as their base settlement layer it was inevitable just people didn't see it in 2018 2019 now it's becoming super obvious i think the credible neutrality is definitely an angle but i think another angle is that building out ethereum type infrastructure like nodes evms it's hard like that's not a trivial thing and like it's not like facebook doesn't have the technical talent like facebook has a lot of technical talent yeah but think about the the culture of that technical talent it's building facebook products for facebook ownership not open source software for global human coordination right so like while maybe they do have the technical talent do they have the technical ethos no they do not they have the zuck ethos they do and do you remember like they rug pulled all of their game developers remember facebook released this this open api a whole bunch of you know game developers um built on top of it and then they would sort of extort some of these games right what was the one uh the farm game do you remember this oh yeah there's all the rage yeah yeah yeah okay farmville something like that okay i never played this but anyway facebook would basically go to the game developers and be like hey you're going to do what we say like maybe we want to buy your company let's we'll just shut off our apis yeah sorry rugpull like we are the you know we are the masters this is like our platform if you don't like it see you later right no wonder no one's trusting them to do this kind of thing they've done this in the past so yeah but here's the interesting thing david is um regulators i find this just hilarious are already uh throwing punches are already fighting elizabeth warren hates it she's pissed it just went live like with this announcement and not hours later but um you know they they get a statement from uh elizabeth warren some other folks in congress who are like we gotta stop this we don't want this to happen um it's funny to me because i don't know if i'm saying elizabeth warren but it's a whole it's kind of a whole group in washington she just happens to be that like the most outspoken i think and kind of like the recognized leader of them right now i don't know if they hate facebook or crypto more right what do you think i think it's amazing when facebook and crypto collide and elizabeth warren just like wakes right up out of bed and be like something's wrong and i don't like it well what's funny is we actually would say elizabeth warren that crypto is the solution to our your your facebook problem yeah yeah just like elizabeth just thinks that crypto is what facebook is trying to make their own cryptos ecosystem into i don't know maybe i just really don't know i want some of these people to come on bank list i want them to engage in the crypto community so we could talk about them you don't like web 2 you don't like big tech you don't like silicon valley cool make it easier for web 3 to thrive so we can destroy them okay disruptive innovation put the power back in the hands of the people isn't this what we all want i hope so yeah i think we've got some solutions for that tribe they just don't realize that you've thought about these things we we have a plan we have a plan that's going to work we think it's called crypto uh david this is a funny story too this is still i guess now we're moving to nft stuff but there was a massive bid for a crypto punk um you've got a crypto punk beside you i've heard of these things okay so uh what was this bid why was it historic and what happened with this story yeah so this guy richard richard with an e instead of an a he tweets out my punk is not for sale i don't care what anyone offers me uh and and so like there's there's that line that like you know everything is for sale for the right price right uh and so the owner of po xyz uh his name's patricio he's not he's not a secret um does the most chad thing ever and offers the largest bid ever for a crypto punk so if this if richard had accepted this bid it would have been the largest crypto punk sale ever clocking in at 10 million dollars 2.5 000 eth so the guy just says like oh what do you mean like you're never gonna sell your punk like what about 10 million dollars and richard can i ask you no okay he says no what's so special about this crypto punk dude it's it's not it's not the punk it's it's like got 3d glasses so that's kind of cool but that's not the point it's not the point the cr the punk is like a medium a mid to floor punk it's not it's not special it's just that richard likes it he's the guy that owns the punk right like there's probably evaluation on my punk and i probably value it two to four times higher than that that the fair market value oh just two to four so if i offered you two to four times more than uh what it's valued you'd sell it to me yeah yeah you would yeah i'm not doing that like we're not doing that right now if you offer me two to four uh times higher than the market price for it of which i also determine um uh then yeah i tell you i sell you my punk oh my god okay so you're not never sell you're not like this guy richard well yeah what happened to a okay okay um what happened with this story yeah so so richard he did he doesn't accept the 10 million dollar offer for his punk god jpeg dude tell him okay so like i was talking to my friend about this and it's like the reason why he's doing it is because like it's cool to deny that the the offer right it's cool to say no to 10 million dollars is it well his his counter argument was like well you know what's also cool accepting 10 million dollars i just sold a jpeg for 10 million dollars in 2021. yeah yeah yeah so like this follow-up tweet coming out of richard uh i think two days later he tweets out diamond hands are not my girlfriend's best friend so he probably told his girlfriend that he declined a 10 million dollar offer what there's some some degree of maybe she just like started screaming at him or said like why would you do that some scale of just like what the hell happened uh but yeah uh that's incredible yeah all right well now we know david has a price for his crypto punk but the thing you should have said david i think is use that reverse psychology you should have you should have told me you're never gonna sell it like this guy richard then i would have valued it higher then i would have really wanted it because somebody listening to this would have really wanted it yeah ryan if you wanted to punk by now you would have gotten one you're still stuck in the turtle yeah yeah yeah it's stuck with it my turtle and i are friends okay um where are you back here it's just going really slow that's all it's not as fast as punks okay it's going to take a while to catch on look this is another big thing it's another big news event okay these could have been covered that could have been news events so far all right so what's what's this one uh so here's here's i think the headline um steam this is valve entertainment um they are banning nfts as crypto games on the steam platform which i think is the largest like gaming platform right in the community uh and then one of their competitors has something different to say why don't you talk about why are they banning crypto games yeah they they had a game that they actually removed from their platform i can't remember the name of the game but they they were on steam they had a blockchain integration they were connected into into ethereum they had nfts in the game and then they got um kicked off of the platform because steem has a has now a policy of no nfts no no financial assets inside of games is this because like all crypto is a scam david or is this because like it's maybe um maybe analyzing their business model or something maybe they don't know the like if they have a gracious angle on it maybe they just don't know the regular regulations around it so they they kicked them off before and now they're going to go do their due diligence and they're going to come back like okay we did we did the due diligence we can now accept it maybe or maybe they are just like oh yeah blockchain that's that whole scam thing like no kick them off get them out of here yeah okay um who knows who knows okay boomer story's unfolding okay yeah all right got it so then what what did their competitors say so epic had something to say yeah yeah an alternative gaming platform epic says we we love nfcs and financial assets inside of games come build your financial asset games on our platform uh and so that story is going to unfold and it's going to be interesting to watch look this is the game theory of it though this happens at the nation-state level right so like china the u.s neither of them like crypto china bans crypto u.s says oh we love crypto now right i'm not saying it's happening exactly that way but that is like what happens when you have multiple parties who don't have unlimited power they can't unilaterally ban something and if they ban it just locally to their own economy then they give all of their competitors a massive advantage and it just forces them into a situation where they have to end up capitulating and accepting this the only question is how long will it take steam to do that will they go through a year of pain two years of pain will they go and they try to build their own like blockchain network that is the steam blockchain will they waste all of this time and money or will they just get on board with what's happening in crypto in these open finance uh protocols that's up for steam and you know for for gabe like where's half-life three that's all i wanna know yeah maybe maybe they're doing some digital assets and half-life three who knows oh you think so you think that's happening oh david let's talk about this while we're talking nfts ross albrecht what is he doing uh from jail from a jail cell with nfts yeah russ ulrich the renowned dread pirate robert from the silk road the very peaceful libertarian who believed in what he was doing and got sent to jail for i think two lifetimes uh for running a uh an illegal marketplace using bitcoin all back in 2013. he's been in jail ever since but he uh has this twitter account that his mom runs real ross at you ross ulbricht and he says we are auctioning off some of my art as an nft the proceeds will go towards charities that help prisoners and their families and towards helping me regain my freedom one project we envision is to help kids travel to visit their mom and dads in prison um so cool ross albrecht getting into nfts from jail yeah very free ross free ross uh also not a bitcoin maxwellist i guess yeah using these other i don't think ever was yeah i you know uh yeah um okay andrew yang what's what's he up to man okay so we had him on the podcast we made this joke toward the end right yeah because he started talking about hey i really think this podcast is a historic occasion because it's the first time that andrew yang has been on a crypto podcast been on bankless and also it's sort of the first time where we've had a politician with uh some name presence just do like the crypto handshake give krypto the handshake and be like hey guys i'm you know i support crypto and i'm gonna like let the world know that publicly and anyway we had this joke and we said hey if this is a momentous occasion what we should do is create an nft and we threw that back to the community and said hey community if anyone you know wants to create a an nft at the end of the show go do it and somebody did it actually this is um a crypto wife i believe she's known on and she makes all sorts of memes for bank lists for the communities it's a fantastic artist and she created this meme for andrew yang so uh take us from there david then what happened yeah we we got also got andrew yang andrew yang.eth we uh teamed up with brantley milligan got into a zoom with andrew connected him with his first ens name andrew yang.heath so andrew yang.eth actually minted this nft and this nft auction actually just closed about 30 minutes ago and it sold for 6.9 eth so staying true to the memes i guess we're not taking things seriously today uh 28 thousand dollars to the forward party so really like a nice step a nice gracious gesture to the crypto world saying hey i'm here i mean i'm in it like i'm doing these things i got andrew yang.ed minted my nft donating to the forward party uh so really really pretty cool yeah i'm glad that you know somebody did that somebody stepped that uh up and you know 70th is not uh 6.9 eat excuse me is is not a small figure so twenty-eight thousand dollars uh and somebody gets this fantastic nft so more politicians will be coming to crypto crypto will be coming to politics um this is going to happen and i think this is just the start of all of this for the listeners out there the nfc just has a bunch of tip of the hats towards uh towards the the greater crypto you can't see it right andrew yang has a chrome laser eyes rainbow laser eyes which i think is a nice touch he's got an ethereum and a bitcoin lapel pin and then there's a bunch of uh nft profile picture icons out there there's a cool cat there's a pudgy penguin there's a crypto punk and then we also have a bunch of the crypto media uh platforms out there uh the defiant bank list daily guay uh and then we also have tips to the hat to get coin and coin center uh and so a lot of a lot of crypto thing is being represented here yeah absolutely and you know people sometimes wonder how crypto is moving this fast like how does it accomplish so much right now we have politicians who are incented to come to crypto because they get votes maybe they get fundraising this sort of thing so do our media publications david this is the economist and they are auctioning off their magazine cover and this is actually a fantastic grab article is called down the rabbit hole the promise and perils of decentralized finance the first article the economist i've ever read that actually portrayed a pretty accurate picture of what defy is and now they're auctioning that off what's really interesting about it is we've said this before it goes to you know it applies to all of our listeners crypto literally pays you to learn about crypto okay it pays politicians to advocate for crypto it pays media companies to put crypto as the title as the heading of their magazine cover okay crypto has a built-in incentive mechanism to spread itself to propagate itself it's almost like a life form okay it's almost like an advanced intelligence that is working through the meme layer of humanity and propagating itself and spreading itself and has the ability to like self-replicate and produce its own energy out of human resources that's what's happening and that's what i think is the story it's like oh cool the economist released an nft well they released an nft they're going to make money on that other magazines will follow they'll produce more articles about crypto and it will escape into mainstream that's really what's happening here which i think is super cool i think another illustration for what you're saying is that water flows downstream and crypto is downstream therefore water which is society is going to flow downstream to crypto now that we've discovered crypto the natural incentives of everything is society just likes crypto once once again the most bullish thing about crypto is to be understood once you understand it you are trapped it's a virus it sucks you in the economist it caught the crypto virus it's all in it's going to spread the crypto virus to all of its neighboring magazine companies and then it's going to go from there absolutely a lot of readers of the economist too like in the traditional world institutional world uh jack dorsey he definitely has the crypto bug but i wouldn't actually say specifically a specific strain of the crypto bug yeah just bitcoin right he's immune from all other um crypto talk i think but he square is considering building a bitcoin mining system he says it's based on custom silicon an open source for individuals and businesses worldwide he has this twitter thread about what square is doing and i think the net of this is basically like hey proof of work is centralized i want to make it a bit more open source in efforts to make it less centralized we're going to create some hardware in square to do this and some specifications for hardware to do this so a noble you know effort i i i think i guess um i don't know though it's just it's still proof of work right like is it square's core competency which is payments of money like or is it something else it's funny to me just because i feel like jack gets bitcoin and then he just makes it a point just to fixate on bitcoin when like when is square going to capitulate like square squares being like valve and being like the steam platform yeah right i'm just like guys we have this whole defy thing and if you're not careful some other enterprising fintech this maybe god maybe it's paypal maybe it's even visa i don't know they're going to come and eat your lunch if you're just obsessing about like bitcoin bitcoin mining when there's this whole other experiment going on which is uh defy and ethereum and like proof of stake like you could do bitcoin but like why not also do these other things i guess to be fair with twitter they are doing more with with nfts but is square missing the boat dude they're not not yet the nft thing actually is not live you know what is live bitcoin tipping and also who do you think want like what do you think the twitter populist wants more verified nfts or bitcoin tipping like i said this last time and also at the same time we said this like two or three rollups ago the total volume transferred of ether and stable coins is dwarfing all other value ever traded in the crypto world and square you know what square is doing building bitcoin mining machines is so nonsensical square you're a payments company there's this brand new payments ecosystem you can build a roll up for your payments and hook into defy why aren't you doing this why are you focused on bitcoin mining it makes no sense i'm not even worried about it david because they'll just they'll just be fine find out later and be late to the party and like it'll happen it's just you know i guess you know some some people have to be dragged along kicking and screaming um speaking of which facebook i don't know if they're being dragged along uh kicking and streaming they're actually trying to lead the metaverse they've just hired 10 000 workers in europe to build up the metaverse they're actually talking about david um renaming their company as well okay so they haven't announced the name yet but they announced their intent to rename facebook must be because all of the negative pr that they've gotten recently um and i i would guess it would be something metaverse related you have any thoughts on like new names for facebook anything good coming to mind god it's it's such a no i don't and it's like such a duct tape fix when like you know what it really needs a reorganization is the complete internal structure and business model of facebook you can't just like slap on a new name he's like oh yeah all those people didn't see how this thing happened jesus yeah well so i asked this uh this question to twitter i was like what should the what what should the new facebook name uh be i came up with the term zuck therium which i thought was yeah somewhat clever other people said social verse okay face verse zuckerverse or my own personal favorite board ants politics club that's the new name for facebook so maybe some ideas there for uh for zuck and creo as you're thinking about this rebrand um david let's talk about this coinbase they just released a digital asset policy kind of an alternative policy to all of the bad ones that seem to be floating around governments what uh what are they saying in this policy yeah it's basically like a skeleton of a proposed they're proposing this be the way that policy happens and it's very logical very clear very straightforward makes a ton of sense i like all of it basically there are two big things there's more details in here but there are two big things is regulate digital assets under a different framework than all the previous assets of the world oh not the ones from the 1940s not the ones that we decided with pen and paper like digital assets need a digital asset framework so let's make that that's their big thing and then their other big thing is designate one regulating body for digital asset markets allocate one and they make a crypto sar a crypto czar a crypto regulator not the sec not the cftc not the treasury not the irs make the crypto regulatory body uh which just makes a ton of sense just pick one just point to someone and pick one and tell them that they're the regulator so that we can just know that can we do the third thing which is make sure that the new kryptosar is actually good remember we talked about that that guy in the white house pick your battles right how much you want to ask okay pick any two of the three ass just allow us to focus our lobbying to one direction we'll start there start there good suggestions by coinbase to be honest um there's a lot more in here so there's a link in the show notes if you want to read more yeah meanwhile i think there's a there's a an attack kind of going on from regulators versus these uh c5 centralized uh crypto bank lending companies they're coming after in particular i believe uh celsius network and also named just maybe next so yeah yeah and there's a reason why we know that they're going after this that that actually wasn't public information these uh office of the attorney general of new york released these uh documents that had redacted like names so we actually there was a privacy retained but you know what they forgot to redact the file name of the documents that they are showing so so we have in the top left corner of each document microsoft word celsius letter and then also microsoft word nexo letter they just forgot after doing all the redaction they just forgot to clear out the names these are these are the people that are regulating digital assets folks there you go well you know you got to watch those document names they'll get you every time you also have to watch uh on calendars david it's like make sure who you're sharing your calendar with like some information could get leaked you ever done that i did not know that that was a thing from experience okay from experience careful you put on your calendar yeah so i mean i think the the attack has has kind of begun a lot of these companies have um raised some war chests i'd say lately i can't recall i seem to recall a recent celsius raise there's so many but like blockfi did recently as well and so these companies are going to fight this this is only in new york the question is does the contagion spread do other states join in this my guess is you'll have some states maybe like a state of texas certainly wyoming that will say fine new york doesn't want it we'll take it right and that is the beautiful thing about again this game theory playing out and krypto winning in the end so all the short-term stuff is uh is fun also i will say like there are some things regulators could do to help us with these c5 companies right because this is not d5 we can't right click open source and understand exactly where our interest rate is coming from on celsius or blockfire nexo right we can do that in uh in d5 but it's not d5 so where there's a trusted intermediary there is some role for regulators to play so let's be fair on that let's just not like shut things down let's without providing clarity i mean it's a great it's a great pairing if centralized intermediary then regulation because that's what we need to be regulated right so those two things go hand in hand what we get frustrated about is when there is no central intermediary there's just this application in some people we pretend there is but we pretend there is and therefore we try and regulate it that's where things get get iffy help us cryptozar we know you're out there hopefully maybe maybe a bankless listener is going to be the future kryptos are well in australia they're doing some things right though uh it seems like at least there's i believe this was um a report that uh the australian parliament has issued and uh they called for an overhaul of basically their regulatory clarity with respect to crypto um they called for new laws to govern daos to centralize autonomous organizations an overhaul of capital gains tax and defy a tax discount when crypto miners are using renewable energy i don't know if these ideas will actually be implemented but this is what it looks like folks it's not that hard right the the crypto industry is asking for some very simple things you know clarity above all but like also some friendlier treatment of this industry as a whole like make it a home in in your country make the industry feel like you are welcoming it as you welcome the internet as a new technological innovation all the people that support it hopefully australia is heading in that direction and providing an example to uh to other western countries it's just very sensible uh legislation here agreed i i want that for myself you won that in the united states do you want to move to australia no not really time zones are tough yeah yeah a great place with time zones right uh poor anthony susana all the way over there yeah he's on a lockdown outside today so congratulations to him that's great that's good news uh hey talk about this this is happening in the financial sector in new york what's this showing this picture yeah so not the first time that this has happened but definitely the biggest statue to get dropped in in front of the nyse there's this famous bull in front of the new york stock exchange uh once upon a time i think after the 2008 crisis there was that that like you know five six seven year old statue of a girl who's like very defiantly putting her hands up on her hips against the bull kind of a a statement against like the one percent versus 99 um now there is this massive ape that got dropped right in front of this bowl so we have this bowl and this ape just staring each other down and in addition to that a ton of bananas got thrown around the bowl uh and so this was it done this is a tip of the hat to for those that remember harambe the uh the gorilla that unfortunately had a young child uh fall into its pit and the gorilla was like you know taking playing with a child hanging out with a child uh very very fearful parents as this girl could absolutely just rip this child apart with one hand and so harambe was shot by shot dead by the caretakers so that the child wouldn't be killed and there wouldn't be a bunch of like you know court lawsuits uh and then this uh harambe ape got just you know martyred by the internet and then now a beloved internet icon and so this artist came and made a harambe statue and dropped it in front of wall street but like there was no connection to like wall street bets or ape culture but it's one of those things like not no official connection but it's one of those things like they knew they knew there's now a massive ape in front of the stock market just feel like this has just nailed the zikaist of being this new era that we've entered into right like the stock market is is neither bull nor bare it's ape now it's right and and harambe like he was killed by the institutions wasn't he right not doing anything wrong right okay just being in the park playing with a kid yeah i mean and inside of a zoo like what's the metaphor there like captured be in a cage and just like trying to live his life i don't know there's there's metaphors on metaphors and the fact that this is a stare down between the bull and the ape i think wow this is how we're entering the 2020s folks this is what it is this is the new era agriculture perfect i keep on seeing uh saying that crypto is moving closer to society and society's moving closer to crypto well if there's a goddamn ape in front of the stock market that's a clear sign that society and crypto are coming closer and closer it's just and it's not like we're advocating like uh ape culture and degeneracy here right which is what's what the monetary policy is incentivizing you've made a mockery yeah of your markets of your markets you've made a mockery of it central banks people in charge institutions and so how can you expect us to take it seriously right like the whole meme stock phenomenon the whole gme phenomenon we could go on but this is brilliant i love this art anyway uh let's go through some quick hits david here we go it takes okay the cboe acquires aeris x so this is the uh cboe expanding iris x was a crypto derivatives market now they're getting a little bit bigger uh this is all very legal crypto and spot trade crypto spot trading and derivatives uh and i guess the cboe is continuing to expand through these acquisitions next up we have a society general we talked about them they're the bank third largest bank in france that recently submitted a governance proposal to make or dao they are shopping for a crypto custodian so if you are a crypto custodian and you want to be bought by a big bank uh society general that you might uh find love there yeah i find love there wow it's like classified ads i guess for uh for uh custodians blackrock's ceo says there's huge opportunities in digital currency particularly in this article he meant kind of stable coins other things non-threatening things but he's kind of in the jamie diamond camp of saying bitcoin is useless there's actually a quote in this article from jamie diamond that reminded me of where jamie dimon comments on um bitcoin this is of course the jp morgan ceo he says this makes no difference to me i don't think you should smoke cigarettes either but our clients are adults they disagree that's what makes markets i love that he compares owning bitcoin to smoking cigarettes my god one of those things gives you cancer the other just gives you more money jamie diamond capitulating to the market i guess all right what's next david uh una swap hires a former obama spokesperson as head of communications and regulatory conversations around defy swirl in dc interesting you swap getting political as well d5 getting political axi is now a top 500 website in the us site ranked 476. actually definitely going mainstream also with that global appeal guys we will be right back with the takes of the week these are some hot takes and of course the meme of the week you won't want to miss it but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrum and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many default applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrary and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defy apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space all right guys we are back with the takes of the week the first one from medvan he says this today's nfts are the cave paintings of the metaverse i like that analogy cave painting of the metaverse very early on yeah you think jpegs or excuse me nfcs of the future are just going to be jpegs think again i think again all right these are just this cave painting times we're gonna we're gonna evolve from here uh medvan with another take i bought my first bitcoin on coinbase in 2013. many will buy their first nft on it too this goes back to the story we're talking about this is uh a mainstream moment i think for nfts and coinbase is gonna be right there helping to onboard the world matt two for two with great takes good job matt good week another nft take why don't you read this one david from adam sacks yeah this was great uh adam sack says look nfts are a scam but websites that give you that get you to post your hard work for free in exchange for hearts and likes that's the real stuff that's amazing what a great way to describe all of social media we do all of this stuff for free i suppose we don't even own the property on top of it we're just renting you ever think about that david like your twitter account is not your twitter account rented something that you're borrowing from uh i'm making more and more valuable although i don't have ownership over it no equity sir it's not even a twitter account you're just a renter and web2 social media are our landlords our surfs yeah let's talk about this dow to dao is going to be the new b2b this is anon intern not going to make it i can't doubt a doubt i can't hear like one time of a dow spinning up without them being like okay here's our sorry here's our token swap targets like i want to do a token swap with this dao and that dao and that dao and it just makes this mesh network of doubt alignment incentives it makes it very like hard to rip right when when bridges are built and they're built sturdily it's it's hard to rip that ecosystem yeah it is yeah every dow launches with like five or ten like different partnerships basically or like you know that's the very first thing you do and dowse can't really work well with non-digital organizations either that just doesn't work so we're talking about a new dow economy b2b by the way for folks i'm familiar that stands for business to business which is a whole like industry sub sector of course and now it's going to be dow to dow these are the new capital formation uh entities david here's the take from you i'm i'm going to read this one right here first oh really i have to do okay this is from david greiter yeah i had him on the podcast once before that's right david hey david i hope you're listening david says what is the total addressable market for crypto uh what if the total addressable market for crypto rather isn't digital gold or the internet sector what uh if it's all government spending so he's saying what if the total adjustable market size is different we always talk about like 8 trillion in gold that's what bitcoin is going to be worth or we we compare it to the internet and he's saying what if it's all government spending and then you replied and you said i think tam for crypto is just everything to be honest so what do you mean by this yeah everyone loves to play that game it's like oh yeah here's bitcoin's valuation it should be at least gold here's ethereum's valuation it should at least at least be all the fang stocks uh like here's how much the government's in debt bitcoin should dude the total addressable market for crypto is every financial asset that exists we are going to consume everything we are literally a better financial asset platform exchange network than anything that's ever come before it so if you don't think some any valuable asset isn't going to find a token on ethereum to embody it you're wrong the the total addressment addressable market for crypto is everything that has value are you going to limit that just to the earth david or you would you expand that to the solar system to the galaxy to the multiverse are we talking the total addressable market size of like all of the possible universes in existence is that how big this is i'm i'm not an expert on interplanetary block production and propagation i don't know like it's it's run up against some speed of light issues it's eight minutes to get to the moon i don't know how fast an ethereum block can get there for actually make make a network work but um once we solve that problem yes if once we solve that problem yeah then the value of the sun will be a token on ethereum watch watch for david's next piece on the total address theory is the settlement layer for the multiverse it's called interplanetary settlement layer absolutely this is uh ryan selkis's tweet i love this one he says we need a u.s regulatory agency that will protect investors from the other u.s regulatory agencies a little snarky kind of fun but going back to how we want to say cryptos are just centralize all the regulatory energy into one place so we can just all focus there i mean that's what coinbase says but what if we don't like the person what if we don't like the guys doing that then we can all yell at him collectively rather than having to split our energies between warren yellen genzler like no just making one person that we get to be the person to yell at apply pressure yeah but ideally it's that number three it's somebody who's good yeah back to that hopefully we'll see where we get okay those guys those are the takes uh for the week or do we have another no next we have memes but before we do take uh what are you excited about david what are you excited about uh i think that this a whole wu-tang album thing i think is just such a great microcosm of what i want to see happen moving forward i want to see daos make a bunch of pr statements and br pr moves that get picked up and reported on that are in direct opposition in direct contrast like positive yeah positive contrast to the to the rest of the world right like the opposite of the the parasite guy that's an analogy in that like the the parasite guy who jacked up the um price of epipens right exactly terrible pr right for wall street for you know hedge fund managers and big finances people hate them you want the opposite of that to happen right you're like no i want to dow to to distribute ownership of this prize cultural artifact that is like a meme about how it's a wild garden and break down those walls and share it with everyone share the culture share the value the way that and this is how i think crypto is going to mainstream itself in terms of cultural acceptance is that we fix all of the problems that society has story by story there's a meme that we ran about a number of roll-ups ago it was like uh actually like a broken existential crisis about the future of the world there was a big crack in the asphalt and there was a band-aid uh spanning the crack and the band-aid was labeled a dow with the homies right like we have the answers and we just need these stories to propagate through the rest of the world to show the world that hey we can fix stuff here in crypto crypto is here to help you live your life uh and i think this is the first story of many i kind of see uh specifically with pleaser dow but also with these cultural artifacts it's like crypto is building this arc and daos are going to like buy up all the cultural icons all the cultural stories and get them on the ark to make them part of the digital world i think that's gonna be kind of cool do you know what's so so interesting about that that hope and that aspiration though is it depends so much on the layer zero which is the people layer okay right because um some people can be [ __ ] right and some people are not some people are good people they you know see pie expanding things they are altruistic right and so our layer zero has to be awesome it can't be full of like wall street [ __ ] i'm not saying all and you know wall street people are [ __ ] i'm saying that there are many [ __ ] for them okay so how do we prevent that because there are a lot of you know parasite your parasitic individuals who've come to crypto and are looking to scam individuals we we see very much this countervailing force of individuals who are here for the long term but like it's not a given i mean crypto could become at the layer zero just as toxic as you know organizations and interests and entities that have atrophied in the real world and like that's why our layer zero is incredibly important to protect like we have to create a culture of like doing good for the world if we want this industry to be successful and sustaining like for generations and it's not a given like we actively have to make that choice i think uh yeah what's your thought what do you think i have a ton of thoughts on that and this is actually kind of like one of the subjects of one of the articles i'm trying to write we have this open public transparent ledger and that transparency because everyone can see everyone else doing stuff that transparency in my mind actually incentivizes open collaborative transparent nature in the society that arounds these things right uh because we incentivize collaboration collaboration on chain uh you know money legos we incentivize collaboration off chain in the layer zero and so there's this culture at least in the ethereum world there's this culture of like everyone checking on everyone else to make sure that everyone else is being good it's like we're making we're a society around ethereum is a collaborative society and when somebody does something wrong that we don't like everyone acknowledges that and knows that and it's like a it's a social checking system social collateral social clout uh and we have this society that is like trying to guide people into this positive sun some collaborative like honorable like society around ethereum and i think the nature of a transparent blockchain actually incentivizes that well to the extent we are able to do that i think we will create a lasting movement that is uh that is good for the world so uh let's hope and that's definitely why we're here um for sure and i know many bankless listeners are here for those reasons as well absolutely ryan what are you excited about i'm just gonna say all-time high man feeling good what a great week right it was a great week it was a great week i feel like um you know this time uh eth has earned it right i i i felt in 2017 like something was off it felt very bubbly like there wasn't a lot of substance behind what was going on right there was definitely something there was a vision and a promise and a hope but there wasn't substance this time we have substance uh the the 2021 bull run has been just you know phenomenal um i think it's you know going to continue in the future one of the last things i'll say and you know what i'm excited about this week is actually after our conversation that we recorded this week with eric peters new podcast by the way comes out on monday for podcast listeners this is with um a guy who made the the largest institutional purchase of bitcoin and ether in 2020 so this is kind of a traditional hedge fund and he really um set all of my worries about regulating regulators and nation state destroying crypto to rest uh so tune in to that episode to hear exactly why but just with a very pragmatic approach i think from time to time in my crypto journey i've always been worried like oh you know are the regulators going to come squash this thing is the nation state going to like disallow it are they going to ban it and um eric doesn't think that's very likely in fact he thinks that there are a number of escape hatches that like prevent that from being the case so i i guess what i'm saying is um i'm feeling good all-time high everyone enjoy the bull run it's going to be fine it's going to be fun uh we'll probably get more regulatory fud other sorts of you know flood that's coming the future that's fear uncertainty and doubt don't worry about this think about the long term in the long run i've never been more bullish and i've never felt more that crypto is completely inevitable so that's what i'm excited about this week man yeah this will be the second time i reviews the water flows downstream metaphor like the regulators are just trying to stop water flowing downstream eventually water finds its way around the dam like it'll get around it yeah absolutely um all right david mean of the week time we've got two hot ones this week two hot meals let's do this one i love our listeners yeah well you i feel spoiled by this meme why don't you uh talk about it okay so this meme went was just went around the whole world i had like three of my friends uh show me this meme on instagram that's how i know it's it's a big deal because all my normie friends sent it to me so this is um frodo uh leaning over gollum's shoulder while gollum sits at a computer looking at a picture of the ring the the lord of the rings ring and frodo says to gollum you can't own the precious physically but you can pay to have your name listed as its owner in an online distributed database oh my god it's definitely a knock on nfts but i think it's in in jovial jest it's totally hilarious and gullum's got this like incredulous look on his face he just doesn't quite get it but he's doing it anyways and doesn't know why do you have a golem voice i want you to do this i don't have a golden voice i'm not gonna i'm not gonna show my golem voice i do have one but you know that's for another podcast wow not not a crypto podcast by ryan next time maybe uh all right number two number two yeah what's this what are we looking at okay so this is that meme that's going around where there's like an iconic figure and it ends in like or really really long i really i don't get why but like this one is the tax optimizer and there's a bunch of just like like things attribute characteristics of the tax optimizer prefers selling at a loss no taxable gains thinks the tax rate is 100 did you hold that for 12 months for long-term gains only takes profits to pay taxes uh always says the words just wait for taxes wants to set you up with their accountant you should have seen the taxes i paid in 2017. um you know that's a taxable event right just a bunch of behaviors that like there are certain uh people out there you guys might might know one he's on this podcast right now okay come on man i am feeling attacked right now okay by the tact optimizer meme because this guy looks a lot like me number one and these attributes sound super familiar familiar in the way i think sometimes but uh yeah look i i think these memes are hilarious because they kind of um characterize individuals and like the tendency to go overboard on something right in a blanket in a playful fun way um and like i have definitely fallen prey to being like the tax optimizer but like there there's another trap i think which is like the crypto dude that never thinks about taxes and doesn't even factor that into any equation whatsoever right and i'm i'm always like to that person i want to say like oh are you like not going to like live in your in your country anymore are you going to like be a fugitive in the in like in the nation that you see then if you don't want those things don't piss off the irs like pay your taxes right certainly uh but there is truth in that you can't let affect the way you like trade and make decisions and if you over index on that and just care about like you know taxes and optimizing those things you're going to miss out on opportunities when i've made mistakes i've probably done that before i do have to say i'm definitely on the opposite side of the spectrum than ryan is and that is why i pay someone else to care about my taxes for me so if you are the opposite of what ryan is uh but you also don't want to go to jail and you know that you're somebody that is not a tax optimizer go find someone and pay them to care for you that's that's that's my alpha there in the words of the tactile optimizer then david i want to set you up with my accountant can i help with that all right we got it it is me guys none of this has been tax advice god knows it wasn't financial advice either ethan's risky bitcoin is risky all of d5 is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed
