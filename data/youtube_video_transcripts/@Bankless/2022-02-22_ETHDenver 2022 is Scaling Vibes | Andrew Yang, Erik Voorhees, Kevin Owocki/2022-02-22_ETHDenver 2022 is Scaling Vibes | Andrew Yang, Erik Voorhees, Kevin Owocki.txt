i love that crypto technology has allowed that kind of thing to flourish and for all this creative energy to go to these problems with technology that wasn't around a decade ago hey bankless nation welcome to another state of the nation episode david we're pre-recording this and this is uh this is all on the back of eath denver okay i uh i'm watching from afar so i'm the guy with fomo like asking you deserved fobo asking you about all of the highlights i missed at denver denver and you're the guy who went spoke at many of these events and uh can give me the eth denver experience as if i'm there that's what today's episode is gonna be about right that's exactly right we are scaling out the vibes that we all experience at eat denver across the internet by reflecting and i ideating about all of everything about youth denver it was really really cool as bangla listeners will know that i shall eat denver uh every single opportunity uh and i think the first like lesson or first like reflection that i have was that i had this kind of pseudo moment going into eat denver when i realized that this thing is like three times bigger than it's ever been before and there are so many new entrants coming into this conference and i didn't know like is this east denver going to be the same east denver that i know and love or are the new people that came in to 2021 going to actually share the same experience and share the same vibes of all the other previous ethambers that i've been to and the answer was unequivocally quite equivocally yes the vibes were not just we're not diluted but in much more instead amplified uh it was even more of the same denver that i know and love and so i'm i'm so like glowing from this whole entire conference because it was such a fantastic experience that's awesome so guys david on twitter said it was the best week of his life hands down so uh want to hear about that not even close hands down so we're gonna talk about that also we have some content for you coming up in today's show straight from eth denver so david uh what are we going to be looking at um after you and i talk about youth denver for a bit there's i think two two clips maybe two interviews that we thought were worth highlighting and we wanted to get on the bankless podcast what are the things upcoming in this this episode yeah so there were two uh panels or interviews that i hosted uh on on the main stage at youth denver uh one of them was planned one of them was not planned and i'll talk about that one second uh the first one was a a talk which we titled uh transcending individualism and collectivism and that was with kevin owaki and eric voorhees both of these two individuals are coloradians coloradians uh who are very big in crypto and think crypto can make the future better because of what crypto has to offer but they think it it does that via very different routes eric voorhees is a a very famous libertarian i think he's perhaps a libertarian thought leader is a way to describe eric before he's uh in this space we've had him on the podcast uh multiple times before both both great episodes and he's coming in on the side of individualism and kevin milwaukee is coming in on the side of collectivism saying that it's actually collectivism is how we fund public goods uh and so eric voorhees and kevin owaki have had friendly twitter spats every time every now and then they they go back and forth on twitter and debating about whether uh how to fund public goods and whether taxation is coercion or how we can fund public goods using crypto and this is a ongoing conversation between these two leaders in the cryptocurrency space and so this was the first time we've had this conversation able to be hosted in person so i was honored to be able to to moderate a friendly debate debate's not the right word but a friendly conversation between these two people that are 99.9 aligned but disagree on the priorities of how as uh society we should fund public goods so that was a fantastic conversation do you know those two are i'm actually haven't listened to this yet but those two are the archetypes for this like dichotomy i see in crypto you know the political compass uh thing you've seen that so you've got sort of a quadrant you've got the the the top two um squares of this quadrant uh you know authoritarian so the the top part is authoritarian the bottom part is more libertarian and then you've got like economic left and economic right so rather than rather than most of our political landscape is like people think of left and right but i also think like there's also the political compasses you're either authoritarian or libertarian i think of eric voorhees as libertarian right most people in crypto are in the bottom part of of this um this box inherently bottom yeah yeah inherently bottom because it's inherently anti-authoritarian but eric voorhees lives in the libertarian right uh square and uh kevin milwaukee lives in the libertarian left square right he thinks that you know there there are collective goods there are public goods and and i think at some level this can also be a dichotomy between ethereum and bitcoin you often see that breakdown though you see both uh so that's why i think it's the perfect conversation because both of those two embodied these two ideas in crypto that are unified and being anti-authoritarian but have some um you know they're a bit at odds whether we're more collectivist or more individualistic and i think that's interesting so i can't wait personally to listen to that but that's just the first content piece what's the second david yeah the second one is the unplanned piece of content which uh i was just shocked that this happened and i was i just happened to be in the right place at the right time to seize this opportunity there was a surprise guest going into east denver that uh was not on the agenda but as soon as he showed up in the room uh we cleared out the agenda for the on the main stage talk so so this man can speak and that man is none other than andrew yang decided to show up at east denver uh a few people kind of had the idea that he would come but 99.9 of the people at ethanver had no idea that andrew yang was going to be there uh and and he rolled in right through the doors and immediately just gets swarmed by everyone wanting to really oh god yeah like he it was like a dog pile of people trying to talk to andrew myself being one of them and this is right on the heels andrew andrew look at me yeah it's like hey can you like can we do it and i i lined up and made all the requests everyone else was doing um this was on the heels of me and a bankless content operations editor luke uh we're going around east denver with his camera and a microphone and i was doing these micro interviews five to ten minute interviews of people's experience that's also coming later on the bankless podcast sometime somewhere um or at least on the youtube uh and uh so we went up to andrew yang he's like andrew can we do a just a quick five to ten minute interview about like why you're here and stuff uh and some one of uh his uh posse uh was like wait do you just wanna like have that interview but on the main stage and i was like well absolutely and so we went over to the green room we went over just a quick agenda of what we wanted to talk about and then we just hopped right on stage and had a 40 minutes of just me interviewing andrew yang on stage at east denver and a little bit of a q a at the end of it uh personally an extremely surreal experience because the room got filled up and when i looked out at the crowd it was just what looked like a thousand people watching me and andrew yang on stage and andrew yang just absolutely crushed it he brought the energy he brought the excitement just like every time he talked there was applause and so i was just like dumbfounded by this opportunity and now we get to showcase it on the bankless podcast that's super cool and none of this was planned he was just like a uh he decided to come to the youth denver conference at uh at a whim just to see what's up see what the community's doing yeah well he's really found alignment with the crypto people i think in the world of politics andrew yang kind of has a tough time because of how middle of the road he is and so he's like an enemy of both sides he's not he's not democrat enough to be democrat he's not republican enough to be republican and he's fine and but the crypto people don't really identify by those terms and also andrew yang's always been a futurist and also an optimist and if there's any two qualities that crypto has it's futurists and optimists and so he's found resonance with the web 3 community and so he started what is basically a dow called lobby 3 which is what he's announcing on stage and and talks about how he finds alignment with the web 3 community he also i don't know if this was this is the first time i've heard about this but this might be alpha ryan where he talks about he talked about how the body administration in the next two weeks is going to drop an executive order that is going to i think force regulatory agencies to actually put into create clarity about our industry and so he's got wind of this executive order coming out of by the vitamin administration that's going to force clarity which is both scary because it's going to make legislation happen that is going to regulate our industry but also an opportunity because we all we also want this uh don't screw it up guys please don't screw it up i bet we'll be talking about this though yes a hundred percent yeah and andrew yang i think really kicked off that conversation at east denver so a really important conversation to listen to and the i we didn't get this in the video but this sadly was not included in the interview but when he walks up on stage uh he just does it he doesn't even wait for anyone to introduce him he just walks up on stage and grabs a microphone and goes it's andrew effing yang so sadly i think you might be able to find that in the long the long ether live stream on the youtube account uh but the sadly that that part didn't make it into that does that work for you when you walk into your room it's david evan hoffman no absolutely not people just cringe yeah all right man well uh we're going to get into those okay so guys expect a podcast in three parts first we're going to talk about some other denver vibes because i'd still want to pick your brain for a little bit then we're going to get to that eric voorhees and kevin awakey conversation and then the andrew yang but first dave before we get into the meat of this we got to talk about our friends at notional finance look man this is a a fixed-rate loan on defy okay was it uh a week ago last week the week before block fi got shut down basically no new block fi accounts can be created that is centralized uh lending and and borrowing products uh notional is a decentralized finance product it cannot be shut down if you still want your crypto fixed rate loan if you want to earn some interest on your usdc on your eth on your uh wrapped bitcoin what else they got die you can do that fixed rate loan so the terms don't change once you lock it in it's like 7.8 on usdc a lot of value locked here so uh million right now uh and i just love these types of products because like how's this compared to a bank account how are you doing in your wells fargo savings account david what's your interest rate buddy oh my god negligible i don't even know the number just because i don't even think that it exists if they couldn't pay me any interest rate i would have no idea do you know their uh i don't know if you've gotten it but they send you the the tax docs on like the in the it's got a line of interest i made like um 50 cents or something a dollar which might count what you're gonna do with that ryan i'm gonna i'm gonna file with the irs and show them that i made that dollar so it's silly anyway notional fantastic product you guys should go check it out there's a link in the show notes uh if you want to earn some stable coin interest go do that go check it out um all right man why don't we start with this david because you wrote this uh really cool post it kind of summed it up some some of the things you denver the eight things you missed to eat denver they'll talk about those eight content pieces and some of the vibes going in but maybe set the stage for us because eat denver has changed a lot since uh 2018 where you went for the first time i don't know did it start before that as well was there an east denver like 2017 no 2017 was the first one yeah i've been through 2018 collected every single poet 2018 three thousand people is what you said now eath price was six hundred dollars that was before we we were knew we were deep in the bear market we're just entering it uh eat denver 2019 4500 people that was deep bear market territory 100 eath the contrast point eat denver 2020 6 000 people okay we hadn't really recovered but all the tourists left but still increased attendees by 1 500 to 6 thousand people this is right before covid and then of course nothing last year in 2021 and now this year what did we hit this year how many people 12 000 people is the estimate 15 000 people were given tickets and expected that twelve thousand people actually showed up this this event was completely saturated uh and like i said earlier i was worried about this just kind of like diluting the experience but no it just didn't happen and what's what's not listed here because it's kind of hard to quantify is like the energy at each of each of these events 2018 had some pretty good energy it was my first one i didn't really know what to expect how to compare it uh and the energy was was infectious to begin with that's eighth number 2018 was why i dropped everything and got into crypto in the first place like experiencing ethereum and ethereum culture firsthand did you literally plan to do it at the conference like coming out of that conference where you're just like okay this is it i'm all in no i was in 2018 my first ever i was planning on going to the conference just to check what's up because this thing is interesting but on sunday of the conference the last day of the conference i was planning on going up to boulder colorado to our physical therapy school because that was my plan i was going to go to physical therapy school wow but then sunday came around and i was like you know what like physical therapy school is 45 minutes away and also this whole like that's a 45 minute uber that i'm gonna have to do to tour this thing and also this ethereum thing is really cool the conversations i have are really awesome and you know what like i think i'm just going to go all in on this ethereum thing yeah and that and that that was that was it that was ether2018 amazing i just i literally had this uh moment where i was talking with a uh one of the uh talking with a talker or one of the panelists after i talk and just just [ __ ] like shared brains with him for like 30 minutes straight and just and he told me he's like yo whatever you're doing like you need to get into this space and so i went and just like sat down and had this reflection moments like oh yeah i'm going i'm going into crypto i don't know i still don't know what ethereum is i still don't know what the hell i'm gonna do but there's no chance i'm gonna miss it okay so that was to eat number 20 2018. uh right like you said right at the cusp of the bear market uh and then eat denver 2019 uh we was like you know everyone was wrecked everyone was broke like there there was no no tourists there was uh everyone had left but it from from 2018 to 2019 the vibes and the energy of east denver was like twice as strong so even though like our portfolios were just like one-tenth the size the energy and excitement about ethereum was like like twice as strong and then that pattern continued the next year it's like it got even stronger like the east price recovered a little bit but definitely was not out of the bear market but the vibes in 2019 were stronger and in 2020 were stronger uh and then in 2022 this last week they just absolutely exploded like the the numbers of people that showed up exploded the types of content the number of stages the who we had andrew yang was there uh and so like it's just a complete fantastic symptom or a sign of adoption when you have like 15 000 people get tickets and 12 000 of them actually show up that's awesome man uh the best week of david's life well let's talk about some of the the must watch denver panels right so i think we're gonna be showing two of those panels two of the panels today but there are some others to add to your list uh maybe let's just go through real quick there's eight of them what's the first one yeah this is the first one it was of course vitalik's keynote speed she was on stage for an hour so it's a long interview and it's titled steps to the digital state uh and then also an open ama at the at the end of it uh and so this was vitalik's main appearance at youth denver um and it's all about just like kind of where we are in um in web 3 and also talked a little bit about the city of denver itself and denver's role in instantiating public goods there seems to be some sort of connection between denver and long-haired bearded people that care about public goods kevin owaki and daniel ryan and danny ryan come to mind uh and everyone enjoyed that of course because it was vitalik uh and then number two we have web three in politics and lobby three that's the andrew yang conversation am i right yeah this is the one that we're about to hear yeah okay uh number three you've got listed the off chain internet uh with evan mcmullen what's that about yeah evan mcmullen has completely what i call has disco-pilled me disco is this uh decentralized identity app that's coming uh and i think she has really cracked the nut of decentralized identity decentralized identity is being has been tackled or has it been attempted to be tackled by many many people in many many different routes uh but what evan mcmullen is building with her team over at disco i think she's cracked the nut uh and her talk i think really illustrates why nfts are actually not good for identity because think about this ryan like your ethereum address is public like everyone can see it but your identity inherently isn't public your identity is you and you need to be able to have choice about how you express that and so first we need to have privacy with regards to who we are and our identity and that means like not putting stuff on chain she uses this line the space between the chains uh and so it's what we've we've coined the term the off-chain internet so everything about like properties of trustlessness and immutability and verifiability but doesn't actually ever become a transaction on ethereum that's what that talks about that's interesting i think that's a space worth watching too well here's another uh eth2 panel as well uh who are these individuals on the eth2 panel this is the road to eth2 that's number four david yeah cayman nava alex stoke and alex stokes and preston van loon were interviewed by mackenzie sigelos who i met mackenzie is a new to me a new reporter on the scene out of a cnbc specifically covering crypto and i got introduced to her because somebody told me that hey like there's this uh crypto reporter out of cnbc who actually like knows what she's talking about and uh is very well informed about the nuances and the deep dives about crypto so not only is this a fantastic panel just to talk about where we are in ethereum 2.0 development even though the nomenclature for ethereum 2.0 is deprecated so don't use it but also uh mckenzie is somebody that i'm now paying attention to as a source of quality good crypto information uh that is coming from a more mainstream news source cnbc does this mean we have to stop making fun of cnbc david uh we can just a little bit a little a little bit closer uh ethereum proof of stake in our solar punk future that's number nine with uh danny ryan what's this about yeah this is all unpacking the nuances of proof-of-stake and why proof-of-stake why we've as an ethereum community elected to go to proof-of-stake uh the the strengths that proof-of-stake has in its security over proof-of-work uh and also just some technical explanations that's what's actually happening when we take out proof of work and input proof of stake instead uh and then and then it just has some great graphics and um some illustrations that really help people reason about proof-of-stake danny's actually sent me some of those slides and so i'm using some of those pictures in a coming article that's going to help debunk lynne alden's recent anti-proof-of-stake tweets which i think are just inherently wrong and danny's talk well is our is really good evidence for that by the way we're having lynn alton on the podcast in the future to talk about her proof of stake article and and hopefully have some good back and forth maybe some good natured debate about that uh too so danny ryan of course is like a primary person responsible for helping bring i'm going to call it ethereum too but the next generation of ethereum to to market uh or to the public um this the sixth is the transcending individual in collectivism individualism and collectivism which uh we could skip because you're going to hear that here shortly the seventh is a self-shill so you you gave a comment you had a conversation too crypto is here to set you free by david hoffman what's uh what's that about we actually don't have to talk too much about them that one because that's actually going to come out as an article on the bank okay usually on wednesday but basically the theme is uh kevin owaki recently wrote a line crypto's not here to make you rich it's here to set you free being being wealthy being a prerequisite to being free so these aren't at odds with each other uh but it also talks about how in web 2 and trad fi we have ins inwardly concentrating wealth as in things collect towards the center but in web 3 and d5 we have social structures we have defy apps we have web3 protocols that push wealth and value and governance out to the margins and the key innovation that really unlocks that to happen is to have private keys because private keys allow for wealth to actually be routed like a mailbox out to the margins and what does society look like when we have a new equilibrium about how wealth uh collects and where uh it collecting at the margins versus the center so that's what that talks about number eight what's this how to contribute to dallas by uh trek tracheopterix we've had him on the podcast he's all it's just always great using great nature and biology metaphors to illustrate how dao is organized and then so he's just taken his experience working with urine and coordinating with yearn to talk about how to contribute to taos eight pieces of content for you guys two of which are already in this uh this episode so just stay tuned you'll knock two out of the way but six more for you in that and then some bonus things there's some some fun vibes so like you know part of going to a conference is always like the conversation that happens the different themes that are flowing through all of the people you talk to uh this this was one so vitalik became a buffalorn what's this about yeah so the we have a mascot at east denver it's buffy the buffer corn uh it's a unicorn buffalo which we made up um and it's as it turns out i don't know if he was wearing it a hundred percent of the time but vitalik definitely put on the buffer corn like suit and walked around east denver which i think is just brilliant because you know when you when i had i had a little bit of this experience as well so if people know who you are and you walk around eat denver like you can't actually go anywhere because you get stopped along the way and vitalik you know it's vitalik if it happens to andrew yang it's gonna happen like five times more to someone like vitalik at an ethereum conference right 100 and so in order i don't know if he meant to meant to do this to dodge all of those people but i mean it's pretty justifiable so he put on the buffalo corn suit and like no one knew it was him and so he got to experience east denver completely invisibly because it was vitalik inside of the buffalo corn mascot suit dude who is so good a little a little sweatier but uh yeah definitely look at this before and after i love it yeah so he he actually had a panel that he had to attend and no one could find him but then the buffalo corn showed up and the buffalo corn just sits down and then it's vitalik inside of the buffalo corn i love this tweet my entire net worth is in this man's hands it's metallic staring down in a clipboard uh dressed in his buff of corn suit half zipped up at this point because it's got to be sweaty in there that's cool all right another thing that happened is uh devcon 7 was announced so a conference announcing another conference but what's special about devcon oh defcon i think is the other most significant ethereum con uh conference this one hops around the world so this one's in pagoda colombia uh last time i was in osaka japan before that i can't remember where prague i think uh and so finally after uh over a year and a half i think now of kicking defcon 7 out because of covid it's finally been officially announced october 11th through 14th and 14th in pagoda columbia it is the biggest ethereum conference of all time every single year and so if you're interested in that uh plan out ahead because now we know the dates that's cool first time in south america as well which is kind of neat maker dow became cool again the og d5 project became uncool for a period of time but it's cool again what's that yeah this is my claim uh they this is the first ever party that maker dao threw and for those that don't know if you go to a conferences there's just infinite numbers of parties every single day and maker dow threw a party and everyone was raving about it it was in this very uh cool church very cool venue uh the music was great and this would not have ever been able to happen when the maker foundation the centralized version of maker dow the maker foundation was around because they were so hamstrung by legal and compliance uh that they just couldn't do anything cool sort of ironic for a d5 project isn't it right hamstrung by compliance totally um and well that was a big critique of maker dow in the first place where um they had always they started off very decentralized and very organic like these 10 15 people that didn't really have any legal structure and then they realized like you know this is just going to go a lot faster if we just centralize this thing and so they centralized it under the maker foundation uh which you know paid out salaries w2 employees stuff like that but then the maker foundation was dissolved about a year and a half ago i believe and ever since then maker dow in my opinion has started to do some really cool things i attended a dinner of like the 30 30 to 40 maker people and every single time i hang out with the maker people i'm just overwhelmingly impressed by how smart and convicted they are and loyal they are to make or doubt like all of them believe that maker dao is the future which is something that i think the rest of the crypto industry can't really figure out how to wrap their heads around and i think that's because of the foundation the centralized foundation has really just limited how awesome maker dial has been allowed to be but now that the maker foundation is gone i think maker dao has leaned into becoming cool again so this is my claim that maker dial is cool again that's cool all right another one is uh alt layer ones buy and love so uh who's paying for this conference it's generally a set of sponsors and uh was that alternative layer ones this year were they many of the sponsors there were many many sponsors and a significant number of them were alternative layer ones both harmony and avalanche were alternative layer ones or a few others that i'm forgetting that uh sponsored east denver um and this has always been a theme with ethereum conferences is that like ethereum killers or you know whatever you want to call them alternative layer ones have always sponsored them because they need to buy access to like eyeballs in community and this is actually something that we learned after defcon 5. and i remember nlw from uh the breakdown podcast made this comment about how alternative layer ones need to bend like have to ask if the ethereum community for legitimacy uh and and so this is definitely something i saw here at east denver where alternative layer ones were were paying their way into relevancy into in this ethereum conference to a little bit uh to the frustration of the the ethereum community who wanted the ethereum leaders and the theory and builders to be on stage where other uh alternative layer ones had to buy their way out by their way into uh and you know this is we've seen this before and it's happening again um alt layer one's buying people's love that's funny i mean somebody's got to pay the bills yet at the same time can you really buy love can you buy a community can you buy legitimacy it's it's hard to do it's hard to do uh it works in the short run it's hard for the longer term also bankless merch everywhere it's a real photo this is the dow punks these are the dow punks bankless merch was absolutely everywhere it felt like uh five percent of the people were wearing some sort of bankless merch whether it was the bankless collegiate hoodie or the ultrasound summer shirt or one of the many other derivatives of bankwood's merch that we had the dow punks were out in force this the this photo i just took just because all these people happen to be around me all at the same time there were like three times as many of these people shown in this photo that were actually out and about eat them are wearing their dow punk t-shirts um for those that don't know dow punks is a project out of the bankless dao and you it's a you know profile picture nft um uh projects that you know we all know like like you know board apes or crypto punks but um specifically built out of the bankless dial but the cool thing is is you get to have a shirt that has your dowel punk on it so while they're all dowel punk shirts no two shirts are the same just because no two dowel punks are the same so those the dow punks have showed up in absolute force uh at youth denver that's cool uh reminds me i gotta cash in uh at least one one more of my dow punks for a t-shirt um lastly a lot of bankless listeners think i'm ryan once did that happen yeah at least i think you are right yeah i thought david was ryan yeah so at least five or six times people would like like when i would they would walk by me and they would just like yeah like hey ryan it's great to meet you i love the podcast i'm like nope david i'm david you know what that's you know it's funny i think i don't know if i saw this on friday or saturday but a tweet showed up in my timeline and it was like uh i'm loving this talk by ryan at eat denver he's just hopped on the conference stage and i look at the picture and it's a picture of you i don't know how people are mixing this up i guess we do look a little bit alike at least not at least not when i have it's just voices man you know people don't know whose voice is who anyway ryan but i thought i thought we had this meme pretty well instantiated david is the one that goes to the real world and ryan is the one that stays home because he's ai like i thought i thought everyone knew this yeah come on what's going on i guess we have to mean that a little bit harder um well that's awesome that's the denver experience at a high level um i think we should get into into the uh the rest of these panels these conversations uh so should we roll with that or any other parting words here no that that's exactly right other than the fact that east denver needs to scale uh there were like hour long lines to get into the conference so yeah it was it wasn't it wasn't a perfect conference um um so like you don't have to feel too much fomo especially if you don't want like people were waiting in line uh the covet testing line because you had to get tested to get in for like two hours um so what we've learned with this denver is that the the venue that we've always used the the sports castle is what it's called is too small uh next year we've got to do the convention center there's literally no other bigger conference or a bigger venue that other than that one so you get into that size i mean fifteen thousand people is uh that's a pretty big conference so for sure so guys uh stay tuned for the conversations we're about to have with eric voorhees and uh kevin o'walkie is the first one and then the andrew yang conversation straight from eth denver before we get to those we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users

uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so if you guys have been paying attention to both eric and kevin on twitter every once in a while they get into a debate around public goods and if you guys know eric is a very big libertarian and kevin is really uh i guess i'd call him a collectivist i'm not sure if that's true or not anyways while these two men have done so much for this industry and they are 99.999 the same they tend to disagree on one thing and that is the priority of individualism versus collectivism so we're going to unpack this today on the spanglish podcast and so i'm going to start with you eric eric why is individual individualism at its very essence good and how does crypto enable individualism all right well first i want to clarify something that i am only an average size libertarian i am 511 so there are bigger ones than me um all right so rephrase your question why is individualism good and how does crypto enable individualism all right uh so i'm actually a little bit disappointed that even answering why individualism is good has to be a thing now this this used to be this used to be like understood by most people at least in america that all individuals are you know people with different preferences and to respect individuals as themselves with their own preferences is like a really good basis for civilization somehow it's become an extreme position to advocate for individualism and uh one of my favorite things about the crypto world is that it's starting to bring that back and empower people as individuals and kevin a very very similar question to you why is collectivism good and how does crypto enable collectivism [Laughter] hello um first off i want to say shapeshift is awesome thank you for everything you've done for this space eric you're a legend um kevin a little closer to the mic please i love shape shift thanks kevin sorry i love shape shift so your question was why is collectivism good why is collectivism good and how does crypto enable it yeah so um collectivism uh is the idea that if we is that a lot of the value that we get out of society is from things like public goods and things that are in the commons so things like clean air like transportation networks this whole space is enabled by the internet which was researched at arpa through a government grant and so the idea here is that public goods are good 80 percent of the value that we get from our lives is from public goods what good is a lambo if the sky is on fire and public goods are good and we tend to we tend to take them for granted until we don't have we don't have them anymore you don't realize you don't have clean air until you're breathing toxic air you don't realize that our digital infrastructure is underfunded until there's a black swan event and there's a huge hack and so basically the idea is that we're all standing on the shoulders of giants and even the most successful entrepreneurs in this space have been standing on the shoulders of giants they've been enabled by the generations before them contributions to humanity and that we should recognize and respect that uh crypto in web 3 allows for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come together and to fund public goods and i think that that's one of the really great opportunities within the space eric do you think that cryptocurrency enables individualism more than it enables collectivism is it is cryptocurrency inherently an individualist technology uh yeah cryptocurrency is absolutely fundamentally a individualist technology it provides every individual with sovereignty over their wealth their finances and now far beyond finance so absolutely yes at the same time i mean i agree with a lot of what what kevin is saying public goods are very important i think what we disagree with is like how they should be funded just because something is a public good doesn't mean you need to steal from your neighbor in order to fund it so um i think that's where that's where we tend to disagree on things but yeah cryptocurrency i mean you can you can tell just from this event like how individualistic it is right there are people here from all different backgrounds all different places in the world they see different things when they look into the prism of ethereum and um i think that that's a beautiful thing eric i want to make a counterpoint to that so many people from so many different walks of life are all here we're all so all the individuals of many many different flavors are all in the same room sharing the same vibes is that not collectivist i guess we have to define collectivism right uh there's a definition of collectivism which i think is the dangerous one in which groups of individuals are coerced into certain behaviors that they wouldn't otherwise be doing i think the most dangerous forms of collectivism tend to turn into war where hundreds and thousands uh or millions of people are literally murdered under the banner of collectivism wars always happen under the banner of collectivism under the banner of nationalism um i'm completely opposed to that and so for everything that you can say about how the internet got funded by the government yes okay what other things has darpa funded right uh the same organization literally built the nuclear bomb and murdered a hundred thousand people in japan so personally i want to find different ways of funding public goods than giving it the money forcefully or taking it from my neighbor and giving it to like the most atrocious organizations on earth [Applause] kevin do you want to sponsor that um uh well i i'm happy to respond to that but i think generally what we're trying to do is create a synthesis not a tit-for-tat conversation between me and eric i guess i'll just say that uh there are different ways that collectivists and individualists define each other so um an individualist will i think define themselves on the basis of mutualism and cooperation whereas a collectivist will focus on group goals what's best for the collective group and the interpersonal relationships in uh in them and i think that an individualist would define a collectivist as uh being willing to accept forced coercive cooperation in order to meet those group goals and that's the primary sort of like axis of of disagreement is whether or not uh coercion is an acceptable means to an end and i guess you know the the real question for me is would you accept a 20 tax on your income to create a 10 000 better world kevin uh we we started this industry with bitcoin which is i think uh the most individualist part of this whole entire industry but i also kind of think that this web three phenomenon and these uh community-based organization phenomenons is much more collectivist do you see that uh the web three side of the the crypto revolution as we are currently in that phase is that the collectivist side of things that's coming out um i think that ethereum first off i don't know much about bitcoin is that even still a thing anymore rude ethereum is a programmable turing complete global uh transparent and immutable substrate for human coordination and when something is programmable you can program your values into your money and so i think that there will be different parts of the web3 ecosystem that will program different values into different monetary systems and some of them will tend more towards multiplayer games and collectivist type things and some of them will tend towards more single player games and i think that that's great the great thing about crypto is that it's founded in a route of not your keys not your coins and that allows you to fundamentally have sovereignty over your bank account which is [ __ ] cool and then from there from that foundation we can build more non-coercive collectivist systems and so imagine a global web scale infrastructure for funding public goods that is non-coercive i think that that is the synthesis of eric's value set my value set the synthesis of what's possible in this space and i think that we should reorient the conversation around how to create a synthesis of cypherpunk values in solarpunk values and realize that world together [Applause] so in search of that synthesis you guys i think have both articulated a pragmatic argument but coming from two different angles eric said that um we darpa made the internet but it also made the nuclear bomb or uh well we can create one good thing out of uh out of a collectivist uh government uh efforts ten thousand evils come after that but then kevin says that what good is your what good is your lambo if the sky's on fire and so we need some sort of government uh management or public goods funding to make sure that the fi the the sky's not on fire both of you guys seem to be articulating pragmatism as uh as your arguments how do you guys square this thing uh eric can we start with you i think when i when i look into into the crypto world i see i see people ultimately cooperating peacefully with no central coercion and i think it's a it's a beautiful example of of what public goods actually can be created without coercive funding right there are so many things that the public here use in terms of infrastructure code mathematics language all of these are public goods and they're not you know funded coercively so i think a lot of people maybe just don't quite realize how much actual spontaneous order exists around them that isn't coercively funded in the first place kevin you want to answer that same question do you want to repeat it sorry could you repeat the question yeah both of you guys seem to make uh pragmatic arguments uh to justify why perhaps you should prioritize collectivism over individualism uh eric said that well well we can produce the internet via collectivism we might actually produce wars as a result and the trade-offs eric and what i think eric says the trade-offs just aren't worth it but then you say pragmatically it's actually just worth it if the government can take 20 of my money if they can make my roads not bumpy and my air very clean and my water very clear uh so how do we how do we square these things when both of you guys are making pragmatic arguments yeah well i mean i guess it sort of just depends on what you think the biggest threat to human thriving is um you know i think that we're in this space to create a thriving of a global citizenry that no matter where you're from uh no matter who you are what your background is that you can create thriving uh both economically emotionally socially and uh and and so i think that you know it really just kind of depends on whether you think the biggest threat to your thriving comes from coercion of a collectivist actor or if you think that the biggest threat to your thriving comes from global coordination failures like climate change underfunded digital public goods transportation networks clean air and water herd immunity uh and those type of things and so uh depending on which one of those things you think are the biggest threat to your thriving i i think that maybe that's where the chips fall all right guys in your opinion what's the best way to find a non-coercive way to fund public goods how would you prefer it be done eric first you have to define what public goods should actually be right so my main one of my main issues with government generally is that they simply get bigger and bigger and bigger and they're always providing more and more things under the under the guise of public good so there's probably a lot of things that that kevin and i both think are like legitimate public goods that need funding but that's such a small portion of what government money actually goes to so limiting the scope of what is an actual public good i think is important first i think we all know like if the only thing the government did was make sure the air was clean and build roads like there would be no libertarian movement right that wouldn't be a thing but that's not actually what your money goes for that's just such a tiny piece of it um so yeah i'll leave it at that uh um yes i mean i think that uh the question is how do we coordinate to fund public goods and one of the things that i see with uh okay so the government uh the the the the government uh definitely has a large administrative state that is slow and bureaucratic and way less efficient than a lot of the technology that uh that we see in this space and in technology in general um i do think that one of the big opportunities that i see is is with ethereum we've got a transparent immutable programmable substrate for global coordination so nation states cannot do global coordination around global coordination failures nation states because they don't have a transparent transparent incorruptible ledger for you to check on what they're doing um you have an opportunity for this administrative state to really grow and to get really bloated and so what if we shifted the foundation of funding some of these public goods onto something that was more transparent and could not be corrupted uh you know a smart contract once it's deployed cannot be uh cannot be changed even if the values of the person who deployed it changed whereas you know with with a lot of these governments it depends on what bureaucrat is in charge of administering the system and so i i really just think that we've got a foundationally better substrate for human coordination with blockchain-based systems for creating transparency and therefore accountability and therefore we can build systems to coordinate without a large administrative state and maybe that's the synthesis of where we're going i want to lean into the where we're going part of that um eric how do you think that this cr the crypto industry's role how does that uh our how does this industry play a role in funding public goods over the long term we're we're still in the very nascent phase of crypto a lot of experiments going around do you think that this industry actually has a role to play with making public goods funded and safe and and secure for the long term uh i i may be stuck in the past but my generation of crypto people are still focused on sort of the first mission which is removing money and finance out of the hands of government that that is um that is a monumental undertaking and is is starting to work but it's going to be like a decades-long process i i love that there are people now in crypto that have different missions and are using this technology in other ways so you know that's great but when someone says like how should crypto be used to fund public goods that's such an alien concept to me um because it seems like a question that might be appropriate uh in the future but today today we still have the federal reserve today someone born in a certain country can't send money to someone else uh just because of like their their background today everyone here and their fiat currencies are being debased at 10 a year and until we stop that cancer i think it's almost futile to start talking about the public goods that also do need funding in some other way it [Applause] i think what your answer was just that money is a public good and government is ruining that public good for the rest of us by debasing the fiat currency is that maybe i'll carry this cancer metaphor a little further if you're if you're dying of cancer you don't want to talk about like what what clothes should i be wearing right now right like that might be important if you're not dying of cancer but when you're dying of cancer you stop the cancer i believe that fiat currency is a cancer upon the world and one once that gets solved i will be the first one to start figuring out other important problems that humanity has to tackle is is money the meta public good uh no money is not a public good money is a private good it should be a private good everyone's money is belonging to them and themselves but we all use the same monies and so yes i have my money that's in like that i own but i only own that money because everyone else also owns that money because it's a global utility system do you not consider that this you know the instantiation of gold for example is a system that exists all across the world that we are all collectively using as a utility of transferring value and so when you say that we're debasing money i hear that we're ruining a public good yeah gold wasn't instantiated gold emerged through the trading of goods by individual private parties based on their individual self-interest right so this is actually an example of something that is useful but that is purely private it does not require government funding it does not require it to be like it's not a public good it's just individual commodity that individuals use as and when they see fit i think something like something like air is a much more difficult challenge because it is shared among everyone it's very hard to like limit and and contain it so there's a lot of important questions of like how to keep air clean i think that's a that's a fair point to debate kevin i want to go back to the question of how crypto can help fund public goods over the long term and you have a book right there called green pilled uh talking about regenerative cryptoeconomics regenerative cryptoeconomics is that another word for helping fund public goods yeah i mean i think yes is the answer and thank you for shilling this book about how crypto can regenerate the world that i wrote so that i don't have to uh the reason why the book is called green build and not uh it doesn't have the word public good in the name is that you need a lecture in economics to understand what public goods are but everyone viscerally understands regen regenerative systems systems that recover over time and are anti-fragile when exposed to stress are regenerative and public goods are a subset of that but i do not want to be overly technocratic and get into economics and definitions with people when i'm trying to explain how crypto is good for the world because that is a good way of losing people so that's why we're talking about green pills and regenerative crypto economics instead of public goods in the book and the answer to your question is that the atomic unit of how crypto can regenerate the world is an impact dow and impactdow is defined only as something that has a positive externality for the world so basically that positive externality can be financial like bitcoin grants creating funding for open source software we funded 53 million dollars worth of open source thus far thanks eric not non-coercively um and uh so that is one example of an impact dow uh another example of an impact dow is uh i think like climadow is a really great example of an impact dow that is tokenizing carbon credits in order to allow us to purchase purchase carbon credits using ethereum and therefore pay down the carbon impact of not only the ethereum ecosystem but eventually the entire world uh using using uh ethereum technology and i think another great example is proof of humanity identity and the ability to transact as a human uh is is regenerative for the world there are people in argentina that because they have civil resistance on proof of humanity are living off of ubi [ __ ] yeah that is the world that we want to create so the impact out is the atomic unit of how we build a regenerative crypto economic system impact dials have positive externalities and they can be on many different vectors financial material social intellectual shout out to gregory gregory landua who is around here and talks about eight different forms of capital of which financial is only one of them and by stacking these impact dials on top of each other and choosing to invest our financial resources our intellectual resources into them that is how we build a non-coercive regenerative infrastructure for the world and i really hope to see this community at east denver and beyond investing in creating positive externalities with the projects that you are all building because the book is called how crypto could regenerate the world and in order to get us to a world where crypto will regenerate the world we all have to choose it and that means all of you yeah i i love everything that you just said kevin because none of it is coercive i love that and i love that crypto technology has allowed that kind of thing to flourish and for all this creative energy to go to these problems with technology that wasn't around a decade ago yeah [ __ ] yeah [Applause] kevin when you talk about regenerative crypto mom economics i picture in my head a mesh network of many many systems that all have positive externalities upon the world and you you rattled off a bunch of different categories where if we can make impact owls in all these different categories and they can grow to fill the void of the world around us all of a sudden the engagement in these things start to produce some sort of basal level of funding for the world around us as these this mesh network of dows grows out and and comes to maturity does that strip away some of the responsibilities that governments currently have um we're not there yet and i don't really speak bureaucrat so i don't really know sorry all right guys i want to close out and and change this uh conversation to something a little bit more topical which is east denver you guys are both veterans of east denver eric what does east denver mean for you um so i'm from colorado and uh it's i mean for me it's been really fun to see the this branch of crypto which is ethereum it's become a major branch uh like come back to my hometown and where i'm from and for every for all of you to visit this beautiful state is just very special to me um you know like back in the day when i would go to bitcoin conferences it was always in other far-off places and that's that's great but to see to see it come full circle and come back to colorado is just kind of just kind of special for me being from here kevin same question what does east denver mean for you um eat denver is a shelling point for us all to come together commune with our collective possibility build the future and we are going to put colorado on the map as the place to move to when when you want to build the future miami's got nothing on colorado david [Applause] all right i want to thank my two guests eric and kevin i appreciate both of you guys are here personal heroes of mine and every

here first i have to say when i was running for president one of the first communities that embraced me was the crypto community [Music] folks who had a sense of the future had a vision and also a spirit of optimism and possibility and abundance and so when i spoke at consensus a couple of years ago when i spoke at a blockchain for good conference i felt that the folks in this community were super aligned with what i was trying to do on the presidential and it's a thrill to be now here in earnest trying to contribute and help because i firmly believe that the work that so many people here are doing can help contribute to the end of poverty in our time which has been my mission for the last number of years and i know a lot of people here want to take that mission forward as quickly as we can andrew i think a lot of uh the one of the differences between you and the average politician is you think in longer terms than the average politician a lot of the average politicians trying to get reelected in two to four years but you're thinking about things like automation and how do we support every single individual on this planet in an economic way and i think that's why you find alignment with the crypto community with the web 3 community can you talk about just the importance of thinking in the long term and how that sets you apart as a politician now i think a lot of you know that i'm something of an accidental political figure certainly there wasn't a lot of you're going to be president in the yang household when i was growing up like that wasn't the conversation it was more like you know keep your head down get good grades clean your room that sort of thing so i ran in part because i didn't feel like our current political system was thinking long term was going to actually champion bigger solutions like universal basic income or some of the things that you all are working on like the next generation financial system and i think that there are real parallels to web 3 and someone who's trying to make a difference in our political system right now because there's an entrenched system that is doing its thing and is highly resistant to someone who comes along and says hey maybe we should do things differently maybe we can do something that's more bottom-up than top-down so the goal is in my mind to take the innovation uh that's improving people's lives and help people help the folks in dc understand that this is not something that only will benefit a narrow few if we do it right it can benefit millions tens of millions hundreds of millions even billions over time andrew there's a decent amount of incumbency in the world not just in politicians but in our social structures the corporations things just seem entrenched and that has caused a lot of social strife and one of the things that i think that the web 3 world is really trying to do is how do we build out new social systems but how do we actually convince washington that we need to turn over new institutions how do we convince the people the the leaders of countries all over the world that it's time for change i i'm so proud to have announced this week the launch of lobby three uh it's lobby three dot io and the goal is that we can make a case to the folks in dc who are frankly right now in the process of writing these rules to have a fuller and broader understanding of not just the risks but also the opportunities and rewards and the fact is right now if you're in dc you tend to think more in terms of one side than the other so we can translate the work you all are doing but we it's not going to happen on its own if you imagine someone sitting in an office building in dc and their approach to these technologies it's not just you know time zones away from this gathering it's like a completely different frame of reference a different mindset so we have to invest resources in trying to bring the stories the opportunities to the folks in dc as quickly as we can in my view the biggest risk to web 3 is that onerous regulations come out of dc over this next number of years and push a lot of the development energy frankly outside of the united states and that's something i would love to prevent i would love your help in helping me prevent that because i think that innovation and development should take place right here in the u.s of a i want to learn a little bit more about lobby 3 because i think a lot of the the people in the crowd here who might be part of a dow or might be part of some social community might find a lot of familiarity with what's going on with lobby three uh what what is lobby three and what's a day in the life of being a part of lobby three like i i'm gonna do my best to summarize the way you try and approach politics here in this room today which is you try and ignore it honestly right like you're building things you're making these go faster and then politics seems irrational and tribal and inefficient uh and you're like oh please let me not have to deal with that stuff is that about right yeah that's very reasonable uh i was right there with you before i made the decision to run for president united states circa 2017. so that's the world that you'd like to operate in but you also sense on some level that there are now forces that are are pushing towards much more direct regulation and oversight of web3 technologies and digital currencies that are going to be written not you know three years from now but in my opinion it's going to be measured in weeks and months the biden administration is likely going to have an executive order that gets issued in the next one to two weeks charging the different agencies with a coordinated regulatory approach to web3 technologies so even if you would love to ignore this stuff and you know you want to decide like let it someone else deal with this it's going to end up impacting your work at some point in this next little while probably so the goal has to be to try and make it so that to the extent these regulations are formulated they're reasonable they're transparent they're done in coordination with industry leaders and people who are just trying to to build from the from the bottom up here in the industry and that's what we're going to do with lobby three we're going to build a coordinated effort we're going to have professional lobbyists in dc yes but we're also going to be doing grassroots efforts in congressional districts where they just need to see this technology in action there are so many misconceptions about the people that benefit from these technologies that if we can show people in real life folks are benefiting from digital wallets from next generation of financial services it can help to shift the perception that right now is in danger of congealing into rules and regulations one of the lines that always resonated with me and i think this is rampant throughout washington is that if you're not at the table you're on the menu and so we all have a responsibility in this industry to be at the table and i think that's what lobby three is doing it's giving everyone else everyone here in this room a voice to speak about what are our values and how can we get washington to align with them rather than just stamp out what the innovations that we have here are today um for everyone listening everyone in this room and everyone listening on youtube what's like the easiest thing that they can do to help move that needle forward either with lobby three or just helping having uh crypto b represented in washington well within lobby three join our discord you can go to lobby three dot io uh we we've made it so it's very very accessible to be able to join lobby three dow like it's going to be something that if you want to participate you should be able to do so and bigger picture let people know that look there's a caricature going on around the communities that benefit from web3 that isn't accurate the use cases are go well beyond what do you all think that the dc conception of use cases for digital currencies are money laundering drug deals human trafficking you know that that if you were to ask someone in dc like what are the top uses like those three things would probably pop into their list top five and you all know that there are millions of other purposes and transactions that the technology is used for every single day so in addition to getting involved with lobby three directly the single biggest thing you can do is spread the word about the fact that look there are creators that are being empowered in totally different ways there are organizations that are able to govern themselves in whole new ways there is a technology that can allow us to get away from frankly having these mega corps have control over our lives in part because we're not able to interact with each other uh with trust and transparency and so if you introduce that and you can see why in some ways that there are folks that have a kind of resistant attitude very early on i mean a lot of political figures might talk about a particular version of the world or values but when they're presented with the actual possibility that that world could exist uh that they don't embrace it they actually sort of you know like shy away from it uh so it's a fascinating challenge and it's something that i would love your help with undertaking because i'm going to go on a limb and say the future of web 3 depends upon what we do collectively in the next 12 months is lobby three a dow yeah lobby three dow it's in the name so you know it itself will be a decentralized autonomous organization when someone asks me what the priorities of the dao will be i respond to ask the dao [Applause] who are the other leaders of the lobby three doubt so i i have a team that i've worked with for quite some time that are part of lobby three itself uh you're all not going to believe this well maybe you will you probably believe it but um so i actually hired a bunch of dc lobbyists back in 2020 to advocate for cash relief and the child tax credit and anti-poverty measures and i did it in part because it was based on an onion article i'd read in 2011 that said the american people hire lobbyists to fight for interest on capitol hill think about that for a second and i i thought it was the funniest thing i was like uh you know that the fact that we'd have to hire a lobbyist but i was like oh we probably should hire a lobbyist and so in 2020 i hired a bunch of lobbyists to advocate for anti-poverty measures and now that team is going to be spearheading our conveying the realities of the opportunities around web 3 to folks in dc in dc right now there's the message in the messenger and i want you to imagine if you were let's say a democratic member of congress in that office and then someone comes to you and says hey these technologies can really help people if if the messenger that's bringing it to them is a bipartisan think tank or an anti-poverty organization that's like a different conversation than if they uh have something like professional like industry association in their names you know what i mean like like that's the reality of what's happening in dc right now so i'm hap i'm proud to say i've been working on anti-poverty initiatives in dc for the last two years and in my mind web 3 could be the biggest anti-poverty initiative in the history of the world [Applause] andrew you when you ran for president you moved the overton window on a lot of things and you were the figurehead that spoke a lot of reason about new issues in new ways and it really changed the whole entire democratic platform regardless of whether you won or lost but you are just one man and you have actually spun off and inspired many other people who are also running for uh elected official offices in in different states uh erika rose comes to mind and if this movement of what you inspire whatever this movement is it needs to have other leaders it needs to decentralize because decentralized networks are impossible to stamp out and all that's needed for a decentralized network to exist is for people to believe in it and i think the dow model is allowing people to rise up and allow this uh movement to be spearheaded by more and more more people is that the goal oh that that's 100 the goal david and erica rhodes raise your hand if you know who erica rhodes is all right so i want you to imagine a member of congress let's call him brad sherman uh who really hates crypto he's an incumbent that really no one likes honestly he's like one of those unliked uh members of congress who's been hanging out for a while um he is unabashedly anti-cryptocurrency anti-web 3. he has a lot of backers in the frankly like the banking system now his opponent is erica rhodes who's completely pro-whip three and she also has a compelling personal story she's an elementary school teacher uh she's uh half black half asian she was a volunteer in my campaign who's now running for congress has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars had a twitter spaces with jack dorsey the other day so if you want someone like brad sherman to know that being against this industry is a political loser then you should back his opponent erica rhodes you can look it up it's erica for congress it's spelled a-a-r-i-k-a so there are different candidates like this around the country that in my mind the community should be getting behind now this is not lobby 3's work lobby 3's work is going to be go to dc and talk sends to the regulators but there are other people who are putting political energy behind folks who are fighting for this industry and i think that we owe them our support honestly for those of you that happen to live in california 30th district that's your race so i'm sure there's some of you in there um andrew a lot of dows in the web 3 world have road maps does the lobby 3 dow have a road roadmap yeah if you go to lobby3.io there there is a roadmap one of the things i would suggest though is that the priorities of the dow will probably shift in real time as the agencies actually put forward draft rules and a bunch of other things so you're going to want to be adaptable and responsive in real time for those of you who want nothing to do with dc maybe some of you actually could find some enjoyment and learning about this process maybe i don't know if that's too far a bridge um one of the things i described to people as you can actually gamify lobbying maybe you could say like hey like that you know here's a member of congress here's an agency here's this um so the roadmap of the dow i'm sure will end up shifting as different priorities emerge because this is very much a right now concern the biden administration has announced that an executive order is going to come out probably again in the next one to two weeks do you know more details about that executive order what do you know about that that seems actually a really big deal so what i've heard is that the executive order will say to the agencies let's come up with a coordinated regulatory response but it will not put forward the response itself just yet so what it is to me is the starting gone it's like okay these agencies are then going to draft these rules and we need to have a direct line with them so that they don't write rules that are frankly very very onerous very heavy-handed prioritize managing the risk well over innovation and development and growth so i'm happy to say that we're relatively optimistic about the executive order announcement itself um but it should be a massive call to action for the web 3 community this is an all hands on deck moment it really is i want you to imagine a world where eight months from now a bunch of rules come out of dc that end up pushing a lot of energy overseas uh reducing the enterprise value of folks who have been working on projects for years and years this is all very much a realistic possibility i also want you to imagine a world where rules come out that you might not love but actually allow you to operate and build for the long term and i dare say that if you were to have this latter scenario you might see the energy in the industry shoot up because right now there is an overhang of this regulatory risk like no one knows exactly what the approaches are going to be what the regime's going to be what the rules are going to be even who the regulator is necessarily going to be so if you get clarity on those things then you can imagine as glorious as this gathering is here today in denver you can imagine the future of this just multiplying over and over again because everyone will know what the rules of the road are that's a vision i'm willing to fight for and i hope you'll join me in it [Applause] so can you model out what we need to do as an industry to turn this opportunity into a w and what would we what would also happen if this would actually turn into an l like how could we drop the ball here what would we fail yet and also what do we need to do to make sure it's a dub well i i think the the single biggest thing we have to do is know that as much as you might dislike politics a lot of you might even think like hey i hate the idea of any regulation in my mind some form of regulation is going to have to be accepted and somewhat inevitable for the industry to mature um but the path of least resistance and there are people in the industry that are in direct touch with the folks in dc like the blockchain association blockchain association and others so there are folks who are advocating but the single biggest misstep would be uh someone else will take care of it like i'm doing my thing you know like let me just focus on on this for the time being because someone in this community has to make the proper investments and resources and energy and time and commitment to try and keep these regulations on the right side are reasonable uh and i i am i'm not sure if you can tell from my tone of voice like i am kind of concerned i'm actually gonna pose this thought question to you all how much do you trust washington dc to just get things right so if that's a relatively low level of confidence then i want you to think about what would need to happen for you to have a higher confidence level and generally speaking the gap between where you are now that higher confidence level involves resources investment ingenuity time energy passion narratives storytelling broadening people's conception of what is possible it's one reason why i love web3 so much is like this is a group of people that's legitimately building a better version of the future and unfortunately there are so many americans who right now are struggling with like this boot of scarcity on their throat uh and then when you say to them it's like hey these great things are possible they're unable to envision them you know what i mean like that has to be the biggest thing that we change together is if we help them see what's possible and maybe even get that boot off their throats then we can live in a version of the future that we'll be proud of [Applause] andrew you talked about time energy attention resources these are all things that daos need so when you are growing the the lobby 3 dow you and the other other dow leaders in there the organ organizers what talent or what resources does lobby 3 down need the most does it need capital does it need foot soldiers does it need developers what could it use the most everything you just listed there david for sure i i'm not going to you know to pretend like we are going to need uh probably some significant institutional resources will come in and i'm happy to say that many of them seem very excited about this effort but then we're also going to need people who are helping us identify the stories to amplify who are reaching out directly to folks in a particular community saying look like members of congress will respond to their constituents so there are folks that you know that are in particular parts of the country that could end up being very very crucial it's going to be an all hands on deck effort and this is the single thing i would say is like if you think this is a problem that just some like industry heavyweight with a lot of money can solve like that's probably not quite what we're facing right now you know what i mean like you have to think about again that democratic member of congress in ohio or michigan or another part of the country like what did they care about what is going to make them go from being very skeptical or dubious about cryptocurrencies and web 3 to being neutral and maybe even positive and sometimes it's the kind of thing where if you just like through your weight around dc like maybe that moves some people but what would be most effective and this is actually in some ways a cause for optimism it would be people in their community benefiting from web three and then if they're actually shown that if like a local community leader or an activist or a non-profit says hey look what it's doing for this neighborhood that you represent that's the single most powerful way we can help turn this negativity around among congress members i think the the web 3 community traditionally crypto has been very like anti-government we can do it ourselves no government but the web 3 community i think is a little bit more reasonable at least in my opinion that we want to be able to be better than the government but we'll accept government regulations at the end of the day and we've seen different leaders show up and actually lean into politics ryan selkis i saw him over there not too long ago taking a leadership position what advice do you have for people that might actually want to lean in and be representatives of web 3 in in washington or in their local communities or in other regulator regulatory bodies well there are a number of organizations that now advocating for sensible regulations blockchain association i just mentioned is is one lobby three will be a new member of this system but certainly if there is someone who wants to lead on this charge uh just get in touch with me or kristen smith or one of the other people that's actually talking to the folks in in dc uh because we need you we need you to lean in and help lead and i will suggest that this is something that's going to help everyone here it's going to help everyone who could potentially benefit from these technologies i pride myself on just trying to be you know frankly like you know like intelligent about like how you invest time and energy like right now this is maybe arguably the most important area of investment for web3 in my opinion because you're looking at a legislative window and a regulatory window that that's like very much open right now um and if you rewind a couple years ago this was not on anyone's radar you know what i mean like if you were to say hey we need to like shape this it's like yeah you know it's not really there it's there now like this is very much like on the front burner for a number of people in dc uh so we have to get after it right now all right andrew i got one last question for you and then we're going to open up to questions so if you have a good question you can line up at the microphone and we're going to get there in a second right after i ask my last one andrew one of the things i think uh we align most with between you and the web3 community is we're all optimistic about the future because we think we can build it better why are you optimistic about the future what makes you optimistic why am i optimistic about the future i'm optimistic about the future because of entrepreneurs who are solving problems in front of them every day that that's what's made me tick that's what led me to run for president believe it or not i just saw a giant problem i thought i could help solve it and we need that approach and orientation and energy more than ever because like i said before there are so many americans who are struggling right now not just americans but around the world i don't know if you've noticed but like the world is kind of going to [ __ ] i mean i don't know if you all like sense that but so you ask my causes for optimism it's that things can change really quickly both positively and negatively so we have to take advantage of the positive as well as the negative we can't just like say like oh things are going to get worse i'm going to do my over thing over here that's actually my challenge to the folks here together in denver today and if you're watching youtube fine whatever is that let's make it so that people can see the benefits of these technologies in the real [ __ ] world as quickly as possible all right we've just got about two minutes left so we're going to take a few quick questions ideally simple ones uh can you take it away for us right um hi i'm dr kelly page from digital promise the national center for research in emerging tech in education and learning i'm curious your thoughts on the decentralization of learner and employee data that we have in our institutions both across the country as well as our organizations and the emerging trend towards lers learning and employment records being decentralized do you have any thoughts on that well thank you for the work you're doing uh i'm a huge believer in anything that helps uh create alternate paths to employment that don't involve four-year degrees or traditional credentialing uh you know right now they're like so much of it operates in an antiquated system it's not serving people well people are doing what they think they're supposed to do incurring massive debt loads they're not finding the opportunities that they need so if there is a way that you can actually translate your value and data to potential employers that's independent of our current uh educational system and even in to some extent like the professional advancement system that exists i would be 100 100 supportive and we need to do more in that area thank you andrew uh my question is about the forward party and if you plan on leveraging web three within your campaigning or once you have members get into office what the stance for legislation might be thank you so the questions about the forward party i don't know how many of you know but i started a third party in the united states of america [Applause] and i did that in part because the duopoly is not working it's actually turning people against each other more than anything else and the forward party wants to be the party of technological advancement and progress so we're going to use web3 technologies at every every stage hopefully my goal is that there's a dow and again the joys of it is that we may have nothing to do with the dao that looks up and and tries to find the best opportunities for independent political candidates for people who are running as democrats or republicans who are aligned uh and we put our energy and ingenuity behind this because you have a failing political system uh you have failing systems of different kinds in america but the failing political system is one that is right in front of everyone 62 percent of americans want to move on from the duopoly they just don't know how to do it and i'm going to suggest that the people here in this room can show them how we can move on say look it doesn't need to be that you have no choice but to slump and accept the lesser of two evils you can actually invest in a positive alternative thank you [Music] i believe we just have time for one last question uh so take it away cool hi mr yang i'm wondering if you can lay out kind of what are the gaps in washington that the community can help with so is it knowledge is it um yeah analysis like what do they sort of not understand about tokens or innovation that might happen that we can all kind of help with yeah what are the gaps thank you for the question the reason i'm laughing is because um like the gaps are not gaps the gaps are essentially a golf or a chasm so the average member of the house of representatives is approximately 59 years old the average u.s senator is approximately 64 years old the average member of congress who's been in congress has been in congress for 10 to 12 years so i want you to imagine that human and then if you ask them hey cryptocurrencies tokens like digital assets what do you think like they have no idea what you're talking about uh and and and so right now they're looking around saying what do i think about this they ask their policy team what is our stance on this the policy team then looks up and says what is our stance on this and then they will ask a few people hey like what's a reasonable place to land on this the people they may ask include people in their constituencies it may include bipartisan policy councils who are known for having like an even-handed approach one group that they may or may not want to take guidance from would be like the industry itself um because the industry itself they'll be like okay like i kind of know what you're gonna tell me you're gonna tell me that you know like we should do next to nothing and so that's the state of affairs right now but if you were to try and put yourself in the head of the average member of congress just imagine total confusion and you are there like that that's where it is among the vast vast majority of them now that confusion can then be tilted negatively very easily by for example a press story about scams you know if that's the only thing they see then they can head in that direction pretty quick so we have to balance some of the things that are out there in the media ecosystem with some accounts of again creators having their lives transformed for the better people having new access to digital services like financial services they wouldn't have had otherwise i'm going to pose this to you all how many of you think that the negative stories about web 3 outnumber the positive stories let's call it 5 or 10 to 1. right so so that is the landscape that these lawmakers are forming their opinions in uh and it's up to us to try and lead them to a more realistic picture don't blame them just imagine that there's you know 50 to 60 year olds who might only know about this stuff because one of their uh children or like a nephew or niece has been trying to explain it to them unsuccessfully andrew yang everyone thank you denver let's go let's build a future it's not gonna build itself
