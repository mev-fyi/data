foreign [Music] what's up coordination on this episode of the green pill pod we have NASDAQ who is an author that wrote the terrapunk manifesto so we're exploring all of the different imaginations for what type of punk ethereum in web 3 is and on this episode we talk about terrapunk which NASDAQ defines as a fork of solar Punk which is more about human maximalism so on this episode we talk about the twin requirements of the need for further economic growth our political economies are based around the idea of about two percent growth per year and also the need to solve our coordination failures are problems with sustainability nasdaq's major beef with solar Punk is that you don't see a lot of humans in solar Punk art so what would have to be true for us to have high human pro market and pro-sustainability tools and future that we build that is terrapunk in uh the ultimate reductionist way there's of course uh lots of little fun attributes of terrapunk that we get into in this episode and I think that as we imagine what kind of future the the world that we want to bend uh that we want to bend the world towards with web3 these conversations about cypherpunk solar Punk lunar Punk Terra punk are going to be really important so I think that this has been a really fun episode and I think that you'll enjoy it without further Ado I'll give you NASDAQ of the Tara Punk Manifesto

manifesto can you tell us about that yes uh so I wrote the Tara Puck Manifesto after reading about solar Punk and just being kind of dissatisfied with some of the answers that it provides uh for the future um the terrapunk manifesto kind of I see it as a step um there used to be steampunk and not and then there was cyberpunk and then there were solar Punk and I kind of see it now as there's Tara Punk uh so the terrapunk manifesto kind of contrasts against silver Punk a little bit although I think solar Punk is useful in some cases but it kind of goes beyond uh solar Punk and terrapunk is terraforming Punk so it's about creating new worlds and expanding Consciousness and creating more land um well yeah I mean I'd love to to talk about how you would Define steampunk and solar Punk and use that as a base to talk about how Tara Punk Builds on those ideas yeah I mean steampunk is um steampunk is like you know it's kind of like kitschy technology um it has these pistols and everything uh it's it's to me it's kind of it's kind of fun and it's kind of a little bit retro uh in a way and it kind of goes back in a nostalgic sense cyberpunk is like futurism dystopia uh solar Punk is you know kind of contrasting against cyberpunk and it is trying to be more pleasant and enticing and like uh I you know it's more green uh whereas cyberpunk really has any green unless it's you know one piece of green compared to like uh the entire dystopian piece and it's like a dying treat or something uh so solar Punk is like the complete opposite of that has a ton of trees and this is more in the aesthetic sense uh than like what the ideological suspense is trying to say um but yeah solar Punk is is a is a is a lot Greenery and trying to create life um but I think that you know as I get into in the essay I think there's some flaws with like uh that sense yeah yeah I mean I guess like my definitions just to put them in the pot into stir Stir It is that uh steampunk is a genre science fiction that uh has a historical setting and features steam-powered Machinery rather than advanced technology it's always to me been sort of like an artistic aesthetic um Cipher Punk uh some of the art is very dystopian and futuristic but The Cypher Punk Manifesto actually goes into the values of privacy and sovereignty as sort of like core principles for organizing of human societies and then solar punk as an art aesthetic has been around like high Utopia High nature scenes in which humanity is integrated with the environment but uh you know when you actually read a solar Punk Manifesto there's people who are trying to interpret the art and derive values from that and they talk about a world in which we've solved our contemporary problems with sustainability from there so I guess like you know as we try to pin these Downs it seems like depending on the vantage point you look at there's different definitions of these art movements uh there's not like one Central Authority that's kind of saying what the values in the Aesthetics of these are it's all kind of an interpretive movement given by people on the internet I'm curious if you would agree with that or or disagree as we're building a foundation of shared knowledge yeah and um yeah yeah no I agree with that I would also just say that uh in the essay I do call it uh cyberpunk instead of cypherpunk and I do think those are two different uh movements I'm more familiar with the cyberpunk movement um but also yeah like you were saying it's kind of they're all kind of decentralized and a bunch of people talking about these movements and and uh connecting with them I would I would just like to say like I don't necessarily plan to be the front face of Tara Punk or like the the leader of terrapunk I just wanted to put out a Manifesto out there uh kind of just talking about these ideas and hopefully uh people kind of take them and run with them and like you know on the Tara Punk Twitter account I could like retweet art or something if if people start creating got it and that that Twitter account is twitter.com terapunk is that right yeah yeah cool we'll make sure that gets into the show notes okay two hours uh by the way because there's the you know Balaji he quote tweeted the original tweet and he was saying that should be Tara Punk uh t-e-r-a which is energy levels so it was like Giga Terra uh kind of on the energy scales um whereas Tara with two r's is uh terraforming so it's it's creating more Earth and I think you know in this scenario we might go beyond uh the Terra energy scale mm-hmm got it so so I mean I guess like now that we've built that that that Foundation of shared knowledge um it seems like to me terrapunk and its most reductionist form is it's kind of like a fork of solar Punk that's designed to be more High human we've got into our political economies baked into the idea uh baked into our political economies is the idea of like two percent growth year over year and you know if we're gonna solve our sustainability problems but also solve uh the ability for our economy to still support people then solar Punk doesn't seem to actually have a lot of humans in it like we can't just go back to this this perfect uh Immaculate Earth that existed 3000 or however many years ago we need to create a civilization we can't go back to Genesis yeah exactly so Tara Punk is is kind of um talking about what it means to have expansion and also sustainability is that true reductive reductionist and and how would you how would you change that no no that's exactly it because I do think that solar Punk wants to go back to Genesis it wants to go back to kind of the commune and like everybody's uh reducing themselves or just doesn't have too much like output uh in terms of carbon footprint and so that that kind of ends up uh minimizing Humanity in in one of two ways it's either you minimize the space that each human gets so it's human atomization and that means like we all maybe we eventually have an earth uh full of just like apartment buildings and everybody gets like almost no space um but we're trying to have as many humans as as we can or it turns into uh you know people still want their space but uh you can't have too many humans with carbon Footprints so it's it's human minimization uh so so you just can't have that many human nobody repopulates this is what we're seeing with the repopulation crisis um with birth controls plummeting this is kind of that ideology it's reducing humanity and human uh the number of human lives to uh kind of like save the environment and it's like humans only output to save them or humans only input to save the environment is just reducing humanity and the Earth will like take care of itself that's kind of what solar solar Punk is but terrapunk it's like no we should have a lot of Consciousness and we can actually like terraform the Earth we can create uh you know for example clouds from the oceans that rain on the Californian wildfires or it like rains water on the Salton Sea and it it terraforms the Salton Sea though so that it becomes livable again uh we can create all these environments where there's space for humans and we don't have to reduce ourselves and then you know we expand Beyond just Earth and we go to to Mars and you know terraform Mars and and Beyond right and there was one point where uh I kind of you know uh we go to different gas giants that maybe haven't uh begun Fusion or or Sonya and like we we start lighting them and creating sun and uh you know habitable Earths and uh I use this phrase as I was just reading the manifesto before this podcast uh lighting the beacons of Gondor uh to Herald like life in the universe like that's the that's the vibe like it's it's Consciousness spreading out into the universe to experience the universe and I think that's very beautiful and I think that's um not really seen enough in in Solar Products yeah so it feels like it you know if we're gonna solve our sustainability problems but also continue expanding resources Tech humanity and population that's quite a thin line to walk if you're just on Earth and there's a limited amount of resources I mean unless you solve for some sort of renewable input uh low low waste and then output that doesn't externalize harm um does terrapunk necessitate Humanity expanding out to other planets into the Stars where there's going to be more physical resources or do you kind of remain unopinionated on that um you know I think Tara punk you know maybe we could uh bring resources from the stars back to Earth uh maybe we create O'Neill cylinders with more Earths maybe it maybe we have to go out maybe we just um like for example solar Punk uh as the name implies you know even if even if you want to get away from it but like a lot of people on Reddit and I I tried confirming this just uh but like a lot of people on Reddit uh are against nuclear for example but nuclear is one of those technologies that compresses like the energy output uh with like its footprint um compared to solar panels instead of like so we don't have to blanket mountains with solar panels um I I do think that the idea of terrapunk and having uh you know billions and billions or trillions of humans uh does necessitate necessitate going out into the stars um I don't I don't think that Tara Punk is compatible with just like stagnation and staying on Earth um well maybe not stagnation but uh yeah I think it does go out into the Stars there's some really great visuals on the Tara Puck Manifesto which by the way will be in the show notes of this podcast episode that kind of have a Venn diagram that compares solar Punk and terrapunk so um some of the the memes that I see in in terrapunk is pro markets pro-nucular prodison spheres pro-genetic engineering expanding life throughout the Universe um increasing population and and in the center between solar Punk and terrapunk we have green architecture and trees we're anti-climate change and we're Pro-Tech and and have that in in solar panels in common with solar Punk but but you know I want to drive in on the the part of this Venn diagram that talks about solar punk in which you say that um solar Punk is anti-markets and um humans are subservient to Nature and the collective is greater than the individual so so the individual's rights are subservient to the collective um do you think that that's your interpretation of solar Punk does the art aesthetic actually confer those things and in what ways do you think that solar Punk is is missing the mark so yeah so I tried uh because I know this would it would be like uh subversive or controversial uh to kind of like you know nag solar Punk like this uh I did like I spent a lot of time reading the Reddit and uh the original papers and a lot of people talking about it and they were often like saying that you know capitalism is what destroyed uh the environment uh which you know we could get into the you know uh but like um and it was very anti-capitalism anti-market and it was more like uh you know reduce yourself uh to like kind of save the Earth got it so it seems like there's and also like if you if and another thing and one other thing uh about the collectivism versus the individual is that Noah Smith for example on Twitter um you know he was talking about how he tried to find good solar Punk stories uh with like you know characters um telling a journey and he was like there are there are literally zero solar Punk stories and it's because I think in my opinion this is now this is kind of my interpretation of why this is is happening is because there's no um kind of hero at the at the center of solar Punk and it's because uh everybody kind of minimizes themselves for the for the collective and so with that there's not uh much of a story to tell there's no journey to go on got it so you contrast it with terrapunk which is high growth using technology to solve Humanity's problems therefore there can be a sort of hero's journey that's up and to the right uh because we're expanding out to the Stars we're maintaining our economy and are maintaining our um the Earth and sustainability and so so on and it shouldn't just rely on like one hero it should be that everybody has the resources to go on their own kind of hero's journey yeah I mean I think one of the you know the sort of ideas that we discussed on this podcast a little bit is creating change of self but also change of system so basically how can we build you know this is this is a podcast that's about crypto and it's about web3 and what kind of civilization does web3 programmers want to build and so a lot of this debate between lunar Punk solar Punk Tara Punk is about imagineering what kind of world that we want to create and um you know I'm wondering you know how that hero's journey fits into the web 3 space and and you know if I'm an entrepreneur or someone who's participating in the web 3 space how can I route my resources or uh my attention to things that are actually going to be Pro humanity and it seems like also Pro economy and there's a space for kind of a pluralism of Heroes Journeys here to help to if this is the direction that the community decides to go there's a pluralism of of Hero's Journeys in order to uh take us to a more terrapunk world if if that's what people have um decided so I guess you know do you have any comments on sort of what you see out of web 3 do you think web3 is more solar Punk Cypher Punk Tara Punk and you know if so how can how can people practically apply these meth like these ideas these imaginations in their designs yeah that's a great question um so perhaps there's ways or ways to uh utilize the the blockchain or web 3 for terrapunk Technologies I'm not exactly sure what that would be but I would say like it like because that's a that's a future Tech like it needs to be built um and if I knew what it was like I would probably just go do it um but I would say that in terms of like current examples that are happening is for example you know vitalik obviously he's he's uh made a lot of money from ethereum and he's started to uh donate that or invest that in startups or technology uh creating these kind of like longevity uh you know human increasing human lifespan increasing uh biology research uh these kind of ideas that are that are similar to Tara Punk veins and so it's kind of like taking the money that he made from web3 or ethereum or however you want to phrase it and then investing it in these futuristic Technologies I think that's to me the most concrete example people that I've seen so far and then you know there's also art um the web3 community is incredible at creating Aesthetics and memes and uh kind of propagating these and you know you know maybe maybe there's a there's a way for nfts or art to be created about chairpock that would be yeah working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker

want to live in and then building the world that we want to live in and you know I'm curious to zoom out a little bit and to look Beyond just solar Punk and terrapunken and um you know what what do you think of of things like lunar Punk uh or or Cypher pumpkin and how do they fit into tear up on click if lunar Punk is basically solar Punk but with more focus on privacy and sovereignty is that Tara Punk also do you think it's even useful to ask that question are we creating a pluralism of punks like how do you think how do you think Terra Punk uh compares to other things besides besides solar Punk and is that even a useful question to ask yeah um so you kind of cut out a little bit but I think um from what you were asking is like is is uh lunar Punk kind of a subdivision of terrapunk or is it like its own thing I I did discuss privacy a little bit in the terrapunk manifesto uh or decentralization mostly like with respect to decentralization of resource so like uh I should be able to create like my own energy be off the grid um that kind of thing if I wanted to um so I and and I don't know a ton about lunar Punk I'd love to listen to the podcast that's going to come out uh on lunar Punk that you just recorded and mentioned to me uh but I I wish I had a better answer for that right okay that's fine this part kind of part of why we're doing all these podcasts together is to um compare all the different punks that that web3 thinks it is and compare and contrast them and no it's great to learn about station yeah yeah um what what didn't I ask you about terrapunk that that you want to tell us um just like uh I just want more futuristic optimistic art that features humans because a lot of the a lot of the art is just Greenery without humans and uh you know I'm I'm looking at the terrible Manifesto and and it's the art section and it's like after defeating the villain the Tara Punk continues using their Newfound skills to transform the environment around them uh for example after Iron Man creates a suit in the cave he doesn't stop at Mach 1 after defeating the villain he also begins using his Newfound technology to power the city in each of the stories he contends who's evolving and fighting fighting larger scale enemies he's proactive like he keeps uh evolving his technology in advance of of the threats uh I just I just really want um incredible art to be created and this this kind of comes back to how Hollywood is very pessimistic about technology like if you go watch the new Jurassic World um it's basically there's autistic Tim Cook uh being portrayed as the villain and it's like like what are we doing here like Tim Cook didn't even create Apple but you know it's like it's this whole thing um and and there's this thing where if somebody gave her blood a little bit like she could save the world but it's bad to do that it's like it's just all convoluted and it doesn't make sense and I just want better uh stories to tell uh they're more more optimistic and and real sci-fi um so that's one thing yeah it's definitely the art is just I'm I'm not uh altogether pleased with with current Hollywood mm-hmm yeah and I I will note that uh Punk Twitter account I think is Iron Man is Hollywood yeah um the terrapunk Twitter account is you've asked people if they create Terra Punk art to tag you to tag that Twitter account and you'll retweet it and hopefully that can proliferate more imagination about High-Tech high human Pro markets kind of worlds totally and yeah so to uh one one thing that uh one of the pictures that I have is uh it's kind of these stone hands that are that are uh larger than humans uh maybe they're they're like 20 feet tall and they're holding this uh walkway this bridge and so it's like this large human and it's kind of holding this bridge that humans are walking on um and so that that was like a really cool like okay you know we should have larger than life humans we should have like the stat uh the Colossus of Roads um you know marking our waterways um and so and so if there's any artist listening to this one the idea that I have is this this kind of like Atlas Shrugged character uh kneeling over this like you know he's uh he's kneeling and beneath his knees is this is the city like this massive City but he's Atlas is just so massive he's he's massive uh there's a ring of mountains surrounding him and there's like a terraformed Mars like on his on his shoulders that's like one terabunk image that I have that I've been trying to create with dolly or something like that but um yeah if anybody tweets these kind of things at me I'll definitely retweet them on the Tara Punk account I would love that right well you know um I I I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I agree with the uh some of the criticisms of solar like I don't think that solar Punk is an art movement goes on record about markets um and but but yeah maybe the community around solar Punk has gone on record about that but I do think that the web 3 Community errors to boards being pro markets like we're literally implementing Technologies from a book called radical markets in order to create more sustainability so in that sense I think I believe that ethereum is terrapunk uh what it's doing is building it is building a high human Highmark like Pro markets uh Pro sustainability uh movement within within the web 3 ecosystem and I think that that's cool to see the mirror between the ethos of web3 and the Tara Punk aesthetic totally I love that and you know perhaps that's why solar punks uh don't like any of this any of the web 3 stuff they always you know criticize it for harming the environment or taking one percent of energy usage but um you know I I love that that uh saying ethereum is terrapunk that's great yeah um great well I think that uh action items for the community is to read the Tara Punk Manifesto check out the art follow Tara Punk on on Twitter and I'm looking forward to seeing how these movements co-evolve with each other and uh if ethereum evolves in a more terra-punk Direction hopefully this whole this episode will have had a small impact on that uh anything else to say yeah yeah me too uh no me too uh I'm excited to see the lunar Punk podcast and I'm excited to see all of these kind of new ideologies evolve it's definitely a you know it's a it's a time to be creating these kind of things and thinking about the future it's very important and uh thank you for having me on I really appreciate it yeah yeah this was a lot of fun cool well thanks so much Jack [Music]
