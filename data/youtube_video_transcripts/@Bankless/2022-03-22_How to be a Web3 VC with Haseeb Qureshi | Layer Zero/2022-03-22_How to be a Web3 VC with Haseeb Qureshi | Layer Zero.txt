there's some things that again you cannot buy or that if you want to try to get yourself will take you a lot of time time is the one resource that you cannot spend money welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer 0 we're talking with haseeb qureshi of dragonfly capital and see we've had him on the bankless podcast before but always to talk about some sort of thesis or mental model and instead in this particular episode we talk about just the dynamics of being a venture capitalist in web 3. and so if you are interested in learning what's it like to be a vc and also what it might be like for you to find a path into becoming a vc this might be the episode for you um i think everyone at least most people when they get into the world of crypto always kind of daydream about like one day they'll be a part of a venture capital fund and one day they'll be on the research desk and i certainly had that that dream myself and kind of growing through the industry i realized that wasn't necessarily necessary for me but if that is what you are interested in this episode is going to be perfect we talk about you know what it what it's like to establish relationships with with your portfolio companies we talk about what it's like to add value to your portfolio companies we also talk about the timing on when it becomes time to actually sell your investments and how you credibly and honorably actually find liquidity on the projects that you've had relationships with and what that means and we also get into the concept of air drops whether airdrops are going to be here for the long term or they were if they maybe they were just kind of a 2020 to 2021 thing and really what it means to have a long-term thesis in web 3 versus just kind of looking at what's going on in the present moment so a really wide-ranging conversation all about kind of investing in crypto as we all do so i hope you enjoyed this conversation with haseeb qureshi right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the chill possible the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer 1. assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across its bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to

up haseeb how's it going i am doing well know yourself i'm pretty good pretty good currently uh stuck between extremely bullish about the merge but extremely bearish about most everything else yeah that is reasonable there's been a lot of good news about the merge um there has also been a lot of bad news in the world so i i think i agree with you it does feel like we're in crypto there's like a little bit of narrative exhaustion it feels like uh people are people are getting a little bit tired of hearing the same old stories uh but i don't know i i feel like fundamentals still look really good so i'm i'm feeling confident yeah yeah same narrative exhaustion is definitely one but also i think i've gotten a sense of like bull market exhaustion over the last like two months maybe kind of the same thing just like oh like sweet another play to earn game oh sweet another like nft profile picture thing all right all right like we're done with that talking about the merge again all right like cool we've been talking about that for a while just like how many like crypto runs on attention and sometimes like well like d5 tokens that was the thing that invigorated us in 2020 and then that kind of like spun out and then nfts that kind of ran his chorus and gaming and then it seems to be like in bull markets we have these iterative cycles of new things that can capture people's attention but eventually like the sparkly new ideas kind of run out and then people kind of like sober up it kind of feels like where we are right now well macro is definitely the driver's seat this year and it's also you know bitcoin and ether are doing most of the talking for the crypto market which is which is also a sign that like again it's primarily about macro uh that at that at the same time you know i remember in january we were getting so many gaming pitches it was like five metaverse pitches a week it was like just exhaustingly repetitive that's falling down so i'm definitely seeing less kind of metaverse automatically raise tons of money hype it feels like people are investors are trying to catch on um i am still seeing a lot of dow infrastructure but i'm seeing a lot of that a month ago we were seeing like so many people telling the same story about dow infrastructure down infrastructure sucks we're gonna build better tools for dows that's finally slowing down um and so now it does feel like there's a little bit of a dearth of ideas you know there was a we went through a few cycles of like okay you know defy on new l1s and then it was metaverse and then it was down infrastructure and now i'm like i'm not sure what the pattern matching like okay here's the startup of du jour is um uh but it does feel like there's i'm seeing more follow-ons from previous you know companies that already have established uh their their businesses um and i'm seeing less interesting things happening at the very very early stages right now so when you're uh engaging with all of these like startups these seed opportunities angel investment opportunities uh well not angel investment for me seed investment what what is is yeah seed investment for you yeah uh how do you keep yourself like at how do you keep the bull market mania at arm's length and also still do your job how do you how do you balance those two things well the nice thing is that at seed um the market has fairly limited impact on seed right so seed like it seed prices go upside prices go down it kind of depends on the supply of capital um but what's happening in public markets tends to have limited impact on what's happening there it the public markets have more and more impact on later stage rounds it's you kind of imagine like a almost like a spring and it's like really hard to push that spring all the way down to seed but it you know series d series e series c they get affected pretty rapidly by changes that are happening in public markets but the effect of that push and pull is um is not only graduated but it's also there's some latency in how long it takes for that to show up in seed so for the most part public markets don't affect seed too much it's more about ideas and more about like what markets are hot that are driving entrepreneurs in a particular direction right so you see more concentration of in certain areas when those things are hot in public markets um so you know like you mentioned they're always nft projects raising there's always nft studios there's always things that are kind of things that are tethered to the themes that are exciting in public markets um but for the most part you can kind of ignore what's happening in publix when you're looking at uh when you're looking at c series deals when you go further afield to like series and beyond that it really starts to matter so how do you like axe infinity for example like the axe infinity alone triggered an absolute mania in play to earn games like that this one thing like started to move billions of dollars of capital outside of its own token uh into like you know play to earn games the next axi we want to be the next axie was like a line for a really really long time uh but like when you invest these things in these things like you're minimum locked up for a year and usually much more more than that and so you have no amount of like guarantees that like you know the play to earn gaming thing is going to be around let alone three months like in three months let alone like you one plus years so how do you how do you um just manage like well play to earn games is a really hot topic right now and maybe the fundamentals are there but and we do want exposure to that concept but and so like you know that like yes this is an investable theme but are the game are the startups that are coming to my my desk right now going to be the thing that actually capitalize on that like i guess it's another reframing of the same question just like the mania and demand for like oh like played it in gaming we got to invest in that versus like well is it really going to be a a thing in a year again how do you navigate those waters yeah i mean you you that's precisely the right way to think about it is that um it's not enough to say this thing is hot right now you have to draw the economics forward and really understand like look by the time that we get liquidity on our investment and the things that we're investing in now which are pre-launch games like from pre-launch game to actually getting a game in the market and monetize and then you're you know you start uh you know the token gets launched and your lock up eventually starts to expire and you start getting liquidity that is going to be multiple years and so it's really not a question of what is axiomfinity being valued at by the market today the right question is where do you think this market's going to be in three years and you know for us or honestly for me personally um you know i'm i'm actually um i'm very bearish on this current generation of plato and gaming i don't think it's particularly sustainable and um and also i mean look i've been encrypted long enough to know that like although in general you should assume that markets are smarter than you are and that markets are forward-looking um encrypted i think those are both bad assumptions depending on who you are so uh i i generally speaking you know i i strongly take my own judgment over what the market's telling me and uh if you know i think i think it's very likely that when we see now we've backed a number of games um and even games that are using plane to earn style mechanics but pretty much everybody we have backed you know when we ask them like what do you think of actually infinity their answer is that like yeah it's [ __ ] like it's not gonna work and you know you need to have sustainable token economics in order for uh to build a game with real longevity and the game's gotta be fun and you know the one thing that you'll never hear in the same sentence is actually infinity and fun uh and in fact you know you go look up any content you could possibly find in actually infinity 100 of it is about making money and zero percent is about having a good time and that has to reverse for crypto gaming to actually have legs so the games that we're backing are like trying to be fun first and the reality is that building a fun game takes time uh you don't get a fun game by like doing a bunch of nft pre-sales and land sales and this thing and that thing and then like hanging with people in the third world to play your game that's not how you build a sustainable game economy right you can't mint fun like you can mint a token unfortunately not no you can do that with nfts but not with uh games um maybe maybe that is in hindsight like how we reflect on this whole nft mania is like oh yeah we figured out how to briefly mint fun and then we milked that for all of its worth yes yes i do think that in retrospect when we look back on this sort of gen one of crypto gaming it's gonna look a lot like gen one of tokens sure we're gonna we're gonna have the same kind of embarrassment yes yes yeah people are gonna be people are gonna look back and kind of be like i was kind of right but like yeah maybe i missed like the particulars of why this generation wasn't going to work right uh when you do your your seat investing at dragonfly uh do you like think about is this going to outperform eth or how do you try and gauge performance like what is your what is your measure for return that is or bitcoin or or your preferred l1 asset yeah yeah yeah i mean you generally want to be thinking of looking am i is this a good risk adjusted return and risk of gestated relative to what and the answer should be the the risk and return profile of just beta right which is buying bitcoin or buying ether um that being said you know our our venture funds can't just go and buy either so that that actually is not literally the counter factual but that's ultimately what our lps are going to judge us on is are you is investing in you better than just buying the underlying um and so that yeah that's the metric by which we try to judge our investments and uh switching gears a little bit but also not totally uh you have a background in poker uh can you talk about how poker has influenced your decision making in these markets especially the the emotional ones so poker it's an interesting question so you know most you know you're most people are aware a lot of poker players have found their way into crypto um but most those poker players end up on the trading side uh they're actually very few poker players i know that have ended up on the venture side and trading and venture require very different skill sets so i think poker and trading have a lot of crossover in common uh there's a lot of stuff in there about risk management controlling your emotions um thinking in terms of expected value being probabilistic about you know understanding outcomes those are skills that poker trains you in that are very much rewarded in trading venture is a very different kind of business because inventor so one venture is driven by power laws meaning that most things uh make very little money or make no money and then a few things make a ton of money and so you're really betting on this like asymptotic return profile on each individual investment and trading is not like that like most times trading it's like okay it goes it goes for you goes against you but like you just need to be right more than 50 of the time and you're gonna make money um whereas venture is like you make a hundred bets and three of them are going to pay for your entire fund and one of them is going to be like a thousand x right that's what venture looks like and so the kind of thinking you need to do in venture it's very different than the kind of thinking you do in poker because you constantly it's very difficult to do math when you're dealing with power laws right like the the uh the convexity of individual bets is so high that something that like is most likely going to fail but it's a very small chance of paying off a very very large amount of money um there aren't a lot of things like that at poker the second thing about it that's different from poker is that venture is very relationship driven and it's very it's extremely iterated game so venture is all about building your brand building the way that people know you and think of you and building long-term relationships whereas poker famously is like you know it's like this hand i just have to make money in this hand and i maximize value in this hand and that's it and like generally speaking you not really although obviously poker is an iterated game in the sense that you're playing the same people at the same table from multiple different hands um you're not really worried about okay i want to be nice to this guy so that next time around you know he's gonna be nice to me if you know i don't want to check raise him too hard because then he'll check raise me next time like usually in poker it's like no i'm just gonna check raise him and screw him and like exert as much pressure as you can unless you're thinking about like okay this guy's a fish and like i want to keep him happy because i want to keep him losing money to me next time and the time after that but that's generally not a huge part of how poker has played it's a fairly small factor in poker um so those are ways in which i think venture poker doesn't really prepare you that well for venture it prepares you very well for training but not very well for venture and that's why i think you see very few poker players find their way into venture um so that's i feel like i've had to learn a lot of those skills really from scratch as a venture capitalist interesting yeah i never really considered that dynamic but the the zero sum versus positive some games and the the um the iterative game uh aspect of venture is is a brand new concept to me so i definitely want to dive into that particularly what aspects of venture are like positive some iterative like you scratch my back i'll scratch your back kind of kind of thing like what what are the relationships that you're trying to establish that help you become a better venture capitalist so there's a bunch of them so um beyond just you know creating a lot of value and putting out content that ends up becoming valuable in ways that are difficult to quantify right like that's what brand is brand is sort of difficult to quantify relationships we have lots of small relationships a lot of people who you've never met that's brand uh you know the the the importance if anything in poker it's actually the way around uh and in some ways in trading it's the other way around trading you don't want people to know what you're doing uh you don't want people to know that you're a really smart trader and that you're making a lot of money and you're pushing these edges same thing in poker and poker generally you actually don't want people to know you're good because if people know you're good they won't play you um and so in some sense there's like an anti-value to brand is that having brand unless it's like you know you're getting on tv and or you're getting invited to these invite-only tournaments but then there's this big difference between like tv we you know we would often call them like tv poker players and like real poker players and like you know someone like doyle brunson who's like not actually very good anymore he's like super super odd you know he's like kind of a tv famous poker player um in a real card game he would actually be a terrible he'd be like a fish at the table in like a realistic poker game but he you know gets he's famous he gets fighter on tv and then he gets a play in these like really soft games where actually he's he's good when he's playing against you know um just like jimmy fallon or something right then okay now he's now he has the shark at that table um so in in um most poker players don't have that experience most poker players they don't want to be known but in in crypto venture or inventor generally you want to be known you want everyone to know that you're really valuable and that you're a person they want to work with and that extends not only to just random folks who might someday become entrepreneurs it also applies to your portfolio you want your portfolio to speak highly of you and you want them to be a strong reference when other people ask around about how hey what is it like to work with svc you also want to have strong relationships with co-investors so other people who you're going to find and around and you want them to say like hey i've got this company you know i don't want to take the whole thing myself who do i want to partner with to take down this investment you know i want you want you want them to think of us um or alternatively when um when we know a lot of angels who find deals very early we want them to say when they meet with a company hey you should really take dragonflies money because they're a really great uh investor and so a lot of our deal flow comes from the relationships that we have and the people with whom we've been valuable the sort of i scratch your back you scratch my back you know we bring a lot of angels into rounds they bring us into rounds we bring a lot of co-investors into our rounds they bring us into their rounds and those relationships are incredibly valuable over the long run to establishing your deal flow and your access as a vc and that's the kind of thing you don't deal with when you're when you're a trader or a a poker player there's a meme going around in crypto twitter not too long ago of um it was from from the perspective of a venture capital uh fund and it was like when the portfolio company finally calls you up for that value ad that you promised at the very beginning of the relationship and then it was like you know some like small little girl like crying her eyes out like being boohoo like oh i have to actually add value what does adding value actually look like and then like what are the how what would one add value to one of their portfolio companies and i'm assuming that being one of the most viable paths toward establishing reputation positive reputation for the for the for the venture capital fund yeah so there's a few avenues of evaluation that are most common so the first and there's a bunch of stuff that's really easy to do that a lot of vc no matter how large would be able to do it so one example is helping with recruiting right so um you know helping them find candidates helping them closing candidates helping them just even strategize around a hiring strategy which tends to be one of the biggest difficulties for early stage startups um you know support on just kind of wrote things like legal um compliance like figuring out where to structure uh given how complex structuring tends to be for crypto projects so those are some of the very early and obvious needs that research startups have uh and then you can even go further afield sort of more um you know crypto native considerations so you know a lot of people need help with getting an audit so you know these auditors they tend to have very very long um backlogs of audits and if you can help them accelerate getting into getting an audit more quickly that's really valuable um there are a lot of service providers like you know what's a good accounting firm what's a good legal firm what's a good um you know what's a good pr firm if that's what i if that's what i need or even you know if there's a dev consulting shop that i might need access to right then you've got things like okay can can i help you place a story in pr can i help you get an announcement into the block or into coindesk or into you know one of these crypto native publications with whom you know we have relationships um and then you start getting even more specialized which is can you help me with my token economics can you help me with my strategy can you help me with my go to market and these are places where it's not just enough to have people on staff who are you know good at those individual tasks that's a place where you really need um you know sort of investor level expertise right so like you know someone like myself or someone like tom you know who's another partner at dragonfly used to be head of product at 0x you know folks like us who've seen a ton of projects because of our work and experience in the industry that we can actually sit down with our companies and help them think through you know a novel token economic design or a novel approach to mechanism design or you know some way to structure their token distribution that really requires the kind of expertise that they can't buy right you can buy help from a recruiting firm like technically we kind of bundle it together with our investment you can you can buy a pr firm that can you know give you access to a coin desk or whatever but you can't buy the kind of expertise that a relatively small number of firms actually have in-house um you know it's like for paradigm you can't buy dan robinson right you know a dragonfly like you can't buy a c to sit down with you and think through your token economics and so that tends to be the most irreplaceable part of what uh strong vcs can can provide to portfolio companies it seems like you um that what from what you just listed off more or less is somehow involved with almost everything about like a startup just like you know legal or just like the rob token economics of like how their project works or connections and hiring it sounds like you know you can ha you have the potential of helping them out with almost literally every one of their needs and a lot of that comes from simply like the reputation and the connections that you've established from yourself as a brand like well it's easier for us to provide that for you than it is for you to provide that for you because we have connections is that more or less right yes or no i mean the the media and company is not going to ask for even you know half of those things right like a median company has some of those things figured out and other ones of those they need help on so right yeah it wasn't something like exactly we do your structuring right i wasn't saying like you come and bring down like literally half of the company coming from dragonfly to make this one startup but just like you have the potential to and you have the optionality to do all of those things yes yes i think for sufficiently large firms we tend to be pretty full stack in the way that we um can perform our value add but there are some things that are more common than others that people actually want from us right generally what i the advice that i give to founders in thinking about value ad is you know vcs we're in the bundling business meaning that our job is to try to brand our capital as being different from other people's capital and the reality of course that capital does not brand it right real actual capital is just like money in your bank and you can't tell who it came from so it doesn't really matter who you get it from and so what vcs really do is they try to make it so the package of my capital is worth more than the package of that person's capital and um it's our it's in our incentive to bundle as many things as possible in that package um now the most valuable bundles are bundles that include things that you can't buy otherwise right and so you know if i were to tell you like look i'm going to invest in your company in exchange i'm going to market make your token um and that's going to be really valuable and you know so a lot of market makers try to get into vc by offering you know a bundle of market making services or you know an auditing firm might say hey i want to get some room on your cap table um and i will you know give you a discount on audits if you if you use me as an auditor um and these things are obviously valuable right like it's them trying to compete in their own way in the bundling business but the advice i generally give founders is that um usually the most valuable bundles like if you take money from an andreessen or a paradigm or a poly chain or a dragonfly the most valuable part of that bundle again is the part that you cannot buy right so like if if uh if if somebody wants to offer you market making services well you can buy market making services right there's it's a completely modified market you can you can buy it from any of the market makers they're all your price um but there are some things that again you cannot buy or that if you want to try to get yourself will take you a lot of time and time is the one resource that you cannot spend money on generally um and so those are the things that are usually most valuable in that bundle and it's why you see in fact that you know it is the top vcs who end up usually winning the allocation in a lot of these deals not market makers not service providers and not other people who have more commodified forms of that bundle when they're trying to invest into early stage companies and how does that change the game for what a vc is looking for when it's trying to grow out its own staffing and its own its own resources in-house like what what what is hot what's hot on the market for a vc firm is it poker players obviously poker player is very high i mean the hardest thing right now that i think most people are realizing it's very very hard to just get an investment team anybody who knows how to invest in crypto is in extremely high demand um and so you've got you know you've got like you know 23 year olds who've got like two years of experience who are getting partner offers at like triad five funds and this is just this is just the way the world now and i i think it's gonna be a while until you see supply and demand equilibrate uh on the investment side i mean you're seeing it too obviously on the engineering side whether you're getting seen crazy crazy engineering hires crazy legal hires um where folks who are making you know somebody in big law for example is making you know maybe 500k a year with um you know four or five years experience at a big law firm um is being offered like a million dollars a year in a top token project uh that kind of pay bump is a function of supply and demand right there's just not enough supply of crypto native talent um so i think over time that will normalize like we're already you know you and i are seeing a huge influx of people coming into crypto and those people within a couple years they're gonna be ramped up and that's gonna change the supply and demand mechanics within crypto um but it's gonna take some time for that to happen and we're certainly uh far away from there today you said people who know how to invest in crypto um i mean anyone who comes into this market can you know sign up for coinbase buy some ethan bitcoin you know make itself uh take self custody of it buy some tokens on unit swap but what does it really mean to be like good at investing in crypto like i've been in this industry for almost five years now which is insane like i'm not even sure if i'm good at investing in crypto so like what does that actually mean so when i say investing i mean the liquid market side i have less expertise on just because it's not what i spend my day today on um the the venture side what it means to be good at investing into crypto generally the way that you're going to be measured for your skill at investing is um one is just your portfolio right so what what deals have you gotten into so whether that's as an angel or whether that's at a firm where you're investing uh you're on behalf of a of a platform um but then there's there's one element of getting a check into a deal which is kind of just your it's really about judgment and having some degree of access but the real barometer of like how good are you investing in crypto is uh can you lead deals can you really extract large amounts of the cap table and really sell an entrepreneur on not just let me in the round but have me be the guy who you partner with for this round um and that is you know it's sort of like if you if you got into a great deal like let's say you did um let's say you did avalanche early right um you get some points for just picking avalanche so it's like okay great you have good judgment you have good taste in deals um you get even more points if you've got a if you're more than just an angel but you got a platform into avalanche right because as an angel sorry you get like a 25k check-in okay that's like not that hard to get a 25k check-in people will take a 25k check you know even if you just have a vague promise of being valuable um but if you want to get like a 500k check-in or a 200k check-in it's like okay you need to really justify that for a platform so that gives you more points but the most points you'll get is if you get like you know a three million dollar check-in or a 10 million check-in that's like okay you you really earned the trust of this person and you can win deals and winning deals is kind of the the hardest and rare skill to get in crypto and the reason why of course that's a very multi-dimensional skill uh in order to win a deal you need to be competent you'd be trustworthy you need to have uh relationships that are really strong you need to have a reputational value add it's like all those things that we were talking about you need to kind of be the whole package in order to be able to lead deals and so that's like the highest echelon of okay you are somebody around whom we can build a firm because you're a deal winner um so those are the ways in which if i were looking at a potential investment candidate that's how i'd be sizing up the the value of their of their experience um so the worst of all is if like if you're somebody who you've you you have a track record of investments into terrible deals then it's like okay i like would rather not work with you at all because like you're gonna be bringing in bad deals and you don't have a good reputation etc etc okay so they need they need their own deal flow they obviously need their own capital but from what i heard is that the real magic is um allocating size into a good a deal that ultimately ends up working out and so basically having the conviction and the knowledge to um quote-unquote ape into a very strong deal that turns out to be strong in hindsight that's really what you're looking for right but also the the ability to to win that lead position right yes winning a lead position is a lot of it is really about sales right um and it's about sales and marketing right so the way i like to put it is that um as a vc firm you have to do both you do both sales and marketing marketing is brand marketing is like the research you put out the talks you give the the tweets you do like the way in which people know who you are before you show up to the table that's marketing that's your brand but your ability to win deals like when you actually show up and sit down with an entrepreneur and convince them yo you should let me lead you around because i'm awesome and i'm going to you know help you become successful um that's sales that's more like hand-to-hand combat and in order to be a great vc you need to be able to do both you need to be able to do both building the brand and the reputation of yourself and your firm but you also need to be able to sit down with entrepreneur and convince them that you're the guy they should take you over poly chain or andreessen or over paradigm and that's that's hard it's hard to do um but the very best investors uh have exactly that skill set am i allowed to ask what your pitch is or is that trade secrets [Laughter] um you're allowed to ask it depends a lot on the company what um the sales pitch is but um if i just sort of imagine myself pitching a generic company i'd say there are a few things that i would lean on in my pitch so i'm assuming it's me myself personally who's the partner who's on that deal um the first thing i'd point out is that you know i've invested in you know a bunch of the great companies and products in crypto um so you know i did the seed round of avalanche seed round of near protocol seed round of uh you know doing analytics um uh matter labs uh a bunch of the great company and you know compound and maker dao and one inch and so on so a bunch of stuff whether it's in c5 defy letter ones lair twos i've been an early investor in all those things so i know the industry extremely well um i i think very deeply and strongly about token economics something i can sit down with you on and help you think through how to design your protocol and what are the pitfalls that i've seen other projects fall into that that you can avoid um i have relationships with you know all the big folks in the space whether it's auditors um whether it's uh you know the the pr firms or sorry not pf the uh the publications that um uh that you want to get your story out into um and um and i'm somebody wanting your corner you know i'm somebody who can help you think through the ups and downs of like how to build this thing from zero to a hundred um and of course the other thing about dragonfly that makes us very unique is that we're also a global firm so we have a presence in asia which most of the firms don't really have and we can help you think about how to bring your protocol or your company to a global stage beyond just the twitter sphere um twitter's huge obviously crypto twitter is a big deal but it's only one part of where crypto operates encrypt is a global phenomenon and if you don't have a window into your community outside of the us or outside of the anglophone market then you're missing a big part of what's making your protocol tick and that's something that i can help you navigate so that's my very generic it's a very generic pitch um but you know usually it depends on who i'm sitting down in front of what in particular i would be focused on in uh communicating why i'm the right person to partner with after you establish like relationships with these companies like i'm sure they they turn into you know more than just you know your portfolio companies i'm sure like you get to know these people get to know their face you establish some sort of like actual relationship with them how do you go about navigating the actual selling of the asset selling of the token because you know there are some brands there are some vc funds out there that have the explicit brand of like this fund dumps your token at the soonest available opportunity and that's kind of definitely worked against them so obviously that's something that you have to consider as a vc is like with the timing and just like uh you know obviously like your job is to make money so the commitment is like well at some point the token gets sold but like also that is like a choice of like oh yeah we are choosing to uh kind of transactionally end our relationship by selling this token not all of it but how how do you navigate those waters of like this is an appropriate time to credibly and honorably sell this token like how do you time that yeah no it's a good and it's a very tricky question um so there's a few components of it so the first of course is that uh you know as vcs we're always locked up in every investment that we make we don't do any deals without lockups um so there's a and generally speaking you know when we're looking at a deal and there's not the pretense of lockups um or you know there's like okay everyone is going to be fully unlocked in like a year and a half generally speaking that's like a hard pass from us because um we believe really strongly in the alignment of incentives and you know we saw this in the you know 2017-2018 ico boom is that when you don't have lockups you don't have incentives a line then people basically they launch something and then they walk away oh wow that's not it's not healthy for the community yeah exactly something for the community it's not healthy for the investors it's not healthy for the founders so um so generally we we in general push for lockups and we like lock-ups um and we and we often prefer them to be longer than what sometimes uh uh some of the uh initial state in which we might find these rounds um being being priced at uh now that being said like obviously as a venture capitalist we eventually have to sell because we have lps and rlps have the demand to eventually get their money back so we do eventually have to sell but we're in no hurry to sell right so as venture capital we're not trainers um and we're under there's no reason why we have to sell the moment that our lock-up expires and so generally speaking we don't sell when our lock expires and um the in our view also is that you know most of the money in the space is made in the long run um like there's always money that you can make by you know flipping things quickly you know buying things early and then selling them as soon as you become liquid on the market there are some folks who engage in that strategy and it's a strategy that can work um sometimes it doesn't work but a lot of times it does work um but that's not how that's not how the big money gets made the big money gets made by finding the right things and and sticking to them and and betting them as they continue to grow and becoming extremely valuable right like the way that you got rich off ether and bitcoin was not by jumping in and out of the market when you know things were good and things were bad like their people made money doing that absolutely a lot of people made a lot of money in crypto um but the people who made the most money in crypto are the people who just sat there and held the most valuable things and as a vc again we think in terms of power laws and if you think in terms of power laws you realize like look it's possible that you know some of the stuff that we invest in it goes liquid and as it goes liquid it you know the the demand doesn't keep pace with supply the you know supply keeps going out of the market and i think the price just you know slowly slowly creeps down and you end up you know losing a lot of what you initially looked like your markup might have been um this definitely happens and it's happened to us in our portfolio a bunch of times and it's very normal um but it doesn't really matter that much in the context of your overall portfolio compared to the things that are really going to work right so it's like the layer ones that you bet on that didn't take off all of them got more than paid for by the avalanches of the world the nearest of the world that really did take off and really became extremely valuable and so in the overall picture of a portfolio it just doesn't really matter whether or not you like sold this thing earlier or sold it late like it it doesn't matter relative to the overall growth of of crypto and the most valuable things that are being built and that's why one we don't lose too much sleep over whether we timed this particular thing or not um and second why we're not under a strong input is to sell things quickly right so if we end up being wrong in certain number of the bets that we made then okay we'll take the l unfortunately we didn't get what we you know might have originally hoped to have gotten in this particular investment um but we don't try to immediately dump the tokens as we get them because it's just not necessary now that doesn't mean that we never sell things you know before 10 years or something we do we do sometimes sell things before some other period because of some fundamental view or we might have lost we might have fundamentally lost confidence in a particular project a particular position in which case we will do that but if we if we're if we're still along for the ride and we believe in the entrepreneur then we'll hold and we'll we'll wait to see what this thing evolves into because again you know the thing about crypto is that crypt is very cyclical and um you know there are times when the market goes into you know secular decline and you know we talk about narrative exhaustion it happens in crypto um but you know the cyclicality of crypto also means that at some point again people get excited and it starts to go up and those things you know the animal spirits return um and so to some degree like you don't need to over index on what's going on in the market right now almost always the right answer in retrospect was just keep holding and see what happens with the market and probably that would have ended up working out better for you but how does that work when so much of crypto operates in fads right like if you the advice of just like well you can kind of just hold your way through it definitely doesn't always work it's like take take for example of somebody who gets into the world of the ico mania like you can't really hold your way through the ico mania granted there are things like snx and uh lend which then turned into ave and link right like we got three big big winners coming out of the ico man oh no we got more than that we got a lot more than that really right like what were your other icos cosmos icp yeah uh uh um uh which is the one i'm thinking of uh polka dots was also one yeah um okay exactly there were a ton of huge winners in the ico right if you it's it it's very reminiscent of the combo is that the dot-com bubble included amazon it included google it included a ton of companies that end up becoming absolutely generational winners and so if you just bought a basket a lot of things that basket would have gone to zero and then you would have some things that paid for everything right and today it looks like that's cosmos dfinity you know uh uh uh polka dot um and a number of other projects that have become tremendously successful that were part of that ico boom yeah i guess i guess i might have revealed my 2017 investor naivete because i was definitely definitely buying substratum and a bunch of other just like you know [ __ ] coins right they're all throughout 2017 because i didn't yeah so look some things got absolutely wrecked right something's got absolutely wrecked and are just lost to history but there are a lot of things that end up becoming among the most valuable protocols in existence so on the whole i bet you that if you index the ico bubble you made money interesting um you talked about how like three three w's will pay for the fund and then one one w will be like the the 1000 x that like really really is a differentiator has there ever been like a a time where you've been listening to a pitch or you just kind of been reflecting or diving diving deep on it on a a on a project and you're like it's going to be that one like did you is there a period of time where you identified it ahead of time uh or identified it correctly ahead of time yes correctly all the time or at least you know ballpark correctly ahead of time yeah um i think the only time that i have done that was near i mean near is the only one that i like i saw that and i was like i know that this one is going to hit i know that this one is going to be huge um [Music] and that was only in the series a not in the seed in seed i i it was very very uh nebulous but in the series a which was pre-token launch i was like this one is going to be absolutely massive um that was probably the only one that i identified oh no the second one i'd say was buy bit by bit was the other one that we bet on we were like this thing is going to be absolutely a massive success um but most of the time uh it was a surprise was there anything you remember that really stuck out as to like was just like pure product market fit or like anything that stuck out that really was like well this is this is why i believe in this for near i'll say for bybe it was more straightforward just these guys were just growing like crazy they had super good execution they had super high margins and um they were basically coming into the market right as bitmex was falling off so they were filling a big hole in the market um and in the derivative space so that was just like a market structure and it was just really obvious to anybody who had underwritten business that these guys were just going to continue to crush and of course perps are just a huge market so being one of the dominant players and purpose and rapidly rising in your market share um it's you know i feel like that that was just a 100 iq like doesn't require a lot of insight to realize that but it was going to win to look at near the reason why we i was so bullish on near at that time this was like uh before the uh the coinland sale that we invested into near and the reason why i was so bullish on nir at that time was one is that i felt like nier was probably pound for pound the best engineering team in crypto uh in later ones um second is that they had basically innovated on the design for ethereum 2.0 like ethereum actually took a lot from the near sharding design there was a lot of i feel like the two things that were most influential on on uh east 2.0 were probably near and far coin were probably two biggest influences and um and near just had the most credible shot on sharding of any blockchain that i had seen and that seemed really really compelling and third is that they had an evm story and i was you know very bullish on the evm continue to be dominant and if they could integrate the evm into a sharding based platform but also with the developer experience of having a wasm-based runtime that people could also opt into that was higher performance that i was just like this thing is just going to be huge given that the demand for ether uh the demand for ethereum block space is so high um and i think sharding is just long term the most the most credible path to scaling so um for not the most but one of the most credible paths of scaling so um that may be just incredibly blush on here do you know when this was when was this um this was uh late 2020. so this was like um october-ish i think yeah demand space for ethereum hadn't it had started to pick up we were at one grey gas prices for a really long time and i can't remember when we actually broke out of that paradigm and went from like one to three and then a few months later we went three to ten and everyone was like freaking out about how congested ethereum block space was i think that was towards the end of 2019 um but you must yeah well this is this is after earth summer well this was after defense summer but yes like it was uh block block of the year demand so 2020 was defined summer yeah yeah yeah 2020 was your first summer so sorry i thought later you say 2019. um so yeah yeah it was pretty straightforward that demand for block space exceeded what ethereum was going to be able to do and the other thing of course was just that ethereum 2.0 was so far away and it was just really obvious to us that like everybody who was thinking it in 2.0 was coming soon was completely off the rocker and like it was going to take forever for 2.0 so you needed to have other approaches to scaling blockchains to come in the interim so at that time there was this debate that i feel like um in my mind got resolved in early 2020 of is it going to be ethereum and ethereum 2.0 or is it going to be alternative layer ones and to me like it just became i just became absolutely certain basically in um in like early mid late 2018 it was not obvious to me i feel like it really could have gone either way um early 2018 if i go either way mid to late 2019 i became more and more certain that other ones were going to matter and that ethereum was not just going to own the entire market um and then by by late 2020 i feel like it was just a done deal and what do you think now i i think it's it's been the same since 2020 it's a dungeon we're in a multi-chain world right there's no longer a debate it's just a fact do you think what do you think over like 2025 to 2030 the distribution between market share between ethereum and the rest of the uh the all layer ones do you have a kind of a gut ballpark field on on what that what that might look like um it's an extremely hard question um if i just had to give a guess up top my head i would guess that ethereum was probably going to have like 50 to 60 market share and then and then like three to five all layer one split up the rest something like that yeah my guess is that like the number two player probably has 20 market share and then it like kind of falls off from there sure living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware

defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon switching gears a little bit here i remember uh going back to kind of the similar question where like you had this opportunity and you knew ahead of time that this was gonna work um for me in 2018 that was cosmos um i learned about cosmos doing just like basic like very like 2018 was my first like nine months into crypto so i was very very new but i still had like my strong intuition that i think most people didn't have back then and uh the the multi-chain the and like interoperability layer is very very attractive uh it's like a very simple concept oh we got all these chains well we need the chains to span the chains that was cosmos like obviously we need we we need that and i remember i was working at an ico advisory company my first crypto job uh and i went and printed off like the first couple pages of the cosmos white paper and i took it over to the research team i slapped it down on the desk and i guess okay guys read this uh and i was like they were all like oh my god this is so great this is exactly what we're looking for um uh so basically the the tldr of the story is like i had i had that like i i called that but after i was like okay like how do i buy the token uh turns out like they had already sold the token to uh i'm pretty sure accredited investors that i was not able to to get in at the time because i was like a recently broke college student and so we've had this conversation about like vcs and their connections to to media firms and to and to uh like um uh token or smart contract auditors and being able to uh provide value to their to their angel or to their seed investment companies their portfolio companies by using their connections uh and like you know we still have accreditation laws and all that stuff and and to some degree part of the web three narrative is like we could get away from all that like we can have like the users and that was the ico narrative is that you know no it's the users that are the investors now do you still see any like kernel of energy around that narrative in in in web 3 because i i see it less and less and less these days yeah well first of all didn't cosmos do an ico yeah it might have just been before my time so i might have just missed it okay okay yeah because i'm pretty sure they did i'm pretty sure they did it sorry this story is still good yes but i understand that i just had the broader point i understand the broader point yeah yeah um so the first thing is that uh when we say retail what do we mean by retail um because the the reality and what do we mean by the community right those are often the two terms that we kind of use interchangeably but i think they also imply different things um the reality of course is that you look at defy right when you when you open up something like when you open up an ideo the the vision behind opening up an ideo or opening up like nft minting is that the community or retail gets to participate right right um and the reality of course is that it's not retail or quote unquote the community that participates it's a bunch of trading firms with bots that actually can you know get into get into flash bots or you know front run the mempool or do all this fancy stuff to go and fill out this entire thing before you can even show up right if you're if you're sitting there clicking buttons on an interface like you're already out of the game like that's you're you're done like they're don't bother um so the ability to really identify what do we mean by retail has become more and more clouded over time as the space has gotten more professionalized so that's that's one thing now the second thing is that uh in some ways one of the most pure embodiments of what we mean by retail and the community is um uh what's what's the term like discord grinding uh or uh weightless grinding basically like you know folks who basically will just go around and like basically farm engagement in a bunch of different discords in order to get involved participation yeah pre-med exactly farm participation right and like in a way this is actually very um this is like these are true retail people who are doing this right like this is not uh trading firms that are going in and doing it because you can't do that at scale right this is like true individuals but of course it's the most cavalier mercenary kind of individuals who are going into doing that the real thing that you want what you mean when you say how do we get the participation of retail is what i mean is like the really nice folks who are not trying to gain things who are not just standing for the money who really just believe in the ethos of ethereum or you believe in the ethos of nfts or believe in the ethos of the thing that i'm building and the reality is that like as you start slicing up the pie of what i mean by retail um it starts getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller to the point where like it's almost impossible to actually specify those people within a set of rules right like it's kind of like i know when i see it when i know like a real genuine community member but there's no mechanism i can come up with that actually distributes tokens to just those people and not these other people who i don't want to give tokens to because they're all a bunch of mercenaries and i think the realization that as the space has professionalized it's harder and harder to accomplish that true goal which is you know i want to give it to my true community members um that you realize like look the roi on giving it to the folks who show up in whatever mechanism i come up with if 80 of those tokens are actually going to trading firms then like that's such terrible roi on on on trying to do a community distribution that like why am i even optimizing for that anymore it's so inefficient to try to do that that it just doesn't work now we have things like you know arc x um or things like galaxy that uh try to find ways to sort of do on-chain kyc for real good users who've been you know active in governance or who have participated in other d5 protocols before as a kind of civil resistance for you know how to identify really true good community members but the reality is that it's hard it's really hard to do that um and so one of the reasons why people kind of throw up their arms and give up on this notion of you know really being really trying to do an earnest distribution to community is that the definition and the ability to access that community has changed over the last three or four years right four years ago it was much easier if you did an ico you could pretty much bet that most people who are buying your token were genuinely quote quote-unquote retail or quote-unquote community members but that's just not true today and that's why it's a lot easier to say look i know if i give my money or sorry if i if i take capital from a you know high-quality vc that they will help me but i don't know if i if i do a distribution to quote unquote retail then it's not going to mostly go to a bunch of trading firms that are just going to dump my token the moment they pick it up which is in fact what will happen if you just do an idea um without any other forms of gating so that i think is is where a lot of this exasperation with the notion of selling tokens to community has come from yeah it seems like a gigantic moloch trap where even if there are a supply of very engaged quality community members who definitely deserve the tokens like the more and more of those people that there are the more and more incentive it becomes to game game those though that existence of those people and like become the wolf in the sheep's clothing like oh yeah we're just like those let us in and then we'll just drown everyone out exactly and that's and you see the same thing with like you know you saw it with ribbon farming you see it with you know dydx um you know watch trading you see it with almost every one of these mechanics uh for distributing tokens to users of the protocol gets gained in one way or another and there's almost no mechanism you can come up with that will not get gamed somehow so say that there every single uh cycle of crypto brings in their brand new cohort like we currently have the 2020 to 2021 cohort of crypto people who are you know quote-unquote buying the top and like earning their stripes and all that stuff but see there's a listener who uh is like well i'm one of those like i believe in crypto i believe in the ethos i see the the potential of crypto not just for 2025 or 2020 or 2030 but like for 2050 in 2070 and i'm i'm so crypto pilled and i believe in the ethos and i'm here for the long term and i am a good community member there's i hope there's a number of those listeners listening to bankless right now do you have any just perspectives or thoughts or advice for for these types of people just how to navigate the murky waters of retail and actually become elevated to start participating in some of the conversations that we've been having here yeah i'd say the um the number one thing that you can do in anything but especially in crypto is to take on responsibility so the one thing that there is there's a lot of engagement in crypto right there's a lot of people who show up in your discord a lot of people who will like you know something especially on your first governance vote a lot of people who might vote in governance or like weigh in on some forum post um but there are not a lot of people who will take on responsibility they'll raise up their hand and say i will be responsible for x and i will do the you know the cat hurting i will do the dirty work i will write up the docs i will you know organize the um the governance calls or whatever it is right uh that that instinct to just raise your hand and take on responsibility in the communities that you're a part of is the most valuable thing and the most likely thing that's going to one gets you a lot smarter about web3 and also if what you're looking for is compensation as a you know member of the web 3 community you're going to get there much faster by taking on that responsibility and also getting invited upwards to take on responsibility in other communities and other dows and other multi-stakes right like if you if you show up in a bunch of these discords and you just you know type a bunch of random stuff and get into arguments and then uh you know expect an airdrop that person is going to become much less successful over the next you know several years than the person who learns how to be an active and engaged and valuable community member so that would be my number one piece of advice to the marginal person coming into crypto i think that maps on to a lot of the advice that i've seen in other industries give with when it generally comes like breaking into the industry like you're a no one and you're in a sea of nobodies and so how do you stand out is that well you start doing valuable work for free and if you do work for free that's like the easiest way to stand out because no one does work for free like why would they do that uh but like doing work for free and willingly uh take on responsibility without everyone anyone asking you uh is indicative of of perhaps so many more things and that's perhaps why people uh why people like that pique the interest of of others that's exactly right and the number one thing that um i hear founders lament about you know their communities is that there are a lot of people who show up because they want an airdrop or they want you know to get some alpha or whatever um there are not a lot of people who show up and like hey i love what you're doing how can i get involved that is like music to every founder's ears and if you just say those magic words like how can i help they will be absolutely delighted and they will sing your praises from the rooftops and you'll start building your own reputation as being a valuable member of the web through community and not just somebody who's here to learn but somebody who's here to contribute i will say that the question of how can i help not not not from the centralized projects upstarts and startups but from the dow side of things the question of how can i help has become like an absolute meme because everyone in a dow in a decentralized dow wants to ask that question but no one wants to actually be the delegation of responsibility and so no one endows no one can actually say like do this we need more people in dao to say oh you want to help go do this we have not enough not enough people to delegate responsibility and way too many people saying oh let me know how i can help um are you are you do you pay attention to like the dow dynamics um in the dowsing i'm actively engaged in i do um but you know they're obviously the number of dows is just massively exploded sure um but the thing the thing i guess the maybe a more pointed form of advice is like just go start doing things right like you notice that this thing is a problem and like don't wait for someone to like deputize you to be the person who goes and does this like there's there's this debate going on you're the one who goes in and like creates a a doc that like summarizes everyone's positions or you're the person who goes and like just is like okay man we don't we're not keeping track of like xyz and nobody can seem to get an answer on like what is going on until now and so you just go in and you're the documentarian you're just like you know that just solves that problem for everyone um and the more that you start doing that and the more you start building the trust and the people who are actually in the positions of authority uh recognize like the community leaders recognize like oh this person is a problem solver this person instead of sitting around waiting to be told what to do does valuable things um then they'll be like cool there's some other stuff that we could also use you know some extra hands on you talked about how a lot of founders are frustrated by the number of people in discord who are just there to like get the airdrop uh and i'm reminded about i can't remember the name of this phenomenon but just like when something just becomes the norm then it becomes gamed right like now everyone's just gaming airdrops do you think like air drops are kind of turning into a thing in the past just because they've just been overused and abused for the last like 18 months or do you think airdrops are going to be here for the rest of time i think airdrops are probably going to be here for a long time i think there are some projects that will start to avoid doing air drops but air drops are although they are gamed they're still really valuable um but there's the ability now to forego the airdrop um but to benefit from the implication of an airdrop right so like if you don't do an airdrop when you launch your token people get mad at you even if you never say you're gonna do their job you know you don't even imply that you're gonna do an aircraft but like people will automatically get mad at you so like what how could you launch a project without an airdrop how can you not reward your early customers this is a terrible project i'm going to leave a bad review i'm going to report you or whatever i'm going to like tell the sec on you right like this is the kind of comments you'll get if you try to launch a product with that narrative report why is that the case why is it the case right like why is that why is it happening and the answer i think is that um what we have now is this very interesting um this very interesting thing that you generally don't see in economics which is uh basically like backwards causation in the sense that you are incentivizing behavior people did in the past by a pre-commitment that you're going to do something in the future to reward their past behavior right so it's almost like you know um uh i'm going to uh like here's here's one problem uh in general like a generalized problem in just game theory right like let's say that uh i want to make you um let's say we're in russia and i'm like trying to make you uh become you know the next president of russia um and you know become the president of russia it's a very cutthroat business right so when you become president of russia you just have total control over everything you're just like a dictator um so if i help you to become the president of russia but when i when i succeed in making you president of russia i lose all my leverage over you so i have no way to make you enforce your commitment to actually you know pay me back for helping make you the president of russia um then like i have no way to stop you from backstabbing me and it's not rational for you anymore when you become president russia for you to actually make good on the commitments you made prior to that because you know you can you have total control now you can just like kill everyone who could potentially get in your way or who had any leverage over you so this is a fundamental problem in a lot of systems where you cannot actually reward people in the past because there's no credible way to enforce the commitment after you you you know become successful right in the same way right like how do you enforce when a project actually becomes successful that they are going to go do the air drop and the answer is that there is really no way to do it there's no way to enforce that this dow actually does the airdrop um and therefore rewarding the early community like the way that you the leverage they have over you is that they're going to yell at you and they're going to say this is a bad project and blah blah blah right but like if you become open c or if you become you know uniswap it doesn't really matter what those people say because you're going to win anyway right so somehow we've got into this equilibrium that even though it's really hard to enforce this every project is kind of benefiting from this assumption that the characters there is going to be interesting we're not going to say it we're not going to there's an invisible carrot right that's now implied with almost every single project and the projects benefit from that because now a lot of people are using the project they're putting tvl in the project they're blah blah blah right like they're getting the flywheel going in the expectation that there is going to be an airbow now if you don't do the airdrop right um if you don't do the airdrop you're kind of defecting in the person's dilemma right you're the person who's like you know what everyone else is going to get hurt for this because other people now are going to start assuming that maybe there's not an airdrop on the next marginal project but it's to my benefit to not do the airdrop right even if a few people get mad at me i don't really care it's not going to impact my community that much i suspect that what you'll see though is that the risk of not doing the airdrop and pissing off your community is going to perceive as being too high that most projects are going to say look i'm going to do something even if it's nominal even if it's a very small air drop i'll do something and that's the way in which i'm gonna quote-unquote defect from this equilibrium so i'll do like a two to three percent token distribution air drop which is something but it's not much uh and that will be my carrot to the community and say look i did an airdrop you guys are just complaining but technically like i did the airdrop i never told you how much i was going to give to the community and that will become more and more closer to equilibrium but i think airdrops will probably just never go away because they are they've just become the norm and people don't want to make their community mad at them um and so it's like i i'm okay with having my community a little bit mad at me but i really don't want them to be like completely mad at me and that's why like airdrops will just be this like sticky thing kind of like white papers were right like white papers like why why did we keep writing like latex white papers after even for things that aren't technical right like they don't need a white paper to explain them like after 2017 they became this like cargo cult of if you're launching a token you need a white paper and you need to put like math equations in it and like we just do even worse graphic design gradually let go of this yes exactly like we've gradually let go of this we're like now now you see like notions right like there's like a notion and we've we've gradually got to the point where you don't have to have white paper anymore unless you're building something super super technical in which case okay you still need to have a white paper um but um this norm just like showed up and it was so hard to make it go away even when i would tell entrepreneurs look i don't care you don't need to have a white paper just explain what you're building clearly that's all i ask for i do not ask for white paper i don't want a white paper i want a clear explanation of what you're building but it took a long time for it to go away because a lot of these norms become really sticky and hard to uh hard to dismantle and i think air drops might be one of them yeah right um it is such a useful primitive that you it seems like people with enough creativity would be able to derive some sort of value out of them because you can kind of custom custom design and airdrop however you like it's like like it's almost like touring complete right like you can kind of design an airdrop however you see fit so it's really up to you to to make it work um as we as we kind of wrap up here i have just a zoomed out higher level question for you do you think web 3 is currently or at least on the trajectory towards trying to kind of fulfill some of the from some of the goals that the crypto industry has for it like web3 has an ethos it has like a vision uh or are you or are we not doing that or are you more agnostic to like people's subjective interpretations as to what web3 should be does that make sense as a question it does it does um i would say i am personally more agnostic about what web 3 is and what it's supposed to be um you know the term web 3 has metamorphosed so much over the last few years right like web 3 you know originally just called it crypto now web 3 kind of is like this big basket of things that you want when i think web3 you know what that originally meant to me was a replacement for traditional web services intermediated by blockchains right like that's what i think when i think web 3. now the term obviously has become much broader than that for the record that is the first time that the first way that i started using web 3 back in 2017 2018 and then it kind of left right left the common vernacular and then it kind of resurfaced in the last year personally i just use it because it pulls well and people like it it does it does it is now it's now like the more um it's a more respectable way to describe crypto web three like sounds exactly right futuristic that's more idealistic right it's more respectable um and so and this is like this is just the thing that happens right like with words is that some words you get stale you gotta let them go and you gotta adopt new ones so um so yeah what are my views on on the direction of web3 i think the reality is that every single time i've heard somebody tell me what web 3 was going to be or what crypt it was going to be um they were almost always wrong and the reality is that we are like i've been in this industry long enough to know that um no one knows where it's going no one is able to predict the future direction of this stuff the way that i see it like all of us all human beings who are participating in the crypto revolution we're all playing this like big we're all playing this on this like giant ouija board and we're all pulling the thing in a different direction and somebody who claims like oh i know what word i know what word we're spelling um they probably don't know uh they might know the direction that we're pulling in right now but as more people enter the space as more ideas come are invented and as more founders come in and start uh you know moving the direction of innovation somewhere else we're going to see all this stuff evolve and all this stuff change and so the answer in my mind is like i i think that the job at least of a crypto investor is not to try to predict the future but rather to pay attention to the present and you know the the you know one thing i often tell folks on on our investment team when they ask me like oh where you know how do we figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work then the answer is like look no one can figure out what's going to work you know it's not going to work like it's really hard to do that's why you know that's why venture is the way it is which is that you invest in a ton of stuff and most of it doesn't work and a small number of things end up becoming really successful um you know when we invested early into defy we invested early into these alternatively ones it was way before defy summer it was way before ethereum was congested right or i guess congested in the ico bubble but uh you know not anywhere to the degree that it is today and um what we were doing at that time was not predicting the future it was noticing the present it was noticing that there were all these great entrepreneurs who had genuinely really novel ideas about how to build a next-generation blockchain that if in fact we were going to get tens of millions of people into crypto that that was going to be necessary and they were building it and they had insights that were real um you know d5 in the early days it was a bunch of nerds who were just like off in a corner playing with lego blocks and like you know at that time it was not obvious that any of the stuff was going to be significant or that it was going to be billions of dollars in locked in these protocols at the time was just a bunch of nerds in their garages right and like and and that um but like noticing that what they were building was actually really sound it was actually going to work if it really got to scale and that it was it was really creating brand new innovations that had never before been invented um noticing that um was our superpower as investors um and so i think the same thing i take the same philosophy today is that like i don't see my job or even my ability as being able to predict the future of crypto what i see my skill set as is being able to notice what's happening in the present to understand it to explain it and to at least draw the line out but the line is super uncertain where it goes and uh you know to that extent i'm kind of along for the ride just as much as anyone else's yeah and this is certainly certainly a fun ride uh one one last one and we'll wrap this up is there any um just like rule of thumb or life advice or just like law of the universe that you pay attention to and follow every single day when you wake up in the morning any like bit of advice that you think is pretty canon that you like to like to share hmm what do you think a piece of advice that's canon to you yeah i guess for me the biggest thing i'd say is that um your scarcest resource is always time even when it doesn't seem like it is so anything you can do to get more time is almost always the most valuable trade-off you can make time being the one asset that you cannot purchase or mint or freely create and so hasive with that i thank you for your time and spreading some of your knowledge here on the on
