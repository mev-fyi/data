[Music] thank you we are here at the axillar interop summit and we are going to talk to Sonny agarwald who when I hear the word interoperability I definitely think Sunny he's been in the cosmos ecosystem since Cosmos was born so he is the king of interoperability if he accepts that title so we're gonna go talk to Sonny right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you're a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of defy where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees the then use uniswap on arbitrum the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the eth layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum Arboretum is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chained surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview Banco station we are back at the interop summit hosted by axillar and I'm here with sunny agarwald and when I hear the word interoperability I think of sunny how's it going Sunny I'm doing great are you all just vibing in this conference that is really custom built for you to vibe in yes it is I'm getting to spread the word yeah so tell me about some somebody who is largely inside of the evm world what is the new meta in the interrupt world uh the new meta um well axillar is definitely helping Bridge the evm and IBC worlds or there are new stuff that they're building it helps you like send messages between evm chains to Cosmos SDK chains very seamlessly so really excited about that that coming about what I've understood with Axel art I've only really learned about it in this last like 24 hours is that it is like the cosmos between Cosmos and ethereum is that a fair like metaphor yeah that's that's right it's it's a cosmos SDK build app chain that lets it's a bridge app chain basically so you know you have like many bridges they're all like multi-sig base and stuff whether it's Wormhole multi-chain uh whatever right but it's like well actually it's similar but instead of being a multi-sig it's a proof of stake based bridging solution okay so how is that different from other things like Thor chain for example like there are or like Ren protocol yeah there's a bunch of other proof of stake middleware chains is actually really all that different from all those so door chain uh it uses similar technology to Thor chain but Thor chain is like it doesn't let you do bridging it only lets you use their bridges for Thor chain swaps and this is part of their whole security model where they don't want you to use it to bridge stuff right and that's cool technology but you know we can't use our osmosis right you can think of it almost like osmosis plus axlar equal store chain okay and so we sort of fragmented these two things out we were like hey I'm not supposed to should we be building our own Bridges and we looked at all the bridge hacks that were happening we're like that is a responsibility and risk that we don't want to take on ourselves let's find a team that is like really solid and understands this stuff really well and that's we went through this whole decentralized Bridge Bake Off process and we kind of came to the conclusion that axolar is the team that has the best bridging Tech in the entire space in our opinion okay and how much of that opinion is shared by others is that your opinion or is that kind of the consensus and why there are so many big names here at the axelr interoper event um so I think like part of it is like this is like a generalized interoper event so a lot of people have been coming but I think like osmosis picking axillar as our canonical bridge that helped like get them on the map and then basically every other Cosmos change started using them as well and now they're starting to be used by you know I think polygon supernets are planning on using them uh they're a partner for the new base uh roll up so I I think they're starting to get more and more traction and what I really liked about them is they're like they have a lot of functionality both from the cool features and security functionality that I think other Bridges just don't have right now okay so just to really test my knowledge here it is a cosmos IPC chain and it also by the nature of what it is can also connect to non-cosmos IBC chains through its proof-of-state consensus correct yes so it uses um a more traditional multi-stig style Bridge system not multi-sig but like you know validator controlled um like deposit system to talk to evm chains so they've connected to ethereum Avalanche polygon arbitrum BSC couple others Phantom but then to talk to Cosmos chains it uses IBC okay and what's really nice is that means for something like osmosis to talk to ethereum we don't have to have our own Bridge protocol right we just talk IBC to axillar and axelr acts like a translation layer for us to talk to evm chains okay so it's a transition layer is there is there a bridge risk here so if Axel are talking to ethereum and Phantom and then also Cosmos how much risk is there present in the system yeah so it is a you know you could call it like a custodial Bridge right the actual are validators the proof of stake system is custodying the assets that are bridged from the evm tree so there is Bridge risk um part of the things that the security stop that you know the sources team we work with Axel are to design like things like rate limiting so basically we have the system where like only 20 of the axillar bridges tvl can be removed in a six hour period and otherwise it it triggers a circuit breaker and this is the kind of stuff you know if you look at traditional Finance systems a lot of the security properties come from these circuit breaker style systems and that's what we've been working with axon teams to like bring these security mechanisms um and that's one of the things that I know I sleep better at night knowing that like okay even if there was some sort of bridge hack or something right the the losses are capped right stop loss for for bridge hacks yeah so it is the bridge that connects axelar to ethereum and axel are the fan to Phantom those are two separate Bridges not one single Bridge correct there's not one Central bridge that would collapse all the other Bridges right correct but it is run by the same validator stats right yes okay well yeah security by validator said I feel like is a pretty known quantity it's an independent Bridge from chain to chain it always seems to be the the weak Link in all these systems yeah and so asler still kind of it has to work around that kind of risk dependency right right I mean I guess to talk to every evm chain it's using a similar implementation sure right so if there's a contract risk you can imagine that same contract risk probably exists on multiple chains so but then oxar is working on non-evm Bridges as well and that's kind of what they were announcing at this event was like basically building an SDK that allows more people to build plugable bridges in Jack's alarm Okay moving on from axelr because I know you're actually more of a cosmos guy just speaking on Axel's behalf uh what's going on in the cosmos ecosystem what are people really excited about uh what's what's the meta there yeah so I think the biggest thing of the last one month probably is the Mars launch so Mars is a lending app chain um and they just sort of launched recently and so you know in Cosmos they're having a couple lending applications but none of them had real product Market fit yet until like Mars launched and they hit their you know they have these borrow caps uh for security reasons sure and I think they hit their borrow caps within three hours of launch and so you know there's only up in that but like you know so far Cosmos we've had a lot of dexes obviously Cosmos osmosis is the biggest one but lending and borrowing and margin training is sort of the next big defy use case that needs to come and uh we've been working very closely with the Mars team to enable that and I'm really excited because like one of them there's a lot of cool things that we're able to do with Mars because of how closely our teams are working together um one of the things that makes like margin trading on ethereum not as efficient as it could be is that the Ave protocol doesn't know about uniswap they act as independent protocols but in our case the osmosis Dex knows about the Mars protocol the Mars protocol knows about the osmosis decks and this allows us to do a lot of cool Capital efficiency sort of things a lot more efficient liquidations um all sorts of cool stuff and so okay so like the these things can be like oracles for each other just because of the on-chain state that's passed between each app layer or app chain is that is that a feature that is unique to app chains um it's not unique to app change it's Unique to collaborating apps okay like I love the Nuance on that one yeah it's interesting what it's like so for example yeah Mars Zeus is osmosis t-wops sure it allows you to use osmosis he shares as collateral it's liquidations instead of doing an auction system similar to what maker compound Ave do they actually execute against on-chain liquidity on osmosis um and then the coolest thing is this thing called credit accounts where what you can do is you can borrow and so in Ave today right let's say to borrow 100 of USBC you have to put down a hundred fifty dollars and eat right in Mars with the credit accounts you can put down 50 of Adam as collateral and you can borrow a hundred dollars of usdc how is this possible isn't this under collateralized right the trick is that it's borrowed into a special credit smart contract account think of it like a smart contract wallet that you're only allow all you can do with it is do certain margin trading on certain pools and the Mars protocol has the ability to liquidate right from the credit account directly right and so you're you're giving it into a custodial accounts that limits what you can do but you still have more Capital available to you yeah smart contact custodial right it's like it can only pull from your account if a liquidation is triggered right right so you get to it's under collateralized lending but with constraints on what you can do with that exactly this is how margin trading worked on centralized exchanges right if you have a margin account you can't withdraw money off of the centralized exchange right right that's that makes a ton of sense yeah so the I heard a take recently that um Cosmos is really D5 focused as in there's most of the innovation in the cosmos land is defy there's less gaming there's less identity how does that ring how does that take ring true for you and are there other what are the other non-d5 parts of Cosmos yeah so I mean obviously I spend my time focusing on the device side of things but there are things going on so stargaze is like this NFP platform you know there's a couple of you know you mentioned the bad kids I think when I mentioned it on the bank list episode start bad kids have this like huge uptick in popularity since then um and there's a couple of projects working on a lot of cool gaming stuff so like uh this is Project called Argus uh Scott he was a friend of mine he was one of the Builders of Dark Forest and he realized that like hey the cost of SDK actually gives us the ability to build a lot more powerful like on-chain fully on-chain gaming things and so he's building this project called Argus that will enable a lot more like gaming app chains and stuff so we're starting to see the initial uh proliferation of other use cases as well so how does because of Cosmos of what it is or the whole like app chain mesh layer you can contrast you have ethereum with the central shared security the ethereum community as a result I call it kind of more cohered and Cosmos is a little what's like what is the state of the broad set of the cosmos app chains Community are they like is each Community is each app change its own Community is there one broad Cosmos Community like give us the topology of the cosmos like social layer yeah so there's definitely this like meta thing where it's like people are often community members of specific popular app chains like osmosis has its own Community kujira which is another popular gags has its own Community Juno will have its own Community but then at the same time we're all like citizens of the cosmos as a whole and it's kind of like you know I'm a citizen of you know uh I I grew up in New Jersey so I'm in New jerseyan but I'm also an American right and so it's just like you kind of have both layers going on cool and then there's always a little bit of like people are often like oh there's so much drama in Cosmos but like I think people it's a little bit overblown actually to be honest like I think there's often a lot of drama within uh ethereum as well right you got unisoft Sushi swap right compound novice yeah today now you have optimism versus Arbitron right and so you see similar things but I think at the end of the day everyone is still like very tied with this larger Cosmos resident Community yeah like sports teams are still all watching the same sport right yeah yeah uh Sunny we got a lot of left in the East Denver conference it's just Tuesday and we got it goes all the way until uh Saturday what's left on your schedule what's left under your itinerary uh yeah so uh when tomorrow really looking for checking out wallet con just uh I don't know just interested I recently downloaded a new browser uh and I'm like this is an opportunity to try out some new wallets and so I've just been playing around with a bunch of different wallets and exploring like wow there's so much cool Innovation that's happening so excited to go check that out Thursday there's like this shared security Summit hosted by eigenlayer and Babylon so I'll be giving a talk there about mesh security and how that's like the future of Cosmo secure shared security um and then on the weekend I'll just be hacking at the at the hackathon and uh Sonny could you walk us through your sweater please uh yeah this is just our osmosis Christmas sweater we did a test batch run this year just for the you know quarter team core development team um I figured you know why we're a customer started only one month a year I'm gonna wear it in February who cares uh but I think you know we definitely want to figure out how to get these on chain something more like unisex sure by next year sure Sunny thank you for always walking me through this interoperability World which again I need I definitely need a guide and you are always a good one so thank you so much thank you cheers foreign
