we need local at home decentralized sustainable agriculture food production which ryan is veggies and meat veggies and meat i have opinions on this thing all right david doing a nutrition podcast is just about the most bear market thing i can think of right now hey bankless nation it is time for the weekly roll up happy third week of july i hope you have your morning coffee david you drinking a morning coffee oh two two every single day yeah absolutely just never miss it no carbs and coffee right oh absolutely no black coffee as soon as you put anything into coffee sugar milk anything it becomes a beverage it's no longer a coffee wow dude these these takes [Music] yeah anti-carb maximalism here i don't know if we're going to stand for it we're not talking nutrition today though i know you want to start another podcast but the topics of the week are crypto david what are we going to cover on the roll-up today celsius files for bankruptcy after paying off its defile loans important very important order of operations there so we're going to cover that uh suzu of three arrows capital leaks the stark net token and then the next day starknet announces a token uh so go figure thanks dude we're gonna give you something cover all of that both like why he leaked the sarconet token uh and all the the stock token details also vitalik writing a book coming out on amazon called proof of stake uh do you have it pre-ordered ryan i i did pre-order that yeah just last week and then ave doing a stable coin g-h-o for ghost the go stable coin cool a lot a lot happening in crypto of course we're going to talk about markets in just a second of course if you like the roll-up if you like the bankless podcast if you appreciate what we are doing here if you want to spread the word make sure you like and subscribe give us a review if you are viewing this podcasting this podcast in your podcast player too spotify apple if you will this comes out every friday of course also something new on spotify we actually have video on spotify now uh right yeah i was just gonna say that yeah so if you are on spotify and you also want to see mine and ryan's faces that option is available to you yeah it's it's it's great i actually started seeing that on the lex friedman podcast for the first time on spotify i saw spotify video and i kind of like it it gives us another avenue for distribution of the video beyond youtube so we get some redundancy there youtube is the only place that we have our video well not anymore because of spotify but it's kind of crazy to think about like oh well there's we we put out the podcast everywhere but like youtube's only the only place that gets the video uh and do you remember that one time youtube kicked our channel off yeah remember that one time that youtube ceo apologized for kicking us off youtube that was pretty cool can't believe that happened that was this year right it's all a player wasn't that long ago one thing you need to do though is go check out juno juno is sponsoring this message i really like what juno is doing this is a crypto native bank account of course i have a bank account david yeah like full confession i know you do too we have to we have fiat bills that we have to pay but my bank account is sadly not that i would be yeah sadly maybe someday but um my bank account i bank at wells fargo like true story it sucks i can't do anything in crypto inside of my fiat bank account and that is why if you have a bank account you also need a crypto native bank account what features does juno bring to the table david yeah so your juno checking account can turn into your token on polygon in like one click five five minutes or less uh and so like you know my will also bank at wells fargo that's why we pick on wells fargo all the time it goes from wells fargo to my gemini to swap to ether to then into my like crypto wallet on juno it goes from your checking account to ether on your preferred layer two of choice uh polygon optimism arbitrary zk sync and star ware coming soon uh in one click right and so we're just cutting out like like 30 minutes and like 17 button presses and you probably have to reset your password anyways uh and so that that's like super awesome like checking account to layer two crazy uh six percent on your uscc if you want that that's an opt-in thing uh three percent on bitcoin and ether uh but then it's also if you sign up if you get a direct deposit which also can be turned into crypto so you go from your employer paycheck to crypto to a layout two all inside of one app which is awesome uh but that the direct deposit gets turned into crypto uh and if you sign up and get your direct reposit they will pay you a hundred dollars and if you deposit crypto on the crypto side they'll pay you ten dollars so there is a link in the show notes to sign up for on juno uh this is the new era of banks we're gonna have banks for a while sadly um but we do want the good ones to have cool crypto native features that allows you to leave your bank easier if you so choose another step to going backless uh click the link in the show notes that's uh bankless.ccslashjuno to find that out david let's get to markets what's bitcoin doing this week my friend yeah bitcoin a little bit down on the week start of the week at twenty thousand four hundred dollars oh it's gone up since i wrote down these prices crazy okay so crypto markets they move not that much not that much don't get too excited uh so down from 20 to 20 400 up to uh down to 20 150 like down one percent dish one and a half percent and how about you ether start of the week at 11 85 currently at 11 15. so down about what is that i have to redo these numbers because like when i wrote these numbers it was 1080 not 115. uh so like rough six percent time six percent call it quick math yeah as of now as of now when you listen to this on friday morning it'll be completely different so none of what david said actually why do we even do this i don't know why do we even tell you price you know it's just going to change but we're looking at trends over time david and the trend is down bad but but there's also some interesting inflation news and um crypto is not responding as negatively to that recent inflation news as it could have so maybe maybe there's a silver lining there we'll get to some of that later but what about the ratio david ratio flat on the week flat on the week it's flat 0.055 it's not telling us anything it's telling us everything market doesn't know what to do right now uh global cryptocurrency total market cap we are under a trillion dollars what are we headed at today last week we were up to 976 billion this week we're down to 929 billion the good news is we get to uh celebrate that one trillion yet again and probably get back down again and again again repeat what is the point of looking at any of these prices how about ethereum gas prices uh not doing too bad there i mean they're down as well yeah so if you're trying to get a transaction through it's a good time to do that definitely cheap right now um i think the the average grade price in last week was like 20 something you doing anything new in uh on ethereum it's like all the cheap now all the cheap gas transactions i'm not doing too much no well yeah that's reflected in like the usage charts like the usage structure generally down except you know i i was looking at the use of stretch you know the usage chart that's actually up uh in terms of like usage and volume us usdc stablecoin i was going to say the transactions i actually did on ethereum this week were all like withdrawals and deposits and like stablecoin stuff i was like oh it's nice i only have to pay like a dollar for that right usually it's like five six something like this um all right well let's talk about the big macro story which continues to be inflation and david new numbers came in this week and they were the worst in 41 years they were higher u.s month u.s inflation just hit a four decade high of 9.1 percent that is the headline in the wall street journal um we should break this down a little bit but first first here's the chart um look how bad it is 9.1 inflation just shooting up like a rocket in uh 2022 uh and then from a category perspective what are the big contributing categories david yeah energy is obviously the big one so the biggest ones are fuel oil in the last year has doubled gasoline has gone up 60 gas utilities up 38 electricity up 14 so like those are the biggest ones and they're all energy related the next one after that is food like groceries up 12 which is also a proxy of energy uh and then new cars is like the first non-food non-energy one which is up up 12 overall cpi up 9.1 percent uh i heard this really awesome uh illustration for like energy uh like why why is why do people pay attention to energy like so much in the global macro space uh energy is like nature's interest rate is the cost of doing things if you need to move yourself any further than where you can walk you have to consume energy elevators take energy escalators take energy cars energy trains energy buses planes like those things also move all of the things that people need like like food uh and so when energy prices goes up like the cost of existing also goes up which makes the world a harder place to exist in as it goes in so this is why everyone's concerned yeah it's a it's like a transaction fee for real life right yes i guess that's why they call it gas on ethereum it is really the analog if you want to do anything in the metaverse on ethereum you have to pay gas if you want to do anything in real life it's going to come at you through the price of energy and fuel costs david we are also looking at the dxy which is this is basically us dollars um the ratio of u.s dollars to to primarily the yen japanese yen and the euro euro yeah i think that's both of those the euro is the dominant one but just it's about currencies i think the euro is the biggest one followed by the yen and what's the story with the dxy what's it doing yeah we are hitting like also a very very long time high all-time high in for for a while i think like the the last time i was this high was something like 2001 or 2002 or something 109 is the index uh for for record uh let's see in the most recent in thai was like 102 back in like 2017 also when they were like raising interest rates most recently uh but then kobe hit and it dumps when the dollar is high everything else is low uh by comparison uh and so like you when you see this dollar index you're like and you're seeing that go through the moon like all assets have suffered because that's the dollar going up versus well not all assets is back up currencies but like strength in the dollar right a lot of like everyone's going to uh to france for ecc in a little bit myself included and all of a sudden like my fiat my fiat dollars give me she's gonna buy me some extra breakfast you know did you see david uh euros in the dollar at parody wait one dollar one dollar and one cent is now one euro no wait the inverse damn it i'm so bad at math anyways the doll was stronger than the euro yes uh but and that was like so early in the week i made the joke that circle is just releasing a new uh staple coin the euro stable coin is called usdc kind of funny kind of fun but also like i mean if you're european holding euros not that funny yeah uh and um it's i don't know how long this is going to persist for but our episode coming out with luke grauman is fantastic for answering this question about dollar strength and why it is strong doing a lot of macro content recently i've really been enjoying and learning a lot but how did the market react yes so do i how did the market react to all of this you've got a meme for us yeah i thought this was a great tweet uh so northman trader good twitter account says today market sold off on a hot cpi print right because if cpi is high that means like oh no like the fed's going to raise interest rates scary that means like you know risk on ass is going to get pulled even more so northman trader says market total today market sold off on a hot cpi print as it implies more aggressive rate hikes by the fed but then stocks rallied realizing that this would result in a recession sooner implying rate cuts earlier than expected before dropping again realizing that a recession would come first basically like hello volatility hello uncertainty we don't know what happens next and just like people are confused hello this face is the face that investors podcast listeners don't have to look at that face of that dog but you should this is why you should watch on spotify right now um this is um you know a question i've said that i've had in the roll up for the last few couple of weeks about macro markets well i feel like i finally got my answer yeah the question was i was mystified why some people in macro are saying the fed should just raise rates to four to five percent like we need that immediately and other people are saying no if the fed raises to four to five percent like it breaks everything the us goes and solve it can no longer pay its interest payments i was trying to understand why there's a difference of opinion uh and here's one thing i concluded in our episode with lynn alden our with luke grauman that things are different they're much different than the 1970s and paul volcker where we could just increase uh interest rates and the big difference is we are at the end of a long-term debt cycle we have a massive amount of debt now in uh you know uh the modern nations modern economy the us europe japan china all around the world and so i tweet this out we're at the end of a long-term debt cycle and the only way to deleverage is to hold interest rates below inflation for most of this decade inflation is not politically tenable so powell must play the idiot by pretending to fix inflation while simultaneously pursuing it that actually might explain some of the actions of powell i thought that was a really good and very nuanced take well done well done it was it's it this is kind of what i gleaned from our luke ramen episode is just kind of everyone's like what the hell does powell not know what he's doing maybe he knows what he's doing maybe he has to play the role of an actor play the role of an idiot because the only way out of this when you have wartime uh debt like debt debt um levels then you kind of get wartime inflation on the on the other side of this and this is to lynn alden's point very much like the way the 1940s played out where for that entire decade you had about six percent inflation well interest rates were at zero percent so the delta was six percent and some years you had 19 that is basically the way out of this and lynn alden said this too she said uh what does the fed know versus what does the fed know and not aren't telling us so this is just a game of game theory as it's like all right what are we going to portray to the markets that we're going to do and what do the markets think that we're going to do and so it's just really it's just it's a game of game theory between the markets and the fed uh and so like how smart is the fed and like if they're just playing dumb like oh yeah we're going to raise interest rates as long as cpi goes higher and then the cpi goes higher and the market just crashes on the cpi high cpi print the game theory works in favor of the fed like it did the thing that they wanted to do without actually raising interest rates yeah and they know the only way out is through high speed so we hope that they do that we don't actually know what they know ryan the the other alternative is is this uh or joan powell is an actual idiot and we're all screwed except i don't know i'm actually uncertain which is true i guess we get to find out man the 2020s are fun yeah this is great um what's this game theory with all of our economic lives dimitri caprina we've had on on the podcast before uh i also thought that was a gave a really useful take he says i've been saying this for months the federal reserve exists within a political system and that system is currently fighting a proxy war with russia and increasingly china policy makers are aware of that a rising dollar creates leverage in that war when you are a current uh nation state with a currency and that currency is strong you have more ammo to shoot with as in when you print money and that money is stronger you can do more things with that money uh and so i thought this was a really good take like we need a high dollar so that we can fight our our actual kinetic war with russia as a proxy uh and then our economic war with china so a rising dollar is like in the is interest of like the incumbent political establishment of the united states do you know david i just realized we need to do an episode on this macro episode the weaponization of the dollar i want to i want to dive into this uh in more depth i mean i i was just thinking i have dimitri back on i'm sure he would he would well he says he's going to do this so maybe we'll let him do this and then we'll just invite him on and he can tell us what he learned he he does the hard work yeah and then we snatch it from thanks dimitri love you man um what else david as we're talking about inflation do you know um just do run some of the math here right on on like gains if you're think about your portfolio where to store your value of course if you have it in a savings account a dollar in a savings account it goes down nine percent every year terrible place to hold value so what do you do do you invest it well everything's going down so you got to be careful the asset class but ryan peterson makes this point with a 9.1 percent inflation if your portfolio makes less than 12 per year the irs takes 100 of your real dollar returns the tax optimizer is here to remind you there's still taxes too and so even at 12 return you're actually making zero in terms of real returns nominal returns maybe but zero in terms of real returns because you got to pay 30 of that at least to the irs so where does anyone less than 12 this year i'll tell you that yeah it's probably the negative well that means you don't have to pay any taxes david there's your silver lining you can't pay taxes if you aren't making money here's arthur hayes and he says must watch the jpy and the euro the japanese yen and the euro expect a quote intervention to weaken if the usd uh to weaken the usc if japan is greater than 150 and the euro is greater than 90 cents on the dollar intervention means fed money printing printing money means bitcoin number go up the situation is fluid so this is what i'm seeing more and more is more people saying like there's a there's a path forward that seems not implausible where like the money printer gets turned on again yeah i think and this is also to pump our luke ramen episode on monday go listen to that episode what he talks about is basically a a very likely way forward is that the fed is going to start having to bail out japan and europe its allies do that in various ways by probably purchasing bonds and so uh watch out for that and i guess that's good for crypto i don't know what it means for the rest of the world but it's good for a scarce commodity asset the take here is that in times like these the economy is now like under the whim of politics like the the economy used to be a free market it's no longer a free market it's going to do the thing that like the political institutions want it to do yeah that which is exactly why we need to do more on geopolitics here david um to understand this all right uh what's happening in the crypto world getting out of the inflation conversation this is a stat about miners yeah new all-time high set by uh miners selling bitcoin a net of 88 000 bitcoins were sent to exchanges from miners a new all-time high so i guess that doesn't mean actually sold miners has sent it to an exchange but like miners don't the implications miners don't buy bitcoin they mint bitcoin uh and so a net all a net outflow from miners two exchanges was hit in an all-time high yesterday why do you think this is happening are they just trying to cover costs yeah yeah they got to protect themselves from like further downside because like if bitcoin goes down like another 50 like a bunch of miners go underwater so they also have to like hunker down for the winter like miners are a massively resource intensive um kind of industry right it's like all the energy costs but also all the hardware costs um what is uh what does this take about treasury value of d5 protocols yeah so hazu had a really good take on this a while ago where like treasuries that count their own native token as like their treasury like you shouldn't be doing that because you can mit your token as much as you want anyway so it doesn't really count but some for some reason we do it so anyways uh the treasury of ave at the peak was 1.08 billion dollars today it is a 101 million dollars uniswap at the peak 4.8 billion dollars now it's 1.3 billion dollars index peak 105 million dollars now it's four million dollars so we're a millionaire so like these treasuries which were held largely held in the native tokens but other defy tokens as well are all down bad uh and so like this hazard was ringing the alarm about this it's like you guys need to diversify your treasury's at the peak not not at the bottom uh or also you'll be in trouble and no one really seemed to have to do that yeah i think very few took his advice but that's a great point it's like uh you know if you look at apple's balance sheet and you're like how much cash on hand do you have apple they're not going to count all of the apple shares that they could potentially mint right or they might have in reserve somewhere right let me tell you like i have actual money infinity money treasury yeah how much bitcoin do you have how much each do you have how much uh stable coins you have that is your treasury if you're a dollar and i think we're learning that lesson real money um david what is this this is a kind of a the lido uh liquid staking balance as compared to all of the other liquid eth tokens out there liquid eat staking tokens out there and what are we seeing here yeah so like the concern of lido centralization has been uh pretty big for a while uh and you can see here it's showing up here in the numbers uh 4.1 million ether is staged with lido which of the liquid staking services people that have uh uh like a liquid-staking derivative like lido has staked each rocket pool has r eath lido's got 90.6 percent of that share uh and so like the centralization of lido is like an increasingly large concern uh some people call it like the biggest centralization the biggest uh systemic risk to ethereum since the dao itself uh just because like network effects would get network effects like uh stake teeth is super liquid it has the most integrations like state teeth is the most useful of taking derivatives so there's a lot of centralization power that a lot of people are worried about yeah i guess my take on this is um yes i'm concerned but it's not like it's not like a code red yeah well like you know yellow orange like i'm concerned but i i also think it's still very early uh the my other take here is something we've been saying a lot is the key to changing this is better competition right really right right we can't put other limitations on lido it's it's home staking has to get better other liquid staking providers have to get uh way better and then lastly i'll say i don't think any of this is is like permanent i mean we don't even have withdrawals yet so it's still too early to see but uh it is something to pay attention to and it's important i do think it's become very obvious david i feel like this was obvious two years ago when uh or three years ago when we read that piece from dan elizer on superfluid collateral that the killer app is liquid eat staking right once you stake your eath there's an acid that's produced on the other side of that people want to do things with that asset and defy that is the the marvel of tokenization so uh that is a killer app and all the competitors need to figure out how to compete with lido on that level in order to eat some of the market share and take that away from them david what what do we have next coming up next the big stories of the week of course chapter celsius files for chapter 11 bankruptcy three years capital leaks the stark net token stark net then later launches their token not launches their token announces their token so we're gonna get into all those details and of course the rest of the news right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by saying it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 e to get started why would you do this you get an extra fifteen percent staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it defy maker dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mince die directly with maker the power to mince new money is in your hands and there's something new in the maker dow ecosystem every time a new maker dow is opened the owner can claim a poap which contributes funds to one tree planted an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side soon maker will be present on all chains and layer twos bringing the biggest and best d5 credit facility to everywhere there is defy so follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence all right guys we are back talking about celsius they have finally filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy i know we've been talking about c5 lenders a lot uh and we can't seem to get away from them because new news develops every single week what is this david is this kind of the nail in the coffin celsius is finally saying we can't find an acquire there's no other way out so legally we have to go bankrupt right yeah remember a number of people i think nexo took a look at or maybe it was ftx took a look at celsius is it balance sheets in interested in proper choir and yeah probably both of them and interested in acquiring the thing and then they were like oh no no no no no so like as a result of that like you know the only option left you have is bankruptcy so reading from the article here today's filing follow uh follows the difficult but necessary decision by celsius last month to pause withdrawal swaps and transfers on this platform to stabilize its business and protect its customers without a pause the acceleration of withdrawals would have allowed certain customers those who are first to act to be paid in full while leaving others to wait for celsius to harvest value from illiquid or longer-term asset deployment activities while they receive a recovery celsius says it has 160 million dollars cash on hand enough to support certain operations during the restructuring process after paying off all of their d5 loans in compound celsius announced that they had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy early thursday morning after paying off their defy loans and so so the users of this centralized app all have to sit on their hands while they wait for the dust to settle and they're gonna probably take a haircut including you ryan uh all of the users one of those compound or ave or make or dow or all the all the defy apps that celsius use are being paid back in full because of the protections of the defy app protocol itself that is my takeaway what's your what are your thoughts i think that's i think that is the takeaway and that's what we've seen this this week before they actually formally announced chapter 11 they paid off more than 800 million in debt to defy apps uh which is really cool and they even unlocked their st eth they paid off their debt to you to ave as well defense paid in full look man the take is this i tweeted this out notice that defy loans are the only ones insolvent cfi companies are paying back right now the code is forcing them to pay back their loans not laws not attorneys not courts code and it's almost like defy works better david weird that's why why are we even here they couldn't they had no alternative they didn't have to go to court because they couldn't go to court because the rules of the collateral are written in code basically unless you pay me back court yes unless you pay back ave they're going to take all of your collateral and that's it's worth it to you to pay off so you have to like it's incredible to me how well defy lending worked through this process and i can't say enough this is this is the bright spot of everything that's gone on over the last you know two to three months and certainly everything that's gone on with centralized lending protocols right uh there's also another part of this story there's this account 0xb1 that's famously part of the celsius story no one really knew who this account was they just knew that they were doing stuff in d5 making a ton of money and associated with celsius uh and now this this account tweeted out and revealed who they who they are so this account says hi i'm jason stone from august 2020 to april 2021 i led a group of talented individuals who manage the xerox of b1 address after discussions with celsius in mid-2020 celsius began an acquisition of kefi a company that this individual had founded and thereafter kieva pivoted to staking and deploying d5 strategies for celsius in august of 2020 0x b1 was created and uh with other address addresses celsius would send customer deposits to us to manage shortly after celsius shared private key to the address with us over the ensuing months transferred hundreds of millions of dollars of customer deposits for us to invest by the time celsius and kefir parted ways we were managing nearly two billion of assets celsius risk management platform monitored our investment strategies and performance using hedge guard and dbank so basically zero b1 would go in like yield farm do strategies make a bunch of money and then celsius would like see what they're up to with these apps with two billion in two bills by the way depositor assets celsius promised the xerox b1 team members that they assured us that as a part of this moderator monitoring their trading teams were active adequately hedging any potential impermanent loss from our activities in liquidity pools they assured me that they had risk management and hedging in place to account for fluctuations in token prices but in late 2021 we discovered celsius had lied to us they had not been hedging our activities nor had they been hedging the fluctuations in crypto asset prices the entire company's portfolio had naked exposure to the market so like when you're not supposed to if you're taking customer deposits you're not supposed to take that those like if they're usd deposits right you're not supposed to take those usd deposits and then buy ether with it in the hopes that ether goes up that's opinionated what you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to doing delta neutral stuff that it doesn't matter what the prices of things do you still get yield either way they were taking opinion opinionated stances on the market with customers deposits which puts them in a position of potentially not making that money back so xerox v1 continues after seeing these and other major problems and how the company operated we informed celsius that we wish to terminate our relationship that was in march 2021 we told celsius that we would work with them to unwind our various positions over the following months by april of 2021 however because i mean bullish bullish year uh bullish part of that year the value of assets under management had increased by another 800 million dollars but when we unwound the d5 positions celsius celsius suffered in permanent loss at first they believed the impermanent loss was evidence of kefir stealing and accused me of being a thief they later to accept the permanent loss for what it was but we claimed i was responsible for it and completely ignored the fact that they had full visibility into all trading strategies deployed by kifa and promise it hedged that exact risk i have tried for over a year to quietly settle this dispute with celsius pursuant to the contracts celsius signed with kefi they okefy a significant sum of money we have been more than reasonable attempting to resolve this with them uh basically it continues uh to say that they have filed they are suing celsius uh trying to get some money um but yes that's what celsius did with your money it's crazy how irresponsible that was just that story of like they found someone who could manage money and d5 protocols fairly well gave them two billion dollars when that fund and that individual said this stuff i'm doing is kind of risky are you sure about this they're like no we're hit we're hedging the risk in other areas of the business which is which is totally fine if they were doing that that would have been like a risky but okay business like they weren't doing that maybe and then they come to find out they weren't even doing it so it's just all of the shady stuff behind the scenes and it's so interesting because the user experience you have as a retail user is like deposit your funds here get eight percent back and the money comes in each month and you're like oh this sounds great well uh on the back side of this i'm not gonna say it was running like a ponzi scheme but risk management was woefully inadequate right uh and um it was absolutely absent completely absent um the question i think for people including myself who've deposited money into celsius is are we ever gonna get our money back david what do you think the answer that question is uh yeah not all of it i think you will get in the ballpark of a thirty fifty percent haircut you'll get you think so that's your essence of your money back i asked this question uh from twitter and the the truth is no one knows it's going to chapter 11 and a bunch of the people were like uh yeah no way sorry kiss it goodbye um some people are being snarky yeah you're definitely gonna get it all ryan you will get something back you're just uh forced holding for some of the answers so it seems like the sentiment is this is kind of a mount gox type situation uh and uh it's not looking good for getting your funds back maybe some portion of it at an unknown time years down the line yeah um after really unfortunately yeah yeah absolutely um david what do we got next starkware token what is this oh no this is first off we got to start with uh throughout's capital uh so like suzu breaks his silence on twitter and so he tweets out sadly uh our good faith to cooperate with the liquidators has was met with baiting hopefully they did exercise good faith with regard to starkwear token warrants basically the lawyers never exercised starkware token warrants i'm not this is like legal stuff that i'm not totally familiar with but you have to like do a thing in order to get the tokens after you invest in starkware you got to do a thing but the the lawyers didn't do that thing uh and maybe maybe you know more about why they would have not have done this either out of negligence or probably negligence they probably just missed it it's kind of a technicality and they didn't they didn't check the box right right um anyways this was released to twitter uh and which was like the first news of a starkware token even though you everything everything's gonna have a token so you know everything's gonna have a token um but this is like the first formal indication that we've seen of uh starkware having a token um the other also suzu's first tweet and like first first tweet sends cause first tweet sends that one that you can see right there it sends june 14th saying we are in process of communicating uh with all relevant parties and intend to pay them fully back and full uh also not necessarily true evidenced by the fact that no one knows ryan where three errors capital founders are uh so where in the where in the world are the three arrows capital founders people kind of assume dubai but no one actually knows uh dubai being a convenient place to not have an extradition treaty with basically the rest of the world um but suzu through three years capital kyle davies uh missing yeah so i guess uh things like this on friday lawyers for three hours capital creditors the people who want their money back claim that suzu and davies have not yet begun to cooperate in any meaningful manner adding that the two kept their camera and audio off at an initial zoom meeting so you have the zoom meeting and they're keeping their their you know camera and audio off like it's kind of a classroom during covet and it's virtual school or something they're just not like locking in um so who knows where these guys are and what's going to happen next but um that that i guess is the big alpha that we know token is selling his house in singapore but he's only he's looking for a buyer to wire him money to his dubai bank account which can't you can't see his money in a dubai bank account that's like kind of the whole point so he's got like this 40 million dollar home that he's trying to liquidate i don't know if he's liquidated why isn't he using crypto it's not very crypto native of him do you buy banking system maybe well yeah anyways here's a picture of the three arrows capital capital office in singapore uh with some uncollected mail uh there it is it doesn't look very good this is what uh it looks like when a major hedge fund completely folds yeah um nft collection we talked about that last week this is still has to be liquidated yeah so this is the starry night throws capitals like nft fund uh which i mean they bought the top of the nft mania absolutely uh but good taste good taste uh people think that this is a really really good collection uh those are kid punks oh kid punks sorry i don't know about that one that one's not in there it's a really good taste but yeah there's a bunch of really cool stuff in here which is it's all going to be liquidated so if you are an nft collector with a bunch of cash on hand uh you might have a field day soon yeah do they do they still exist nft collectors with the cash on hand david left oh with cash on hand i don't know about yeah all right starkware tokens so what is the news then it was like pre-released by three hours capital uh and then more formally released by starkware just days later yeah one day later yeah exactly so starkware tweets out uh starknight alpha was launched on the ethereum main net november 2021. now it's a time to advance its decentralization as demanded of an l2 on ethereum here is our decentralization proposal introducing the stark net token and the stark net foundation pretty much like playbook for decentralizing your layer two uh and so they released three blog posts uh part one part two part three uh we're only going to read out parts of one and three uh but the key points of uh blog post number one says starknet's decentralization involves a native token and a new foundation again par for the course uh the start net token is used for governance and as the network's payment and staking asset so that's actually a i mean not a crazy choice but like demanding your own token to be the payment token for that particular layer two that's a interesting choice to consider like that's not that's like arbitrary optimism those don't they don't do that they take ether as the gas for the layer two rather than the the network's native token so there the take here is that like well if this dark where's token is the new gas for this darkwater layer two they're they're like really more aligned with the starkware layer two than they are with the ethereum layer one so it gets started to make its own like self-sovereign ecosystem uh so there's that uh 10 billion tokens have been minted and allocation has begun this darkware foundation now being set up will have a mission to maintain starknet as a public good we do like that public good word so here are the details 10 billion tokens uh we'll pull up a pie chart here in a second uh 17 percent going to stark where investors uh three hours capital which that's going to get liquidated and distributed which i mean i'm kind of fan of that because of decentralization they had like a lot of it and then 32.9 of uh two core contributors that is the starkware team uh if you add those two numbers up i believe you get 49.9 percent uh and then on the other side of things 12 percent to grants 10 to the foundation 8.1 percent is unallocated to be determined uh two percent donations uh nine percent community rebates and nine percent community provisions so you have 49.9 on one side that's like the centralized team and investors and you have 51 uh 50.1 percent on the other side which is various forms of the community the foundation like long-term starkware development uh ryan what's your take on this distribution yeah it's not bad i mean it seems kind of par for the course uh 50 is maybe a bit on the high side from an investor and kind of core uh contributor perspective 49.99 sorry yes not quite 50 uh but i don't know i just you know some of it's semantics you know ten percent here ten percent there i'm not really sure the big question to me is like how are they actually going to uh distribute the tokens to their users in the community how does that work do we have any details on that or uh this is still an announcement to launch a token and you you kind of wonder if they just did it a day after the suzu news came out and they kind of rushed it as a result and so that might be part of the reason they don't have dates they had all these they had three blog posts and it came out 24 hours after the suzu announcement that would be that i think they had this ready to fire yeah maybe um so yeah so that's that's what's going on in starkware world how how many more player twos are we waiting for now is the kkk's token zk sync um there are a couple others in the works too oh yeah oh see oh there's a ton yeah oh yeah there's aztec release their ticket aztec has a token there's scroll that's still in development that's right yeah there's there's a ton of layer twos left uh but they're like these are between starkware stark uh between starkware zk sync optimism and arbitrary arbitration also needs to release a token those are like the big ones i'd say that's right and they're probably all going to release their token during the bear market so i guess we will see what happens there yeah guys coming up next the story of vitalik writing a book i just found this out last week what is he writing we'll talk a bit about that also ave launching a stable coin is this going to be a die competitor are they doing something else and then finally disney and polygon are teaming up we'll talk a little bit about that before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you can now bridge straight into arbitrary for more than 10 different exchanges including binance ftx kuobi and crypto.com once on arbitrary you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe new to arbitrary for a limited time you can get arbitrary nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrary odyssey the odyssey is an eight-week long event where you complete on-chain activities and receive a free nft as a reward find out more by visiting the discord at discord dot gg slash arbitrome you can also bridge your assets to arbitrarily at bridge.arbitrum.io and access all of arbitrary's apps at portal.arbitrum.one in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger

already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets all right guys we're back uh david did you know that vitalik is writing a book like i know you know now but did you know before last week uh no i knew it this week you knew it this week yes oh you found okay so i just learned this uh last week and i was like surprised because i follow what that man does like i read his uh research posts all right i stalk vitalik buterin notifications are on yeah notifications are on and dialed up um but uh yeah just learned he's coming out with a book this book is set to release on september 13th i believe it is now for sale on amazon it's called proof of stake the making of ethereum and the philosophy of blockchains so um he's co-writing this not just vitalik but uh there's another author nathan schneider editor he's an editor okay uh he's an academic of some sort and he actually jumped in the thread and was commenting i was asking questions back back and forth um i'm anxious to read this uh the author or the editor says it's it's about making blocked giving giving uh crypto and blockchains a philosophical underpinning and kind of separating it from the scams like it is a good thing for the world if you're a serious person an individual and here's why vitalik is making the case to a different crowd than probably the crowd that listens to bankless or that is the attempt it seems like that's what the editor is saying anyway beautiful i cannot wait to read that that is exactly the type of content that that i'm looking for i heard a funny joke somewhere that was like i'm starting to think this whole like ethereum merge thing it's really just a point to sell vitalik's book oh well the dates okay let me say september 13th is that also going to be the release date of the murder it's a reasonable merge date it's a reason it's not crazy right yeah i'm just saying it's not crazy he's trying to sell his books the bitcoiners were right i knew he's a scammer it was all about this book all about this is the reason for starting ethereum just the long con vitality good job man um all right ave they're doing a stable coin i'm pretty excited about it what are we talking about ave bucks is that what it is yeah no of a bucks stable coin fears with a proposed new token so ave companies the centralized team uh that stewards the ave protocol uh propose a new dollar peg stable coin to the protocols dao on july 7th the gho for ghosts that's the ave like uh icon like mascot uh will be minted by borrowing against assets locked as collateral on ave borrowers will still earn yield on their deposited assets while also racking up interest on their borrowed gho according to of a company's proposal interest payments will go directly to the dow treasury of course and can be considered revenue welcome a welcome word in the bear market this is the power of d5 that gho allows for more liquidity for decentralized stable coins in the market more fees for ave more volume and fees for curve more stability for other stable coins and more attractiveness of d5 in general compared to c5 wrote mark zeller who works at ave so basically it's it's like maker dow but with a money market attached so if you slammed like maker dow and compound together like boom you would have the ave stable coin which is great that's awesome it makes a lot of sense it's all collateral-backed it's collateralized this is not like the tara luna fiasco at all so it's using the strengths of the maker model and the strengths of ave which is the money market piece right so is the thing going to be called ghost ghost i am not the arbiter of the pronunciations no i think it's worth exploring and unpacking the differences of maker dow dai versus ave go so make or dao extremely risk adverse extremely hardened going after real world assets and like real world integrations where ave is a little bit more uh defy crypto native going after maybe a little bit more of the long tail of risk and not totally not not totally down the long tail but like opening up more total assets to mint go than you can put into maker data mint die so like we're starting to see some separation make or doubt like real world assets extremely risk adverse extremely conservative ave not super not totally super conservative still very risk-averse obvious never been hacked in in any way but also accepting a little bit more liberal on the long tail of crypto native tokens so you can start to see some divisions in like the decentralized stable coin i'm actually just so happy we have a second decentralized stablecoin i think that's so great it's so great missed opportunity to call it ave bucks maybe that's still on the table guys but if you if you're hearing me not a bad name but you know what's cool uh ryan you're leaking in the bankless stablecoin strategy of bankwood's bucks that we have is that coming back but that's going to be what is going to be the collateral that backs that david oh well tbd yeah okay all right david's making stable coins on the fly but um do you know what's funny to me is how much as you're describing how much things have changed for me i used to think of ave as ooh that that's pretty risky yeah right it's like oh i prefer maker maker doubt if i'm if i'm if i'm um taking margin out or taking a loan out of my eat i'll do maker doubt rather than ave aves just seems so blue chip and so risk off now and i think part of that is like they've done a great job and lindy effect they've been here for a couple of years and it's it's worked very well the other part of that is the overton window has completely shifted right so now we've we went in this bowl cycle way out on the risk spectrum we saw things like luna and uh ust and that whole implosion all these algorithmic stable coins and like what's happened with c5 lending right like those the safe places like block fi and celsius to deposit your funds have completely exploded now i'm like ave is just it just seems so safe it seems so blue chip it seems so grammar ready and that's totally changed for me in the last couple of years totally all the things that are still alive right now uh i mean we still have to make it to the other side of the bull market but it seems like the most of the downside volatility has happened already so like if if it's going to break at a protocol level it would have broken by now so like all the all the stable coins that exist today i feel like you can definitely start to like endorse these things pretty pretty well you could have always endorsed dye like ave the stable coin i don't think it really adds any new risk to the ave protocol um it's a new product not necessarily a new like risk factor i'd say um and then and then also fracks like killed it this this bit this bear market in a good way in a good way like killed it to the to the upside you're doing well no he didn't die yeah like uh ust goodbye uh wonderland you know mim i'm pretty sure that's gone but for the most part it is anyways i wouldn't trust it personally but now we have like three really awesome decentralized stable coins uh optimizing for three different things uh so you know it's bear market build market yeah absolutely it's absolutely great uh big week for um matic as well this week and polygon so the first bit of news is uh robin hood just started allowing deposits and withdrawal support for matic and for polygons so that's another fiat bridge fiat gateway and robinhood of course i don't know 20 25 million users something like this uh now have a way to get directly onto polygon also some breaking news from polygon they are excited to be the only blockchain chosen to be part of the disney accelerator program what is this david yeah so six companies selected to be a part of the disney's 2022 accelerator program i didn't know this existed but now i do is a business and development program designed to spur the growth of innovative companies around the world this program which starts in a week so like next week is looking to develop technologies with augmented augmented reality non-fungible tokens and artificial intelligence i mean you can kind of just guess and see imagine for yourself how those things fit into a disney product right like i don't think it takes that much imagination to put those things together during the course of the program each participating company will receive guidance from disney's senior leadership team as well as a dedicated executive mentor and like like ryan said polygon is the only blockchain native platform selected in the six company lineup um cool cool for them good business development of course uh you know always waiting for disney is the the giant of ip in the world to start doing things with the marvel universe the star wars universe or like mickey mouse and friends uh in nfts and uh maybe this is a way to explore that as well a bit more david oh this is really really cool yeah so this is what's happening this is the uh the ens markets uh yeah that's markets i always like to say there's always a bull market somewhere even in the midst of this bear market somebody's still making money and right now it is uh the ens uh domain name holders uh and specifically certain clubs of holders these clubs have have come out of like the ether so you have like the 999 club which is uh anyone who owns numbers zero zero zero through nine nine nine dot eth you're in the 999 club then there's also the 10k club which you know add another digit uh i'm in the 10k club thank you uh and what number did they have uh i actually don't know it starts with 68 6842 i think i don't know um but then there's also other clubs right there's like arabic number clubs like a bunch of clubs are being established and it's basically like uh there's like bottom-up like non-non-erc 20 token dao right so it's like there's these clubs uh and so there's this tweet thread that has a bunch of these uh metrics that i'll read out here with a current floor price of 25 east the 999 club has quickly become the most expensive of all the ens clubs and now is considered an icon of e s domains to look into the 999 club we've pulled addresses of all 506 different holders of the 1999 uh uh ens names uh the first thing we noticed is the lowest amount of paper hands that we've ever seen 2.4 percent i'm pretty sure what that means is only 2.4 of total holders has sold i think that's like four or five six people uh uh this is the highest of the category classified by this particular algorithm uh and 168 of these holders of the 506 have their ens domain as their primary ens name record uh and so like they their number is actually like registered to their ethereum address so like 33 of these holders are using these digits as their ens identity uh and so next up is the 10k club which is like uh uh 1000 through 99999.e uh a larger amount of supply and a 1.6 each floor the 10k club has a unsurprisingly higher ratio of paper hands but to put things in perspective the ratio is still higher than things like azuki's or doodles the 10k club is made up of 4 368 wallets 218 of them also own a 999 club ens that means almost half of the 999 club also owns a four-digit ens name this time 668 holders have defined their address as an ens primary domain ratio is lower than the 99m club but the network effect is still greater with four times as many people flexing their four-digit numbers uh and this is just the numbers club they're like i said there are other number the clubs ens clubs in the ens game uh you can check them out at ens.vision what is with this why is this happening so first of all let me say humans like tribes ryan okay but like first of all like uh dot eats are i think the perfect bear market nft to start trading i don't know it just feels so essential so you know it's close to the metal right slow foundational like so i get that aspect of it after fashion but like why now enos has been around forever why are we suddenly now in july of 2022 and also june and may why are we now getting this d gen uh bull market on ens's uh can you explain this to me yeah i actually do have an answer for that like well some part is just like uh you know ghosts in the machine like some people just like to trade things but also i'll say that you know a lot of uh new nft speculators that came in bought ether at higher prices much higher prices than they are now and so like ens names are a great tax loss harvesting nft to purchase after you bought your 4000k ether and now it's down to one thousand dollars uh so you can buy an ens name because it's still if you're buying an ens name you're still longing ethereum mostly so you get to tax loss harvest all that ether that you bought but you can also buy an nft that you know is not going anywhere unlike like all the other like jpeg nfts that are opinionated like do you like the cats do you like the punks do you like the apes like it doesn't matter like everyone plays the in the nf ens game like you you ryan have an e and s name i've gotten he and s name we're we're considered like d5 people more than we are nft people but even us have ens names right uh and so uh that i think and also just like there's historical relevancy like the dns don't world has made people bajillions of dollars and so like we're just repeating history again i get it i get it i get all these arguments and a nice pro tax tip by the way david i'm proud of that one that was good that was good tax loss harvesting is awesome um but okay but like all of that stuff was true before now like now people have like jpegs just leave a bad taste in people's mouths now ah that might be it so people are like anti-image anti-jpeg and they're like i want something real yeah give me something it's a proxy for ethereum okay and dot eths are like it's a proxy for ethereum but it's also like it's tangible it's real it has utility what can you do with a dot eth anything like you can it's it's a human readable name for any ethereum address or any i guess dress in general on the internet and that has utility and maybe that's where the market's going for nfts yeah yeah so like you know i think crypto punks are cool but like that doesn't necessarily that's not a universally held opinion right like some people think crypto punks are cringe even though those people are wrong um but like if you are walking to a club a metaverse club and you have zero zero zero dot ethan as your name everyone thinks you're cool really it's a universal signal i think that's it man i think that explanation is exactly what you said jpegs are out jpegs are out so what are the jpegs aren't universally out but like again they're more you know what i needed yeah i've read so many takes this week about like just in mainstream media about like nfts being a scam and like just it's endless man jpegs are just not jpegs aren't appearing on jimmy kimmel these days right that's for damn sure right it's like totally out of mainstream culture except bill murray being counter cultural he went and he bought a cool cat this week nice cat that's cat bill murray that's the cool cat that i would expect bill murray to purchase do you know he's buying the dip here yeah well yeah good for him yeah one more thing on the ens before we move on i think this needs to be like uh seconded but i think this whole thing got started when people noticed like a bunch of uh people in like arab countries buying number number e s names and like the the license plate low digit uh license plates in like places like the united arab emirates are like similarly status symbols so like people will pay big numbers for like low digit license plate numbers and so ens it's like an even bigger market uh and so i think this got triggered in the east and now like the west is like oh we also want to play this game and now the game's on have you ever have you ever had a personal license plate david no that's something yeah bank list bank list is sadly eight letters i actually did no no no b n k l e s s we could do that okay i could get mine virginia yeah okay i will take a picture of my minivan and show it to you don't put your license plate online though yeah good call thank you thank you opsec uh lesson for you as well um gamestop finally launched their nft marketplace as well what is this thing looking like david yeah this is matt feinstone uh used to be at loopering now at gamestop and he goes gm everyone gamestop nft is live in beta non-custodial ethereum layer 2 marketplace where the community can truly own the digital assets that they love you can check it out at nft.gamestop.com uh and so now this is the verge gamestops nfc marketplace has arrived just in time for a crypto market crash god they just can't let us give us a break yeah let it be fun and come on verge yeah uh anyways uh buy sell create nfts on the gamestop nft marketplace over 200 collections are on there with more than 53 000 nfts listed and you can connect the newly launched gamestop wallet which we talked about a few weeks ago to your digital assets you can also use options like wallet connect and metamask right now you can not everyone can put and create an nfc only certain creators can apply but i'm sure they're going to open up in the future but also of course gamestop it's got the word game in the name ryan they're about their gaming company they have bigger plans than address a marketplace down the line they said in a press release that it plans to expand functionality into areas like web3 gaming on the nft marketplace gamestop is already teasing support for immutable x a platform on a theory that's used by some nft games is coming soon uh also previously we've talked about the 100 million dollar grant program between gamestop and immutable to help build out the world of web 3 gaming so you could just imagine it's like oh i'm playing my game i found my super awesome like like long sword of flame it's worth ten thousand dollars i'm going to take it to the gamestop marketplace and sell it like you could totally see that world this is pretty cool i like it and what is this built on so i know it's a layer too do you know what the marketplace is built on is it immutable is it loopering is it some combo of both uh that is a good question i do not know it's one it's one of those two things it's one of those two things immutable x coming soon yeah well that's right that's what i talked about they're teasing it so like what is it currently based on i mean i bet you i bet you it's if it's not both now it will be later that's a question for matt we'll go find out guys and let you know but it is on layer two and that's pretty cool i would guess it's either a mutable or loopering or some combo of both um david let's get to some bitcoin stuff i guess this isn't bitcoin stuff it's maybe bitcoin tribe stuff michael saylor this week quoted as saying ethereum is obviously a security obviously david um i think ethereum is a security he says i think it's pretty obvious it was issued by an ico there's a management team there was a pre-mine there was a hard fork there's continual hard forks there's a difficulty bomb that keeps pushing back and then he says i think all proof-of-stake networks are securities all of them and they're all very risky it's above my pay grade the regulators will decide whether or not they will allow them to continue or not it's the only good take he had the regulators will allow i don't know that the regulators get to decide whether the networks continue but i guess they get to establish some sort of stamp of legitimacy on them david do you think that this is just some uh insecurity here about eth being a security or even not being a security um do you think that like bitcoin or bitcoin maximalists let me say are threatened by ethereum i mean we've had they've always they always happen the cftc has uh clearly stated multiple times that ether is a commodity we've had um senior members of the sec say that as well ether is a commodity along with bitcoin group it in here we've had a long period of time since the initial ico the continuing acceptance more decentralization of ethereum over the years there haven't been strong indications that any senior officials in the u.s actually are targeting ethereum as a security so regardless of whether it's whether you think it's a security or not under the definition of a security it doesn't seem to be that's the direction the regulators are trying to proceed and pursue what do you think about this yeah this this is the classic old man yells it cloud meme uh like bitcoiners for people that have been on crypto twitter for longer than like this bull market this is like just a classic talking point of bitcoin maxis about ethereum like oh there was a pre mine oh vitalik controls everything meanwhile vitalik holds the record for the most ignored and unemerged eip addresses or eips to ethereum uh fun fact uh like uh like you know no no control over the monetary supply like you know blah blah blah like all these like talking points is a security uh you know vitalik's a scammer anyone who thinks of a toxic scammer like that's a legitimate take that people have on crypto twitter like vitalik is a scammer he's building a scam he's the biggest scammer of all time like that's just ridiculous and so like this whole like ether as a security thing it's really just like there's like this very strong do not break ranks culture in bitcoin in the bitcoin camp uh and this is like one of those talking points that that they say it's like no only by bitcoin because everything else is a security it has got to be the least cipher punk take i've ever heard from bitcoin maximalist which is like hey nation state like come help make make ether a security please because you know it's just in the interest of their bags i i don't understand i mean i would think that like hardcore bitcoiners hardcore bitcoin maximalists aren't they like don't they skew libertarian aren't we trying to get away from kind of like nation-state uh control of our monetary system and that the entire point so let assets compete why not let assets compete i don't understand the appeal to um papa gensler to come take a look at ethereum and put get them in trouble right um yeah it's it's libertarianism when it's about bitcoin but if it's about anything else is they're like super status like the bitcoin maximalist is like a state and if you go against the will of the state they come at you with their cyber hornet army are you a bitcoin maximalist come come at david and i and tell us why we're wrong i've heard it all do you think bitcoin maxwell is listening to anybody probably not probably well no because you're not alone you're not allowed to like to consume anything that's like it's literally like one of these like extremist religions like you are not allowed to receive education outside of the bitcoin state you are not you are not allowed to to flirt with the enemy you are not allowed to go on other people's podcasts like you you have to stay inside of the bitcoin cult and if you go outside of the cult like you'll be uh exiled like look what happened to nick carter like the same the same just extreme tribalism exists like beyond bitcoin maximalism and it's a part of bitcoin maximalism you're a bitcoin maximus don't you dare flirt with bank lists turn this episode off right now do not dare um you know even even dan held and uh some prominent bitcoiners actually rejected the you know the take of ethereum being a security and agreed with uh our takes here anyway uh let's get to some releases some good news here what is this pseudo amm pseudo amendment from sudo swap this is uh nft liquidity infrastructure so some quick tips about what this actually is it's a amm for nfts uh but you know you got to get a little bit more creative because it's not that simple but three things you can really do you can create pools that gradually buy or sell nfts along price curves you can provide liquidity to pools to buy and sell those nfts to earn fees and you can directly list all of your nfts at fixed prices liquidity providers have full control over their pool's pricing they can address it at any time there's endless possibilities for new pricing models basically there is uh more infrastructure for liquidity on nfts like nft financialization really needs to improve there is so much left to do are you bullish on this category oh basically like an nft nxt defy integration like nfts are super illiquid and they need to be more liquid in order to be more adopted and just useful and so we have things like collateralized nft infrastructure like this is is also another one just like things that provide liquidity to nfts i'm pretty bullish on yeah i think this is alpha guys i think a lot of nft5 building is going to happen during the bear market and you're going to see the fruits of that in the next full cycle also this lens tube what is this an open source web 3 video sharing social media platform built on top of lens protocol and live on polygon yeah yeah so there's two uh protocols in the back end here one is live pier which has been around for a while just like uh decentralized video trans coding and streaming and then are we for the data so the the data is all on our weave uh live peer does all the video transcoding uh and then like lens tube is the front end so they're connecting all the dots for you here's our here's my friend gabriel haynes uh if crypto twitter will recognize him um uh so yeah there's now a more decentralized alternative uh for youtube david we gotta we gotta do this look at gabriel he's got some subscribers here we gotta set up our lens tube account on bankless guys some big raises this week the first lightspeed raised seven billion dollars across four funds and launched a new crypto native team that is absolutely colossal raise seven billion dollars these days apparently light speed apparently now they do also uh multi coin capital launched a 430 million dollar venture fund i think the theme here is um it's a good time to deploy capital in the bear market i think smart funds have raised or gotten the commitments to raise in the in the bull market or using their reputation in order to keep raising and are planning to deploy a lot during the bear market this is why this is feels much different than 2018 david when no one was like you wouldn't see any of these this level of raises like everything completely dried up now people are still investing yeah i mean i think vcs are just like licking their lips like the time this power has shifted back into the camp of vcs where in 2021 the power was in the the hands of founders and builders like if you had a product you could raise infinite amount of money an infinite evaluation and like vcs were having to push out other vcs to get into deals now it's the inverse now the vcs are like ha power is backing our side now like we've got all the money and you've got none of it set the terms yeah we set the terms so yeah vc for financialized capitalized vcs are uh in a good spot and again it's good because private valuations were getting nutty absolutely insane compared to public as well um this is li-fi they just raised 5.5 million in a strategic ecosystem round this is a bridging aggregator uh technology pretty cool david i'm not just a bridge aggregator a bridge and dex aggregator aggregator uh and so it gets you from chain a to chain b while simultaneously getting you from asset one to asset two at the same time i mean you can just imagine in a blossoming of blockchains both alternative layer ones and many many layer twos and also assets you can just like teleport from chain to chain while also swapping assets at the same time and it just routes your order through the in the best possible way to make sure you preserve all your capital while you go through that chain teleportation that's better than chain bridging and asset teleportation david and i are investors in this one too just a small porsche angel investors also chris dixon he uh just funded farcaster and what's cool about this is i don't use farcaster um but it seems kind of cool and i could imagine myself using this years ago this is basically like rss plus and i remember one of chris's initial um theses like 10 years ago in a16c more broadly was that rss would kind of take off as an open protocol right and that world didn't really happen instead we got kind of the the social media closed ecosystems of like you know twitter and you know facebook and other social networks and like even the sub stacks of the world i think his thesis is the reason it didn't work is because rss as a protocol did not have value captured did not have a token did not have money did not have payments and now i think this is another attempt at that to revitalize this protocol which is rss and to add a business layer on top of it i haven't looked at the details but um you know i recall that being one of one of chris's um talking points and theses cool cool i'm a big fan yeah i mean this is this is web 3 revi uh like reinvigorating web one and there are a lot of cool things about web one not that i was there for it totally um notes is safe they just raised a hundred million dollars led by 1k x gnosis i mean this is great just a great tool for uh storing storing funds in a multi-sig type way uh 100 million dollars apparently i bet they raised some of that during the uh the bull run and are announcing it now and he takes on this uh yeah i mean everyone uses this product right like everyone has not everyone a lot of people have multi cigs i have a personal multisig that i use uh ryan and i have the bankless multi-sig uh like basically every single dallas treasury is inside of the gnosis multisig they're also rebranding it this is also a rebrand to safe so take off the gnosis and just add safe uh and so it basically is it's of of all contracts in ethereum here's a good bit of trivia of gnosis safe now called safe has stored and secured the most value of cross ethereum over time so like it has the biggest like tvl of assets locked uh that's because of just how simple stupid the contracts are and it's just like a basic multi-sig and it's just battle tested man yeah right like there's 40 billion dollars in there i didn't know nfts were in here too 13 of all crypto punks are in safe right now um pretty cool i need to put mine in there good to see them continuing to invest there and of course with all of this investment money that means there are jobs available for you yeah let me tell you every single week get a job in crypto if you can and i'm here to tell you you can because there are some companies that are hiring there is a jobs board that is ready to feed you those jobs let me read a few smart contracts software engineer stig fish back end full stack software engineer stig fist block chain marketer steak fish front end engineer software engineer uh steak fish dev ops engineer steak fish they want a lot of engineering talent looks like alliance dow looking for a cto also a software engineer also a senior software engineer also an executive assistant it's on technical outer space wants a solidity engineer unit swaps is hiring are you generous is hiring chain link is hiring arjun is hiring tally is hiring i could go on but i won't you can see all of these job positions the bankless.palette.com jobs go check those out uh all right david what are we on to next my friend uh sponsors ron's a sponsor taking a quick break to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make that show possible but then we're going to come back and talk about questions from the nation takes of the week and what david and ryan are bullish on and of course the meme of the week the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across its bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of across the story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrary or boba networks the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-trained crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started all right guys we are back if you have a question for david and i on the weekly rollup we will answer your question the way to do that is look for this tweet coming to the bankless hq twitter account asks you questions here's the first question i'm going to ask you i think it's the difference between proof of stake and proof of work this is from jeremy meth medford i over complicated your name jeremy uh i haven't heard a pos that's proof of stake proponent addressed this point from proof of work people very well proof of stake leads the rich getting richer within that system drake's answer to alden was unsurprisingly uh was surprisingly unsatisfactory that's justin drake in a bankless podcast episode he's referring to is this just a trade-off that is lived with due to other benefits proof of stake brings so what if this idea that proof of stake is just the rich getting richer david yeah also is on the topic of talking points that bitcoin maximists talk about all the time this is one of those things like proof of stake is just like the rich get richer paradigm a lot of they also call it like this is a fiat paradigm is like the people with a bigger stake have the bigger say that's all totally completely wrong it's just it's like such a swing and a miss and so i'll do my best to like summarize it here to the question of what which one has higher returns on capital the cool thing about proof-of-stake is we know exactly how big the returns on capital are uh in right now i think the stake rate is 4.2 percent uh post-merge it'll jump up to seven and then it'll come back down there'll be some sort of equilibrium between like five percent five six percent four to six percent we don't really know until it happens but like 46 ballpark year over year returns on ether so like that that is how much capital begets capital in the world of proof of stake in proof of work people don't associate with like capital beginning capital because like there's this work word you have to do work in order to like mine the blockchain but like you're not really doing work you're just racing to consume as much electricity as possible the cool thing about proof of stake is that it cuts out so many middlemen that preserve the ability for individuals to actually participate in this game in the world of proof of stake there are so many middlemen that separate one dollar from turning into one dollar's worth of security and this is really the thing you need to optimize for is if you have one dollar of capital how do you produce one dollar worth of security and proof of stake is going to like directly like coupling those things directly proof of work has so many middlemen that separate one dollar worth of capital from one dollar of security so you have like the mining facility you have to buy all the hardware you have to house the hardware in a big facility you have to cool the facility you need a ton of electricity so like a lot of bitcoin mining facilities build their own power plant at this at this point you need to have supply chains with asic manufacturers that starts to be having like political connections do you have actual like political connections to the manufacturers so you need to invest in all of these things that aren't hash rate and everything that you have to invest in is a is a place where economies of scale can be expressed so like the difference is is like if you put in a thousand dollars into ether and you get six percent on your ether year over year or if you put in a billion dollars or a million dollars like pick your number of digits everyone gets the exact same amount of interest rate on their ether year over year in proof-of-work if you cannot start a proof-of-work farm with a thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars you'll be completely uncompetitive so in order to play the game of proof of work like mining you have to invest tens of millions of dollars into a proof-of-work mining operation to be viable because the economies of scale are so incredibly large and the crazy thing is is like if you put in 10 million dollars you will get some amount of hash rate but if you put in 100 million dollars you are going to get far more than 10 times the amount of hash rate because it returns it favors capital and so like the returns on proof of work on capital investments into proof-of-work mining are far greater than six percent it's something like 50 to 100 to 150 depending on how professional your mining operation is so compare the proof of this six to seven percent yield on proof of stake to like the 50 to 150 yield on a bitcoin proof of work mining operation that is the rich get richer model and so like the only reason why people think it's proof of stake is because it's actually formally a part of the actual system it's like yes you get compound interest and people like oh compound interest like that's the rich get richer no like i'm sorry all right who is cutting uh a hundred million like are you cutting a hundred million dollar or ten million dollar like ppm private placement memorandum for your bitcoin mining operation like no you're not only the rich are doing that uh and rant yeah yeah so i i agree with all of that and here here's i guess one way to think of it so first of all it's it's important to acknowledge both systems are the rich get richer right like a capital system is the rich get richer but proof of work is like ten times worse than the state i was a longer larger than that maybe larger but like proof of stake is actually uh an improvement on the rich get richer it's not as bad it's the minimum it's literally the minimization of rich get get richer because again if you have 32 eth or 3200 each or 32 000 each you get the same amount of yield no matter what it's kind of like the rich get richer in the same way that investing in like in an ideal world uh treasuries or you know sovereign bonds are the rich get richer sort of like that that's that's that's one important part and then the other important part to understand is um proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps right and so here's what we mean here's what you're saying here is like in both cases it requires capital right okay and like what are these asic machines that you're using they're tokens they're forced alignment to the protocol yes except these tokens are much harder to get and i'm talking about the asics you wouldn't think of them as you think of them as hardware computer hardware in the real world they're like tokens they're units of capital to charge and so if you think of them as uh physical tokens essentially the difference between buying an asic and putting it in a massive data center like the supply chain the you have to have connections like energy consumption you have to be a company and a very sophisticated company with business development team with like location with physical space in order to do that versus with ethereum and any staking network you can buy your token on freaking uniswap right and that's your unit of capital how much more accessible is that i think that is another important difference to understand and so like i think the the counter argument will be like oh yeah like bitcoin miners they have to expend all this extra money you have to buy you have to expend your rewards to buy the asics you have to expend your rewards to pay for the mining operations you have to expend the rewards to pay for energy like that is that is risk and that is baked into the returns and so actually the more risk that there is the more expenses there are the only reason why people are going to do that are because the returns are literally higher as a result of that risk yeah yeah um totally well i think we've talked about that for we we get excited talking about that i wrote an article covering this called four misconceptions between proof-of-work proof-of-stake that like in my mind i think is the clearest articulation into these arguments so if you want to explore that more go read that article i'm going to make a big mistake and ask you another question that you're probably equally passionate about which is my question for the bank for you david what does david have against carbs rhein sean adams asked this question for the roll-up what do you have against carbs fan for okay so people not not on crypto twitter i just randomly decided to like pick up this anti-carb campaign uh and like it actually caught a lot of my followers by surprise like oh david read like a magazine on keto and now he's like a keto maximalist people don't actually know that i actually studied this in college and consulted on it for a couple years after school uh so like i have actually i have this in my background you're really against carbs no okay no that's mostly a meme okay so like the typical american diet is something like 70 carbs 20 fats and 10 proteins when like the optimum balanced diet is something like 50 to sixty percent fats like twenty percent uh like fit forty to fifty to sixty percent fast like twenty ish percent protein and like twenty percent carbs like that is actually a true balanced diet like heavily weighted in fats and like not nearly as much weighted in carbs uh and so like and so like the the the crazy thing is like in the same way that like the the government controls the price of the dollar they're also controlling the price of corn the reason why there's literally high fructose corn syrup in everything is because corn making high fructose corn syrup is basically free and there's nothing worse for you than god damn high fructose corn syrup it's literally everywhere it's completely so it's like it's it's sugar it's a big filler it's also highly addictive you know it's a great business model ryan carbs everyone's addicted to them they show up you know you know carbs show up in the brain uh they fire the brain uh the parts of the areas of the brain that the same place that uh cocaine and heroin do and like just as much sugar does like absolutely crazy so like it's a crazy business model like we're we're suing these uh that one family for like getting everyone addicted to painkillers like the big food industry is doing the same thing with carbs you're just addicted to carbs carbs carbs are the opioids that no one notices david that's exactly right dude i don't want to get you started on this okay because it's a long i can tell you've got a lot to say i bankless nation who would enjoy an episode on bankless maybe some side stream or something with david on nutrition because i would actually like to school up with you i've already gotten i've already got in the works everybody it's already happening yeah so there's this guy who i listened to uh anthony gustin gustain he would do the perfect keto podcast which is now rebranded into something else anyways the way that this this is not just like david going rogue and doing a nutrition podcast there's the the world of agriculture and sustainable agriculture is very much tied to decentralization whereas we have like highly centralized production of corn and factory farmed meats which are terrible both for like your health and for the animal uh and everything is super centralized and like a way and that's we can't live on this planet that way like it can't work that way we're going to kill the planet what does make us work on this planet is sustainable agriculture which is inherently tied into the concept of decentralization like robust anti-fragile like harmony with nature farms that are distributed all across the world in a very decentralized manner that is in harmony with nature that is robust that is longevity that's and especially as like global supply chains break down and like we can't cooperate with europe or china or anything like we need local at-home decentralized sustainable agricultural food production which ryan is veggies and meat veggies and meat i have opinions on this thing all right david doing a nutrition podcast is just about the most bear market thing i can think of right now i'm gonna personally in the bear market i am somehow intrigued by it and i want to learn more uh last thing here is there there was some talk of david doing a dance so uh anthony cesano he's supposed to do a dance at a certain point when eth hit a price point and i think that price point was hit what was that was that like a thousand i think it was just it was an all-time high um by the end of 2020 and we hit 2020 and we didn't pay his dad yeah he did that right he didn't he didn't do the dance so yeah this is david twitter a dance this is david hoffman my co-host here okay not just a nutrition podcast not just a crypto expert but apparently you know how to do the napoleon dynamite dance you're not doing it here oh so you have to learn first david says this if eve hits all-time high by end of 2023 not 2022. huh 2023 yeah 18 months here i'll do the napoleon dynamite dance to clear anthony susano's depths to debts to crypto twitter crypto twitter must agree to these terms i wholeheartedly agree sir that's getting a retweet i agree to these terms i'm writing it down this means you are doing this uh so like anthony has said that he's okay with this like but also like this is a debt to crypto twitter so like anthony owes this to crypto twitter i'm saying i will pay back anthony's debts but crypto twitter has to agree i don't really know how to get consensus by crypto twitter so maybe you do what ryan did and go to this tweet and say like i agree with these terms or i do not have terms consensus everyone wants this david i've only heard of like three people that have said that they agree okay what's the threshold for uh crypto twittering uh twitter agreeing to these terms 50 comments 50 comments 50 comments saying i agree and it has to be like a 90 to 10 ratio of yes or no's all right guys i'm i'm going to tweet this out 50 comments you heard it on the roll up so make sure we want to see david do this dance we'll broadcast this on the roll-up oh god uh clip as well all right it's a good thing that ether is not going to hit an all-time high by 2023 really that's also the most bear market thing i've heard david say um spicy vitalic is the best vitalik all right what what is he saying here he's pushing back on the whole ethereum is a security talk that was going around here um i'll read his first tweet and you read a second it's amazing how some proof-of-work proponents just keep repeating the unmitigated bare-faced lie that proof-of-stake includes voting on protocol parameters that's one of the arguments for why ethereum should be a security it's right you can use to vote it's false it doesn't just like proof of work doesn't and this so often just goes unchallenged nodes reject invalid blocks in proof of stake and in proof of work it's not hard and he follows this up because he is quote tweeting someone who says the fact that you can vote on something to change its properties is proof that it's a security love bitcoin vitalik says a small grammar nuance in english when talking about things like proof of stake we don't say it's a security we say it's secure i know these suffixes are hard to are hard though so i forgive the air that's the spicy take which is saying like hey you bitcoiners who think that ether is a security because of proof of stake no it's extra secure unlike the proof-of-work hard cap model which is destined to run out of security budget um this was going back earlier where uh like people think that like proof people associate proof of stake with governance because like your stake determines the next block but no like your your 32 ether is an asic what determines the rules and the update to the rules are people that download and update their nodes just like in bitcoin node operators you do not need to stake to update your nodes or determine the future direction of the blockchain node operators do this you don't have to have money you don't have to have any well all you have to do is be able to run a node on a machine and then you are essentially validating yes uh so here's here's the last uh take that we that i'll that we'll give i think that's the last take no we got one more uh this is me and i say how to become a millionaire this is it this is going to work everyone who's listening to this who follows this can become a millionaire hopefully 50 chance uh number one stick around and pay attention during the bear market number two that's it that's all that's all you do that's all you do so yeah i mean the whole idea is that alpha is generated in the bear market the people that stuck around during the the 2018-2020 bear market like they got to participate in defy summer which was like i don't know about by you ryan but like d5 summer was way more like lucrative than 2021 like there was just like money being printed everywhere it was super fun like the vibes were really good uh and and then also people who were participated in d5 summer they knew that bull market was on like a whole 12 months before like other people that had left during the bear market or people who didn't know about crypto so like we knew that the 2021 bull market was gonna happen in like april of 2020 and so we had like six months nine months to like front run everyone else yeah totally you got to stick around in order to do that i have a third way to become a millionaire though david listen ten percent inflation for the next decade everyone gets to be a millionaire like the us dollar is eroding that fast exactly nice um all right a final take for you this is uh a whole letter from penn tara we can't read the letter in this take of course but i think the synopsis is the title d fry worked great all of c5 was failing all around us d5 worked great dan from pantera capital pushes back against the idea that has become a narrative somehow that celsius and blockfi all of these were like defy and here's an article he's pointing to d5 has an existential problem no defy worked incredibly well during this downturn uh and he pushes back on all of that so i'll read i'll leave that for your homework well i asked david the question we end these episodes with what are you bullish on this week my friend uh am i allowed to like leak some alpha uh certainly yeah yeah you mean the outfit is it is is it something i've heard uh yeah you know all that i know about this you know about the alpha leakaway then yeah for the first time ever there is more being built at bank list behind the scenes than than out in public like usually almost everything we do is completely in public like 95 of banquets is out in public just like the discord coordination the five percent of coordination that's like in private uh for the first time ever there's like more stuff being built in private that we've got since secret than what's in public i feel i feel teased sir yeah do you feel you're teasing me i'm teasing you you're teasing me isn't working well i know what's going on so it's not working on me but uh yeah that would pique my interest yeah yeah when am i gonna find out more david uh well there's well there's a number of different things there's this one thing that is happening and then there's this other thing that's happening and then there's the third thing which is the bankless studio uh which most people know about but they don't know to the degree of how awesome it's going to be so there's there i teased one of the three things there you go we got some stuff coming is what david's saying in the pipeline yeah ryan what are you excited about uh i'm excited about the universe david yeah and i mean this literally this time so you can't like uh you can talk about like my deep thoughts are weird the james webb telescope okay this has been a project that's been like over a decade long and it launched last december i've been following this this is the only thing i might be more excited about than the ethereum merge okay might be probably not i've got nutrition you've got in the deep space uh deep freaking space yes and the james webb telescope and so uh you guys probably saw this the pictures were all over the place pictures came back from the first pictures from the james webb telescope and they are absolutely phenomenal okay we're looking at here is like some of these stars david are just 500 million years old okay we are looking back deeper and slower than we ever have that's like 95 through the timeline of the universe that's how far back we are looking here and it just blows my mind uh you know there's there's tons of stuff you can find like you know our slash space is full of these images if you want to get super geeky but i think i have a crypto take here too which is like this is a 20 20 22 thing that i think the world needed and i think we needed um because first of all what is the james webb telescope was it it's a public good this is open source knowledge that we can now share across uh the internet so it's kind of like some of the things that we're building in crypto and that's amazing in and of itself it's also a massive engineering undertaking right uh that has taken over a decade this project was far more complicated than anything humanity's ever launched into space just the level of detail and planning and everything had to go right in order for the mirrors to unfold it's just an incredible story and that we were able to do this as a species is absolutely phenomenal we have a giant eyeball apparatus in space now and that's cool um also this is like science scientific discovery and as we know it's like science technology that is the way we actually progress right these inflation cycles these monetary policy things that's not actually doing anything for progressing and improving uh humanity and quality of life for humans uh in the short run the way we improve quality of life is through technology that's the thing that always works and we need science in order to do that uh and then this gives me like a new perspe it gives people a new perspective on the universe and it's a time where like i mean there's wars happening there's conflict everywhere no one can get along and um this is something that we coordinated on to launch into space i don't know it's just a breath of fresh air in the 2020s and i feel like we really needed that that's that's my take on the telescope and why it's important i love it i love it one thing i've been thinking about a lot lately is that like while there's like so much short-term bearishness and like because of like the recession that is about to happen to us and all of our assets are down bad everyone's like focused on the next like one to two years like how do i make sure i get to one of these two years and then there's like even greater stuff like that like global geopolitical things are totally gonna shift the world's gonna look super different in five years the dollar is about to collapse like oh the short term short term in the grand scheme of things like bearish stuff that like damn we're gonna have to like the whole fourth turning thing like there's this big world transition that we're about to go through but on the other side of that there's like this space race that's about to trigger there's like this metaverse that's about to develop there's like bio hacking and gene editing that is like on the cusp of exploding there are so many cool things ahead of us and like they're all positioned to be like the thing that pulls us out of this just like crazy terrible like global reshuffling that we're about to go through yeah i totally agree i i think um i mean bullish humanity over the long run always right um bullish humanity uh meme of the week david what are we looking forward to this week yeah uh this is uh mike three at enjoy your on twitter uh it says base carbon working on a dig playlist and the playlist is titled three three arrows capital three ac and it's song one can i borrow a dollar song two i need some money song three give me your money so i'm for money that's what i want chuck brown who's on five we need some money song six can i borrow a dollar again song seven spare some change uh eight can i borrow a dollar nine can i get some money uh yeah throws capital down bad oh it keeps on going it keeps getting yeah i need money can i borrow a dollar i need money again i need money give me money money money money money oops oops that's it that's capital playlist if you're if you're into that kind of listening then uh we'll include a link where you can find that on uh on spotify guys as always none of this has
