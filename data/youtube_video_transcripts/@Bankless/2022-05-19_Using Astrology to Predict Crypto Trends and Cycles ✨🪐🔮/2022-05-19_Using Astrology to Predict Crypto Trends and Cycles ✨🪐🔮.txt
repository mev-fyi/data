can you walk us through a little like out loud thinking process about like what goes into finding the connections between astrology and financial markets so at any given moment the planets in the sky are in a certain position they're all moving at different speeds they're all moving in different orbits and the planets therefore are always making different angles to one another and these angles tend to represent either easy or difficult world events and the planet themselves symbolize certain themes in the world so you'll combine ex-planet with why planet in a certain degree and if you're using multiple charts as in the chart of the given sky to something that was born whether it be a person or bitcoin because we were all born at a snapshot of the planets and we can see how our life is going if we apply the current planets and those geometric aspects to something that was born so if you do that to bitcoin you can predict if x aspect to like why planet in bitcoin's chart then number go up go down if this is happening to the chart of the us then this looks like this kind of world event
