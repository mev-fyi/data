[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we are here to help you become more bankless bankless nation we have an absolutely incredible episode for you super honored to have chris berninski on the podcast he doesn't do many podcasts but there were some ideas i think he wanted to talk about specifically with the bankless community and this is just a killer episode david what stuck out to you chris to me is this quiet thinker who is always lurking in the background just absorbing information and really stitching them together in the ways that make sense to him so when he gives his thoughts it's coming from a place of like patience and contemplation and he in that i think that is really reflected in his like deliberateness in his ideas and so when he comes to bankless and shares what he has been thinking about lately and what he's seeing going on in the defy world and the greater crypto world at large i take pause and i and i try and and integrate his ideas into into how i'm seeing things and so i have a ton of respect for for chris and the way he thinks and i'm really happy that we were able to get him on the bankless podcast to to kind of share what he's been thinking about especially as the crypto world has seemed to have rounded a corner in the last few months or so yeah he's one of these guys with some uh crypto wrinkles to use a metaphor right like so he's been in this space for a while got in in his uh 20s but um wrote the ringing the bell on a new asset class in 2014 2015-ish which was a um like a incredible paper uh for its time way ahead of things so he he's kind of he's got this wisdom that's built up in crypto and having witnessed a few market cycles uh and that certainly comes through when we talk to him about where we are in the market cycle we ask him about eth specifically we ask him about defy tokens we we talked to him about um economic bandwidth and um what these new capital assets can mean for the world so this is um no this is like an episode that ties a lot of things together that we've talked about previously but also projects forward like if you want to hear what the next three to four years are going to look like starting now i feel like this is the perfect episode to start with it's very obvious that chris has uh pretty strong convictions about the values of of both himself and these systems at large i think that's really important when it comes to actually looking at as to where these systems are going because if you're in the crypto space uh you are here because of the new values that are instantiated in the code of these protocols and having somebody like chris who has very strong values and very strong convictions about those values who is also a leader in this space in a way chris is the kind of directing the memes directing the narrative in a way that resonates with his values and the values that he has that he's communicated through his writing i really resonate with so i'm really glad that we have chris in this space kind of leading the thoughts leading the leading the charge into this new world going westward but going in a specific direction that will be good for humanity rather than just bringing about the same old systems in a new form but before we get into the interview we need to talk about some of our bankless sponsors as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent-seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless crypto economic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today so the biggest thing that's holding crypto back is actually getting fiat into the system moving from that old world to the new crypto world what you have to do is create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's also holding your app back if you are a d5 developer and are building something on a network like ethereum what that means is in the fiat process your users drop off when they're signing up and you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but what if you could make it super easy to on ramp to your application using a fiat on-ramp ramp is that it is a delightfully easy fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eat and die usdc whatever asset they want in five minutes or less so this reduces the dropout rate and lets you build products for the real world zurion is using it ethereum is using it taurus is using it d5 apps that you probably know and use today are using it what you need to do is check this out and visit ramp.network to see how easy it is you can get set up in 10 minutes or less and 100x your addressable market size as a develop this is like the ultimate growth hack and when you mention bankless they'll on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so go to ramp dot network mention bankless and get started alright guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with chris bruniski [Music] hello everyone bankless nation we are so excited that we have chris braninski on the podcast today he is a vc and partner at placeholder he's the author of the book crypto assets he's really the founding father of many of the mental models that we talk about here on bank lists on a weekly basis chris it is fantastic to have you here today how are you doing sir i'm doing great thanks for having me on guys yeah absolutely how how is kovitt going you uh you you're surviving everything that's going on in the east coast there i am surviving um some people know this but i grew up on hawaii and so i did retreat to the islands for a little bit and i'm back in new york at the moment and new york's a pretty surreal place it's um maybe half as full as it typically is which in some ways makes it more pleasant but then there's the um constant paranoia of contracting kovid although you know it's safer than a lot of the rest of the us at the moment um so it's got its puts in its takes yeah absolutely i guess the nice thing about being immersed in the digital world is we don't have to deal with it with that sort of thing uh so much so um you know i've been mostly camped in my office i know david's been sort of the same um and uh yeah a different world there but but chris we want to dive right in here we've got so much to talk about today so many cool topics um so i think we should just you know dive in with maybe we could start with what's go i think everyone has your background uh everyone knows your story from previous podcasts and many have read your book you definitely have a big fan following in the bankless community so maybe we could just talk about what's going on in d5 these days particularly these defy tokens these these almost these proto uh capital assets um you popularized at one point in time in 2017 the like some value uh formulas mv equals pq you know can you talk about capital assets and you know how you're thinking about valuation of them and maybe the evolution of token valuation over time in the context of these defy tokens definitely the toughest thing here is we're dealing with programmable value right and so the programmability can lead to any kind of value capture and therefore any kind of valuation model and so typically when i'm investigating these things i start off with the super classes of assets from robert greer it's just a formula of looking at the world that i like and those super classes are capital assets which are an ongoing source of something of value they're valued on the basis of the net present value of uh their expected returns there's consumable so capital assets would be like bonds equities income producing real estate that kind of stuff um there's consumable transformable assets where you can consume it you can transform it into another asset it has economic value but it does not yield an ongoing stream of value um so that's more your typical physical commodities or bitcoin for example or precious metals and then the third super class are your store value assets so cannot be consumed nor can it generate income nevertheless it has value it is a store value asset so that's like you know fine arts or some of the precious metals like gold overlap into this and certainly bitcoin does so if we look at those three super classes and we say well where does bitcoin fit in that bitcoin really started in the consumable transformable and has bled into being considered store value very similar to gold and so the equation of exchange mv equals pq um that i did a lot of work with in 2016 and 2017 was really the best attempt at creating price targets for a consumable transformable asset um that has a store of value characteristic and you know typically when you look at your typical commodities which would fall in these consumable transformable buckets um their price floor is the marginal cost of production and we have seen that be effective actually for btc you know in the bottom of the market in 2015 again in the bottom in 18 2018 and 2019 um you know in 15 marginal cost production was around 200 that's where we bottomed um in 18 and 19. similarly it was in that three four five thousand dollar range so that's a good bottom um and that sticks to prior rules that we know and then it's a bit um more novel to to use mv equals pq to solve for the necessary size of the monetary base of an economy size pq at velocity v and that's basically what what i was doing uh with the consumable transformables but then um as in in that stands i want to make clear that i think that continues to be the best way to approach the consumable transformable assets that overlap with store value assets though the store of value has a financial premium which makes it very hard to accurately project the price now if we fast forward to now and we compare now with 2017 there's been a total explosion of stake based assets and so i wrote a piece i guess it was in it was either in 2018 or 2019 that was updating um some of the this valuation work and really focusing on the stake based assets because what became clear to me is a state-based asset is a capital asset um it it gives you a source of something of value and it will be valued on the basis of the net present value of its expected returns and so what that means is in in particular for a lot of these defy assets anything where i'm staking the asset and i need that asset to perform work to get value flows from the network i can value that using some variant of you know a dcf or a dividend discount model there's different ways um to approach it but it's a much more familiar model say to a traditional evaluation analyst coming from ecwid the equities world or the bonds world or yeah the bond world and so really wanting to get people to understand okay you can look at these as newfangled capital assets so let me pause there because there's more to go into yeah i don't want to derail from the the defy token conversation because that is definitely this new phenomenon that's going in on in in the d5 world but but first chris i want to talk about uh the three asset classes from from robert greer that you are um a fan of super classes yeah assets super class yeah because then we have the typical asset classes that we think of underneath those super classes yeah excuse me the the three asset super classes and i use those super classes as a model for understanding eth in in my my talk slash paper the eth is a triple point asset where i made the claim that ethe is perhaps the only asset that fits inside of all three asset super classes and i actually never got your opinion on whether that uh statement resonated with you or or not so does it it does um and i think it's good branding um i i i mean we're all aware of how important these different shortcuts or memes are so i like the idea of it being a triple triple point asset um i think the silence that you might have felt um for mine typically i'm silent if i'm uncertain about something you know because then i don't want to put a uninformed opinion out there and the reason i was a little uncertain is we've just never had an asset like that and it's not to say that it can't happen but it is complex in terms of approaching how to value that thing and and what it will be conceived of um now i think that when i look particularly eth 2.0 right there eth will be staked um for consensus and so that will make it a capital asset um and you will be able to value it on that basis it will have additional demand as a consumable transformable and with this growing understanding of ethos money it will have a financial premium and so on that basis i think you're spot on that's super interesting to get your take on that chris um let's let's switch back to uh the defy assets um conversation so that was a great summary of the three asset super classes right so we've got our capital assets which can be valued as a discounted cash flow dcf type model right and then we've got um our store value and our consumable assets and that's really the mve equals pq equation was really built for those now it seems like in 2017 the market went a little bit wild with valuing every single token that existed as a mv equals pq type token right as if it's going to become a store of value asset it seems like with the um resurgence of of defy tokens that actually have these on-chain cash flows we were talking with dan elliser in an episode a couple episodes ago it seems like this is a more healthy type of capital asset because there are actually cash flows associated with these defy tokens like comp or like balancer or like some of the others that are are coming out is that your take too is is the best way to value these defy tokens in that as a capital asset in a discounted cash flow model and does that mean these assets are a bit um healthier i might use that term than the the asset valuation models we were using in 2017 so i definitely think um there's more fundamentals uh here right and so um the only thing that makes me a little uncomfortable is um using the discounted cash flow idea i was trying to use discounted value flow because a lot of these things you know it's not specifically cash that's flowing and so there is a little bit of extra complexity in terms of the type of asset that is flowing to the holder be it the native crypto asset or die or some other asset within this realm but it is certainly the case that um there's more fundamentals here and it's more familiar to your traditional analysts and what that means for me is um you know we have these exploding markets of assets and you know when i got started in this industry most people didn't care because most people thought they were worthless and now a lot of people care because a lot of people think they're valuable but no one knows how to value them and so everyone's trying to figure out how to value them and that was more so the case in 2017 and that that will come back around um we've got kind of our core crypto group that is of course nerding out and fascinating uh fascinated by all this but um as we have more of these models that come out there's this this this phenomenon that starts to happen that's specific to humans um which is theory is following price so we're creating theories to try and predict these prices but once we create the right theories and they they back test and these models are panning out then price will follow the theory and so then we actually start to build in more price stability um you know less volatility more consistency in these markets so it's actually a critical a critical part of the functioning of these markets that would be able to better value and understand them and that's also very important for you know the larger scale money that institutional investors that crypto is always talking about um because you know those are the types of conversations i'm having often with placeholders lps around you know how do you value this thing and if people can't get a handle on you know its fundamentals then they're likely to um not be comfortable at least from an institutional basis there's one other thing i want to add here and that's the difference between say a fundamental evaluation model and a relative valuation model so you know the discounted value flows or let's just call it variance of net present value of flows um those models are fundamental models then there's the whole world of relative valuation models which inequities are things like you know price to sales on a trailing or forward basis or price to earnings or there's there's you know dozens if not hundreds of them what's interesting with um crypto is you know we had things like um nvt right for the consumable transformables the network value to transaction ratio but now with the capital assets we're seeing things where people are looking at these um from a price to sales or price to earnings basis so you know tokenterminal.xyz now has a ranking where you can look at assets and you can say oh wow this asset is quite cheap in that it's only trading five times earnings going to the supply cider whereas this other asset is trading at 500 times and so actually what you've seen partially in d5 with some of these assets like bancor or ave or kyber they were valued very cheaply as a multiple of the the value flows going to their supply ciders and so you really had a repricing or um you could call it multiple expansion where you had people realizing oh wow these are capital assets these are solid networks they're producing these value flows and they're trading you know at one tenth the multiple of their peers and so you have people piling into them and there's basically a repricing to bring those relative valuations more in par and so um i think we can expect to see both a lot more fundamental valuation work and that's kind of the bedrock but then the um say the pricing game with your peers becomes a lot of relative valuation comparisons that has been one of the most exciting things i've seen i would say in the past you know six months or so this this sort of relative evaluation metrics that we're seeing we will include a link to token terminal in the show notes for folks so they could see that also a couple of articles on bank bankless where we've talked about you know how to how to value it so it almost what you're talking about chris almost is kind of analogous to a price to earnings ratio right that uh people might be used to evaluating in the equities world yeah and it's it's really fascinating it's fantastic that we're getting to this place in crypto and it makes me super excited and i'm admittedly a nerd for being excited about that um but the the danger here is that we don't standardize and so i actually haven't talked with the token terminal guys but like if you think about it um for this this price to earnings um that they're listing i've got a suspicion that it might actually be more price to sales right because sales is the top line flows to have a price to earnings you would have to be understanding what the margins are of the individual supply ciders now i think they list it as a price to earnings if i'm not interested um the other thing is you know to create that ratio let's just say price to sales you would have the network value of the assets and you divide it by the value flows um going to the supply ciders now for that network value are you using circulating supply or are you using fully diluted supply right are you using trailing or are you using ford and so once you start to ask these questions you can see oh you know there's four or there's eight different potential price to sales ratios that i could project and really for a comparison to be useful every single one every single asset has to be computed in the same way and so i think we need you know price to sales off of circulating and off the fully diluted because you'll start to see that will start to reveal kind of what's hidden in the underbelly of coin market cap and some of these sites of you know okay yeah this asset might look cheap but it's got 90 percent dilution in it because only 10 percent of the supply circulating so we need to standardize and we need now that we're kind of getting the um big overarching ideas we'll have to standardize and become more nuanced in our comparisons and understandings and i totally share your excitement with like the fact that we've gotten to this place is incredibly exciting the fact that we are now talking about the nuances of relative valuations across different defy and crypto capital assets is incredibly exciting and i think all of that will come you wrote a fairly famous uh paper in the crypto space um talking about the birth of the new asset class and it it feels to me like like we are birthing new asset classes if you will under each of the super asset categories like as we speak i mean the emergence of this capital asset well that's an asset of defy tokens as capital assets that's an asset under the the capital asset in a super asset category when you originally wrote the paper uh you were talking more about bitcoin right which was more the store value asset are you seeing like essentially what we're doing here is we're digitizing like there's going to be the birth of new assets in in digital form that are crypto native across each of these asset super classes yeah you know it's funny you say that because i have from our notes the new asset class paper and i had written down i should have titled it bitcoin ringing the bell for new asset classes yes pretty much exactly what you just said yeah i you know i guess if we if we think of blockchains as this 21st century accounting system or blockchain has 21st century accounting systems then i expect all of the traditional assets to get digitized and you know accounted for and exchanged on these rails and then exactly as you were just alluding to um the creation of new examples within each asset superclass so you know these this capital that we're talking about it's not quite like equity there are some you know really important differences and so you really couldn't call it equities or stocks nonetheless it would still be a capital asset and therefore a new asset class and there will be a bunch that fit that bill similarly under the consumable transform goals bitcoin is not a commodity um like wheat is the commodity there are some things that are that are quite different about it especially you know you you look at the marginal cost of production tends to go up whereas for most commodities the marginal cost of production tends to go down so you know you're definitely you're you're spot on there um and we're going to have you know these liquid asset soups um kind of floating around as bits on the database so chris i just have one more we want to get to some other stuff but one more as you said that you kind of jog my memory so my mental model has shifted a little bit away from a bitcoin or an ether being the actual consumable asset itself uh and more toward the block space as being the consumable asset and bitcoin and ether as the currency that is required the protocol mandated currency that is required uh to pay for the block space i'm wondering what you what you think about that idea so it's it's basically the idea that well the true commodity here the true consumable asset is the ethereum block space itself the gas if you will that's the kind of denomination or the the bitcoin block space and um bitcoin or ether are are more the money more the the currencies that are required to pay for them i'm wondering if that factors into your thought process or what you think about that idea so i see what you're getting at i would still say they're one and the same um and the analogy that comes to mind is you know let's take gasoline um which is composed of you know different commodities but is this commodity soup um that gasoline then goes into an engine and then runs that engine um but it's still the um the gasoline that is valued and that you buy and that you pay for and that you consume you're you're not consuming the engine directly like you consume the engine over 10 years or 15 years as the car depreciates and all of that and the reason i'm using that analogy is you know bitcoins block space or ethereum's evm and block space those are the engines and you know bitcoin is the fuel and ether is the fuel to run computation through those engines and so it's the direct value uh the direct valuation of access to those engines so you you're absolutely right that like the utility you're getting out of it comes from the block space and that computational engine but the fuel that goes into it that values it directly um are these assets the btc so chris i want to turn to another difference between the traditional world of uh equity assets and assets you would find on traditional markets and the assets that we are seeing come around in this uh most recent era of crypto development and i mostly want to focus on fairness and equality with how these assets are coming to be and maybe compare and contrast them with with the traditional system right and so this new emergence of d5 tokens the the saf g the simple agreement for future governance and the emergence of liquidity mining what these really all are are distribution mechanisms and importantly i i think uh the the compound comp token has had no shortage of headlines but what has had a shortage of headlines in my opinion is that the comp token and the liquidity mining that is going on with the com token is the compound proto protocol quote unquote going public right and importantly it's going public in a uh using that metaphor it's going public at a way faster rate than what you would find a typical company is on the stock market where there are multiple and multiple and multiple rounds of vc funding that that allow certain special interest groups special people uh privileged people to gain access to the upside of a certain business right and then finally the public gets to have access to it like last right but compound really just took the shortcut and said like well we're not going to go public on the public stock market we're going to turn the governance over the protocol into this comp token and we're going to allow users to work for this token right and in your article um a blank slate of state which i'm a huge i was a huge fan of and it's definitely going to be included in the show notes you talked about the need of baking labor into capital and how that can solve some of the rampant wealth inequalities that we find in this world which i think during the times of money printer go bird during coronavirus it's extremely salient so i'm wondering how if i'm if i'm speaking of of the right ideas when it comes to baking capital into or labor into capital uh with this whole liquidity mining phenomenon as like perhaps a first step towards generating a more fair financial system definitely um and there's a lot to unpack there but um if we look at if we look at bitcoin as kind of the mother of all of this innovation right um bitcoin used a hardcore supply side subsidy um that is the minting of new bitcoin um to capture a bunch of supply ciders to provide security to the network and actually create the service and so what we see compound doing or balancer doing or some of these others with liquidity mining is really the the same supply side and to some extent now demand side hack give away the and this is specifically with compound and balancer which are capital assets whereas bitcoin is as we discussed consumer transformable and store value but for compound and balancer you are giving away the capital of the network to the people who make the network great um and that is the laborers as you were just alluding to david uh and then also to some extent the demand side i think we're going to see people play around with how they use the in these incentives but it it really is a bootstrapping hack to pull together marketplaces and solve the chicken and egg problem which is a very hard problem to solve and i think it's super elegant to do that by giving away the majority of the capital to the supply side and demand side and leave the investors in the minority position um there's you know more we can go into in terms of you know de-emphasizing investors and path to liquidity and the costs but let me pause for now well chris do you think that this model is going to solve some of the rampant inequality issues that we've seen with with equity where it sort of pools among the the uber rich or is that a different problem to solve i hope so and i think it has a good chance of doing it um you know if we zoom out and we look at equity really what equity is you know it was invented about 400 years ago and it's the pooling of capital um to take risk in a joint venture um for something and so the dutch east india company is um the earliest and most famous example of this and that has worked great um at in the industrial era where you kind of always needed more capital to make more investment in the the capex of the machines and the systems that are producing things um and so you know in a way investors constantly dumping in more capital is is a much needed function within that company that that company that's backed by equity but as we have turned to the software era and you can produce new units at zero marginal cost and just continue to scale out and scale out and scale out with on a relative basis very little capital then what that means is in the software and the digital era you kind of have these massive systems that scale out are really capital efficient but are captured at the beginning by the shareholders and then those shareholders because it's just the shareholders that hold the capital of the system it's concentrated governance and in only having shareholders governing it i think it allows those shareholders to dehumanize all other parts of the system so you don't take them into account because they don't have a seat at the table and so you maximally extract in that process the the other thing and maximal extraction is the name of the game right in equities um the other part of the the process here is um in terms of who gets access to a productive asset with an equity if an equity is yielding dividends then everyone is getting those dividends whereas with a lot of these crypto capital assets you have to be an active participant to be getting the yield and if you're not an active participant you're getting diluted and so you know if we look at the um the access to the assets the governance of the assets uh the productive nature of the assets there are leveling forces um that i see in these cryptocapital assets that should help us with the inequality that has come from um you know our our equity systems as we know that so it becomes less of a model where you've got the capitalists versus the users and more of a model where the users become you know shareholders they become part of the capital structure is that kind of what you're saying yes um placeholders governance researcher mario law has a joke um where i think it was um keynes who said you know you you have to do away with the financiers and um mario's joke is with crypto we're just trying to make everyone a financier and um yeah you you if you're gonna have a capitalist system which is very effective um at least the most effective coordination system that we've invented today um economic coordination system then um everyone needs to have access to capital because if you have capital then you're basically swimming downstream um you're accruing value and that is like it it you can look at the point of capitalism actually is um solely to grow capital like it's it's actually kind of set up um such that all the way through from the creation and the production and that whole process and the growth it is just set up to continually expand the amount of capital within the system and it does this you know quite reliably there are bumps along the way and so that is that perpetual growth engine is kind of a miracle um and it is it does exist within our minds only um but the really important thing with it or where we've messed up thus far is we haven't put that perpetual growth machine in everyone's hands and um with crypto we have a technology that is low cost enough um to now do that now we're still probably a good five to ten years out from you know having really good candy coated interfaces and really good public key management and you know the all the world's languages available on these interfaces and all those kinds of things that will truly take this technology the last mile to everyone but the raw ingredients are there certainly to open up that access you know i think what would help is if we actually applied this so these defy tokens these opportunities to get involved as users also in the capital side of things are so new right now that people are just trying to wrap their heads around them so i think would help to have you know some you know tangible example uh to talk about um i know you are close to the balancer project and for folks that don't know balancer dave and i have talked about balancer often on bankless it is an uh automated market maker so and but but it's got some unique characteristics a little bit like uniswap but but also uh some unique characteristics that that chris can get into it it's now at about eight percent of all d5 trading we're just looking about that at this yesterday so it's grown quickly and they've recently rolled out their balancer token the bell token to liquidity providers can you talk about balancer as a case study in the context of of what you were just saying about this new asset class and about users getting more involved as financers as you say certainly so balancer is just totally wild it's an amazing system and you can see balancer as collapsing together asset management with exchange right because with balancer you're able to create pools of up to eight assets um with any percentage weighting that you want um and so that is basically allowing you to create your own etf your own exchange traded fund and then the pool auto manages those weights holding them at you know let's say you want seventy percent maker twenty percent even ten percent die it will auto manage those weights now what's fascinating is you get paid for having contributed your assets to those pools because those pools serve actually as the back end for an exchange a decentralized exchange that sources liquidity from these pools and so what you've done is you know you look at traditional asset management in finance and you have an extraction system where you contribute your assets you have to pay people in the the index world you pay people for doing very little but you pay them anyway and they extract from you year after year after year in balancer you contribute your assets and you get paid year after year after year because you are actually providing a service for people who want to exchange and so i think that's a good example of actually compressing and collapsing inefficient parts of the existing financial system and just creating something wholly new that in my opinion is much better um for for the supplier and the user of this system now what balancer has also done is they've committed to giving and it's not so much giving it's allowing the liquidity providers to earn 65 of the capital that makes up the network and um so you're giving you're you're allowing the users to earn the vast majority of the capital that makes up the network um the team you know has um their upside slice for having created this out of their minds as do the investors and then there's a pool for insurance and for a few uh integration partners in the future but it's a good example of it it inverts actually what happened from 2017 where you were selling you know say 60 70 80 of the supply here you are allowing 60 70 80 of the supply to be earned for quote unquote free but you're really providing service which is why it's better to think of it as earning rather than giving away and then those people if you earn something that labor earns more loyalty than buying and so those people earn this asset become strong hands and then become involved in the governance and when balancer does implement you know something that makes this a capital asset rate something that directs value flows to bow holders the way i see that playing out is the valuation of the asset will be based upon those value flows but the governance is what makes those value flows credible and so if you have bad governance then you have to hike the discount rate which will discount all of those value flows to a smaller value if you have good governance then you'll have a lower discount rate and so those all those future value flows are less discounted meaning the present value is more so i just want to recap the ways that balancer is similar to but also meaningfully different from the legacy systems that it relates to right so balancer is a place where you can deposit assets and it simultaneously acts as an exchange for for people outside of the system to to leverage and in a similar way as a where you can buy an etf as an index with balancer you can submit assets and get exposure to a generalized set of tokens but this one pays you for keeping your assets in the etf from the from the utility that you are providing people that are looking for liquidity and so as a capital or value depositor you get returns on your capital simply for making it available for exchange and at the same time exactly balancer is uh bribing your loyalty as a capital depositor with the bow token which is a governance token of the system which like i said earlier with the comp model is a balancer system quote unquote going public right making the governance over the protocol giving it directly into the hands of the users of this system which one analogy i really like is that you know the uber drivers and perhaps even the uber riders are receiving shares of uber as an incentive to use the product right so it's getting the the upside potential of the whole entire system into the hands of the people that are providing the value in the first place and is doing this in a much more streamlined way and all of these things just resonate with me so much in the way that they make it's the same systems and the same mechanisms that we've had but with more equity built into it with more fairness built into it um and i'll pause there and let you comment before i ask my next question no i think that that was a great summary there was something i wanted to say about um going public but i forget what it was so continue on okay so the the query or qualm that or worry that i have is is that um uber drivers or uber riders or people that are you know users of this system might not be or have the background or experience or the education necessary to make decisions about governance over these systems does that worry you it does um this is where i think of so there's a there's actually a few things that worry me here so starting there um i think that this design this governance capital asset design is really most relevant to investors and suppliers and less so to the demand side now you just reference you know an uber driver and maybe an uber driver doesn't want to be involved in in the governance of uber but i do think that they should have still have exposure to the capital um of the network that they're working for and that they should be able to delegate um and you know maybe they have a really eager friend who's nerding out on governance and maybe that person makes it their full-time job what i anticipate longer term is um i think these governors of these networks as the network scale need to become prestigious positions and i'm not sure that the direct coin holder vote is the right long-term solution and i know that's a little contentious given how widely used it is um but when i when i look at say how our biggest systems in the world are governed right now and those those systems are really our governments people in congress or in the senate or the president or whatever it might be they get full-time salaries they're professionals it's a prestigious position and so if we expect these systems to evolve past this toy stage i also think and i've been having this conversation with the maker dad team that you need um you know governors who are earning full-time salaries and been having this conversation with z cash team two full-time salaries prestigious positions that you know people are working for that they're training for that they're studying for right now we're still very much you know in the tinkerer hobbyist working from our from our garage stays from our garage stage and so we do need to grow past that and i i don't think we have found all of the right solutions i think that there is this constant tug to go towards more um you know representative democracies rather than direct democracies and there is also going to need to be a stratification between okay what is something where every coin holder vote versus where you know there's a council or you know there's some elected group that's voting on things it's kind of like um board level decisions you know decisions that are made at a board meeting once a quarter versus you know the day-to-day operational decisions and so just to divide and conquer and have the right amount of expertise um and the the right amount of effort put into some of these decisions i do think we need more governance stratification um and i've been influenced somewhat here by carlotta perez who you know just zooming out from crypto believes that we need more micro scale governance and more supernational or international governance and then kind of more trimming down of the fat middle um and so what i'm getting at here is you know let's automate the bureaucracies the paper pushers where there's a lot of corruption um and there's not the transparency we want and it's just kind of commodity work anyway automate that um and then take the value that you would have paid to those people and pay you know the governors at the supranational or the micro scale more um so there are a number of things jumbled up into that around governance i think the other concern i have here is um what balancer is doing what compounder is doing is not sustainable and i say that loving the balancer team and you know working closely with them since last year of um it is a supply side subsidy right it does have an apr now it does generate a lot a lot of yield but just as with bitcoin that needs to turn over into paying customers right that needs to turn over into true value flows and so the subsidy works for the bootstrapping stage but it is not the end-all be-all you have to get to a point where you know there's real people that are paying for this service because that shows the utility that the service is providing to the world and that's really where we kind of get to the equilibrium capital asset model yeah i think those are both great points chris yeah so i want to riff off your first for a minute because it does kind of frustrate me a little bit when people talk about on-chain coin-vote governance as being decentralized governance right um because what i see is the the really unique thing about these assets is that they are settled on chain and these are all on-chain cash flows and that's global and that's permissionless and that's amazing that's incredible but essentially coin vote governance that is um you know corporate governance we've had that for a long time in equities that's essentially shareholder governance and i wonder if if that's kind of what you're getting at like my worry is that coin vote governance for some of these systems once the equity is distributed to some of the users it sort of collapses to the model that we have today with equities where you have large capital pools who serve on the board of directors and then you have small investors who are essentially proxy voting to them do you think that it will kind of collapse in that way or do you think will uncover uh some of these new governance models that that you're talking about that um make this more unique so i agree it has echoes of corporate governance um i think that it is marginally better in that um even if you take something like decred right one of the more famous um and robust models of point holder governments you can earn that asset um and you could say okay you know there's there's there's um you know equity-based compensation if you're early on at a startup and so you could also earn um a seat at the table in corporate governance as well and that's fair pushback i do still think that um the general involvement when i when i look at um who's involved in governing like decred it's pretty flat um in terms of like anyone can talk with the leaders and anyone can kind of can raise an issue and put it in front of the board let's say and that's not the case with corporate governance so maybe one of the biggest differences here is the access to put information on the table is super open in these systems in a way that it's not open in corporate governance i agree that there are troubling amounts of concentration around um some of these coin holder governance systems and that's where you know distribution is absolutely critical and this is where i actually think it's quite neat what ethereum has been able to do of you know yes there was the original sale um and you know there's all the kind of maximalist propaganda around that sale but a lot of that sale has been distributed out you know ethereum foundation almost ran out of money at one point in time because these were so low and so that has has become distributed is as well distributed as btc um and a lot of that is thanks to proof-of-work and these cycles and then now in switching over to proof of stake you can do that somewhat equitably because you've distributed out the asset well i think it's um it's quite hard to start from um you know if you don't have a mining mechanism or some earning mechanism it's hard to avoid capital capturing a system and here's the other kind of just unfortunate reality of human nature is you know one it's it's the quote of power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely um or you know you can come into a system being a progressive but once you capture power you tend to become a conservative and you try and conserve that power and amass more of it and so like these are very base human things that happen time and again and i'll reference mario again um because he wrote a piece called resource distribution and power dynamics and decentralized networks it's on placeholder.vc and um these are age-old problems that we've struggled with and we're always going to continue to struggle with what i would hate to see is the path that maximalists take where they're like oh this is too messy we could never improve upon this why should we even try um you know there's 21st century accounting systems only for one asset that is totally the wrong perspective to take on this it's more this is a very sticky problem we have a new technology that can help us solve some parts of it not all parts of it human nature is still going to be human nature but it would be a lost opportunity to not you know have one more turn of the wheel in working to better govern ourselves yeah i agree but by the way though that that is why i worry about the current crop of eath killers um because they don't have the distribution that uh ethereum does and ether does they're going straight to proof of stake with on chain on chain voting coin vote do you share that worry yeah i mean look the only um placeholder looked at um most all of the headline quote-unquote ethkiller deals at at different points or um had those deaths those decks cross our desks and um the only team that we chose to back that's not ethereum is polka dot um which you know i'm sure could become contentious with time and polka dot did have a large sale um and so that is on my mind um but they also you know led by gavin who while he's contentious is a rock star in the space and they have been building community for the last three plus years and so um i think that we're gonna see these concerns play out with polka dot because and and polka dot will be the best comparable to ethereum because it's got a lot of this you know like core crypto ethos and cipher punky and a community that loves the technology and all that kind of stuff but it won't ever have proof of work right um and so if there's material differences between how the community behaves or let's say you know different amounts of apathy or those kinds of things i think with all other variables kind of equal we'll be able to say okay you know some of this is coming down to the way in which this this system's capital was was bootstrapped and distributed um but as for you know a bunch of the others i think you know a lot of the ethereum killers look at their systems as companies right and they want to hold the technology close to their chest and the capital close to their chest and they just don't fully get it um and they're actually kneecapping um the promise of their network in applying company-based silicon valley techniques to you know globally um sovereign crypto networks hey guys i just want to pause the interview with chris real quick and talk about ave ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum so what that means is that you can deposit your assets into ave and then take out a collateralized loan or simply deposit just to earn an interest rate so you pay an interest rate for borrowing you earn an interest rate for supplying but what the magic of ave offers you is stable interest rate loans which is a really important money lego for building out a bankless revolution having an interest rate that doesn't change under your fee is really important for long-term thinking and being able to plan out your own personal finance futures but also make strong business decisions based on an interest rate that you can depend on in addition to their stable interest rates there's also flash loans and flash loans are where you can borrow any amount of any asset without any collateral so long as you are also paying it back in the same transaction the use cases for this are absolutely endless and i'm really optimistic that some creative developers are going to make some really cool tools using the ave money lego system we have been watching ave climb the d5 pulse leaderboard just growing and growing and growing in the assets deposited into their application which just shows how strong of a system they have created so you can go and check them out at ave dot com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum while it works so check it out i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5x6x x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this that will include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off all right let's dive back into the interview so chris i've heard you make the statement that if you have good governance you can have anything right and so i'm hoping to get out of you perhaps an illustration of what good governance is and why that can get you anything and then perhaps also illustrate a a system that does have governance something like decred something like compound or balancer in a world where governance over these systems has been maximally successful what has good governance enabled these systems to do at maturity sure so it's hard to answer because none of these systems are at maturity um but i remember for the decrypt thesis we wrote uh i think it was with good governance you can have any feature you want and the key there is you can not necessarily you will and one of my learnings since having written that is you know there is a trade-off between um centralization and and uh execution speed so the more centralized you are the faster you can execute now you can execute in the wrong direction but you can execute really fast um the more decentralized you are it slows execution um and even if you can just think about you know a centralized system technologically versus a decentralized system now what that there are more things i'm going to have to layer in here um so what's interesting is there's um a study from the um from harvard's kennedy school of business that looked at democracies versus dictatorships and what's interesting is in expansionary times so basically bull markets the two perform on par economically but then it's in times of duress when dictatorships can fall apart whereas democracies tend to hold together better and if you're thinking on a decadal time scale you know times are not always good and so and we've seen this happen with different crypto networks um but if you don't involve people in the governance of your system and then things start to go south then they'll defect right and often in crypto that's forking um they'll go create another community or they'll raise hell within your community and that becomes um its own mess if you look at something like decred you know this bear market has been tough on decred but it stirred up a lot of conversation within the decred community and we haven't seen decred forking right you look at say something like bitcoin bitcoin has had numerous forks because there's no governance venue to reconcile disputes whereas with decred um there is a venue to do that and so and the system is designed to remain coherent so with something like bitcoin you end up having governance by defection um which might work solely in the case of bitcoin for the value add that it's trying to provide the world and being very stable and unchangeable and hewing to 21 million units if they can um assure that the security model is sufficient but then with anything that wants to evolve more um you know you you ideally want to remain coherent through your evolution and not constantly be losing limbs of your community because you lack a venue to debate and agree on the path forward and so um you know i think that over the long term good governance equitable governance is things that involve people that give people a voice to at least be heard are key to to surviving and to resilience even if they may slow down you know week to week execution through you know a little bit of analysis paralysis and and being too distributed so i'm not one to ascribe the current market prices to a successful thesis or not but i'm about to do it uh decred's price isn't very high in relation to what it once was and bitcoin's price is and bitcoin has absolutely no governance right and we have seen applications on ethereum follow in the same absolutely no governance model mainly uniswap right and we also and there are versions and iterations of balancer that can follow in uniswap's no governance footsteps but there does seem to be a pretty large role for no governance systems like uniswap that have been really really successful and with these new emergence of of governed protocols like compound and balancer and and ave um the it's the the lindy on these it resets and you know compound has updated three times balancer is just fresh out the door so like perhaps a lot of this conversation is skewed by just how young defy is at large but what do you see a role for just ungovernable systems like uniswap like bitcoin in the world of social scalability like how does the governance over these systems uh limit scale if they if governance can't become uh fine-tuned or or perfected so i would say that um there's a few things here one going back to this study between dictatorships and democracies when things are in growth right like uniswaps and growth and bitcoin in a macro sense is still very much in its growth stage um you can tolerate less representative governance because everything's going well right people are happy because they're making money and um you know that anaesthetizes any concern it's more when things are not going so well that you will have a lot of defectors and that you need a decision pathway for for how decisions are made one basic way of thinking of it is the most important decision a group will ever make is how decisions get made um as i said earlier i think that you know bitcoin could end up being an anomaly here but when i look at human history governance has actually governance is the thing that allows us to scale right like we as primates is part of the primate order we tend to show aggression towards beings that are not of our tribe and some primates kill beings that are not of their tribe and so we're kind of constantly um finding ways to peacefully coordinate with other tribes and having governance of different forms has allowed us to do that over time and i'm not sure if you guys have read the sovereign individual but he gives really good arguments um around kind of the economics of violence and protection and how governance interplays with those with basically coordinating around violence and protection and so the way i see it is these these systems are um giving us a supernational so global means to govern really important economic industries um and to not have a means to change those or to give the people that make up the systems any form of representation would be a mistake now i do think that we need to automate the fat middle and so this is the difference between like rules and discretion so as much as possible automate the commodity bureaucratic fat middle where it's really just paper pushing and very little discretion needed in those in those decisions and then automating you kind of stomp out all corruption but then you will still in my opinion always need discretion at um the super high level like you know the super macro scale and super micro scale and certainly you need legitimate governors you need people um who the community elects or you know puts in place who the community trusts but um to presume that we can create kind of these um automated machines that don't need any oversight from us i think would be a mistake so chris you mentioned in tribalism how it's hardwired into the human psyche and um i think many utopians have you know tried with like digital technology will eliminate tribalism but we we see a lot of tribalism in crypto um i mean it's everywhere and i know you've spoken about tribalism in the past uh my question i guess is do you think tribalism is is good or bad like is it healthy in some way or is it always bad and have your reviews evolved at all on that so they have evolved um i put out a tweet i think around thanksgiving last year about tribalism and i think on a personal basis i would much prefer for tribalism to go away um but i accept that that's naive um and that tribalism is as i was saying earlier baked into our evolutionary hardware and so you know short of a consciousness revolution which maybe will in a few thousand years um tribalism is always going to exist and it's going to be a motivating force um and you know that's again where i feel we will always need venues to debate and just decide and to choose the right decisions forward because those choices are always subjective right like pretty much everything is subjective at least within what humans have constructed because it's just human constructions and so the most important human construction is to decide upon how we're going to decide about future human constructions um and so circling back all the way to tribalism if we don't have those constructions then at least from what i see on crypto twitter and you know some of the nastiness that happens when we devolve into just being the animals that we are you know conversation goes out the window and it becomes a bunch of fights so i tend to share like um your view that like personally i don't like tribalism right i mean let's talk about this rationally um although i have said this before and i'm wondering if you share this view it does feel like the tribalism specifically the maximalism that is imbued in the dna of bitcoin is actually good for bitcoin for for the price for the price of bitcoin and of course price means security it means liquidity you know prices economic bandwidth we've talked about all of those things do you agree with that do you think some element of the maximalism and the tribalism in bitcoin is good for it so i think it's been critical to getting this movement off the ground like um you know i wasn't here at the very beginning um but once i started getting professionally involved in 2014 um it was very different from today like every other conversation i had i was basically battling it out with someone on why bitcoin was worth something and so there was a certain amount of stubbornness and hard-headedness and um borderline religious belief that was needed um in order to to get bitcoin off the ground and specifically bitcoin where it is really hard to value right and it's not a capital asset and so you know you have to use a [Music] more newfangled valuation model like the the equation of exchange we were discussing earlier so i think it was all necessary i think um [Music] at a certain point and you know the same goes for different religious movements that we've seen over time you can turn into an extremist and you can actually push people away right and so there's a moderation that's necessary and i think that you know we probably buy into the representation on crypto twitter too much um and you know the cast of characters especially on the maximus side that that appear there i think at this point kind of the economics and um uh ideological underpinnings of bitcoin speak for themselves and so my hope is that um you know the maximalists we see on twitter just become more and more irrelevant as the space becomes bigger and you know i think people increasingly do recognize the really hardcore maximalists as extremists that are not you know the engineers or the the builders that there are exceptions here um but i guess to sum up it was necessary that doesn't mean um that that form of extremism is always right it's kind of like as a company grows sometimes you need changeover of management right sometimes you need different skill sets at different periods and um i certainly don't want my grandmother getting screamed at for you know where she chooses to bank um that's just not appropriate at all and that's gonna turn her away she's yeah she's not gonna she's gonna think crypto is a very strange social system yeah i want to compare and contrast the tribalism found in the crypto worlds which i i think we're all in agreement at the at the genesis of these protocols you do need a healthy dose of tribalism because that is like the uh autoimmune system the immune system of a of a network right it protects it against all costs and we've seen uh going back to the lens of the sovereign individual we've seen this play out um and i think most saliently in america in the 17 1800s right where america needed to have this band of patriots to defend the nation uh against all costs right like to work for something bigger than themselves and that's really kind of the founding principles that america was founded on using the the the uh concept of america the concept of individual liberties the concepts of freedom as this rallying cry to generate the patriots of the system and now i think we're seeing that play out in in these digital nations as well where baked into the values of the digital nation are individual sovereignty individual freedoms and and uh you know an escape from tyranny but however there's a big difference between the physical nation state and the digital nation state where you know if you are born in america you are an american citizen whether you like it or not you were born you are an american citizen you know before you can even like have the concept of what a nation is uh because you know you're a baby and you don't know anything however with digital nations bitcoin and ethereum they're entirely opt-in and so like they will never have an any person in their constituency that doesn't want to be there which really changes the game when it comes to tribalism right because when something is an opt-in system it both generates pride and and uh you know loyalty because there's it's a non-coercive system however it also doesn't even need it anymore because of the way that these systems are grown and so the the point the question i'm trying to get to uh chris is when you compare and contrast uh the the model of you know the physical nation state versus the digital nation state and you involve invoke the lens of tribalism and how a digital nation state can scale to the entire globe without needing to consider the physical nation state even relevant where does tribalism come in when there is one single quote unquote digital nation that we have all opted into so that's an awesome question um the first thing i'll start with is um while i agree in the meat space that we've been born into you are just the member of one nation state the really cool thing with crypto networks is you can be a member of all the nation states or all these digital economies right um i heard you guys podcast with hasu and similar to him and i think similar to both of you i would consider myself a bitcoiner and an etherean and you know a member of dozens of other networks where i've been interacting or conversing or know the founders or you know some form of community engagement and then often asset ownership and so we're we've gone from you know monogamy with our nation state to um [Music] polyamorous if we want to use that um way of being with different digital economies and so to say oh you know because i was you know just a patriot to my one country i can only be a patriot um to one digital equivalent i i think actually loses the opportunity of what this movement provides right this movement provides us the ability to be a participant to vote with our feet to get involved and be interested in the things that we want to be interested in and not be relegated to land in in which we were born the other thing i'd add here and this goes back to the prior question as well is the tactics that you use as an underdog are unbecoming once you become a champion and that is you know the the underdog um you know can be boastful and gritty and you know hard-headed and all of that but once and and that's endearing it's like you know you go you go get them underdog but then if that underdog becomes a champion and is doing all of those things that's unbecoming it's like oh wow like you're really conceited and you're not very humble and you know why are you doing that right and so i think that when we when we look at these different crypto networks they do need to be gritty um getting up and running and it's a highly competitive environment and all of that but once you're at a certain escape velocity you are much better off being um you know having having open arms being very accepting absorbing people into you and we've actually seen this play out between bitcoin and ethereum um in a way bitcoin yes it is the champion but it has always kept this kind of like hardcore antagonistic kind of surface level reputation and i'm not talking solely from personal experience it's you know i get this question a lot of you know why are things so hostile or antagonistic or i just i don't get it versus ethereum which has been much more welcoming much less judgmental and you know ethereum's vision is a bit more multi-purpose and so there's more flexibility within it um but you know look at which system has you know 4x more developers it's ethereum um and then if you start to look at the network stats you know ethereum's starting to come on par with bitcoin even though it's half as old or if you look at you know the economic systems or the tokens ethereum is just dominating so ethereum has become the um king of the smart contract land and has chosen to you know be open to be accepting and that is bringing more and more and more people into the community and you know i'm still a fan of bitcoin bitcoin is still growing there's still good innovation going on but i think it's growing less than it would have um had it been more welcoming once it reached the champion stage yeah i you know i definitely resonate with that chris um one thing that i would say is i feel like i'm a i'm a patriot to a particular set of values right particularly bankless values replacing that that fat spot in the middle as you call it the kings with protocols i mean i think that's the basic idea of the sovereign individual and i worry sometimes that um back to your point you know the revolutionaries ultimately come to power and they become a lot more uh like the kings and the tyrants they tried to replace i worry a little bit about that in the the bitcoin network right um you know maybe these crypto banks become sort of the the new power structures in this world and we're back resembling something that we just left um that's really like why i think the um if for me certain networks have absolutely no interest like tron i i don't care about tron whatsoever because it doesn't align with my patriotic uh value system of going bankless and replacing kings with protocols um like what's your take on that what like why are you here what you know why wha what social contracts in these systems are important so i'm here and this goes back to the blank slate of state uh to help create a more fair effective and generative society um and each of those is a conversation in itself but you know the fairies really just um giving everyone a fair shot which the majority don't have right now and that kind of goes into the idea of putting capital in in everyone's hands um effective is it has some efficiency in it but you know it's um creating systems that do more with less um and hopefully with less environmental damage that that is a big one from my childhood and my formal schooling um and then the generative is really you know that that speaks to um i think the human mind and um the human organism is extremely generative and so if we operate with zero-sum thinking then we're actually missing the infinity of the universe missing the infinity of our minds and that's a huge shame and i want for everyone to be able to live in kind of this this generative state of mind and that's not currently available for even the majority so those things really bring me um or brought me to the space and have fired me up i think you know i started off when i first played around or got to know even the idea of bitcoin it was really just through tinkering on on the silk road in college with friends and just being like what is this thing and um i was actually more intrigued by the silk road at the time and then even two years later 2014 you know i more wanted to be a revolutionary and um you know it's just kind of fired up in my young 20s and now i think i recognize that all of these are you know turnings of the wheel um we start off as revolutionaries but all revolutions temper with time and we do a bit better um i think maybe one way of phrasing it is um i've never been more convinced that this technology is going to change a lot of the underpinnings of the way the world works i've also never been more humbled or accepting of the fact that we're going to get a lot of it really wrong and so long as we get more right than wrong we will do more quote unquote right than wrong but it's not um nothing is is ever the end-all-be-all and this is where you know i like the idea of revolution just being recurring evolutions um encrypt is a big one but you know even if we put all these systems in place perfectly then you know our kids or our grandkids they'll want to rebel against it because at that point it's the status quo and you can't make a name for yourself as a young kid if you're going in line with the status quo there's no leverage with that you're going to go do something different so you know the revolution swings towards another underdog so um a bunch of thoughts in there but i think the last thing i'd say as to why i'm here is it's just it's fascinating like there's no more interesting place to work in my opinion than in the crypto space oh no that i think that is echoed by by all of us here and uh one thing that i think is is true of of all of us here uh us three um you me ryan is we're all pretty like big thinkers right like we like to to try and hypothesize things in the macro view uh and and id8 and and daydream about the the future crypto economic sci-fi world that we think is coming david i just copy a lot of my thinking from chris honestly yeah let's be honest yeah um but when it comes to the rubber meeting the pavement and making real progress and change in people's lives mainly people outside of crypto right because like you know crypto's already changed my life it's already changed all of our lives like my the majority of my personal finance activity is on ethereum so like my life has already been changed but i'm one of the people that resonates with this industry and so of course it's going to change my life first my friends that care about sports or my mom who who's a boomer or the people just walking down the street what things what signs or or just flags or indicators do you look for when you are trying to find ways that crypto is meaningfully impacting the the average individual like what when when crypto actually does impact the world and the ways that we hope it to what do you think will happen first how will we see the indication of a crypto world actually manifesting by our through our peers so i think we're already seeing it with um the financial services sector that's booming um both between bitcoin and ethereum i um i wrote a piece recently called superior financial system that speaks to really how between bitcoin and ethereum we are creating something that will be featured complete with the existing financial system and i think you need um this system in place this this accounting and distribution system to then be able to build all other socio-political institutions and so this is the first installation really um and it's um you know global from day one it's much more resilient it's much more lower cost it's providing both new surf services and striving for feature completeness and maybe most importantly it all runs on the same data right i can go into competitors like xerion versus instadap and i have the exact same view of all my ethereum wallets and that's just so mind-bendingly superior to what we have in the existing siloed data systems that i think it's almost impossible for both users and entrepreneurs and developers to be attracted to the system over time so certainly you know keep an eye on the financial services first and that is why you know um of late there has been this boom of interest in in d5 i think you know from there i really want to see people earning their wages directly from these networks and making it such that you need as little capital as possible to get started earning in these networks because if we make the gate capital then you will only get people involved who already have capital and that's actually not solving one of the key problems that i would like to to see solved here and so if people are earning their wages earning their livelihood directly from these systems um in more human work ways so you know that could be working for aragon's court or for claros or for you know setting up mini validator systems where you borrow the capital from someone there are different things popping up i actually wanted to write a book called the hitchhiker's guide to crypto where it would be a book basically about how you could make a living from these networks really just with an internet connection and i realized we're not quite there yet there's not quite enough to write about um but i think the writing is on the wall and we need to see more of that you combine earning wages so your you know day-to-day month-to-month livelihood within you know your investments and your basis of wealth in these systems i think you'll start to see and we already are seeing large wealth transfers um it's kind of like the new settlers right the people that went west um from the east coast they struck out west the people on the east coast were kind of like i don't know what you're doing you're crazy that's too risky you're probably going to die um you know let's see what comes of it the people who went west you know some of them many of them did die um fortunately in crypto this is a digital migration and so our physical cells don't die even if we lose some of our assets but we are you know trotting the roads and creating the systems that will lead to large wealth transfers that will then bring more people in into the space and those people will be brought into the space both because of you know the the nature of the services i described earlier in terms of cost superior cost superiority and accessibility and resilience um but they'll also just be drawn by the allure of people that they knew um living better lives because they migrated to this world right we're extremely memetic and we are also by and large a society that is obsessed with novelty and so um at least with the way our brains work with with dopamine once we get the things that we wanted um the dopamine stops firing like dopamine is really just an aspirational chemical in our brains and so this is why a lot of people get you know bored within you know a job that they once always wanted or a relationship they once always wanted whatever it might be and people just consistently keep looking for the the new thing it's actually an evolutionary basis to keep us looking and surviving and iterating and reproducing and the reason i'm saying all of this is you know a lot of the meat space at least to me as a millennial and all the younger generations feels kind of old and outdated and not that interesting and so i want to go exist in the new stuff um and so this new stuff that crypto's creating is you know there's infinite white space to to innovate and build and earn from um and so i'm not um i've given a few points to to your question of you know what do we look for but i think that um and one of my troubles is maybe always going to philosophical or zoomed out but when i look at it from that that broader perspective it it feels inevitable to me that people migrate into this digital west chris you are speaking our language sir everything you just said we talk about that weekly in the podcast we call it going bankless there you go where you we like those words yeah we like those words and you know we're in you talk about memetic we it it's kind of we talk about you know slowly breaking up with your bank basically right and your existing money system but what you're also doing is like to you to your point you're kind of breaking up with the old economy for this new economy this new uh unsettled western economy that has infinite white space that might be the episode title david infinite white space love that you said that um so here's a question for the journeyers who are going out in uh this infinite white space they're they're going out west um so a question about all this defy growth that's going on right now so the these tokens are uh increasing wildly over the past you know two to three weeks i think there's a sort of an i guess not an existential question but an important question that people are asking which is does some of this growth flow back into eth i just had a conversation on twitter and somebody you know said like ethereum's going to be super successful but eth will remain at the same price you know maybe bitcoin or you know staple coins might become the reserve asset on ethereum you've tweeted some stuff out about this what's your take yeah so the the headline take is you know 2017 was one service within the financial services sector and that was capital formation and we all know what that did to eth and d5 is all services within the financial services sector um and so you know expect a multiple of the impact um now people will push back and say well you know 2017 was a leverage machine and that drove east higher and higher and higher i [Music] also think that um a lot of what we have going on right now has echoes of a leverage machine and [Music] there will no doubt be booms and bus and that is why it is still the wild west but i see it as a much more efficient leverage machine than efficient and adaptive than we have in the meat space because the meat space has a hard time you know taking um you know real uh asset valuations and liquidating people quickly and there's all these legal contracts and there's all this kind of muck that that gets in the way whereas eth's leverage machines are you know really fast really snappy can be you know vicious on the way up and down um and i guess the way i see it is you know that is going to fuel that alone will will fuel a fair amount of heat growth but then um and i'm sure that makes some of the listeners queasy but then when i look at fundamentals um i was writing this down earlier i don't have it with me but i think you know top of mind ethereum is processing about double the number of transactions as bitcoin it's got i think um on par amount of daily active addresses it processes half the usd value um it's if you just keep going down the fundamentals heath is anywhere from half the fundamentals of bitcoin to you know 1 to 2x the fundamentals of bitcoin but it's valued at one seventh of bitcoin and so um just to make the math easy is let's say it was valued at one-sixth the value of bitcoin if all the fundamentals point to it even just being half as good at bitcoin at half as good as bitcoin you would expect it a repricing to cause east east's price to triple um relative to btc and so i think you know the fundamentals and what's going on here if i zoom out and remove myself from you know the different ideologies um ethereum is extremely strong you definitely wouldn't want to bet against it and then you know saying that oh this this isn't going to accrue or it only accrues to btc um i feel like that is um just kind of like i don't i don't know what the word is for it um it's inconsistent yeah it's inconsistent uh and so there's a lot here in terms of like the models that you could build um another thing that i would just uh say through these cycles is um btc is still the reserve asset of the space and then the ebtc pair so how east performs in btc terms is kind of the rallying cry for the long tail it's one of the things i look at um the most on a on a daily basis and if btc is outperforming then it gives a lot of life to long tail and basically you know in up trends in bullish environments risk appetite grows value flows into the long tail into these higher beta assets which tend to outperform btc um and then in the down cycles um a lot of those riskier assets as still being higher beta will underperform btc and so one of the kind of ironies here is i've seen and i'm sure you guys saw this too for a lot of the people of which there were many that joined in 2017 and that speculated in true coins um and just got absolutely destroyed i understand how painful you know that that process was but the the kind of irony here is they speculated in assets with zero fundamentals as opposed to um you know kind of sifting through the quality crypto assets out there through the bear market they've capitulated into being maximalists and basically at the bottom of the bear market they're they've been maybe the most maximum less because people like oh look btc is gaining on all these other things but the grand irony is that is the setup for all these other things to then massively outperform btc um and it's gonna happen like i don't um care what any maximalist says this kind of risk on risk app risk off appetite uh expands beyond crypto right like this is just kind of the nature of the beast and another thing to incorporate here is um bitcoin being the biggest and the most liquid crypto asset makes it the hardest to move um relative to a lot of the the long tail so let's say even half as much value flows into eth as btc eth will move more um and so i think everything is is set up at this point i forgot what the original question was but everything is is set up for a lot of these long tail assets including eth uh to outperform btc yeah that makes sense uh so it's like a subset of the question right is within that of within people who believe that right you're not talking to the maximus tribe right now you're talking to the bankless nation tribe what are you more bullish on more of these defy tokens or more eth it's almost a question of asset super classes too right are you more bullish on the the capital asset side or on the the story value you call it computational money side that eth is on right so i wrote a piece on middleware protocols in 2018 and at that time placeholder was building out i don't think we had the term d5 at the time um but was building out positions and things like puma or numerai or foam or a number of these um middleware protocols many of them financial built on top of ethereum and our thinking there was along the lines of what i was just saying in you know these down cycles a lot of these assets will underperform um they're you know quite attractive in terms of their evaluations and so you want to build those positions in the down cycle but then the other thing is they can migrate right if ethereum hits trouble those middleware protocols can go to other smart contract systems or can go multi-system right could be on ethereum and polkadot and cosmos or you know whatever the relevant construction and so the way we saw it is develop positions um in a lot of these assets which just as i was describing how eth performs relative to btc a lot of the erc20s will show the same dynamic relative to each so they'll underperform eth in a bear market but outperform eath in a bull market and so it's kind of like a leveraged eat portfolio i guess you could think of it um and so we did that for a while and then when you just got so cheap um we were buying for ourselves um in our in our personal accounts btc me i was really all that joel and i are allowed to hold that scale and when we were buying btc and eth for ourselves personally um you know we had that conversation with our lps because when we'd originally been raising um sorry i'm giving you guys more backstory here when we'd originally been raising we didn't think we would hold btc and eth we told our our lps our investors buy btc and e you know that's very low cost to do you can do that for yourselves that'll be your market beta and the placeholders fund one will be your alpha and that's all well and good in theory but the truth is with the nature of rlps most of which are large institutions they're not at a place yet where they can get over the hump on directly holding btc and eth and so when these assets when bcc and eth were so depressed um we had to buy them really um otherwise we wouldn't be doing our job for lps and we're fortunate to get very good prices on those and so now we have um you know the portfolio of um store value assets and the monies and so that would be uh bitcoin decred z cash ether and likely polka dot um and then we have you know these um a number of defy assets and kind of these middleware capital assets yeah that makes a lot of space and like a lot of sense and uh you know not to be tribal but uh chris i'm glad to have you in the ethos money tribe sir we've been talking about that for a while and the just the the usage of eth as a story value asset i think is um something that the market has not wrapped its head around because they are a bit backward facing and uh i mean let's face it uh ether lost 95 percent of its uh all-time high market value over the past two and a half years so it's understandable that people are feeling that way a little bit last question for you chris so uh in 2017 when i was trying to wrap my head around this you wrote uh an incredible book on crypto assets um if you were to write a book today you mentioned the hitchhiker's guide to defy um or to getting revenue in these bankless systems but uh would you write that book or what book would you write today if you had the time to write a book so i do i do like the idea of a very thin um kind of manual that and it would be the hijacker's guide and you know design such that you could hitchhike with it and wouldn't take up as much room in your backpack as crypto assets did um so you know that's been on my mind the blank slate of state essay could expand into its own book but interestingly i've been starting to kick around in my mind whether jack and i should do an update to crypto assets when i first published it i was so sick of the book and that whole process and it felt like in october that i never wanted to do it ever again and i never wanted to touch that material ever again um but now when i look at everything that's happened and all the different things that could be said i still think that that structure um is good i i might do a what and why and drop the how because professor says what why and how and the how was just like really dry and got dreary to write at the end but the what and the y are really important and have expanded so much like that book jack and i started writing it in november of 2016 and submitted the first draft end of march of 2017 march 31st 2017. so in the last three weeks of writing that book um you know march 10 2017 eth went to the moon because the winklevoss bitcoin etf was rejected and everything started popping off and then you know icos had been gaining steam ever since the dow but they really started to rip and so you know we've got one section in there on the wild west of icos but i think there's so much more that that could be added and layered in and now that going back to the start of this discussion the market is recognizing capital assets and um it's becoming less theoretical and more practical i think there's a lot more nuance that we could write about i think one of the struggles from where i sit and where you guys sit and you know the work that placeholder does is sometimes you feel like you're crazy um because you're talking about things that don't exist yet um and you can develop a lot of conviction in those things but sometimes it can take years for consensus to catch up with that and so the process of writing a book is so kind of high stakes that i would want to make sure that you know things that i'm writing about aren't five years into the future but more you know two to three years in the future such that with the lifespan of the book and also giving me the energy and you know kind of conviction to write it i know that it's not gonna you know come out looking like crazy talk for five years but more you know it's relevant within all of it's relevant within a year or two or three um so we'll see hopefully um jack and i get another version out would you guys i mean i'm curious would you would it be interesting to you guys to have quick assets become kind of this um legacy where there's you know v2 and v3 and b4 or would you prefer new books oh so i'll i'll speak first maybe dave has an opinion on this different opinion on this but uh i would say it would be incredible to have this updated in every market cycle sir so like 2017 uh for it to come out at that time was a perfect time to onboard an entire wave and onboard them in a responsible way is what you did with that book so it was it was very much about valuation how to think about the space and giving them the history it feels like now if this is 2016 again as we've been talking about it'd be a great time to onboard that next wave so you know one every four years sounds about right to me it is about that time yeah i think i think if we had our way chris we would uh just have you producing endless amounts of writing and we would consume it all i think if i had my way i i would ask for a expanded version of blank slate of state just because that's what personally interests me but i wouldn't be too picky either way awesome well thanks you guys chris uh we can talk to you all day man it's been great to have you on the bankless podcast thank you for coming on sir this has been fantastic it's been really fun thanks for all the the good conversation and good questions you guys got me lost in thought a number of times with the richness of the questions well it's fantastic fantastic that is absolutely our goal so thanks for entertaining us hopefully our listeners got lost in thought too so listeners action items for today what we're going to do is include all of our favorite uh of chris's writing in the show notes so make sure you check that out some of our favorite articles a lot of these articles as i said have been influential in the things that david and i have written and the bankless community has consumed also follow chris on twitter we will include his twitter handle fantastic insights always uh there and then listen to you episode four so if you're curious about what chris was talking about with the asset super classes earlier in the conversation in episode four we sort of lay that out and talk about ethan as a triple point asset so do that and then lastly you got to subscribe to youtube for our new state of the nation show david why should they subscribe you should subscribe just because it is a much easier faster way of getting information right into your brain this is a podcast so you are listening to it but the state of the nation is a videocast where you get to look at the data look at the tweets look at the graphs that we are also looking at as we kind of digest it and analyze them so it's a faster way to get new information into your brain and it's always updating right so every new week there is a new state of the nation and so we go through what that state is uh on our weekly youtube state of the nation and dave and i get to look at each other too while we're doing it which is kind of a unique experience we don't do that on podcasts all right guys risks and disclaimers eth of course is risky none of this is financial advice crypto is risky bitcoin is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you have joined us on the journey thanks a lot [Music] you
