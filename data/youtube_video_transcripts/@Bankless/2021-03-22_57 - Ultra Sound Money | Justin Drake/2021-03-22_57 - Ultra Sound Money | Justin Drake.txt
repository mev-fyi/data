[Music] welcome to banknotes where we explore the frontier internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david that's got to be the most bullish episode on ether we've ever had and that's saying a lot ultra that is saying a lot ultrasound money with justin drake justin drake is a researcher at the ethereum foundation he also was the guy that led the charge behind one of our previous most beloved episodes ever which is moon math the bull case for cryptography where in that episode justin drake took us through the innovations behind cryptography and made the claim that the current state of cryptoeconomic systems design basically bitcoin and ethereum are just in the very primitive ages of the deployment of cryptography this is a very similar episode but instead of talking about cryptography we're talking about economics specifically crypto economics and justin again makes the claim that we are just in the very beginnings of economic innovation when it comes to crypto economics and he takes us through his vision of the future his vision for the future of ethereum and the future of ether the asset and what can it really do when we apply all of the research and development that we've done ever since 2009 when bitcoin got started you know i think historically david there's been a little bit of a taboo in ethereum culture to talk about price so we use terms like like economic security and to be clear we're not we weren't talking about the price of ether on it on a given day in this episode but the monetary premium of the asset ether as a store of value net in the assets relationship to the economic security of ethereum i've actually never heard uh an ethereum research researcher or someone very plugged into the protocol design talk about it in this way so for me honestly david this is kind of like a dream episode it's one thing for listeners to hear ethereum bulls like you and i talk about this it's another to to hear from somebody who's actually designing the engine and designing that engine with the intent to produce what to produce a sound money to produce an ultrasound money this to me was like really a a fantastic episode like a dream episode honestly i've been waiting for an engineer a developer uh somebody who's working on the engine of ethereum to to come out and say this and you know the takeaway here is uh hold your hat folks like ethereum is coming ether the asset is coming for a store of value position in this ecosystem it's like we've been saying from day one on bankless david ether is money justin drake to me is a true cypherpunk he is really leading the charge of what the legacy of the cypherpunks have left behind where they maximized innovation in cryptography it exploded onto the scene cryptography split it on the scene with the emergence of bitcoin and crypto economics justin is a cypherpunk 2.0 because it's now not just cryptography it's cryptoeconomics and to me he's the absolute absolute expert on crypto economics and what crypto economics can do there were so many takeaways in this episode and there's just too many to list here i think the one takeaway that i do want to mention is that there has already been this sound money culture in ethereum it's just been hidden under behind the scenes and with the emergence of things like eip1559 and the reduction of ether issuance in proof-of-stake we actually get to talk about how that creates a sound money in ethereum and the beneficial tailwinds that that creates for ethereum and also for the world if the world can have the hardest most sound money possible it deserves that in ether according to justin drake is ultra sound money i would make the statement guys that you don't know ethereum and you certainly don't know ethi asset until you've listened to this episode because ethi asset is going to be defined in ethereum the network is going to be defined by the next engine upgrade it's receiving and it's receiving that economic engine upgrade now with proof of stake that's just been live for a few months eip 1559 and the eventual merge and ending of proof of work so if you want to understand the future of ethereum if you want to understand ethi asset you have to listen to this episode is well worth your time the other thing i would say is you might not understand bitcoin the asset or bitcoin the network until you listen to this episode and that's the hidden spice you take david should we get right into the episode first we want to tell you about our sponsors that made this episode possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got

had justin on for one of our most popular episodes one of my favorite episodes i think david would agree to my favorite as well moon math and the bull case for cryptography the last episode really focused on cryptography we touched the economics but we didn't get into it in detail i think in this episode we are about to so think of this as the sister episode to the moon math bowl case for cryptography episode justin drake it is fantastic to have you how are you doing today sir i'm doing great thanks for having me again so this being sort of the sequel the sister episode i felt like the theme from the previous episode was cryptography is really in the stone age and we have so much further to take it and they're all of these cryptographic innovations that are coming down the pike that we are going to incorporate in crypto going to incorporate uh in ethereum but we didn't talk as much about economics is there more to talk about on the economic side here right i mean that that's a legit legitimate question to ask you know we have you know these huge improvements in cryptography do we also have huge improvements in economics and i'd argue that we're still also in the stone age when it comes to economics and in a way i mean that literally right because we're in still in the age of gold driven economics so and gold you can think of it as a as a stone as a shiny rock um so bitcoin has taken the the approach to mimic gold and the economics of gold as much as possible um so you can think of it as skeuomorphic economic design it tries to copy the real world this is very similar to what happened in in the early days of the internet when people were designing websites they had these these buttons which looked like actual press buttons but when you take a clean slate approach you have new possibilities and when you really embrace the digital aspect of trustless sound money actually you can really transcend to a large extent um this this stone age economics um and you know when preparing this that pos this this podcast i actually realized that the the gap between the economics of of bitcoin which is kind of stone age economics and kind of the the future of ethereum which you can think of as sci-fi economics is is enormous um it's 10 100 x 1 000 x um you know better so yeah i guess i'm excited to to dig into concretely what are the improvements of the economic system as a whole we have various components that are individually improved so for example we have an improved consensus engine where we go from proof of work to proof of stake you know we have an improved uh fee mechanism where we um go from this first auction mechanism to this um you know eip1559 mechanism um and you know we also have various other economic innovations um such as the the issuance policy and all these things together in this latest design really come together really really nicely um and so in the same way that bitcoin is engineered money and it's engineered to be as close as possible to to to gold we can ask ourselves what if we push forward this this economic engineering as far as we can and we have 12 years of um of i guess innovation that are that are compounding um and when you compare uh what we have to what we all have um the gap is is enormous but justin our last episode with you was all about the bowl case for cryptography and the claim was that cryptographic hashes and signatures were really just like the stone and the fire when it comes to cryptography and there's so much more left to tap into so much more potential to tap into and i think we're about to do this again with economics where you're you're claiming that with economics you the progress of humanity and innovation behind cryptonomics is just at the very beginning yet i want to i want to plant an idea an image in the listeners heads where while innovation and economics can progress economics as a discipline still follows the same patterns and this is the patterns that humans have come to to understand they're in with every economic system there is an economic engine the uh the engine of an economy is a metaphor that we hear out both inside and outside of crypto and what i think we're going to lead us through is a metaphor that we're going to keep on returning to is how economies are engines and the design of said engine impacts the economy and also the fuel that we put into this engine impacts the economy and so as a frame of reference you're going to take us through all of these different ways in this comparison makes sense so to kick this off i want to throw the ball back into your court maybe you can elaborate on that metaphor how is an economy like an engine and where does this conversation start when it gets turned to ethereum and cryptography and cryptoeconomics yeah so i actually stole an idea from michael saylor so michael saylor loves to say that bitcoin is this economic battery that can be charged with kind of monetary premium um and i i kind of agree you know with with this metaphor and i was thinking to myself okay what if we extend this energy metaphor to the other pieces of the blockchain not just the battery so i guess we have um you know monetary energy which you can think of as kind of electric energy and this monetary energy is stored in battery cells right so you can think of one token for example one bitcoin or one ether as being a battery cell that can store this this this energy and i guess um if you look at the the battery there's kind of two um two separate ways to to charge and discharge the individual energy battery cells so the the first one is kind of a exogenous process so you have the market with supply and demand that will pump in energy into the battery and the battery will will store this energy into the battery cells and the reverse can happen you know you can sell um and and remove um energy from from from the battery so buying the buying the token is charging the the token selling the token is discharging the token right exactly i can pay you to do push-ups right i'll pay you like one ether to do a hundred push-ups and i can pay you to do that labor i can pay you to do that work and that is how the the stored energy in an asset in gold bitcoin ether can turn into real labor real work in the real world exactly yes and like one of the things that we're trying to design for is the concept of soundness so what does soundness mean it means that the energy storage um is um hold over time right so in 10 years time i still want the energy to be stored in those battery cells i don't want that basically the battery cells to to leak um and so that's that's one way um the where you can charge and discharge the the battery is just by buying and selling um by the way when we're talking about energy here justin right the metaphor that michael saylor used is the same metaphor that you're using energy here is value specifically it's it's monetary value we're not talking about like proof of work energy or anything like that we're actually talking about value being the monetary engine of these crypto economic systems correct yeah that is correct i mean you there's a there's various analogies that are rooted in engineering when we talk about money and value you know you can think of it in terms of fluid mechanics fluid dynamics sorry where you have fluids you know we all we talk about liquidity right and liquidity pools and things like that and you can also use heat kind of as you know like heat travels from one place to another um but yeah i guess for today's podcast we can use energy as the metaphor for monetary value as you say exactly yeah we've got the energy we've got the battery cells take us further into this metaphor right so there's a another mechanism which is basically issuance and burn so here um what you're what you're doing is that you you're creating new tokens so new battery cells or you're removing battery cells and here you're not really charging or discharging the battery as a whole like the amount of energy stays the same but you're redistributing things so when you add for example battery cells you create new tokens um the kind of these these battery cells have the property where they all want to have the same value right because they're fungible so you you print new containers these battery cells and then kind of you have this flow of of monetary energy from the from the existing battery cells into the new ones until they all have the same um value and it's the exact same mechanism when you're burning from the point of view of of a bitcoin you know issuance is the root of all evil uh in the sense that when you create these uh these new tokens well it's kind of leaking um from the existing tokens um and so as a as a bitcoin holder you don't like that because you're being diluted your energy is getting stolen from you right because because big new bitcoins or new dollars or new ether are completely fungible with old bitcoins old ether the issuance is just stealing that energy it's not creating new energy it's just tapping into the energy that already exists in these other monetary assets exactly right yep now that is one component which is the battery and then there's kind of another extremely important component in the world of blockchains and to continue this energy metaphor think of an electric engine the engine so specifically the engine is going to be a metaphor for our consensus engine the consensus engine takes in economic fuel right and that could be in the form of issuance right which is a way um to basically discharge individual cells and and and take energy and and give it to the engine or you could feed this engine with another type of fuel which is the transaction fees and then the whole point of this economic engine is that as an output is going to give you economic security and this economic security which is output is meant to secure the the whole system um and so when when you look at the at the engine you know you can look at various things like how powerful is my engine like how much economic security is are you giving me or you could look at how fuel efficient is it like how much power do i get per unit of fuel or you could ask yourself okay what is the best type of fuel to feed into my engine is there like one type of fuel which is better than the other or you could look at um what is the ratio of the the load that under which the the the engine is and the the power that it has right so if you have a an economic engine of of of power let's say 10 billion dollars it takes 10 you have 10 billion dollars of economic security meaning that it costs 10 billion dollars to attack the system but your your load is going to be the economy living on top of that so if we look at bitcoin for example it's a one trillion dollar um you know system it has five billion dollars of economic security so the the load to power ratio is going to be 200 1 trillion divided by 5 billion and then you can do you can look at all sorts of metrics like that about your engine and try and understand okay what are the properties of my engine um and it turns out that if you take your engine and you know which is proof of work and you replace it with proof of stake then pretty much on every single metric you get an improvement and it's not just like a a tiny improvement like 10 or 20 or 50 it's 10x better 100x better or in some cases a thousand times better and more so we're going to dig into all of these components in in more depth but just to kind of establish these components in as part of the the intro so the engine as you said is the consensus mechanism and so bitcoin of course uses proof of work ethereum in the future will use proof of stake we're going to get into that and you also mentioned the fuel is basically it's economic fuel right this is not gasoline or petrol this is a fuel that comes from two sources generally in a cryptoeconomic system issuance is the first source of economic power economic energy and transaction fees are the second source but let me ask a question about the the engine so an electric car engine produces something right that is motion it it enables the the car to go from point a to point b um what does a crypto engine for a layer one like bitcoin or ethereum produce is this consensus is this or more abstractly does it produce trust right what is the output of the engine right okay so the output is what i call economic security in the context of consensus so the way that i kind of think of it um kind of graphically is that imagine you have like some sort of um star wars or star trek kind of shield around your spaceship you know it's providing security it's like your economic shield and just to be very concrete in bitcoin it's it's hash rate right so basically what is the dollar equivalent to your hash rate so in bitcoin the hash rate is 150 million tera hashes per second okay and each terror hash if you were to go buy you know a mining hardware each terror hash will cost you about 30 bucks so you have roughly 4.5 billion dollars of economic security so if you want to overthrow the bitcoin system if you want to perform a 51 attack you're gonna have to buy 4.5 billion dollars of um you know mining hardware in order to to get that hash rate um and so you can denominate economic security in dollar terms like it's basically your your your moat your defense mode um and for for ethereum proof of stake um your security economic security is also denominated in dollars and the way you you you get the number is basically by by looking at the total amount of if staked so right now we have um 3.5 million if um at current prices this is over six billion dollars so um you know even today um um you know this very nascent uh proof of stake system in the theorem has more economic security um than than bitcoin so justin there there's an interaction here between the energy and the engine right and this is the difference that we that we often talk about on the bankless podcast is there's bitcoin btc the asset and then there's bitcoin the network right there's ether the money and then there's ethereum the economy and then there's the ethereum consensus mechanism which is proof of stake and all of these things interact they're all a part of a con a composed system and the the viability what we're going to get to is the viability of the engine and the efficiency of the engine ultimately impacts the money-ness that goes into the engine right because one the strength of one impacts the strengths of other others and i before we get into the differences between like how cryptoeconomics is different than gold economics because there are important differences there i want to ask you about like well when all of these things get integrated when all of these composed systems and we we maximize the benefits and efficiencies of all of these systems to generate this maximally efficient engine that is what gets gives monetary premium can you talk about that um i mean so so one of the the things you mentioned is that all of this is a system right um and it's important to consider them in in combination so um for for gold kind of one of the very nice things is that the the engine you get for free right the engine is is mother nature as the laws of physics the laws of physics kind of give us for free censorship resistance it gives us for free no double spend and it gives us for free no you know no affordability and things like that unfortunately in the world of of blockchains um your consensus engine you just have to keep feeding it you don't get it for free you have to pay for it now if you look at the economic design of of bitcoin especially in the long term when there's there's no more issuance um basically um what it's done is that it's it's it's kind of made a mistake right and the mistake is that it's it's it kind of um it tried to mimic gold a little bit too much and so what it's done is that it's it's basically isolated segregated the the battery and um and the engine so today the the the the battery the the engine is is connected to to to the battery and so that's that's providing this constant source of fuel that will give you economic security but in the long term you know this link is severed so there's this there's two separate systems there's the battery and then the engine and then the risk is that you have this amazing battery which is the the btc asset with like 21 million bitcoin guaranteed but you know it's it's the the the real liability is the is the engine here um now going back to to your question around um i think it's a question around reflexivity which is basically um you know what it what is going to be used as a store of value and it's kind of it really it kind of starts in my opinion at the technology level right because once you have the best candidates for something that could be a good store of value it could have very nice properties it could be digital it could be programmable it could be scarce it could be secure all of these things then kind of people start using it as a store value and then it be you know you have this reflexivity going on um and so you know in the same way that we've seen um you know the stores of value radically changed over time you know we've had you know seashells and you know salt and you know yapstones and and gold and bitcoin i i think we're at the cusp of something new here where technologically speaking we have something which is radically better than what we have before and then that is kind of this uh weird reflexive loop that kind of discharges the previous um stored value and then and then charges the the other store value the successor so can let's talk about that for for a minute because that is a it's a it's a it's a property and i'm going to use the term magical because it's almost a magical property that some assets some scarce assets get to have which is this magical meme power of monetary premium it's the thing that a bunch of humans have collectively decided could be valuable and that they should store their wealth in and it's reflexive as you say is because the best store of value is um the store of value that community the entire world comes to consensus on effectively so when you're betting on a future store of values you're kind of betting that um society and culture and communities around the world will choose to store their wealth into one thing so not everything can have this right you mentioned like this this history of money uh where gold had that throughout throughout the centuries throughout the ages there were times where silver had it but assets like copper never had strong monetary premium or it was like smashed by some of these harder more sound assets you also mentioned justin that um the interesting thing about gold is it's imbued with this economic security um due to physics right the birth of a explosion of a star a supernova has created gold on the periodic table of elements and that is its security budget for its lifetime it doesn't have to keep repaying it whereas bitcoin does bitcoin has to keep repaying its economic security keep feeding the engine as it will or else it will no longer work so um we're we're drawing these kind of comparisons i think but can you talk a little bit more about this mystical property this magic meme energy behind a monetary premium so where does it come from people still don't really understand that justin like it we know that it's in gold but we've grown up with gold being a story of values before our lifetime we see it maybe emerging in bitcoin we see elements of it emerging in eth what is this monetary premium thing where's the magic here right so if you were to use kind of economic terms i'd say that um you know it's all about the shelling point as you said there's coordination involved you have various candidates for stores of values and you want to look at their merits and you want to have some sort of mechanism for society to agree on one of them to call coordinates of one of them and um basically you want to you want to have um the winner you know the the natural processes for the winner to stand out in in some way and the fact that it stands out means that it becomes the shelling point and then that becomes the the place where everyone you know congregates um and um you know there's there's various ways to achieve a shelling point right one could be like um you know simplicity security one could be like the lindy effect like how long has this thing existed um you know one could be you know how useful how useful is it this is where commodity monies came from right like the selling point was that the the money is useful already so you know it's a natural place for everyone to coordinate because they already had value and you know you can think of gold as being you know um commodity money to an extent right because you know gold has been used you know for jewelry but also for you know industrial use cases um and i think once we in the the digital world um you know you know there's there's many properties that are very important to have if you want to be that that shelling point where everyone congregates and where the narrative kind of um does it does its magic as you say um and like i think one of the big ones um is is program programmability and this is one of the the things that is a distinguisher between um you know bitcoin and ethereum but you know beyond that if you look purely at um you know economic considerations i think there's there's two of them the first one is economic security right so bitcoiners care very very deeply about security and for very very good reason you know they're paranoid you know it's part of the the culture and one of the amazing things is that from an economic security standpoint um ethereum is miles ahead than bitcoin so that's kind of one check uh in the checklist that we have i guess another aspect for being a shelling point is for being an economic starting point is um economic efficiency right so um like how much how efficient is your system um you know going going back to the security like how fuel efficient it is um and this is gonna have real impact you know um on on security on on issuance and things like that um and it turns out again that um if ethereum is orders of magnitude 10 to 100 times uh more fuel efficient than than bitcoin and then when you combine these two things together economic security and economic efficiency then out pops kind of something amazing which is economic scarcity but not just the standard vanilla kind of cap supply economic scarcity but a new paradigm which i guess you could call ultrasound money right so if bitcoin is sound money because it has this cap supply um then thanks to all sorts of innovations you know that go really really deep um at the very surface layer you have you know ultrasound money and the idea here is that the the total supply is actually decreasing over time and this is actually somewhat similar to bitcoin in the long term so you know it's a natural process for people to lose their keys for example as they die you know if they haven't set up uh you know a proper inheritance mechanism and whatnot um then these coins could go could go missing so you know if you estimate that let's say um one in a thousand coins goes missing every year um then in roughly 30 years uh you know bitcoin is is going to become ultrasound in the sense that the the the amount of money bitcoin that is lost through natural mechanisms will outpace the inflation um this the issue and so um um i guess ethereum will be ultrasound kind of 30 years earlier and then bitcoin and it will be ultrasound by not just you know 0.1 but potentially much much more than that so i want to recap where we've gotten to uh so far and then we're going to get into the details about uh how this this comparison works out so um monetary energy which is the monetary asset the units bitcoin gold ether uh though that's the battery that's the fuel going into the system and gold has this privilege because it was birthed in supernovas right and there's no such thing as a supernova money printer that doesn't exist that's nonsensical yet when we talk about this realm of cryptoeconomics what you're saying is that just focusing on the battery side the energy side the value side of things is only half of the equation and if we really want to maximize what is the potential here we need to both have the best fuel possible the best energy possible the the best value possible but we also need the best economic engine because if we have a good fuel but a poor engine our our aggregate output is less and just focusing on one of these two things is missing the whole picture and so this is where i think justin you are particularly optimistic about researching both how to make the best value possible with also making the producing the best engine possible and it's really the aggregate of all of these systems that is what we are calling a new paradigm rather than skeuomorphic backwards design of replicating what we already know we are actually using innovation research and development to actually progress forward so i think at this point in the conversation i want to turn to the engine design so not talking about the the value or the fuel but instead talking about the system the engine that consumes that fuel and comparing and contrasting the efficiency of proof of work and proof of stake could you lead us into into that conversation yeah for sure um i mean i guess just before we do that i just want to add one more essential component it's actually three components in the system we have the battery we have the engine and then the third one is the solar panel okay so what does the solar panel do it's a way to convert one form of energy into another form of energy right so solar panels will convert solar energy into electricity and the metaphor here is um the the the fee market right so you have this transactional utility right people have a desire to um to transact and that translates into transaction fees and this this output of the solar panel um you know can be fed into the into the engine and this is how um this is how it it is right now with um with both bitcoin and ethereum proof of work um the the solar panel is connected to the the engine directly um and the solar panel captures the energy of the economy right there's a gdp behind bitcoin there's a gdp behind ethereum there's a gdp behind the united states the irs taxes that gdp you know gas fees on ethereum taxes that gdp bitcoin fees tax that gdp and injects it back into the system right exactly um so it's important to take into account the solar panel and i guess one of the the key innovations um that we have in the theorem is uh eip1559 and you can think of eip1559 as finding a way to basically use the output of that solar panel and connect it to the battery so that you're charging the battery so instead of connecting the output to the engine directly you're connecting it to to the battery and you know this this has very significant you know consequences in terms of security and i'll i i'll i guess we can we can talk about that um so i guess you know you're asking you know what are these characteristics of the engine can we go through them one by one and and try and compare and contrast uh proof of work and and and proof of work uh proof of stake so you know i already mentioned you know just in terms of of raw power what is the the the the power of the engine right bitcoin has 150 million terahertz per second 30 per terahash that's 4.5 billion ethereum has um about 6.5 um billion of economic security with the the e-fat stake um in the beacon chain in the beacon chain exactly right um i i just want to camp on that for one second justin because i'm not sure like everyone understands that so what you just did was you multiplied the value of all of the hash rate and you came up with a number because hashrate is essentially its capital it can be converted into units of value it can be converted into dollars and you compared that and you said what that's 4.5 billion or so or 5 billion 4.5 yeah let's say 5 billion 5 billion okay and then what you did was and that that that is essentially the economic security of bitcoin so if somebody wanted to attack bitcoin they would have to have what 51 of that 4.5 billion is that correct well let's assume that the 5 billion is honest they don't want to attack so you as an external attacker if you want to have fifty percent you need to match what's already there so you can okay to double the hash rate need to double the hash rate so i'd need to have like you know five billion or so of equivalent hash rate okay and and let's let's remind big bitcoin just like ethereum gives two security guarantees no double spends and no censorship right so that's why security is so important that's why we're talking about it now with ethereum you just use the number uh that is based on the amount of eath staked right now in what we call eat 2.0 right in the beacon chain essentially and the value of that is what six billion at this point in time right let's say six billion so it's six billion so what you're saying is already um you know post merge whatever that happens in ethereum ethereum as a economic network is already provides more economic security than bitcoin this is what i this is what you said this is what i just wanted to emphasize because i'm not sure people have fully wrapped their heads around that and understand that the ethereum network is potentially already more secure economically than the bitcoin network at least post merge once proof of stake is fully activated that's what you're saying right yes that's correct i mean someone might ask a very natural question which is what about in addition to the you know five billion dollars of mining hardware that you need to buy what about the electricity that you need to you know expand to perform the attacks it turns out that the electricity per day you know it is negligible it's like you know 10 million 20 minutes so if you're happy to pay you know 4.5 billion surely you can you can afford you know 20 billion 20 million um and you know like being able to do the attack just for you know one day or one week or one month or even a whole year um you know that that's that that's totally possible once you already made the investment of getting five billion dollars of of of hash rate so let's talk about let's talk about that the the engine then the horsepower so because because i think this is where you're leading to it's like the question in my mind after i hear that is okay how is that possible how is ethereum providing more economic security with with less total market cap it's like it's a lower value asset from a market cap perspective compared to to bitcoin so how is this even possible right um so i guess this goes this goes back to the kind of the next point um after we cover um economic securities economic efficiency right so it turns out that you know skipping ahead that ethereum is roughly you know 20 times more uh fuel efficient than than bitcoin so you know you get more bang for the buck um so in in ethereum um you know if you if you have one dollar fuel let's say you get you know 20 of of of security uh in bitcoin you put in one dollar fuel you get one dollar of economic security so um you know one of the reasons why even just out of the gate um ethereum is is more secure than bitcoin is is due to this efficiency which we can talk about uh later i guess i think an important point i want to bring up is the the way that this interacts the way that the engine interacts with the money is extremely salient here because with the ethereum economy ether which runs on ether and the bitcoin economy runs on bitcoin in it and when we were talking about how do you charge in a unit how do you make bitcoin have more value or how do you make ether have more value it's by buying it and and not selling it right so the ratio of buys to cells is how you charge the battery but if your economic engine of bitcoin requires 15 times as much value to achieve the same result as ethereum does be under proof of stake that means you have to discharge 15 times as much bitcoin versus ether right so you are selling because bitcoin miners receive bitcoins and then they sell them to pay for electricity and hardware and so as the as a result of the way that the bitcoin engine is designed it discharges 15 times faster the rate of value than the ethereum economic engine under proof of stake it it forcibly sells btc the asset on the secondary market which is like the battery of the the unit battery of bitcoin leaking because of the persistent selling did i get that right yes so if we assume that there's no transaction fees then it's exactly right let's assume that the engine is fully powered by the battery then you know for an equivalent amount of economic security the proof-of-work engine is drawing power 20 times more than the the um the proof-of-stake um engine and so you know you could i guess you could compare this a little bit you know to to um you know electric cars versus gasoline cars so if you want to do i don't know 100 miles you know it's going to cost you x x number of dollars to charge the battery into 100 miles if you're using electric car if you're using fuel car you're gonna have to buy you know 10x or whatever the number is the multiple is it just turns out that the the multiple between proof of work and proof of stake is 20. so even though right now bitcoin is kind of providing much more economic fuel to the engine than ethereum is actually providing is getting as a result less economic security um and you know one of the you know my projections if i were to look into the future um i i actually expect that the the ethereum economic engine to be at least 10 times larger than than than bitcoin and then you know one one of the reasons here is that one of the reasons here is that we're gonna have more people staking so for example um you know coinbase hasn't really launched yet you know they're gonna bring in let's say one million extra um ethereum to stake um and then that's going to to increase the power of the engine um and my expectation is that we'll get let's say 10 percent over ether or 20 percent of what we first taking and that's going to dramatically increase uh the economic security of the of the ethereum system and i guess another possibility is that the ratio of the of the price of of ife relative to the price of bitcoin you know will increase and if that happens you know that will also improve the relative uh size of these uh well the relative output power of these economic engines so justin that increased economic value or that increased efficiency means that the ethereum economy can secure more on top of it right so when we think about um all of the tokens all of the assets all of the in the future roll ups and layer twos that are secured on top of ethereum um you know that value has a certain dollar amount right there are 85 billion or so defy tokens out there uh right now there's 30 billion ish stable coins all of these things have economic value um but the ethereum base layer needs to be able to secure that economic value and this this goes to a concept i think you were talking about a little bit earlier you hinted at this load to power sort of ratio and i what i think you mean there is maybe you can explain it further is how much how how large of an economy can the base layer actually secure can you get into load to power and talk about that right exactly so the the load to power the load is kind of the economic load of the whole system the the whole economy that relies on this engine so for for bitcoin we have an economy of a size one trillion dollars and we have an engine economic security of of of five billion dollars so the ratio is is 200. um and you know the the greater the ratio the worse things are and the reason is that um the incentive for an attacker to attack the system is is greater right so he oh the attacker only needs to expand you know five billion dollars and they could potentially break a system of size one trillion dollars so really you want to be reducing that ratio as much as possible now i think the metaphor here is simply a truck towing something right so you have a car you have a vehicle it has torque it has power and then it also has a load that is pulling behind and if that load is too big in relation to the power of that engine that can cause misalignment or or misaligned incentives it will cause you know choking and um stalling you know the engine will stall it's not you know capable of of pulling the load it's not adequate for the amount of load and you know one of the the scary things with bitcoin is that the issuance is going to zero and if the transaction fees can't compensate for the reduction in issuance um then you know this this ratio is just going to get worse and worse and worse so you know let's imagine you know a success scenario for bitcoin let's say that it reaches the the market cap of gold let's say you know 12 12 trillion dollars um now if if there's no issuance it needs to get all of its its economic fuel from transaction fees now let's assume that um that you know every single transaction on average pays a hundred dollars in um in in transaction fees now there's there's only i think 120 million um transactions per year so you know that that gives us a a low to ratio of roughly a thousand to one right so over time even in like like very conservative uh estimates i i'm expecting the ratio to worsen from 200 to one up to a thousand to one um one of the the good news in in ethereum is that um like we i'm expecting let's say ten percent of all the eave sticks all the eve to be staking and so here it's very easy to calculate the ratio right because it's just going to be ten to one right so if you look at all the if out there um there's going to be ten times more if out there than there is eve staking so the ratio is ten to one but actually as as you as you said david we shouldn't just look at if because that's not the only thing that ethereum is securing it it's securing also all sorts of of defy and non-if assets and so you know let's let's let's make some sort of projections you know let's say that um d5 is 10 times as large as um the the ethereum um economy the eth economy then you know the ratio worsens to a hundred to one but it's still nowhere near the 1000 to one that that this this projection would give us so justin when you describe this this load to power concept and as david was talking about it i get this mental image of like a a pickup truck just trying to haul a massively large trailer and it gets to this hill and it just it just can't it's just not enough like throttle to be able to to make it up this this hillside or this mountain i can we talk about what actually happens so if bitcoin gets to a place where it has a thousand to one ratio in terms of the amount of value inside of it versus its economic security right um what what practically happens in a transaction so i we can i think see glimmers of this when you use uh lower economic security change uh chains like um bitcoins satoshi's vision is one i mean i think exchanges they they will sometimes take days or even weeks to confirm transactions from very low economic security chains is because they need all of those blocks to to come through before they'll they'll actually like certify that the the transaction is value and it is valid and can't be double spent is that sort of what we're talking about here is in in a bitcoin that is way overloaded here the transaction sp speeds will slow down or at least not transaction speeds maybe i should say confirmation times will slow down settlement assurances right exactly um it's actually worse than that um in the in the worst case so it you know let's imagine that that bitcoin becomes systemically relevant for the internet and the world right it's like let's say it's a 100 trillion dollar kind of asset um you know if you if you put yourself in the shoes of a of a government like like like china or the united states you think to yourself okay i have the power to manipulate the economy of the internet this 100 100 trillion dollar beast and i only have to spend what 10 billion dollars you know it's like it's like a no-brainer right i'm obviously going you know my military budget is like a hundred times that or you know a thousand times that um i'm obviously going to you know to to to spend that 10 billion dollars to to have control over this this world economy um so yeah if we want to look in terms of the the long-term success basically you should think of of the the load as being the the carrot kind of the incentive for the attacker the the bigger the load the more the more kind of value there is to potentially extract and steal and manipulate and do all sorts of of bad things um so yeah it's actually it's actually worse than just being conservative in terms of of confirmation times um you know it could just simply break the system um if if i mean it's actually shocking right that um there's only five billion dollars securing bitcoin like an uh uh a government like like china or the united states could definitely pull this off and and break bitcoin as it is today yeah i i think a lot of people don't realize this uh you know hey guys quick break in the action there's so much left that justin drake has to deliver about ether as sound money we go back to the conversation of ether as a monetary battery and eip1559 representing a recycling mechanism that captures that excess energy we also talk about the lasting impact of the combination of eip-1559 and proof-of-stake which justin projects out to have a huge efficiency upgrade to ether the asset the fuel that we put into ethereum according to justin because of these upgrades we get to recapture an equivalent amount of value of eth locked in d5 at today's rates except we get to get that value back into ether the asset every single year it's such a cool conversation and also we talk about ethereum culture or the layer zero of ethereum and how it's actually been a sound money culture this entire time we just didn't know it yet really interesting conversations we gotta take a quick break and talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted it's really a fantastic tool that lets you use ethereum for what it does best which is holding and managing your financial assets but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on unit swap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips but with monolith so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop go to monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa cards it is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics realize this uh you know i i want to draw another connection here because this is something that we've talked about on the bankless podcast and i think you're pointing uh a fine tip on when we brought on charlie noyes from from paradigm we talked about this this concept of a and a base layer like ethereum the importance of monetary premium right because monetary premium as we talked about earlier is sort of this this magic meme power uh if you are the underlying base asset is viewed as a store of value then it just gives you an insta boost to your economic security right and so we we we had kind of this this not a debate but a discussion about where like my take is kind of that the the winning d5 platform has to have the highest amount of economic security right in order to host the the 20x uh defy valuation that that you were just talking about justin right so at some level all layer one chains are in this competition for monetary premium and if you are trying to be a layer one chain and your base asset is not money right so i'll throw one out there uh love the cosmos ecosystem fantastic projects fantastic team atoms are not competing as a base money they're not competing as a as a base store of value like the project teams will tell you that um but if you're not you're at a disadvantage because there's a lower threshold of economic security that you can guarantee and settle on top of it is this a conclusion that you would draw as well from from the discussion so far that it's vitally important that a layer one asset base layer asset have a monetary premium in order for it to secure the most amount of economic activity on top you know absolutely um very well said um you know this is part of the the shedding point aspect where you have various options for what can be you know money and what can be stores of value um and you know as a community you know we're gonna go through the catalog and look at what is what has the best properties and security is going to be you know one of the very top of the list and if if your success scenario means having a low to uh to power ratio of a thousand or more then that's that's scary you know um because um you know let's let's say that that the ratio is thousand to one so let's say that your economy is is a hundred trillion dollars that means that your security is a hundred a hundred billion right a thousand times less um that's you know that that's still peanuts in the context of of a a government like like china or the us justin we were talking about this uh potential attack on bitcoin by a nation-state level actor but proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake offers another property too and that that is kind of the the property of uh being able to bounce back almost like an anti-fragile type property i believe vitalik has talked about this on the bankless podcast in the past a little bit can you talk about how a bitcoin proof-of-work type system would recover from such an attack versus ethereum and proof of stake right so this is one of the the places where the the the improvement between ethereum and bitcoin is not just 10x or 100x it's kind of infinity it's like it's like black and white zero to one so let's assume that there is an attack um some sort of um government does attack bitcoin well it turns out that it can permanently attack bitcoin it's kind of game over it's it's a it's a knockout um and the reason is that you can do what vitalik calls a spawn camp attack is that you can just repeatedly attack the system over and over and over again and like the key issue is that um with bitcoin you don't really know who is attacking you right like the the mining power is kind of anonymous but maybe even more fundamentally the other big problem is that even if you knew who was attacking you you have no way to defend yourself so you have no way to to kind of destroy that mining power but with with ethereum we have we have these two superpowers the first superpower is that every eve staker is identified so you have a you know a pub key um which identifies you as a as a as a staker and whenever you make an action whenever you make an attestation for example which is one of these votes in the context of proof of stake we know where this vote came from with crypto cryptographic you know um security hang on i just want to re rephrase that really quick when somebody mines a bitcoin block they publish it to a network but anyone can publish it but in proof of stake when you attest to a block that attestation comes from a specific address with a specific amount of eth in that address when you say identifying the person or we're not identifying well it's not this isn't kyc this isn't like naming a person this is just the stake which is where the security comes from comes from a very specific address which is not true with bitcoin bitcoin validation comes from miners which don't actually exist anywhere inside the bitcoin protocol it's just anyone can publish a block so just you could be a bitcoin miner and you could find a block and then you could send that that to me you could send me that information and i can publish that block but it's you still have the miners i just wanted to make that that clarifying point absolutely yeah there's no kyc involved this is just the the pseudo-anonymous identification that we have for example in in in bitcoin and ethereum with the um with the addresses right you hold some bitcoin but that doesn't mean that you have to do kyc to to hold bitcoin at this specific address um so i guess not only can we identify where the the economic security comes from but we have this other superpower in ethereum which is that we can slash so we can penalize so the idea of proof of stake is that you you put something at stake right you um which is if for example and if you do something bad we'll just remove that if so this would be the equivalent of setting on fire you know the the the bitcoin mining rigs um and so we actually have two separate types of slashing mechanisms we have what i guess you could call layer one slashing which is that within the protocol itself if you do something which is obviously wrong so for example if you do two conflicting votes two conflicting attestations then you know we have a mechanism to automatically slash you for doing that and that will deal with you know many of the worst attacks out there you know for example if an attacker tries to create two finalized blockchains which are inconsistent then we can prove mathematically that at least one third of the of the eve stake will get slashed so a very significant portion of the e4 gets slashed and then once you splash that kind of malicious if then as you said it's anti-fragile the the system is self-repairing because now there's less malicious folks and you know we're left with with the the the honest folks and um you know the people that were malicious got penalized and the people that were honest did not and by proxy were rewarded because it's reverse dilution it's the elimination of ether from the people that were bad and then therefore the people that were good own a larger percentage of the ether which means that the ethereum is moving into the hands of naturally moving into the hands of people that are good and honest right um and i guess if you want this when you look at the um economic game you know in context of game theory you can look at the game in two different ways you can look at it as kind of one game you know can the attacker break the system yes or no if you were to play the game once and then there's the notion of an iterated game which is what if you play the game multiple times um so you know for example imagine you're playing booker you could be one hand of poker and that would be this this one shot kind of game or you could play the you know a thousand hands of poker and you know when you have this iterated game you know things change because you could learn about your opponent you can mix things up and whatnot it turns out that for coin the the one-shot game is a knockout so you can't play you can't play the game anymore once you've been knocked out on the other hand with ethereum every time you get you get attacked you know that's pretty bad um you know i don't want to down downplay this so but um you know the the the system was was broken temporarily it was attacked um but it has this so you know for some period of time let's say a few days there will be chaos right because people won't know what is the real finalized change because there's these two inconsistent finance change but after you know the chaos settles um um a few days later the the system will be in a stronger position and now we can start again with the the second round of the game so let's say that the attacker wants to attack again right well now he needs to go acquire more if and then do the attack again and then get slashed again and every time you do that as you say the the um you know the amount of ethan circulation reduces and reduces and you can actually put a cap on the number of times that the system can be attacked so let's say for example that there's 10 percent of all eve that is staking and they're honest so they don't intend to attack the system well there's only you know nine times that the attacker could do the attack right because he will need to buy at least 10 million uh eve and then every time he does the attack he loses the 10 million eve and needs to rebuy another 10 million and there's only 90 million there so in the worst case scenario if vm will get attacked nine times um so that's a very nice property which i guess you could call engine repairability this engine if it does break and you know things happen in the real life uh at least you can repair it uh bitcoin the engine breaks you just scrap it and importantly under proof of stake if somebody if there's uh if there's a 100 million supply of ether and there's 10 uh 10 million ethers staked uh an attacker needs to match that with another 10 million ether but because of the nature of proof-of-stake and slashing we can punish that person so they better have gotten an equal amount of value off of that chaos that they created otherwise why would they do this but the important thing is like a there's only nine possible times that they could do this before the world runs out of ether but every time that they do this the value of ether on the secondary market goes up because this person bought 10 million ether and and then they deleted it and then they bought 10 million more and then they deleted it and so it actually becomes increasingly costly because the cost of ether goes up the value that you needed to sell to buy that ether keeps going up every time you try and do this so not only is there reducing ether available to you to attack the network it's also getting more expensive to purchase that ether exactly and not only do we have this anti-fragility at the iterated game level but we also have this anti-fragility property at the single single game level and the reason is okay you want to you want to acquire you know 10 million eve you know you buy your first million and then your second million is going to cost you more than your first million because the price gone up et cetera et cetera and this is actually the opposite of bitcoin bitcoin has economies of scale for the attacker the larger the attacker is um the cheaper he has to spend per terror hash per second in bitcoin you have a dis economy of scale the more effort you want to buy the more expensive it's going to get to you so let's say that in bitcoin your your apple right um if if you're going to manufacture you know 150 million tera hashes per second of of of hash rates you bet they're good they're gonna pay much less than thirty dollars right because the thirty dollars that's you know including like the profit margin from bitmain and including all sorts of inefficiencies but if apple were to do it you know maybe they'd only have to spend let's say you know two billion like one of the reasons for example is that apple has priority access to tsmc's leading node so tsmc is like um those the company taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company that produces art silicon for for the whole world and whenever you have a new node so for example three nanometer node that's um that's up apple has monopoly kind of access and they have um and every time you improve the node um you get better power efficiency so that your your your cost per terra hash um kind of um improves and you know there's all sorts of other economies of scale that you have when you when you attack bitcoin which is the exact opposite to ethereum where if you want to attack it you have this economies of scale from the point of view of the attacker so justin it just strikes me that the the reason bitcoin has never been attacked or ethereum on proof of work for that matter has never been attacked is because uh no one's tried like nation states just haven't tried that's the only reason i mean what you're saying i think is in the case of proof of work with bitcoin if i am a bad gov agency let's say i'm bad gov us uh i've got apple that's located within my jurisdiction i go i team up with apple i spend five billion or so on asic hardware that they manufacture for me and because i'm making such a large purchase they give me 20 off so thanks a lot guys it's you know less than four four billion now uh and then i go and i attack the bitcoin network and then this point about repairing the engine and anti-fragility with proof of work because i own all of those asics there's nothing there's no way for bitcoin to to recover using the same hashing algorithms is how i'm understanding it now what what happened what would happen though if bitcoin decided to just use a different hashing algorithms algorithm and like you know kill all of those asics we've seen monero switch around their their hashing algorithms in the past is that a path for them to to get out of this conundrum that bad gov us has caused yes um so actually i i simplified the situation a little bit when i said that bitcoin is a one shot game it's actually a two-shot game and the reason is that the first shot you kill the double shot to 56 a6 they then no longer worthwhile you move to a new proof-of-work system but what is this of work system going to be based on it necessarily has to be based on commodity hardware and by commodity hardware i mean something like gpus or or cpus um you know you can't go manufacture asics for another proof of work there is there just isn't enough time to to organize all of this um and and then the attacker he simply has to do the same thing but this time with commodity hardware so just buy sufficiently many gpus and then and then that's your second shot the second shot is the real knockout so it sounds like we really want bitcoin to be its maximum potential the only if it would be a much more radical change and it would probably have to be proof of stake yes so that is one option um to migrate to proof of stake i guess another option and this is something we discussed in the previous podcast is simply for bitcoin to use the ethereum blockchain as its base layer for security which is using proof of stake in a difference yes okay so justin i just just one point on this right because there is this we don't have to get into the to the concept of um strong like weak subjectivity right but one thing that bitcoiners will point out is that hey the great thing about bitcoin is that the the token the staking token which is asics plus energy of the bitcoin network is external to the system right so we can always restart it we just have to funnel more energy into it and more like like a hashing algorithm they see this as a virtue rather than a um you know a uh like a flaw in the engine design do you think do you think there is a virtue here in having the the economic token that powers the bitcoin system be sort of external be asic plus energy consumption is there any merit is there a trade-off here that we want to highlight yes so um you know as is you know almost always the case in engineering there are trade-offs there's things that you improve on and there's things that you have to to to give up um now we haven't gone through the whole list of advantages of proof-of-stake but let's let's jump ahead and look at the the trade-offs um from what i can tell this there's three different trade-offs one of them as you said is this notion of objectivity versus weak subjectivity um another one is the concept of of complexity of the your engine um and the the other one is this the distributive nature of bitcoin so i guess we could go through these traders one by one the first one which is the easiest to understand is the engine complexity so the the bitcoin proof of work is extremely simple it's so beautifully simple it's you could write pseudo code for it in like 10 lines of code um and that's that's an amazing property to have you know simplicity um you know unfortunately um you know ethereum is two orders of magnitude more complex than than proof of work so um you know you could write the the state transition function for the beacon chain in a thousand lines of code uh so you know that's roughly a hundred times more complexity if you measure complexity in terms of lines of code um then than bitcoin you know that's that's a real trade-off the good news is that i guess we've already paid the complexity cost right we've we've proved that it is possible to overcome this complexity we have four different uh production grade um you know securing the beacon chain right now and and this complexity is manageable and this is found in other places in engineering i mean a computer is what a hundred times more complicated than a calculator let's say right it's you know not necessarily a bad thing right that's a great point yeah there's an astounding amount of complexity you know in your iphone um you know millions of man hours have gone into designing iphones um yeah for sure um i guess it's just a necessary evil um to to to innovation another aspect is um kind of the fuel emissions so it turns out that there is one advantage of of proof-of-work in terms of the fuel emissions the engine emissions is that it's a forcing function for miners to sell their bitcoin and this has a it's a distributive kind of forcing function so this is great for distribution um and it's a property that the proof of stake doesn't have in the sense that if you're if you're um to become a staker you need to have eve to to start with and then that the eve stays with you i mean you kind of accrue if but you don't you're not forced to sell it um and and the reason you're not forced to sell it is because proof of stake is so efficient that you don't have to sell it to to pay your your bills you know your electricity bills and whatnot um i've heard one manifestation of this as uh a bitcoin maximalist or you know bitcoiners heavy proof of work will say proof of stake just installs a permanent plutocracy would be a way that that's been described right um i mean the the way that um the way that i see it is that we we kind of get the best of both worlds with proof of work and proof of stake in terms of distribution so we've we've had the five years you know probably six years of proof of work we've had plenty of distribution um and then you know this this hybrid approach where we after the distribution phase we move uh we move away from the distribution phase then yeah so that's the the second trade-off is the the distributive aspect and then the the final point which is the objectivity point and i put it at the end because it is a subtle point um so okay what is this objectivity all about and if we were to take the engine metaphor i think of it in terms of jump start ability okay right so the way the way that it works is that you have this master engine right which is meant to be replicated all around the world and when you sync up to the blockchain you kind of want you have your local copy of the engine and you want to to get to the same state as kind of the master state so you in a way you kind of want your your local copy to be jump started by the main engine now it turns out that for for bitcoin the length of the the jump lead the cable is is infinite you know you can go all the way from genesis so basically you could sink from genesis and you know you you'd get to the you'd still be able to sink to this um master engine even even though you started from genesis in ethereum you have a constraint on the length of the the jump starting leads you know these cables that you need to connect between the two engines it's limited to three months right so if you've been disconnected for more than three months then you you won't be able in a purely objective way to sync up to the engine what you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to ask a friend or ask a group of you know semi-trusted sources you know what is this what is the state of things and and then take that as a as an extra assumption that you have and so bitcoiners hate this because this is compromising with trust right um and uh and i would say that ethereans are more okay with this because it's in our opinion it's more pragmatic like i could probably find someone i trust who's got the state of aetherium where bitcoiners are like you always you always always always need to be verifiably going back to genesis and ethereums are like well you can just go find someone who who like that you can trust and download this date from them and this is the kind of the trade-off that we've made yeah and it turns out that if you look at the the the practice as opposed to the theory they're essentially equivalent and why are they equivalent the reason is that as a bitcoiner you do have some hidden sources of trust now for example one source of trust is when you go download the client you're not going to read every single line of code you're down you know you're trusting you know bitcoin.org or bitcoin.com whichever website you've downloaded the client from and you know you're also trusting um what i call the seed nodes right so the very first time you connect to the network to the peer-to-peer network you're gonna you're gonna connect to so-called bootstrap nodes or seed nodes um they're gonna allow you to connect to the broader system but if for for some reason your seed nodes are compromised then you're gonna be in a little you know fake universe that could be controlled by the attacker so there's there's various uh hidden trust assumptions in bitcoin which means that in practice we have weak certificate weak subjectivity anyway so it's on an equal footing in the from a practical standpoint all right justin i want to return that was we just went on a little bit of a detour talking about how these systems how these engines work i want to return back to the metaphor of a truck pulling a load up a hill right and the truck is the engine the load is the economy the fuel is the money that we put into this engine and there's different types of fuels can you walk us through that metaphor yes so as i mentioned there's two types of fuels there's fuel a which i'll call grade a because it's the best of the best in terms of for security is issuance so basically it's energy that's drawn from the battery and why is it grade a fuel it's great a fuel because it's predictable it's low volatility and you can set it to have a guaranteed minimum for security and then there's this great b fuel which is not so great you know unrefined fuel if you will which are the transaction fees and the this is energy that you receive from your solar panel and the energy from that you receive from the solar panel the transaction fees are unpredictable highly volatile possibly slash likely insufficient for security and even worse that transaction fees have this subtle property that they're stealable in the sense that if you have and decide we briefly talked about it in the last podcast but if you have um a a a block with transactions uh these transactions will pay transaction fees and the next miner is incentivized to steal those those those transactions and the associated fees as opposed to building on top of the block so that leads to chain instability because these fees can be stolen this is minor extractable value which you know bankless listeners may be already familiar with exactly yes um and you know there was this this episode i think with you know the finance chain when for example they they got hacked and you know there was like rumors that maybe you know binance would you know reveal the private keys associated to the hack and then you know there's an incentive for miners to basically rewind the hack and then give themselves the money um and you know basically stealing the fee um anyway hang on no i don't want to go into that so there were there was an episode where finance finance was hacked for like 3 000 bitcoins or something and there was it was like 15 million dollars my numbers might be off and there was a big conversation about how cz could public publicize the private keys to uh to the bitcoin address and that would instigate a minor competition to start building a new longest chain on the at the block of the moment that the bitcoins were stolen because the miners could go and and go and reclaim those stolen btc right so the the conversation and if there was 15 million dollars stolen and it would there was a three-day window for this to be an economically viable activity to do because at the end of three days it was going to cost more than 15 million dollars to go back three days and so there's a three-day window where there was this possible time where cz could publish the bitcoin private keys and then all of a sudden the game theory is on where the bitcoin miners are all in competition to go back to claim this block for themselves and take those btcs for the miners instead of the attackers right and this is a this is where the conversation about good fuel and bad fuel comes from where uh fees or or minor extractable values are highly volatile and not dependable versus issuance and if you don't have issuance that dwarfs fees then you're then your engine can be unstable exactly and actually you you're right so grade b you know i said transaction piece but it's actually more general than that it's as you said it's mev and you can it's actually different types of of grades of b like b plus and b minus and like you can say b plus is you know the transaction fees you know they're not so volatile but then you have the extr the extreme what i call spike volatility so every once in a while you have this huge spike which it would be the binance case you know you just have 3 000 bitcoin or whatever it was kind of as one big spike and that would be the b minus uh type of fuel uh which is the most explosive and most dangerous type of fuel and so you know one of the the questions you want to ask yourself as a designer economic designer for these blockchains is what kind of fields you want to put in your engine and you know obviously well it's obvious in hindsight but i guess it wasn't obvious what satoshi is you want to maximize the use of grade a fuel right and you want to minimize the use of grade b fuel for security and so what we're doing in the theorem is we're connecting the battery directly to well we're connecting the engine directly to the battery so that give us gives us this nice grade a fuel and then we have mev minimization techniques the you know the the main one being eip1559 where we take this beef grade b fuel and we we we destroy it you know we just don't want it to touch the engine you know it's it's it's it's actually a liability to have the the great b fuel and then bitcoin has taken the exact opposite approach which is we're gonna over time we're gonna exponentially decrease the amount of grade a fuel that we're giving to to our engine right the issuance is going to zero all the good stuff is going away for security and you know we're just going to hope that this great b fuel is going to be good enough uh to to power the engine um justin that's always been crazy to me because arguably actually right now all right thank you ryan you muted yourself on okay sorry start over yeah actually justin that's very curious to me too because arguably right now bitcoin has better grade a fuel than ethereum has because it has a stronger monetary premium it has a stronger narrative meme value right so its grade a fuel is worth more on a percentage basis than ethers grade a fuel and yet bitcoin is the network with this wonderful premium grade a fuel that is forsaking that and going to this far lower poorer quality grade b fuel and i i love that analogy you were talking about it's like solar panels right it's like solar panels on a cloudy day just like they don't work very well right and this is like solar panels on steroids this is as if when you have an episode like the binance one you're describing is if sun someday the sun is magically a hundred times stronger and like really gives you a ton of energy right so it's like solar panels for five seconds exactly wow so that's always been curious to me and not something that i think most bitcoiners um internally rationalize maybe that there's that that they're swapping out fuel for their economic engine mid-stream and what the hazards of that might be yeah i mean my mental analogy is imagine an electric car remove the battery who needs the battery to power the engine just put a solar panel like and then you know you drive through a tunnel and then the the car just sold or maybe you know as you said it's cloudy and you know you can only do 10 miles an hour um and this is something that has been you know predicted academically for bitcoin so for example there's you know this this paper that um that looks at the instability of the blockchain once you rely on transaction fees one of the the the the observations that they make is you know we have a dip in transaction fees for example during the weekend right so it what will happen is that during the weekend some miners would just not be profitable so they turn off their miners and then the block times you know become you know 20 minutes 30 minutes one hour block times and then you know doing doing uh peak hour hours i guess it would it would compensate you know with you know five minute block times or three minute block times um it would get really really funky very quickly i want to take these metaphors all the way to the very end and so we have we have two vehicles two engines towing two different loads right um and bitcoin does have a battery but it has a battery that it can't recharge because it only issues btc right it doesn't there is no long time issuance and so once this 21 million btc is completely issued the bitcoin battery is completely drained and it never gets recharged and so the solar panel for the bitcoin vehicle gets plugged right into the engine right and the bitcoin engine is completely subject to the whims of the bitcoin economy is bitcoin generating high fees today or is it generating low fees today and imagine like a truck going up a hill towing a load and it doesn't really know how much energy it's going to be able to receive like in a moment's notice like in the next mile and the next mile after that it just runs on transaction fees and if the transaction fees go into the engine then the engine can push it forward according to how much transaction fees there are but it doesn't have that sustainability that assurances that it's going to be able to get up that hill because transaction fees are volatile also if one block comes in with like 10 times as much transaction fees as the next the next block it can't actually imagine just like stomping on the gas pedal and then immediately releasing it like that's not how you get an engine to go up a hill like that's not sustainable and so what ethereum has done with putting this solar panel into the battery into the engine is it allows that volatility in in transaction fees to get filtered through the battery first and stored in the battery and then the battery trickles the energy at a sustainable rate at a dependable rate that we can count on within long-term assurances into the future and it's that battery that depresses and dampens the volatility in transaction fees and allows that ethereum the proof-of-stake engine of ethereum to consistently climb that that economic hill with its load how was that metaphor yeah absolutely the the the economic battery is um a dampener um of the of the energy i mean one of the things you said just a slight correction at the very beginning you you said that um when there's no more issuance the battery is fully depleted um it's not that it's fully depleted is that that you can't discharge it anymore so it's kind of the opposite in the sense that it becomes the perfect battery if you in in kind of an isolation in a vacuum it would be kind of an ideal um store value mechanism because there wouldn't be this leak in terms of issuance but the the problem is that you can't consider this battery in isolation you have to consider the whole system you know one thing that that strikes me justin is that people forget satoshi was an engine designer it's almost become like this narrative that suddenly like in the beginning there was bitcoin and it was perfect at the at the very outset and the engine was perfect and it was bestowed upon humanity right and then satoshi disappeared because it was finished right but the reality is satoshi was a crypto economic engine designer and this was his first kind of iteration of the engine model t it it it's kind of a model t i i in all of the i guess religious warfare and tribalism justin i think people forget that this is a human being designing an engine this is not gold that is an asset bestowed to humanity via nature this is an engine design absolutely right so this is economic engineering and you know the the progress of engineering generally speaking is is exponential um and you know 12 years is a lifetime especially in the blockchain world and as you said this was the very first design and you know it was heavily inspired by by gold and you know we have the skeuomorphic idea and i think satoshi used gold because that was the best the physical world could provide but once you enter this new paradigm of you know digital money then suddenly the design space increases dramatically and you know things happen that are totally unexpected like to give you another analogy of skeuomorphism in the d5 world is decentralized exchanges that would use an order book right the way that we have exchanges is with all the books so the way that you you do it on the blockchain is you try and try and build an order book on the blockchain turns out that's the utter failure that that doesn't work for for various reasons um well and then out of nowhere comes this new concept of a amms and this you know this innovation is is part of the this new design space that's been opened up um and one once you detach yourself from your your preconceptions in the way of the past then you can really open yourself to the world of possibilities that this new space offers so justin we are actually just getting started with the comparisons here because there's so much more to talk about and i think something that might blow people's minds is that ethereum doesn't have just one engine it has multiple engines and it can start up even more engines or power down engines can we talk about how ethereum has multiple engines yeah so this is um implementation diversity so it turns out that sometimes engines have have bugs um so um and this you know this has this happens to all blockchains it happened to bitcoin bitcoin has had various bugs ethereum had various bugs and one way to um hedge against these these bugs to protect yourself is to have multiple implementations and so um you know you can think of it as a as a helicopter right do you want a dual engine helicopter or do you want a single engine helicopter right i would i would want to fly on a dual engine helicopter if possible just in case the first engine has some sort of problem and in ethereum we have you know a four-way redundancy we have these four separate implementations four different languages four different you know teams in different parts of the world which is in stark contrast to basically the the the monopoly that bitcoin core has uh in in in bitcoin um and you know this is not only about bugs but you know this is also about all sorts of external pressures you know like bribing for example you know one possible attack scenario for the the us government is to give every uh bitcoin core developer 100 million dollars and to insert malicious code you know like the it would be um you know a possible kind of attack um there uh whereas in in the theorem we have you know more more diversity and more more robustness there and we've actually already experienced this in ethereum where one of our engines went down and thankfully we had a secondary engine to keep ethereum up and running can you talk about that scenario yeah absolutely so um in the earlier days of ethereum um there was a bug in in gef and geff just became unusable i think it was some sort of denial of service attack and had it not been for parity had it not been for this backup engine um you know the affirm network would have suffered a very extended downtime because it took a long time to fix the the root issue uh you know several days and that would have you know shattered the confidence in in ethereum in these very early days so yay diversity um i guess one kind of point here is that um the way that we've gone ahead with the um eve to protocol is that we've designed an imp a specification so this is kind of meant to be the the root of of trust in terms of what the design is and is meant to be maximally simple and readable and understandable and we've even gone as far as making the implementation executable so the the the specification sorry is itself code um and so that makes it easy for for implementers to coordinate around the this this this protocol in in bitcoin the way that it has evolved historically is that you have a bitcoin core that came out and it had various bugs and there was no specification so the only way that you could write an alternative implementation is number one you reverse engineer how this whole thing works and number two you need to be bug for bug compatible right because if you're not bug for bug compatible that's the possibility for a a consensus failure and this this this friction of not having a specification and having to adhere to every single bug that is in bitcoin and there's there's quite a few and you know subtleties um has has meant that we we haven't really seen an alternative to bitcoin coin bitcoin and we've actually also similarly how ethereum had its bugs that uh it experienced and then thankfully had a second client or or now in proof of proof-of-stake for clients uh bitcoin has also experienced uh a a fault in the bitcoin code a a a a breaking of the engine except it repaired that ng thankfully this happened very early in bitcoin's history i think in 2011 and maybe another one in 2013 my bitcoin history is it isn't too super sharp do you can you tell us what happened there yeah um i think it was before my time in bitcoin there was an overflow bug you know classic classic bug where you know you're storing a balance in some some number of bits like 64 bits or whatever and there's there's an overflow um and then you you kind of wrap around and what that means is that um you know someone was able to to craft a transaction which is essentially minted you know a huge amount of bitcoin out of nowhere like billions or trillions of of bitcoin because they they exploited that overflow um how did you how did this system rot get get past this problem yeah so you know it caused chaos for a few hours um i i don't know exactly how many hours but it was on the order of 12 hours or 24 hours so you know the bitcoin core developers were very fast and the mining you know ecosystem was you know had a rapid you know incident uh incidence response but you know they could have been a more subtle bug or there could have been many bugs that are triggered at the same time by an attacker or in and you know even even 12 hours of downtime is is is kind of uh unacceptable and and beyond the downtime that there's another issue which is that now you have um you have potentially two forks which are legitimate right um and you know there's this mantra in bitcoin that after six uh confirmations you know you have finality and so so you're happy but you know this is a way to basically bypass finality where by you know as an attacker let's say you do a one billion dollar transaction six six blocks go through the you know your counterparty gives you one dollars worth of assets and then you you know you trigger this attack and then you can revert the six blocks of finality um so yeah it is it is scary um and you know that's one of the reasons why we want um uh distribution i guess another aspect here is that in ethereum the way that we achieve finality is for two-thirds of the network to come to consensus on on state and so the ideal uh situation is where the stake uh the eve stake is equally distributed across the clients so for example 25 25 across all four clients so that if if um if there is a bug in in in one of the clients then that's insufficient to to reach the the two-thirds required to finalize a a faulty state on that note kind of a quick psa um it turns out that impractive in practice prism is has more than 50 percent of of the notes so if you're running prism you know please consider uh no longer running prism i guess this is nothing against prison per se but it's just too popular and it would be good if other clients were more popular one aspect i'd like to talk about this about is um i'm going to start that over uh one aspect i'd like to talk about with regards to all the client diversity and theorem is is there is more choice and more options for people to use and my my optimistic scenario is that all these clients will compete right you when you stake your ether to ethereum you need to choose a client and those clients want to be chosen and so they are competing to receive ether to put their power into ethereum right because power power goes into the ethereum economy via clients and clients attract ether to be staked via their clients so that they can power the system do you see um do you see these clients like and competition is supposed to be good for the consumer right so do you see these do you see this competition aspect being healthy for ethereum or do you perhaps seeing a convergence on maybe just one or two clients in the long term because of you know monolithic tendencies how do you see this playing out right so one of the advantages of competition or actually of diversity is that each client can try and cater for a different niche um so for example nimbus which is one of the clients they cater for very low power devices you know think mobile phones or raspberry pi's and you they can be the best at doing that and then you know you could have teku for example which is um geared towards like in um you know in industrial grade um you know staking and then you could have um maybe lighthouse which is geared towards you know the um the individual staker for example um i'm i'm hoping that you know they'll be able to find their that their niches and that they will get distribution that way um what you mentioned about competition is is correct though so if for example there's one client which is able to you know aggregate at the stations and include them on chain like much much better than the other clients then they when you're running this client as a validator you're gonna receive more rewards so there's an economic incentive for you to use that one client the good news is that um you know the clients awful clients are close to optimal in terms of um you know doing their duties and so they're all optimally receiving the rewards and we want to keep it that way all right guys so we are almost done talking about the design of the ethereum engine and the ethereum vehicle and of course when we stitch all of these things together we get something that's greater than the sum of the parts but we have two very quick parts that we want to run through first and that is the first being stealth and our our truck that is pulling up a load up a hill also needs to be stealthy because these systems these vehicles are supposed to be sovereign state level resistance and so stealth is a fantastic feature for vehicles to have that state level resistance think of think of the f 111 or 117 like nighthawk this is the first ever stealth fighter or all the investments that the us military is made into stealth vehicles we want our economy our vehicle our engine to also be stealthy um so justin how is the ethereum system how is the ethereum vehicle a stealth vehicle right um i guess that comes down to the the physical footprint right so to become an ethereum validator all you need really is ether which is you know purely in the digital world there's no physical footprint for that and then you need you know a raspberry pi and an internet connection and every all the the um the computational resources are very limited you know you need very little power very low computation very low bandwidth etc etc now this is in in stock contrast to bitcoin whereby if you want to be a miner you're going to be in a very very specific place you're going to be where electricity is cheap and you're gonna be consuming huge amounts of electricity which means they're gonna be you know um expanding a large amount of of heat and you're gonna need huge warehouses uh where you're gonna be housing these these mining rigs and you're most likely gonna be found in cold places like iceland and so this this physical footprint means that you're not at all stealthy right like the government can just show up at your door you know in iceland or wherever in china next to a dam where you have very cheap electricity and just you know confiscate your miners or or do things like that um whereas with ethereum you can just you know be anywhere in the world you know you could be behind a you know tall uh the tall network for um anonymity so you don't even leak your ip address um and you can just do it on the raspberry pi um and i guess if you look at um you know the the fight against my marijuana right so um if you if you're farming this stuff right you're you're you're going to be expending a lot of energy and you're going to be detectable by governments governments use the you know will analyze the electric grid to try and find these these marijuana farmers um and and you can also see them from space you can see them from satellite imagery and notably you can also see bit mains mining facilities in china from space right and so if we're talking about nation-state level resistance like if you can see them from space you can send a missile there i mean perhaps that's a crazy example but it's it's within the realm of possibility absolutely yeah you can't send a missile to an inferior mistake for which you don't even know the ip address right and even if you did know where the physical location of that little raspberry pi was or the validating node that's not where the ether is that's not where the security is the security doesn't actually exist in the physical world absolutely yeah so this is one of these advantages where it's hard to quantify it's hard to say this is 10 times better 100 times better it's just you know infinity times better and well actually maybe you could try and quantify so if you look for example at energy expenditure right so um you have um you know 1.5 million mining rigs each rig one one kilowatt um [Music] um and then in in comparison you have let's say 10 10 000 nodes each nodes consume let's say 100 watts so that's that's like like a thousand to one right so that's that's three orders of magnitude uh more stealthiness just in terms of the power consumption of the theorem proof of stake network relative to the bitcoin proof of work network all right justin so we have our efficient vehicle pulling the load up the hill but engines and systems can break down over time uh let's let's lead into this conversation how how can we make sure to have our engine not break down over time and what can we do about this right so i guess we want to try and look at engine degradation like how does the engine evolve over time as you use it now this is uh an aspect where bitcoin kind of the the bitcoin engine degrades extremely fast so roughly um you know every year one third of the mining hardware becomes obsolete and so you have to to remove it so basically um the the hash rate has this um life life time associated with it and then it needs to be it needs to be removed um and so as as you're running this engine the more you run it kind of in a way the more it's fighting itself and degrading on ethereum it's the exact opposite which is amazing it's negative degradation the engine becomes stronger the more it is used which is pretty amazing and one one reason is because of of the issuance right so the the issuance in proof-of-stake goes to the stakers and the stakers are naturally you know in the in the disposition to to to stake more right and so um the the ratio of the the staking power versus the non-staking if it grows over time because of this issuance you know this is one of the advantages of not being distributive um is that the the those who are ready to secure dfm network will grow power over time i guess another aspect is you know the transaction fees right the transaction fees are burnt and transaction fees come from non-staking if so that again kind of increases the ratio towards the the stake is and then the final thing is tip the tip is that part of the transaction fee which is not burnt and that's even more obvious you know the tip directly goes from non-staking e-fusers to the stakers who are the validators and collect these these non-burnt transaction fees this has always been to me the most elegant part about proof of stake because what proof of stake does is that it rewards bullishness it rewards the people who make proof of stake work right so the people that make proof of stake work are the people that believe in the asset that stake the asset and then proof-of-stake rewards those people in the asset that they stake and because we have shed the uh the inefficiencies the leakage of a of an engine that uh must uh take in transaction fees and uh  i lost that one and because we've shed the inefficiencies of a proof-of-work engine which must inherently sell the native asset into the market to pay for the upgrade costs of both the electricity and the engine instead we have just rewarded the people with the more of the asset that they already believe in right proof of stake rewards bullishness and what you were saying is like we we talked about the trade-offs behind distribution proof of stake is not a distribution mechanism it's a security mechanism and it puts more and more eth into the hands of the people that are willing to be offer security to ethereum and so there's this always the slight tilt in favor of the people that are going to provide security to ethereum and so anytime that any transaction is made on ethereum it always a little bit ends up in the hands of the people that are in most incentivized and most willing to protect the network and that to me is just perfect mechanism design because it aligns incentives behind the ethereum economy and the people that secure that ethereum economy which is east stakers do you know david it's almost the difference between like hiring mercenaries for your national security and your your army versus like hiring citizens who have a vested interest in the long-term benefit of the nation state that they're protecting who have who live in their own land and have something to lose if they lose if they mess up exactly right and this incentive alignment is not as strong in bitcoin right you don't have to be a bitcoin holder to be a bitcoin miner and actually we're starting to see this misalignment in the context of proof-of-work for eip1559 right we have miners saying i don't we don't want this and we we might you know do a show of force and we might even you know forcefully fork things and attack the system if it turned out that the the the miners were eave holders it's likely that they would have come to a different conclusion there right miners believe in silicon yet stakers believe in the asset right and so miners want to maximize their chips and stakers want to maximize the asset and it's over at the end of the day it's the value of the assets that powers the engine right it has nothing to do with the asic to me to me it's elegant so justin up to this point we've talked about the design of the engine and we've contrasted proof of work versus ethereum proof of stake we've also talked a lot about the efficiency of the engine but my sense is there's still more to talk about around economic efficiency of the engine what else do we need to understand about efficiency right so there's kind of two very key points for the economic efficiency the first one is around fuel efficiency how much security do you get per unit of fuel and here there's a very nice kind of metaphor so it turns out that all the inefficiencies of the proof-of-work engine mean that for every one dollar of economic security you need to spend every year one dollar of fuel you need to feed it one dollar so if you think of the economic security as um kind of being loaned to the protocol right so the miners are loaning their hardware to the protocol and the protocol receives economic security as to pay for this security the protocol in terms of apy for that loan it needs to pay a hundred percent apy which is insane um on the other hand with proof of stake um the um because you're dealing with with pure money it turns out that the apy is going to cost is going to match the cost of money right and what's the cost of money that you know three percent four percent five percent really a paradigm shift in terms of economic efficiency where instead of paying the principal you know every year if you have five billion dollars of security every year you need to spend five billion dollars to secure it because of the the electricity that you need to spend but also because of the hardware of obsolescence um on the other hand with with proof of stake you owe the protocol only needs to pay for the cost of money which is let's say it's five percent and that's 20x more efficient than proof of work and this goes back to the conversation about money right and if the bitcoin network needs to have all of this expenditure this this to meet its own expenditure requirements every single year what that does is that is battery leakage that's energy energy leakage out of the unit of of uh of a bitcoin unit because all the miners that depend on btc for revenue must sell btc to pay for bitcoin security and so they they sell btc to pay for electricity they sell btc to pay for new hardware and that is how the bitcoin network maintains itself in contrast in proof of stake stakers don't have to sell anything because staking it has been designed to be maximally efficient all you need is a raspberry pi and an internet connection and so that raspberry pi consumes some electricity maybe 50 a year that internet connection costs something but it's nothing to nothing in comparison to a turnover of asic chips and nothing compared to energy consumption and and so what we're saying is the cost of bitcoin security costs 5 billion and it costs 5 billion every single year but with proof of stake it's just the opportunity cost of capital and that goes back to what we were talking about about state proof of stake inherently rewarding people who are bullish ether the opportunity cost of capital for them for people who are bullish ether is nothing because there's no other asset in the world that they want more than the asset that they are staking and so in theory the opportunity cost of capital is almost nothing for them and so almost nothing is the cost of proof of stake if we are incentivizing bullishness on ether which is what proof-of-stake tends to do absolutely yeah you said it very well so let's talk about the the second piece here justin of economic efficiency that you hinted at what is that second piece right so the second piece is eip-1559 and the idea here is that if we have excess energy in the system let's not waste it on fuel that is not going to be useful for security right there's no point in overpaying for security um and instead we're just going to take the energy and charge the battery we have a system whereby the amount of fuel that we're giving is always the right amount we're not underpaying for security and jeopardizing security and we're not overpaying and jeopardizing efficiency and one of the amazing things is that when you when you burn you open up the possibility of actually reducing the total supply so the bitcoiners will often think of issuance at the root as the root of all evil but actually what they really mean is is the increase in the supply but it turns out that if you if you burn more than compensate for the issuance you have a reduction in supply and it doesn't matter that you have this issuance the um the the net result is still that your your economic battery sales will not leak and actually is the opposite they might um you know get charged over time as the burn is able to over compensate for the issuance when i when i wrote my article on eip1559 i think back in like 2019 the way that i described eip1559 is that the ethereum protocol is issuing a stock buyback every time a transaction is made right that burning is ethereum the protocol buying back its own ether and this is ethereum the protocol being a persistent buying pressure on ether and going back to the very beginning of this podcast we talked about the way that you charge a monetary unit is by buying it and bitcoin is is a charged monetary unit because everyone is buying it right now but if ethereum the protocol is the net buyer is a persistent net buyer of all ether that tracks the gdp of the ethereum economy and so there's the buyer of last result last resort every yeah it's there's always a buyer for ether and it's the ethereum protocol under an eip1559 paradigm and so ever anytime there's excess energy anytime the sun is so incredibly bright that the solar panel is picking up that energy and it's too much to use right now because we don't need it the truck is already moving up the hill towing its load at a steady clock of 60 miles an hour we don't want to go any faster we don't want to go any slower so let's capture that energy and put it into the battery put it back into the system and that system is ether the asset absolutely yeah and if you look at the net difference between you know what we're expanding today in transaction fees and which which goes towards basically you know buying um gpus and paying for the electricity bills you know it's on the order of you know 10 10 000 if per day um and you know once we we start burning that you know where the the net difference is going to be twice that right we're going to go from plus 10 000 to minus uh 10 000 so that's kind of a net you know 20 20 000. and when when you um when you look at current prices and you also take into account the the efficiency gains um from from removing proof of work um after the merge we're looking at you know 13 billion dollars per year roughly of of by pressure relative to what we have today so just to put that into perspective it's um it's greater than burning all the eave locked in defy every single year it's also the equivalent of of of of burning all the eve in the sorry equivalent of buying all the eve in the deposit contract and the and grayscale combined every single year so it's a it's a kind of a tsunami of it's a it's a huge shockwave in terms of the delta between what we have today which is a huge amount of cell pressure [Music] relative to what we'll have in the future which is a buy pressure now the reason why i'm i'm relatively confident that we're actually going to have a net buy pressure is because you can just look at the transactions today it turns out that if you annualize over over you know 365 days if you take a moving average um where um we have 6 000 efer per day in transaction fees so you can make an assumption that some some fraction of that is going to get burned so let's say 70 um and when you compare that to the to the issuance that's actually more than twice what you need in order to um to negate the the issuance um so yeah i'm relatively confident that um in the future we will enter this ultrasound state where the total amount of if in circulation will go down over time so let's talk about that all right because th this is almost the the climax of the entire episode um you mentioned this term ultrasound money of course bitcoin uh has famously called itself you sound to money but what you're referring to with ultrasound money is is something even the the next level above bitcoin something that has maybe negative issuance per year i i want to go to something that just is under appreciated in ethereum and i just want to make this statement then we'll talk about ultrasound money and that's this i think eth the asset is the single most unappreciated thing in the ethereum ecosystem like everything that you're talking about people forget that ether is a cryptocurrency uh they're very excited about ethereum the network and you'll get people who say things like i'm bullish ethereum the network but i'm not bullish on eth that from everything you've described makes absolutely no sense whatsoever because how can you be bullish on ethereum the economy or ethereum the network and not also be bullish on ether the asset when we're talking about these types of burn mechanisms when we're talking about these types of staking lock up mechanisms so let's let's round this out let's talk about this justin when you say ultrasound money this whole thing this whole engine has produced at the end of the day economic scarcity uh what are we talking about here what is ultrasound money right so you know at the way that this meme came about is was really a joke it was a play on the words the idea was that if bitcoin is sound money and it has cap supply then if you have a decreasing supply you must be ultrasound right and you know you can use the the the bat emoji to kind of represent the ultrasounds that come from from bats but um you know it turns out that this this meme is is much much much deeper right so one of the aspects that we've talked about at length is that um economic security on ethereum is much much higher than bitcoin and that contributes to this ultrasoundness um and and you know that contributes for example towards um ethereum becoming the selling point for a a global um world internet um currency i guess the other aspect is that if ethereum once we have eip1559 is an income generating asset so you can think of of it in terms of of profit and p p p e ratios so you know if you if we say that we have roughly 100 million ether and we're burning a million ether every year well that's kind of a p to p e ratio of of of a hundred so you know ethereum is in this really um advantageous position where it can do multiple things at the same time on the one hand it can act like a stock you know with a pe ratio of let's say a hundred and it can also act as kind of a store value with this magic meme energy stored within it and you know these things are are complementary right so the fact that we now have money that behaves like a stock with a p e ratio makes it more amenable to become a store of value because it it makes the shutting point even more potent i want to i want to rehash what you said a minute ago because i want to make sure that it lands with the listeners once we integrate all of the research and development that has gone on from the ethereum researchers about crypto economic system design once we improve our engine from proof of work to proof-of-stake it's much more efficient we don't need to put as much fuel into it which means we don't need to we need to we need to sell less ease to achieve the same result which is keeping the eath battery charged so we we go from having to issue you know two eats per block to much much less than that point one each per block we bring the issuance down and so therefore ether becomes much harder then we add an eip1559 which captures so much of the energy of the ethereum economy and turns that into net buying pressure of ether the asset by ethereum and as a result of all of these efficiencies that we've talked about we get to have as an ethereum ecosystem a net buyer of ether that is equivalent to the amount of ether that is in grayscale and the deposit contract combined every single year reoccurring a new one of those every single year and an additional metaphor is all of the eth locked in d5 that we like obsess over on defy pulse the i don't know what number of millions of eth is locked in d5 or the it's 42 billion dollars we get that net buying pressure every single year it's recyclable that buying pressure is recyclable and so this happens every single year after year after year and this is where the sustainability of both ether the asset and ethereum the economy comes from is because we have created ultra sound money because we have designed the system in the best possible way and this is why ryan is so upset that people don't understand this it's because it's i don't get it most under appreciated asset of all time it's absolutely crazy i mean there are some some some questions though like is this fee burn really sustainable and this is a valid question to ask ourselves so for example what if the price of if increases right does it mean that because people are denominating the transaction fees in the u.s dollar does it mean that the total amount of if that is going to be burnt is going to reduce as the price of eve increases but turns out that um that's not the case so you can look at it from an empirical evidence standpoint so from from genesis to now the the price of if has grown a thousand x actually 2000 x from one dollar to two thousand dollars and over that time the amount of transaction fees has gone nothing but up and so you can ask yourself what are what is the possible explanation for the fact that the total amount of even transaction fees goes up despite the price of eve going up and one possible explanation is that as the price of eve increases that's highly correlated with user demand right the price of increases you have lots of fresh blood coming in new users and so that puts more pressure on on the fee market and that compensates for the fact that the price of if has been increasing i guess another um possible explanation is that if is used as economic bandwidth in this economy and so as the price of yf increases you have more economic bandwidth and suddenly you have more opportunities right you have increased economic density meaning that every single transaction will carry more value and you know you maybe have more opportunities in terms of arbitrage right because it's just more money sloshing around because you have more bandwidth and i guess maybe another possible explanation is that you you simply have a richer user base right and so the the price sensitivity to transaction fees decreases um [Music] and maybe like a final kind of possible explanation for this empirical behavior is that if is a what i call i guess a unit of trading right so this is a pretty amazing statistic which is that if you look at the unit swap volume right now we're doing a billion dollars of volume on uni swap it turns out that 95 of that volume is in if pairs what i mean by an eve pair i mean that there's two erc20 tokens one of which is the wrapped wrapped eve so out of the billion dollars of transaction volume 950 million is basically with eve and so if you look at arbitrage opportunities they're going to be eve denominated and so it's it doesn't matter if the price of eve increases because if you have let's say a 0.1 eve arbitrage opportunity and your transaction fee is 0.05 if um and it's an invariant whatever the price of is you you're going to want to conduct that that arbitrage opportunity and i guess we're starting to see if being used as a as a unit of account and the use of trading beyond just you know unit swap for example we're seeing it in nfts and the more if is used as a as a unit of account the more the amount of transaction fees in if that we can burn is going to be insensitive to to price increases well said what we're seeing right before our eyes is ether as an asset increasing in moneyness in its ability to be a store of value unit of account and unit of exchange which is super exciting and all of the reasons why this is important i think we've gone through right eth has to have value and a lot of value tremendous amount of value in order for it to host the world's open finance economic activity it needs it in order to secure itself it needs it for economic bandwidth trustless economic bandwidth you know one thing i want to talk about here as we as we get to a close here justin is um sound money culture right so bitcoin very much has sound money culture right they you know thou shalt never touch the issuance schedule of of bitcoin even if it even if it means the truck can't pull the economic weight up the hill thou shalt not touch it ever because why because hard money that's why um can we talk about this because we opened this up and we were talking about shelling points and and money is is really sort of a social coordination game if you will um is is sound money it sounds like it's being baked into the ethereum protocol ultrasound money is it also being baked into ethereum's culture because that's important too um is it what what do you think about ethereum's culture uh because ultimately you know it the layer zero as we've said so often justin is people it is it is culture we are socially enforcing the value and the economic security of these networks and if we don't have sound money minimum necessary issuance in the culture of the system we won't be able to enforce that as securely how would you rate ethereum on that right so one of the the big counterpoints of bitcoin is of the ultrasound money thesis is predictability right for them a big aspect of soundness is predictability um and i guess that that makes sense and that's a fair you know counterpoint that basically if you were at ethereum at genesis it would have been unpredictable for you to foresee the various changes in issuance that we've seen historically so historically we've seen two major changes the first one is the reduction of the block reward from five eve to three eve per block so that happened in october 2017 and then we had another reduction from three eve per block to two e per block in february 2019 and i guess we know we're in the in the process of doing another block reduction like a third policy change uh we're basically removing proof of work and going to proof of stake and that's roughly a 10x improvement so we're going from 2e per block to roughly 0.28 per block now um you could you could you know ask yourself is this isn't this bad you know we've lost uh predictability and what what i'd say to this is that as you say we have layer zero predictability right the community predictably only goes in one single direction which is hardening right so every time we make a policy change we're hardening as opposed to you know the federal reserve which is up often in the other direction so you know lynn alden um has this you know famous quote where she says you know the ethereum developers changed the um the issuance policy as as as often as the fed well first of all that is just not true in terms of a quantitative standpoint right in in five years or six years where we're looking to make three issuance uh uh changes um whereas you know in the similar time frame the the fed has made more like 30 so 10 times more but maybe more importantly each of these issuants are in the hardening direction as opposed to the you know inflation direction i guess another thing that i'll say is that i think us ethereums we want to um maximize for long-term predict predictability and so we've traded off the short-term predictability where we have you know this initial experimentation um and over the long term we're going to ossify and we're not going to change this is kind of a natural thing that happens to blockchain protocols they ossify over time um and to my knowledge we know we don't have any you know plans to to really change the issuance beyond what's what is being delivered with with proof of stake on the other hand bitcoin talks about predictability but actually it's it has you know skeletons in the closet right so it's optimizing for short-term predictability but because it doesn't have sustainability you know relative to security it it's actually um not optimizing for long-term predictability so you know who knows what will happen in the future we know it's unsustainable you know in 30 years something has to change we don't know exactly what's going to change maybe bitcoin will move to proof of stake maybe a bitcoin will will move to the ethereum network maybe they'll remove the 21 million limits no one knows um but and and this is kind of a source of of long-term unpredictability which uh we hope to not have in ethereum justin can you talk about hard money as a design goal of ethereum and that might sound foreign to a lot of people because that's again like like ryan said it's not it hasn't really been baked into our culture but i think it has and we it's actually just been unconscious in the culture it's not in the consciousness of the ethereum culture but it's perhaps in the unconsciousness of ethereum culture can you talk about that yeah i think i think i would agree um that there's been this this this unconscious uh desire to have sound money and it's becoming more and more conscious you know partly thanks to you guys uh and others who can you know work on this narrative layer um i guess um you know within the kind of the the research team i guess i you know there is also kind of a shift more of an awareness that there is a desire from the community at the end of the day you know where we try to cater for for the community and there there is this um this desire for um soundness um and so we're we're making um explicit design decisions towards that so to give you one example um we uh want to cap the total number of validators to roughly one million validators so that corresponds to 32 million if and that will basically also cap the amount of issuance that we that the proof-of-stake system can can do so we we kind of estimate that one million validators is more than enough security there's no need to overpay so we just cap it and it turns out that when you have one million validators that corresponds roughly to maximum issuance of one million if which is kind of a nice round meme number that in the worst case scenario we're going to inflate at one million eave per year but of course you know if we're gonna burn two or three or four million if the the net amount is going to be negative and i guess capping validators a good thing to do why is that why is that justifiable right so that goes back to the um you know efficiency um so eip1559 prevents overspending on security allowing us to charge the battery while the cap also allows us to not overspend on security by basically capping the amount of energy that we're drawing from the battery we're not going to be drawing any more than one one million ether per year you know one thing i i often think is when ethereums talk about sound money they just use different terms they talk about security and of course security is just one side of the same coin when we talk about monetary premium and ether as an asset backing the security of the entire network so uh ethereum has always been optimizing for sound money in a way because it's always been optimizing for security people also you know when you were talking about developers and issue issuance we had lynn alton on the podcast she sort of uh you know made this argument i think people overestimate the ability for developers to just like fed chair a change to issuance inside of the protocol at the end of the day the ethereum network and the layer zero is minimum necessary issuance and so if anybody i'm sure you would agree justin you know on the ethereum dev side of things or research side of things tried to put in some sort of um issuance change where you know funds were going to ether issuance was going to a separate deposit to be used for you know who knows what the community would reject that right so at the end of the day this is backed by the same mechanism that bitcoin is backed by which is this which is this layer zero um you know justin maybe we could kind of sum up what this means uh ultrasound money um this is kind of the the sister episode as we as we said in the intro to the bull case for for crypto economics i feel like this episode has been almost the bull case for ether the asset uh sum this up for us what does this mean what are some of the the takeaways for crypto natives and people who are interested in in these technologies yeah so um i mean i kind of see it as the the bull case of ethereum economics as a whole and that includes many different aspects you know one is being able to secure the blockchain um right we have this crypto economic system the economic part is kind of a necessary evil um it would be great if we could do it purely with cryptography but you know we need economics so let's make sure that the economics is as robust as we can get it um let's basically engineer the crap out of it the other aspect is um you know engineering for for for soundness and for this this the store of value aspect so you know i mentioned that soundness one possible definition is the ability to transport over time right so when you have digital money it's trivial to transport over space right you can you can just use the internet and travel the speed of the internet or you know at the speed of light um but travel over time is a is a difficult endeavor now why is travel over time especially relevant for ethereum um one of the reasons is that defy is built on if as collateral right if you take for example a synthetic like a stable coin right you're going to use ether as collateral and you know we're going to see tons and tons of synthetics right not just stable coins but you know stocks and whatnot um and so we need when when you when you have a synthetic what you're doing is you're putting if as collateral now it would be a crazy idea to put an asset which is not sound as collateral right because basically what you you want the collateralization ratio to improve over time right so that you don't get liquidated so what you want to be doing in a in a in a in a sound kind of synthetic framework is you want to be putting the hardest money as collateral and then using that as the backing for your for all your synthetics another aspect of of of soundness which is critical for ethereum is is staking you know as as david said um you know staking doesn't work unless you have people who are bullish either and are happy to hold it over extended periods of time um and so here we kind of have this this reflexivity going on which is that um the more people are happy to hold eve as a store of value as a long-term store value we're going to have more validators which is going to lead to more security which is going to lead to more people being comfortable holding if as a long-term store value so we have all these um beneficial um mechanics you know at play and then ultimately when we try and sum everything up really we have a new paradigm kind of in in economic you know theory i guess you know we've never seen this before we've never seen um a kind of a deflationary sound money um and we we're in uncharted territories and you know it's extremely exciting because you know people also don't completely realize um what the the amazing you know system that that we're putting out there partly because right now the beacon chain is this the skeleton chain right which is only securing itself is not really securing anything else um but once everything comes together which is a process which will take you know about a year or a year and a half so the rough road map is this year um in in one of the the hard forks i think is the london hard fork uh we're gonna have eip1559 in july and then in 2022 we're gonna have the so-called merge where we remove the proof of work and have proof of stake and at that point from an economic standpoint we have something extremely exciting like the the next level of economic uh engineering uh ingenuity i guess guys this year burn next year merge and reduced issuance justin drake we want to thank you for joining us on the bankless podcast and explaining all this to us it's been a pleasure sir thank you guys wow what an episode bankless nation you know what um i think that's going to take some time to digest one thing one of my takeaways and i'm sure as yours david to you is bitcoin move over there's a new store of value on the scene wait until this narrative leaks out into mainstream we are early this is the frontier guys uh super exciting stuff here with justin not just sound money but ultra sound money justin not only the creator of this fantastic episode but also the creator of the thing the meme that i think will carry ether into the very end ultrasound money with justin drake justin thank you for being here and delivering us this information thanks again for having me this has been a canonical episode some action items for you guys there's another sister episode to this that we mentioned a few times we will leave that as an action item in the show notes that is the bull case for cryptography uh also we've got to say emphasize this of course none of this was investment advice we don't know what the short-term price of ether is going to do long term of course we're bullish but who knows crypto is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but as usual we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for
