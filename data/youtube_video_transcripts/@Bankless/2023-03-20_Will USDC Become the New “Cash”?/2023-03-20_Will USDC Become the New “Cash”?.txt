there's a bill that I think will see the the light of day very soon in Congress which is like the payment stablecoin act it's like a payment token it can be used to settle a payment obligation as good as cash payment stablecoin legislation essentially creates a pathway for private sector actors who have a formal recognition at the federal level and be connected to the Federal Reserve Bank but instead of depending on the government to build technology and innovate you're depending on public blockchain infrastructure I actually think we're like two three years away from having at scale a regulated model of this that can work at internet scale and work for users and that's going to happen way faster than Central Bank digital currency
