bankless Nation the ZK Frontier is hard to imagine we can discuss the properties of ZK technology technically but articulating what it's actually going to do for not just ethereum not just web 3 but the entire internet and the society built on top of it is really hard it's a hard Vision to articulate ZK technology unlocks a massive new landscape of opportunity but it's it's impossible to actually imagine it the pattern here is that it's it's trying to like articulate what the internet would look like in the late 80s we can articulate the internet technically we can now pass data between the computers at the speed of light across base and time but illustrating the internet meaningfully before applications like YouTube or Twitter or Discord existed is basically impossible and we've seen these moments in history before no one could really imagine that the printing press and double entry bookkeeping would meaningfully change humans perceptions of Art and self the steam engine or combustion engine did not evoke images of abundance and culture in the mind of people looking at it today Bank location on the show we do our best to draw the future of a ZK enabled internet Alex glukowski and Anthony Rose from ZK Singh come with a color palette of principles that can help you the listener draw what you see Downstream principles like sovereignty censorship resistance hyperscalability security these are all properties of both cryptosystems and ZK technology and we take each principle one by one to make sure that you know exactly what colors you have at your disposal when you want to go and draw your own imagination of what the future ZK internet looks like currently ZK technology is maybe at one percent penetration of web 3 and web 3 is maybe at one to two percent penetration of the internet at Large we are so early Anthony and Alex and the rest of the ZK sync team thinks of the entire internet the whole damn thing will eventually reach 99 ZK penetration in the fullness of time the internet is going to look real different and what excites me about this is that we can see it coming from a mile away it's not often that we get ahead of an opportunity this large this far in advance this is why we are here in crypto and as my genius co-host often likes to say when they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values CK technology doesn't just scale block space it scales crypto values to the internet to everyone by default Ryan and I are both advisors to zksync you can probably hear it in my voice that ZK sync gets me very excited and bullish on Humanity which is kind of what I really need after 2022 what 2022 did to crypto as advisors to ZK sync we help them tell their story we help them tell this story which is what we are doing here with Alex and Anthony of ZK Singh today helping them tell the story that they are trying to bring to the table I worked with them on the agenda for this conversation I helped guide them through this conversation because I think the story is really important the more cynical viewer will say that it's because I have exposure as an advisor maybe but I'll say it's the same relationship that I have with eth there are values that I believe in there are assets that Express these values and projects that represents these values well I think those assets have the best Roi potential and I want to share that thesis with the world it's been correct so far this is why this episode is being released under the full disclosure category because this episode is based around an announcement that ZK sync is bringing to the table today the release of these DK stack a modular technology stack that allows anyone to build their own ZK chain and have that ZK chain be interoperable with every other ZK stack chain it's kind of like the op stack but this time with ZK the cool thing about the ZK stack is that it's naturally composable with other ZK stack chains right out of the box the ZK stack is a fully flexible and modular Tech stack that allows you to choose exactly how you want to build your ZK chain what data availability solution you want to use that's up to you all the choices that go into making a ZK chain the ZK stack lets you choose and compose it together except for one thing you must use the same ZK circuit this is the secret sauce the actual ZK element of this you must choose the same ZK circuit which is what the ZK stack is in order to join the hyper chain Network that the ZK stack system wants to produce this is the magic that makes every ZK stack chain know about every other ZK stack chain and how they can all hyperlink together in perfect ZK fashion I've really enjoyed this episode I thought it was a ton of fun I think you'll learn a lot about this we go through all the principles that ZK as a technology brings to the table and I hope bankless listener it helps show you the ZK Vision that the ZK sync team has been working on for years there's so much left to explore out there and we are just getting started so let's go right into the conversation with Alex and Anthony from zksync so we can get your imagination running about the inevitable future ZK internet Bank location I would love to introduce you to Alex glukowski the co-inventor of ZK sync and Anthony the senior VP of tech who leads the engineering team over at ZK sync Anthony Alex welcome back to bankless thanks for having us good to see you again so I'm really excited for this this conversation the ZK technology ZK as a as a meme is kind of having a moment in the crypto World The Meta has shifted towards focusing on CK I think this is a frontier of crypto that we've known has existed for a long time and now teams like like yourselves are starting to explore that Frontier in a much more meaningful way uh and I think you guys have a message for us which is more or less stated as the crypto world the internet itself is not bullish enough on ZK I think we all kind of get it like Fast transactions speeds lower gas fees faster settlement times uh but just stating it like that I don't think it does enough Justice uh and so I want to throw this question to Alex Alex what does the web3 world not understand perhaps or could use more illumination about the future world of ZK where are we now and where do you think that we are going um the ZK is actually the missing link that will transform the web free in the form in which we know it today into the actual next generation of the internet so if you think about the what like how internet was was gradually evolving from um initially just mimicking the previous media of communication that that existed before internet and then transforming and like becoming what we know it now the powerful network with um compound you know like composibility with with a lot of completely new use cases that were not imaginable before the next obvious step is everything that touches value goes onto the internet and transforming in a similar way and for this to happen the internet has to get certain Properties or maybe the other way around the web create has to like Embark embody certain properties that will make it easy for the internet to fully embrace it to penetrate to to like make it through and through interconnected with web3 but no separation which is like one seamless Continuum and the ZK is the technology that brings this properties and we don't have anything today that can substitute it this is why what's the position right now I would say the the world of ZK is just not very penetrated into ethereum like where are these ZK applications we have we have some zkevm main Nets right and these are contracts on ethereum that are applications and then there's some stuff there but overall I would say the bulk of activity in web3 is mostly in like the non-zk format so call it like one percent penetration of ZK uh in the final form of ZK Tech as it's adopted into our smart contracts onto our layer twos like where do we get do we get to like 50 do we get to 88 how far how far will ZK come to dominate what we call web3 uh I think we'll see something like 99.99 how many nines you get um but it's going to be part of everything essentially and I think we are where we are today is uh at this pivotal moment where we see this transition and this transition is at a at the lower Point um but we just launched this first ZK VMS very recently and they naturally need time to mature and the users need time to get you know to solve the the initial uh hiccups and friction and also to get enough bottle testedness enough maturity enough uh kind of Confidence from the users that the systems can hold a lot of value and once we're past this point we're going to see the exponential adoption of this technology which will replace basically every Every Chain every bridge everything at the infrastructure layer of the of of the web free what gives you the confidence that 99 of web 3 will be ZK like well what 90 excuse me 99.999 ZK like what why are why do you feel so confident in that statement I am a technologist I'm just looking at the properties of the systems that that you have uh just just like when we started matter labs and ZK sync project four years ago we were looking at the existing alternatives to scaling and we realized they are not gonna take us anywhere like we had the idea of uh the lightning Network for Bitcoin and for you know um the radius of plasma and ethereum and similar proposals and it was clear they are not elegant they are not fitting they're not solving the problems in a way the uh the the users will would seal this like need to to get solved so um and then we looked at the ZK Tech it snarks it like six in their knowledge proof uh deck and it was very clear that this is kind of this this magic Silver Bullet that was will get us there we were it was very immature back then we did not have the protocols that are as performant and as flexible and as generic as we have today but it was clear that this revolution is in the air and it's brewing and it's going to come to fruition more or less soon we like it was hard to estimate whether it's going to take two years five years ten years but it was clear that we're on the right track and we it turned out that um we were not optimistic enough we are actually like we we managed to complete this this journey to the full fully functional ckvm in in my short time than the world's top leading cryptographers who are thinking that that including metallic Anthony I want to throw this one to you because you're on the engineering side of things you understand the tech very very deeply Alex was like there ZK has these properties right that compelled him in the Z casing team to be like yes ZK is the answer ZK is going to do what it's going to do which is penetrate into the world of web 3 at the 99 which is a big big statement uh what what about ZK makes that true like what are the properties of ZK that makes it such a compelling technology yeah it's a great question for me ZK uh one of the reasons why I think it's so compelling for what we're doing and actually will be more compelling for other use cases in the fullness of time as Alex has spoken to is that well for blockchains in particular public blockchains it's so complementary with respect to the properties that they are good at relative to what they need so for example at least the way I think about it you know when we think about why public blockchains excite many of us as a technology in the first place and why we think they have so much potential it's you know properties like decentralization properties like their security you know the trustless transactions this permissionless system and This Global accessibility you know to a first approximation these services are available to anyone with an internet connection the challenges that we've seen in this space are also well understood right so the way that we pay for lots of these nice properties is with the inability or the challenges around scale of course this is one of the problems that zkasync is laser focused on and has been laser focused on since the start uh and this technology this cryptographic protocol the zero knowledge proofs have this huge asymmetry between you know do a lot of computation and then be able to sort of Express this proof that represents that computation that anybody can verify extremely cheaply relative to the amount of computational work that was done to kind of you know generate the proof and they say symmetry means you can start to imagine these composable systems where a lot of competition could happen on one side and it can be trusted on the other side um trivially right with no sort of trust assumptions introduced before you move on Alex I want to pin down on that word asymmetry uh computational asymmetry right easy to a hard to compute easy to verify and I think uh social words asymmetry for The Listener being like that power benefits you the individual right it's asymmetry in a Power Balance terms like there are large-scale institutions out there there are the powers that be and asymmetry tilts power against large-scale institutions in the favor of individuals and so yes that we have like the technical term for asymmetry which is like the N equals NP problem or like the the just like what ZK technology fundamentally does but really like meaningfully asymmetry is just like power balances and specifically power balances towards the many towards the users the piece I mean specifically here just to clarify is there a computational asymmetry is maybe the right way to phrase it where you know for example what we're doing with era today a huge amount of activity can happen at the layer two and the representation of that activity the sort of proof of the correctness of this activity ends up being this very small footprint that we verify on layer one you don't have to trust us that all of the activity happened on the layer 2 and the way that we said it did because this protocol gives you that property where anybody can verify that what we're saying is correct so this is the asymmetry that I mean this really nice property where you can verify the computational Integrity so a huge amount of computation can be sort of zipped and expressed very succinctly with these cryptographic protocols um and then the other nice property which I think is not a core Focus for us as a team today but it's a core like in fundamental property that will be I think important for the future for us and other people leveraging ZK is privacy so I think you know and we imagine this future internet of value we will need privacy at the protocol layer we'll need privacy protocols to exist because just as if uh you know you can go into a shop and buy something with your credit card or pay with cash it doesn't give access to your full transaction history this will obviously be another important problem for us to solve and this is another important area where ZK can complement public blockchains as a technology Anthony there's two things that you pulled apart integrity and privacy we get we get the computational Integrity from ZK technology that's what it does uh and then I think what you said is privacy the threshold for achieving privacy becomes a lot lower and the easier to access once we have this once we have the the ZK foundations right and so Alex I want to throw it back to you what do we get when we combine these things integrity and privacy and how is it different from what we know in the web3 space today um it depends on what we do with them but I think there is a one-third component which we which will really take us to uh to to implementing the full vision which is a touch of magic you know like you insert like any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic and um in the realm of uh software development certain Technologies certain Frameworks when you as a developer use them like uh I I can remember using react or review.js in the early days of this Technologies it felt like magic you describe things it's really elegantly and they just work and they display what you want them to do and there's a lot a ton of over going on underneath and I like you could say the same thing about like Google Maps where they first appear yeah you move your mouse you scroll and all of a sudden the map Zooms in and out and to any degree uh the the with is your knowledge and privacy it's the same story we had examples of perfectly private Technologies like pgp that were supposed to be completely decentralized and independent and and unencrypted and they never took off even between cryptographers because they lack the magic of just making it seamless and easy to to you know they just work out of the box so the the uh slipped Into Obscurity and then at some point the uh WhatsApp and and signal and telegram appeared with uh end-to-end encrypted secret chats that worked without any effort from the end user side and they took on and now millions or billions of people are using them fully encrypted uh you know at this global scale I think this is something that is required for for ZK to actually benefit to get to this 99.9 percent I think I think what you're saying is that uh if we use the example of like tornado cash to achieve privacy which you know rest in peace we can't really use it anymore at least I can because I'm a United States citizen uh but it's still like a one-off implementation of privacy it's not privacy by default right it's not privacy on the foundations I I I think what you're saying Alex is that in order to have privacy by default it needs to be embedded in the foundations that we live upon right otherwise like going into a one-off implementation of privacy like tornado cash it's not going to work because just because it takes actions it's like a burden and so in order to have private money and private actions it needs to be embedded into the blockchain so that we don't have to think about like the choice right it's just like something that we have almost by default is that right I I agree and I would add to this that it really starts with the end user experience privacy it changes the way you interact with blockchains and so the the World experience the like the the Dynamics of transactions of transaction changes really completely and tornado cash did actually a pretty good job in uplifting this ux experience and they were going on like they were quite on the right track but yes in isolation from all the other protocols it would not help you much of course you have to integrate it with everything else it you need privacy by default and you also need developer tooling that makes it really easy really uncomplicated and very secure to implement private applications uh so all of those components have to come together for for really like embracing the full power of CK Alex you talked about um the combination of integrity and privacy creates magic which is fun uh but also it's like okay that's great it's really hard to imagine right and and I think one of the things that really just plagues the ZK landscape is that imagining what comes next is really really hard right like I we can talk about individual use cases we can talk about like computational Integrity we can talk about privacy by default but for like the Layman or just like the generalist it's kind of hard to actually imagine what it's hard to imagine magic so Alex like can you how do you how do you actually articulate to just like the Layman or just like the general populations like a ZK enabled internet like what what is that what does that do I I think the part where which makes it hard to imagine is exactly the part which makes makes it magical you know magic is something that happens it makes things possible that that are seemingly impossible like you you think of the first iPhone you have all of the applications that do a lot of things on on your small device on a small screen you don't have to know how it works under the hood you don't have to understand all the complex Technologies of the screens and processors and radio technology and whatnot uh that that makes it work like all you need to know is you press the button like you tap on the screen and you have a beautiful 4K video and and you just enjoy it like that's magic so like not all things have to be addicted in in that deep but um it's like we all know it's it's of course pure science like if you want to understand it it's open it's an open book it's pure math you go step by step and you do dive deeper and deeper with time you will you will be able to fully stand each step of the protocol each step of the computational um tricks that that are happening there to deliver this the promise of uh um integrity and privacy and basically all other things that are coming from Anthony help us uh fill in this picture this this ZK Magic picture what does this picture look like to you too I think maybe um one analogy that I find quite helpful is you can imagine a world where the infrastructure is as mature or comparatively mature to we have in web 2. you know for example if I am sending you an email I don't really have to think about it I don't have to know where your uh yeah like your what platform you're working with where the email is hosted the protocol just sort of handles the sort of Transportation of the information in a way that makes sense that to me I'm just sending you an email and then I could send Alex an email and it really this is you know the thing that I want to do this task uh doesn't require me to think about the protocol doesn't require you know this barrier to using it in a very seamless way this I think is where we need to get to with transactions of value for example so what if I could send you value not knowing anything about where your wallet was hosted which change you're interacting with it really start to build this much more seamless experience you know when we think about how the internet has been scaled it's the question of horizontal scalability right you know no uh company is just like scaling their system by getting a bigger and bigger computer every time they get you know another order of magnitude of users and as we think about not just how do we go from ethereum's 15 transactions per second you know hundreds or thousands but how do we get to millions of transactions per second you know how do we really get to hyperscale to a world in which you know the internet of the internet value is powered by these systems we need to solve this scalability problem in a real way and for me this is where the magic comes in when users don't need to think about the infrastructure because most users don't need to think about the infrastructure developers don't need to uh sort of solve every problem to be able to achieve what they want to do for their application because the protocols are mature and the protocols provide a foundation and a toolkit for like building things that users want maybe just to take a step back and you know when we think about what these um ZK powered networks look like in the fullness of time there are a bunch of core Properties or tenants that make sense to sort of articulate as we're thinking through the design and thinking through then how they will behave so at the top we've got you know trustlessness this is sort of where a lot of things start with us from the point of public blockchains and ZK obviously gives us an ability to kind of extend the systems that already have this property in a way that doesn't actually introduce new trust assumptions which is obviously hugely important so in in public blockchains in ethereum Bitcoin like users verify transactions by like running their own node which is easy from a network standpoint like I can run a node I can download a node maybe it'll take me a day and then I can start verifying transactions it's easy-ish but with ZK with ZK added two chains this this gets easier correct it gets easier so instead of having to verify everything in the way that you do today for example in the way you describe with a full node you have to you get to verify the proof so this succinct very very quick to verify um a representation of all of that computational work gives you that confidence just as if you'd reverified every single individual transaction yourself but of course you don't have to right so we actually how would that compare to the actual challenge of running a full node in terms of running the full node I mean essentially what you're doing is you're replaying the computation just as if you were playing it I mean you are you know replaying the computation so you want to say I need to get to a point where I can trust the fact that this sequence of events has happened and I replay this sequence of events and just to make sure that every single thing proceeds as as you know I've been told or as I I need to infer with ZK this is not required so you actually just uh have to verify the proof this is an extremely quick computation you know it could be a rounding error essentially in terms of computational work relative to all of the work that's being verified so you get this huge like compressibility factor in terms of doing this verification so what you're able to do is have this interface between two systems for example where trust isn't required but what you get is a very low latency way to communicate state so for example system a and system B can talk to each other can communicate that you know events have happened can move information but you can do it in a way that doesn't introduce a huge computational burden because system a doesn't want to trust system b or needs or needs to have this trustless property for system B for example right the way that we achieve trustlessness in in with nodes right is you run you download every single block and you run every single bit of computation yourself up to the point that you need to prove which is with ethereum like eight years of history and computation that you redo and and so with with DK Tech with DK Roll-Ups uh you're saying that this it's just a single proof it's more like of a single instance rather than just an entire history of data and I think the interesting part of your answer was like it's not just humans it's also networks trusting each other as well like other networks talking and and being in a trusted uh or trustless environment rather than than humans and so I really just kind of want to drive the point home of just like rather than years of computation that we have to do like not years of time for actually doing the computation but like a Year's worth of history of old transactions that you have to go serially one by one to get to the point of trustlessness which is possible we have nodes that can do this this is what running a node is with ZK Roll-Ups it's almost just like just a single a single proof a single ZK proof in order to do all of that same work and so there's the benefits are just like hey it's easier for the user but also more networks can talk to more networks and there's like that's maybe some of the magic that we're talking about it's like we know it's cool we don't know what people are going to do with it but we know there's a big there there yeah I mean for me like this piece is the part that I'm personally most excited from an engineering point of us really building out and you know implementing in the Vernier term but this interface piece where you leverage GK at the boundary this is incredibly powerful CK at the boundary I like that line okay that so that was trustlessness where do we go next uh security I think is the next property that we need to speak to right um we you know ethereum today securing the value that it does today happens because of its investment in security and because of the you know years of best practices and frankly work and sweat that's got into you know thinking about how to build secure systems this is you know just obviously as we think about extending this orders of magnitude Beyond where it is today something that we have to continue to invest in and something that we have to uh think of as a core principle behind you know some future internet value there's no world in which I imagine that's succeeding in bringing you know trillions of value at trillions of dollars of value on chain if the system is insecure these kind of things just have a fundamental tension um how would you define security this is a great question very simple terms yeah in terms of how I think about security the security at the protocol layer means maybe sort of principled isolation and principled control you know when I think about this today with ethereum for example the whole you know not your keys not your coins like this sort of principle is kind of enshrined into the protocol you know if I have control of my keys I have control of my assets and this is a way that I think is a sort of fundamental prerequisite obviously very many important things under the general umbrella of security when we're thinking about it this is not necessarily how we think about it we think about correctness we think about sort of you know building in a system which is um battle tested uh robust and just all of these properties that for any system managing lots of value in a world of you know pseudonymity there are risks that we think about the system level um but for users I think security is about control and about sort of being protected from the protocol and using cryptography to protect them yeah how does ZK actually fit in with security does it does so like ethereum pretty damn secure uh what does a CK roll up how does that change the nature of security or does it at all in a world where we are complete with the protocol or you know the protocol is extremely mature that what we're aspiring for is that it doesn't change anything right the obvious point at the moment when these systems are being built is that these systems are complex none of this is Trivial you know and there is work and we try to be very transparent about you know where we think our sort of security posture is you know we when we first opened this system we very purposely labeled it as an alpha version of the system because security is one of those things where you kind of don't know what you don't know forever and you just have to do a lot of work to get to the point where you feel like some threshold has been satisfied and yeah I mean you know for us I would say that today it will be true that no complex external system that is you know months or weeks or even a year old will likely be as secure as ethereum but we will get that I mean time passes work is done and the systems you know go through there's a lot of work you can do to get to the point where the system is robust this is well understood and it's it's work that we're doing it's work that the community will do obviously as we open source the code for this reason um but yeah there are security assumptions introduced with complexity but there's also ways to mitigate this um and they're well understood but obviously requires time okay trustlessness security what other are the unique principles or properties of ZK chains uh another good one will be reliability right liveness is obviously something that's incredibly important the network needs to be you know ethereum is uh reliable reliable under uh you know extreme circumstances if it's designed to be reliable it's this is one of the other properties I would argue is a sort of core piece of the um value in public blockchains this is something that we obviously can't compromise so the system has to be reliable has to be resilient and uh has to be available for users so again this is another core tenant when we think about designing these features UK chains and we recently had the whole uh ethereum finality non-event I like to call it a non-event because I mean something happened but the point is that nothing happened and so this was when like if blocks failed to finalize blocks were still propagating on ethereum yet they failed to finalize for an hour or so and then they finalized this is a this is what we're talking about right this is reliability in the ethereum layer one how does this work on on zksync or you use earlier you use the term in the fullness of time which I'm going to use because I like that it implies like at The Logical conclusion of ZK sync and ZK chains which is reliable reliability look like at this level reliability for us again in the fullness of time it doesn't I don't think it looks very different to the way that we think about reliability at the level of ethereum and this is a nice example as you point to today I would say we have a slightly different property like the way that we think about reliability today honestly looks a little bit more like I've thought about reliability when you know Building Systems in web 2 world where you know that the system today is not decentralized so you don't have all of the resiliency that decentralization gives you this is 100 coming and we're like building this piece very actively but today when we think about reliability we think about you know in the same way say Netflix thinks about reliability they think about disaster mitigation failovers you know no uh sort of single point of failure make sure you're building resilience systems this is how we're thinking about building the system today and how we're thinking about the network since you know for a long time now even before the launch of alpha um technological components that go into this so we the the the the fragility that is uh like dominating the layer two landscape is like single sequencers there's a single sequencer is this part of the conversation and what are the components that need to be added to these change in order to achieve reliability I would say the real component that we need is decentralization right so this is the thing that really is going to help solve the reliability problem to a degree like this is the the most important part of the work that we're doing from the engineering perspective it's decentralization in terms of what we do today there are different components of these complex systems each of them actually you solve or you think about reliability in a different way some parts of the system you can scale horizontally so for example when we're thinking about the provers they can be scaled horizontally very easily you know if one failed really actually it's not that big of a deal in the same way as if you sort of see a component fail in a web 2 world because they're restartable they're sort of sort of effectively like dumb stateless workers you just spin up another one and it does the work that moved from like you know failed proof to the new proverb you obviously don't want things like that to happen but the systems are built to be resilient such that you know things happen when you're running software this is just part of the way that you design software in general um but in terms of how we build reliable systems it has to be decentralization this is the thing you can't rely on any one entity you can't rely on any one entities choice of their infrastructure you have to get to a world where you know the system is permissionless the system is decentralized and the properties of the public blockchain you know we're coming back to it this is where era needs to be this is whereas UK sync the as a protocol is is heading okay so that's reliability again started with trustless security reliability where do we go from here uh next on the list probably censorship resistance um you know when we are building these systems we have to be building for everybody and we're thinking about you know again like this is another core property of ethereum and it's one of the properties of ethereum that we say that when we're projecting these systems into the future it has to be maintained has to be defended so again when we're thinking about a future ZK powered internet value how do you build a world where or how do you build the protocol where censorship resistance is just embedded into the protocol and users have the ability to interact with this system in a way that you know is I also think consistent with like permissionlessness and trustlessness and so on right it's down this is Downstream of properties that we've already discussed right like with high reliability and high trustlessness you achieve most censorship resistance yes to a degree and I think it's also important that you design the protocol in a way where entities operating in this different participants in the system don't have the ability to censor other users without yeah I think the protocol has to be designed with this this piece of mind I think listeners are familiar with just censorship resistance at the layer one right like you broadcast your transactions someone's gonna put it into the blockchain uh and if no one's hearing your transactions well you can kind of just do it yourself in certain circumstances um how does it does how does the ZK component change this conversation or does it not change it at all this is something that we're just copying and pasting from the layer one we have to think about it in a different like copy and pasting the idea is I think the way that I would think about it but the idea the implementation of the idea might look different so for example I would argue that one important property is the ability for anyone to participate in the network at any point if they wanted to right so for example in a fully decentralized Network you should be able to predict participate as a validator participate as approver censorship resistance needs to be baked into the protocol and there are ways that you can do that that don't require you to say oh you know to make sure I'm not being censored I have to run a validator so we have to think about it I would say the protocol layer um so when we're thinking about the system in the fullness of time it's like the implementation of the idea rather is maybe going to look a little bit different because of you know the mechanics of the system probably look a little bit different but we're um persisting the spirit of the idea okay so that's that's interesting resistance we got a few more uh what comes next uh we touched on it a little bit earlier but just to bring it back up as another core property when we think about the system at scale is privacy you know I want to be able to uh participate in this future internet value knowing that I have the opportunity to protect my identity under certain circumstances or I have the opportunity to uh not necessarily share all of my transaction history and I think sensitive information being protected as part of a system at scale is just something that we'll have to figure out and it's another core property of um you know a system that's powering millions of uh daily users activity on chain right yes and anyone who sent anyone else money on the layer one understands that this is something that we kind of all need uh okay uh hyperscalability is is the one that that excites me the most this is the one that we're gonna talk about now this is also kind of the the cool thing uh I mean I'll Trust this is cool censorship and privacy is cool uh but hyperscal ability to me stands out so so Anthony what is hyperscalability and what does it achieve so yeah I think I think for ZK this is sort of the focus and maybe like the Crux of everything right so again what is this when we're thinking about ethereum what we would like to do is make this system basically orders of magnitude cheaper and faster in terms of you know being able to process transactions at vast scale worldwide scale hyperscalability is this right it so of course how do we get to a point where this system that we kind of we understand works effectively for everybody in the world right you want to get to the point where uh Financial activity is is being able to be moved on chain and you can start to build again and actually share these other properties that we've been talking about but you can do it in a way where the system that provides all of these nice properties is you know implemented in such a way that it can scale to an enormous amount of activity relative to today you know we're obviously talking a lot about scale at the moment and when we think about scale today we're thinking about layer twos right this is definitely the thing that we're thinking about a lot um but solving this problem and giving to the world that we've been describing for the last uh you know short period of time it doesn't we don't get there with Layer Two right we have to talk about this is scale hyperscale is extending this idea and actually being able to build the system where you have almost like lots of these layer twos could be configured in different ways can be deployed in different ways but they can interoperate and they can communicate in the way that we've been talking about leveraging ZK uh such that you actually have sort of a compute platform that can actually power an enormous amount of activity for people across the entire world I would like to add that the we have kind of a strict definition of what hyperscal ability is and if you think of the Internet it's uh a system or a network of systems that does not have any inherent bounds any inherent limits on how Beacon can grow you know it started out as a small University's network of just a few nodes and then it grew into thousands and millions and billions of servers worldwide running all in parallel doing a lot of of work and and capable of doing a lot more work if necessary and in in like the this is what it really means the lack of limit like removing the cap it's not possible today with the existing Technologies other than ZK because the no matter how you structure how powerful service you use how willing you are to give up this centralization you cannot process all of the internet transactions on a single server or even on a single Data Center and similarly you cannot process all of the value transactions on a single monolithic blockchain system that will necessarily process them sequentially on One processor or like even if you do optimistic uh parallelization like you're still not getting there you still it's still much closer to like one server one data center situation than to the hyper scale of the internet so hyperscale means really going Limitless with full interconnectivity with with full interoperability so on the internet any website is available from any other website in exactly one click you can always put a hyperlink which will take you in one click there you don't have to go through you know like long path first we have to go to this segment of the internet and to this segment then we open some git and we go through you know that that's not how it works like it's it's is basically like a universe connected with warm holes where you get from any point of the universe to any other this is hyperscalability and this is this is something we're extremely excited about and this is uh part of of what we're diving deep um in our post today yeah I really like the idea of like what what is hyperscalability hyperscality is is growing scaling a network with with zero upper bound maybe Alex the there is an upper bound and that upper bound is the internet as in like there were the the idea of ZK chains can only grow up to the edges of the universe and the universe is the internet right and so the point is is like as the internet scales anything that is hyper scalable with again ZK Tech will reach will follow that corner of the internet as the internet itself scales and so the point is like with that with every new like any new ZK chain can fill the and this is why I want to take the time and like uh really drive this point home is like the internet is a container and we want to fill that container with ZK Tech right because of all the properties and and uh things that that ZK Tech gives us the sovereignty the the user power user autonomy uh and so the idea of hyperscalability is that we can actually penetrate ZK Tech into the far reaches of the internet okay so we're almost done with our color palette of painting this this ZK picture we got we got a few more uh Anthony you want to take us through to the last uh the home stretch here sure um so I would say the last two properties that we you know we've been thinking about this and we think are critical principles for the sort of system that we imagine powering the future internet value one of them is accessibility and this is one area where you know there's many ways to Define it but we would include things like affordability easy to use and they need to be uh yeah just applications need to be available in a way where they're accessible to everybody and related to permissionlessness and you know all of these pieces are somehow entangled but for us this is one area where particularly affordability has been an issue obviously at layer one right when we think about uh the bear Market we think about gas fees this is one area where even to do relatively simple things on chain people could be pressed out of it and how do we get to a world where this isn't true and this is uh again you know leveraging ZK proofs being able to benefit from this sort of huge compressibility of computation you start to get to understand a world where even with layer two things can be dramatically cheaper than layer one and obviously this is something that will continue to build towards um and then finally I don't give too much Credence to uh anatoly's takes from Solana but there's something that he said that has stuck with me which is that gas fees are a form of censorship like there I'll throw a flag at that statement at in a literal sense but also at the same time meaningfully it's true as in if things are too expensive to access for 99 of the world then it might as well be censorship and I think this is what we're talking about with accessibility is like we need to have these very high powered Financial applications not only just tools for the one percent it needs to be scaled out to 99.99 of wealth is this another way to say this for sure and I think also you know when we think about the use cases coming on chain you need to get to the point where the price of using the system isn't a barrier to even bringing that use case on channel to imagining your own chain so yes like for sure the price is a barrier even for things that happen today but as we expand and you want to bring you know micro payments on chain you want to bring games on chain you know users don't pay per click when they're interacting with Facebook for example you know the amortization of running Facebook across all their users means that they don't need to right how do we build systems which the cost of using the system Trends towards being so low that it's a sort of you know uh yeah these fees are just not a barrier for anybody using the system for any use case that they can imagine using it for this is I think you know really where we want to get to beautiful all right and this coming down to the last one which is also my favorite uh sovereignty Anthony what does sovereignty mean yeah sovereignty is another one that's very important which is um I think nicely summed up as sort of right to exit you know any group of users using the system need to um have that right to exit have that right to Fork away from the network uh you should be in a position where you're not beholden to the changes in the network in a way that don't make sense to you right so for example I mean we've seen examples of this in the history of public blockchains where people have disagreed with the direction of something and decided to fall this is something that we think has been a core property of the systems in the past and should be a core property of the systems in the future I want to add a historical parallel to this in throughout the history of the world people were exploring New Frontiers uh due to a significant degree of motivation because they were not happy with the rules and customs of you know like or maybe abuse of power in in the countries where they they were living so they would venture out to the new world to you know to set the area to to different parts of you know it's unknown uncivilized places where you could establish new ideas new new games basically from scratch and then everyone who wants to play game according to this rules can join and today we run out of new places on Earth like maybe we can we can try Mars but really the this digital uh Networks is something where we can again experiment we can learn from these historical examples and uh the right to exit is what checks what keeps the the the the system the kind of like the the state the the economical political societal system in check if something goes wrong if they you know like you could always have a situation where a majority turns on a minority and tries to to oppress it the minority should have the right to exit and the this kind of serves as a balance for preventing the situation in the first place so it's relatively embedded in the idea of layer ones because really it's like they are all forkable by default uh it's relatively hard to implement for layer tools this is why we put a special emphasis on this on this property in fact we see the opposite tendons we see some layer twos trying to capture their Market position and like in in building mechanisms that prevent the users from exiting introducing prohibitive licensing introducing you know like making it very hard to exit the system like the fact maybe that you have to wait seven days to to go out is is is like serving like like this factor of uh hard to live and I don't think it's going to play well I think the users will prefer free places uh and the the like you have to to make a deliberate effort to implement this at Large Scale one of the key problems at plasma well by plasma didn't work was that the uh one of the security mechanisms of plasma was the mass exit and this is now known as the mass exit problem like if everyone needs to exit the system in order to be secure like it you know within this specific period of time it might be very hard to impossible to do this so you need to plan the systems in a way that make it easy for arbitrary many people to exit and and also cheap enough if it's prohibitively expensive then we gain we get this censored by uh unaffordable fees situation it's like we are putting a lot of effort into this for this philosophical reasons right and this just goes back to user autonomy right and and I really the the I remember Amin solomoni talked about this very very deeply about uh moloch Dao where uh as soon as individuals have the right to leave the Dao no one could bully anyone else because if they bullied them too hard the users would just leave right and so we have what we're trying to do here with this ZK Tech we're trying to have we're trying to maximize trustlessness right we're trying to maximize security we're trying to maximize reliability privacy and censorship resistance which is all great and if we do then we have this fantastic utopic land but then the idea is like once that land becomes populated because why wouldn't it it's so great but if there was no freedom to exit those things might erode and then all of a sudden it goes from like a utopic land to an extractive land because no one can can exit so what you're saying Alex is like it's a check on the fact that all of these things will be preserved because if they won't then the users just leave and they're out of there and so like the the all of these properties that we just talked about trustlessness security reliability censorship resistance privacy hyperscalability accessibility accessibility and sovereignty one of the reasons why I really wanted to go through each one of these individually is because they're each like a color a color in this like Grand color palette of this very hard to Define vision of ZK Tech that penetrates the internet like it's DK Roll-Ups it's DK chains and CK applications it's accessibility of ZK and painting this picture is really hard especially when you are looking into the future like no one knew uh in the Renaissance what happens when you combine the printing press and double entry bookkeeping like all of a sudden you get a Cambrian explosion of like human culture that is meaningfully different from any of those two technologies right then you have the the Industrial Revolution like we get this steam engine we get the combustion engine and then humans start doing weird and crazy things that we never really saw happen before and so we have all of these properties we're trying to like paint in this picture of like what do we get when we embed the values of ZK technology all the way throughout and permeates all the way throughout the internet like we're trying to paint this picture here uh and it's hard to articulate because at some point it just goes up to like we need the developers to start playing with this and start building stuff and starting to do crazy and crazy things but that's where I want to turn this conversation to next we have this idea we have all these principles we have this ability to scale this Tech but right now we have the ZK sync era mainnet there are other ZK EVMS on chain uh but that we just talked about again Anthony in the fullness of time ZK sync in the fullness of time how do we get there where do we go from from A to B how do we get this into production what are the next steps here yeah I mean uh very happy to speak to Ira I'm very happy to speak to where we go with era and where we go with the ZK stack more generally and this is kind of what we're really excited to be talking about and what are the sort of maybe like even a point of inflection where you know we've been building for the last well several years at this point this sort of towards this idea but we also want to uh for this to be successful this obviously needs to go beyond us right we need to get to the point where we have a community behind this we are one contributor of many and these ideas are things that can be discussed can be debated can be improved and can be refined with era I think of it and I think internally we think of it as the first hyper chain you know these principles that we've been talking about are not new to us this is something that has been guiding I think the sort of philosophy behind the work for years and you know even back to when I had my first conversation with Alex probably about two years ago like it was very clear that these things were in place at the time we're articulating this in a in a way that I think is um for me probably the clearest I think today when we're really trying to make sure that this is something that we're opening up with the community because we want the technology to also be built with the community um era as a technology I think is the first instance here and we do have uh ideas of a to B and it comes with opening up the ZK stat you know encouraging others to work with it to deploy with it to improve it to refine it we have a lot of work to do we have a lot of work that I can speak to if you're interested about what we're actually doing at the moment um but the important thing I think at the moment is you know the ZK stack is uh available open source and essentially ready for us to start seeing other instances of this being deployed start to really you know build the pieces that are required for what we're talking about and this this Vision that we're working towards the ZK stack drill into that a little bit more that that is the the announcement what what is the ZK stack uh so as Anthony just said the uh you you know there's this old truism if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together uh for era we had to focus on speed and deliver it uh uh fast because we we we saw the the demand for zkbm was extremely high and we just needed to get the first version done with the laser focused effort of our core team uh now it's the time to open it and hand it over to the community this is why we started with the ZK credit publication we note that we opened it on GitHub for the community to discuss we're not just dropping it as like here's the the final truth we want the discussion we want the contributions from the community we want it to be uh broadly supported we we like you know like we want to incorporate all the feedback into something that can become the codification of the ZK culture that will then serve as a guiding principle as this North Star for the broad decentralized community of contributors it goes back to the ideas of sovereignty and reliability like we can Implement all of these principles technologically and basically all of all of the eight principles we we just discussed they are implementable purely technologically they basically don't require a lot of you know like human or in-game theoretical components you can do things that we can build a system that essentially like villains like Lord Voldemort can can run uh and they cannot do any harm but such a system will not be durable because it needs to evolve with time and the evolution happens better by humans so if the Lord Voldemort controls the code developer the development process and the core team then over time it will it obviously will not play out so so good so like this is why the the code base must be full open source and under fully permissive open license owned by the community and the contribution base must be very broad so that a lot of people can actually take over the code and if things go wrong if the United government's governance of a network could always get compromised the we you know like as is with with all things so with all networks in uh human world who observe the Pareto principles uh uh application that the power tends to get concentrated over time we see it with the internet the internet is now largely controlled most of the traffic is is coming through for corporations and they can impose uh arbitrary rules as they want so like what's important is that if the community wants to exit there will be viable Alternatives and and so like we we need this broad Community move uh movement to participate this is why the principles are published now and being discussed and this is why we're announced in this case stack okay just just to make sure I totally understand the ZK stack is software that is being published is it like it is is it ZK sync but like vanilla as in like without the state it's just the code so if one is somebody wanted to deploy their own ZK sync they would go to the ZK stack and that's what that is is that is that what it is being released the ZK stack is based on the code of ziki sync era and it's still being developed further but the idea is that the it's a modular framework for building your own hyper chains so you can build your own chain you can deploy it you can deploy it independently on ethereum but you're much better off deploying it as a part of the hyper chain network uh where as you can sync era exists and and a lot of other hyper genes which are accessible to you so you're part of this huge um single liquidity single trustless messaging um ecosystem which can talk from any channel any other on any chain can talk to any user on any other chain fast seamless and without any trust assumptions okay so this is a ZK stack this is kind of uh reminiscent of like op stack where op stack has their scaffolding for optimistic chains but this is with ZK chains with ZK tech and and again after going through our our conversation especially the part about verification chain a verifies chain B one of the big challenges that the op stack has is like what does it actually mean to actually be integrated is a harder question because it doesn't have ZK and so my my intuition is that using the ZK stack if you choose if somebody builds a ZK chain using the ZK stack these chains are inherently similar just much more interoperable with each other out of the box is that correct ah correct it's all about interoperability it's all like what makes a hyper chain hyper chain is the ability to have hyper Bridges dollar chains and Hyper bridges are bearing this resemblance to the hyperlinks on the internet one click from any page to any other page that is the whole Essence like the the interoperability of the the simple liquidity space is the essence of fiberging one of the questions I've been asking at bankless a lot is uh the the raw North Star of crypto system scaling at the to the level of the internet right like as we said unbounded well clearly that just means we need a Cambrian explosion of chains right if you if you accept the modular blockchain hypothesis which I totally do I've been one of the like leading proponents of it uh you know centralized monolithic chains don't don't scale we need chains on chains on chains we don't just need layer twos we need layers on layers on layers which implies some sort of like fractal growth of chains and so I've always been asking like how do we get to 10 000 plus chains right how do we get to the scale of the internet because that's the only way that we're going to do this is with like 10 000 chains and so this is zksync's answer to that question it's like how do we get to 10 000 chains we produce a modular framework of ZK chains that can all interoperate with each other this is my this is my summation of of uh this news is that is that am I on track here so this is our contribution to this to this Vision we are offering like indeed there is no um stack today that is fully open source and that people can use uh to build their own systems and we're we're offering that uh and we are giving it over to community to to work on this Vision together with us and own it so somebody that deploys a ZK stack chain how interoperable is it with other ZK stack chains like out of the box is it like uh what is that conversation like does it start off like mostly interoperable just a little bit interoperable how do I understand these things and like is does the interoperability grow over time can you just unpack the interoperability conversation sure the you can think of it in a similar way as uh um the uh vision of shards on ethereum on ethereum 2.0 the the original Vision that you have multiple charts and they you can talk to uh between like they they are separate they are distinct and you can send a message from Manisha to any other and you you can attach value to it you can you have a guarantee that the message will arrive there if there is a smart contract which you're talking to you have a guarantee that this smart contract will eventually be processed and you will get an asynchronous answer and so this is the this this really the The Reincarnation of the sharding vision for ethereum with the hyper chains just powered by the by the magic of ZK right but so what needs to be true in a ZK stack chain for for that to be able to happen right so if I if I deployed my own ZK stack chain is that true right out of the out of the box or like what do I need to do to make that true like is this like a conversation about the shared sequencers no you will not need share sequencer shared sequencers are a whole separate topic which can can be helpful for some use cases might not be helpful for other use cases it it has nothing to do with Hyper reaches uh the uh what you need to do is you need to embrace a certain standard of communication like there must be some certain basic ZK circuits shared by all of these chains they can deviate you can customize the chains the ZK stack is fully modular and allows you to customize things you can introduce your own token for staking or for for paying fees or you can introduce your own data availability policy uh with like choosing between the Ezekiel roll up ZK Porter Evolution or maybe a pure validium mode for some privacy applications uh you can customize your sequencer like you can do a lot of these things but there must be some common component which is this core ZK circuit which the chains can can trust because like if you're running the exactly same ZK circuit uh as the other chain then you can blindly trust the messages that come from this chain because you you have the consensus only theorem so you know the state of this chain at the latest Point precisely because you can read it from the ethereum state and you can you trust the validity of this message you trust that the all the execution happened exactly the same way you expected it and this is very similar to how internet works in the internet we have a lot of different applications different layers but there is this one basic layer of the IP or the Internet Protocol which describes the packages and they have to be compatible if you don't understand the AP format of the package you will not be able to connect to the internet right but on top of this AP protocol everything else all the other layers can deviate wildly this is similar here we are trying to Define this minimum uh minimal viable standard that glues the the hyper genes together okay I love that I love that definition so the the ZK stack it is a modular ZK chain stack where anything that is flexible is flexible anything that's a choice is a choice for the deployer if you want to use your data availability daily availability layer of Celestia you can eigenlayer you can the ethereum layer one you can so the only the thing that is the ZK stack again Alex correct me if I'm wrong is that the only choice that is made for using the ZK stack is using the same circuit and what does that do that does this one very important thing which is hooks in all the other ZK sync chains which again have each individually made their own choices about what that chain is and it looks like and what it hooks into but the only choice that's made is that you're using the same ZK circuit and that is how we have many many different chains all hyperlinking to each other and becoming the same ZK ecosystem that's my interpretation is that correct this is mostly correct there's one more component that all of the hyper chains not doesn't matter if ll2s or l3s they have to exist in the same ecosystem on layer one so like this is this is purely Technical and you can you can look into our technical documentation how exactly this is implemented uh but they have to share the the same liquidity base the same base Bridge smart contract on ethereum because otherwise you cannot really use hyper chains to to um to transact so I can try to explain what what makes hypertens different from all the chains that exist today which is um the uh sorry from from the bridges like today's Bridges between different chains between the roll ups or between layer ones are really not following the uh the metaphor of the bridge accurately like you bridge something that connects to Islands you know you have a you have a car on one Island and you want to move it to the other Island if you're at the bridge you would just like ride over the bridge so the car would not be on on the first island anymore it would appear on the second island this is not how the bridges work today some do like some usdc Bridge could work this way because you you rely on on you know like the car is magically uh minted and burned by by a central Authority but most other Bridges work in a way where you park the car on the parking lot on the first first Island you hand over your keys to someone uh who you know will manage it for you and then you walk on the other Island and you are given another car which represents your your first car so you can run ride around the the second island but like someone is still holding your keys of the original car and they could if they become Rock they could just get in and drive away and then you will not be able to get it back so all of a sudden your your other car becomes worthless because you you can't do much in like Yuki it's not really even a card it's just a voucher for a car right so the this is the this is how this all bridging Paradigm works and why it doesn't really work vitalik had a really interesting post about this with diving deep into technical nuances of why this inter blockchain uh bridging is fundamentally broken the hyper chains are are connected with Hyper bridges that enable this it precisely because all of the liquidity is living in a single big smart contract on layer one so the the statement is is that a yes have the ZK circuit then all the chains connect to each other and they must share the same base that same layer one yes is that that layer one is ethereum or are we talking about okay so it's it's as so long as any ZK stack chain hooks into the ethereum layer one then everything is interoperable correct this is correct it has to be on the same layer one you cannot build it between different layer ones so you could build uh hyper chains on a different chain uh like on a different layer one like maybe on uh on violence or or Solana or whatever but then they would not be interconnectable with ethereum Hyper chains yes okay cool well see this this goes into uh a lot of like bankless's early philosophy about like hey why does everything aggregate to one layer one why are we so focused on ethereum well because the layer twos are focused on ethereum and therefore the layer threes will be focused on ethereum and so on and and so forth Alex Anthony uh I've I've learned quite a lot I hope the listeners have learned quite a lot what are the next steps here so a congratulations for getting the ZK stack out in the open uh this is the these ZK technology embodies the values and and I'll use I'll quote my co-host here when they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values and to me this is exciting because we went through all of those uh principles that we talked about right trustless and security reliability censorship resistance privacy accessibility uh we get to scale these things to the fringes of the internet to the margins of the internet using this technology that is mentally uh scalable so that's that's just really exciting because this goes back to just the roots of like what are we doing doing here in crypto like 2022 kind of made us question that and so I'm very optimistic about like restoring principles and and Alex I really like what you said No Game Theory tech only like hard-coded in Tech we don't have to have like this game theory game of chicken to make sure that this thing is working uh and so I'm just really excited about this what what are the next steps so today uh ZK stack is released people can go check it out I'm assuming uh what what do you guys want people to do what should developers do uh what What's the correct call to action here what do you what do you want people to go do uh we encourage contributions we encourage people who want to build hyper chains to get in touch with us and speak to us and take a look at the code and get uh you know start building stuff prototyping uh on era and and then like building your own hyper chains and developers who want to contribute to the ZK stack are extremely welcome to work either with matter Labs or or just do contributions separately there are a platter of possibilities open talk to us Alex Anthony thank you so much I'm really excited for this uh these DK Frontier definitely appears to be upon us so thank you for helping it Usher into the world of crypto because we definitely could use some more self-sovereignty uh some more censorship resistance more privacy uh in this industry so I appreciate you guys and all the hard work that you guys have been doing over the past few years thank you David thank you Bank location you know the deal crypto is risky Defy is risky ZK technology there's probably reasons why it's risky too you can lose what you put in this is the frontier but we are headed west it's not for everyone we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] [Music]
