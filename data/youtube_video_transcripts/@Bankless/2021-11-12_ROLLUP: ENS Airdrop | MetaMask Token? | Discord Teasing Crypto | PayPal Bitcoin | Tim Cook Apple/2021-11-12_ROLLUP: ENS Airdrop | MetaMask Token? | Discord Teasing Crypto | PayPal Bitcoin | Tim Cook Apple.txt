[Music] happy second week of november bankless nation david what time is it it's the friday weekly roll up where we roll up the entire week of crypto it's my favorite part of the week is when we get to talk about all the crypto things all the fun things that happened and there's always one thing that's happening and then we get to talk about it for way too long and that's why these shows go for an hour and a half that's right but you know it's really fun it's like a way to digest everything that's going on it actually puts me at peace because every single week in crypto like i feel like this frenzy of frenetic activity and then after the weekly roll up i'm like ah i've absorbed it now i know what's going on like and that's why i enjoy this time too other than that it's just it's also fun there's so much going on but like i feel like the box is checked i got through another week of crypto and i absorbed as much material as i could yeah listeners think that we know all these things before we talk about them but no we're just learning as we read them aloud so let's go ahead and get started with that huh guys some hot topics this week including the ens airdrop all right so if you have a dot eth you probably had a right to claim some ens tokens and those skyrocketing price we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about the potential of other air drops as well metamask question mark question mark question mark discord teasing and ethereum integration they did some teasing too they're ceo nonetheless and then they kind of rug pulled it so let's talk about that uh tim cook is he bullish on crypto david and also bankless is launching a new podcast what yeah we are because we need another podcast wait are you doing your own podcast oh you'll have to tune into the full roll-up to hear all the details brian's doing a podcast all right yes right sure a few things we've got to mention before we get into it the first is this look at this uh this just dropped um last week this week it's still going on this is the bankless we're gonna make it hoodie dude i got a hoodie i also got a t-shirt you can get both of those this is a bankless dow meta factory

want this hoodie if you want the shirt go ahead and pick it up of course you put in your metamask and there's also some robot for you waiting on the other side uh eventually so people love the shirts that the bankless shirts that i'm wearing out at these crypto conferences and every time i tweet about it hey like where can i get that shirt and i'm like yo like it's too late you missed that's why you always have to get every single drop because you don't know if you're going to want it in the future or not so you can it's insurance right you got to get every single drop so it is scarce right you only have a specific time window if you don't get it there it never comes back it's gone yeah this is scarce merch yeah so that sale ends tonight at midnight eastern uh 9 p.m pacific time so if you are listening to this on friday morning you don't have too long to get this and if it's saturday you're too late you should listen to these on friday you sorry guys you're not gonna make it to the

bankless team the rest of the bank list staff all right david let's get to it man market time there's always stuff happening in the markets what's bitcoin doing to us or for us this week well remember how it was all-time high last week last week ryan oh yeah did that happen all-time high week this week yeah absolutely so yeah bitcoin painted a new all-time high of sixty eight thousand six hundred and forty dollars almost hitting that magic magic meme number of sixty nine thousand dollars not quite there uh tumbled up i tumbled a little bit off the high currently at sixty five thousand three hundred dollars uh oh no it no excuse me it's 64 700 dropped a little bit since last i checked overall up 3.6 on the week so bitcoin all-time high week for bitcoin congrats do you know what our friend raul paul said when we had him on in what august or so we're like hey give us some price targets right and i was thinking he'd be very you know like vague and not give a time horizon he's like boom 100k bitcoin end of year 10k eath end of year yep mike drop yup getting close feels very much within striking distance yeah we are within striking distance to raoul paul's numbers and uh you know that that didn't seem as likely a few months ago what's he doing for us same story also all-time high week hitting a new high of four thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars immediately after hitting that high it tumbles 350 dollars down to 4 500 it's crazy to see ether make 350 dollar moves inside of like one hour think how crazy think about that do you remember when eath was below 350 yeah that would have meant dropping to zero sir yeah but after tumbling 350 down to the low low price of 4 500 it has since reclined up to seven hundred and thirty dollars at the time of recording overall up almost four percent on the week so ether new time all-time high bitcoin all-time high all-time high week uh and also uh a little uh something behind the scenes but like the bankless uh podcast downloads charts looks like the the bitcoin and ether charts right now so we are also banking except it doesn't go down it doesn't go down that is true yeah up only on the bankless lessons yeah do you know what okay so you know two things one 5k continues to elude us right every other day when i when i see kind of like a run-up i'm just like 5k today question mark and i throw it out on twitter and it doesn't happen to me that's the top signal me i should stop doing that and like doing the anthony susano thing the other thing i'll say is like this drop the sudden 350 um uh dollar drop in the price of youth bitcoin got hit too was this like what were the rumors going around i saw like evergrand or something some sort of weird fud whatever i just pay no attention to these things because they're so temporal and temporary it didn't matter do you think that was just a you know explanation i have no for the price i have no clue right like it barely drops below where it started in the week and so like it went from like super high to just really high uh like maybe it was evergrand i don't know i just think it's funny at this point just don't try to explain these things right sometimes bots leverage traders games in the short run you'll see moves like this yeah you only see moves like this when you zoom in on the on the one week charts like when you zoom out on the one of your charts it doesn't actually show up let's do it yeah i'm gonna zoom out like you can't actually see it yeah like it's not there anymore it's gone wow look at that up and to the right can you go down to the very bottom of that up into the right trend right a little bit to like pass sometime between november and september where it just starts linearly going up right there okay so yeah around the early in october we have just been linearly up and to the right like yeah perfectly that's crazy that's crazy yeah this is stair stepping i guess like the future of these stairs are little uh hilltops little mountains we're just stair stepping out that's a really interesting looking chart let's zoom out a little further though look at that this is not logarithmic but you know yeah you can hit that line do you remember hit that like button on the bottom i'm i'm not i want to see it linear first do you remember 2018 yes this is the high my friend burned into my mind look at it just a tiny little tiny little blip yes a tiny little bit famously like there's a the trader trader memes is when like the top of the previous market cycle just doesn't actually show up anymore on linear view you can still see it but it's getting small it's getting pretty small do you know what's crazy is um i was listening to your uh griff green um later zero which is great by the way i really enjoyed that uh anyway um do you remember the dow crash yeah it went with it hit 20. right uh-huh you can't even see on the chart so this was like the massive uh like wiffo moment where where f'd it's over when the dow collapsed and eth price totally lost like 50 60 70 80 of its value basically in a very short time span like a month time period of time you can't even see it on this chart all right hit that like button just just see a piece appease me and the viewers yeah look at that that is a sustainable dude that is look how like vertical the price action was in 2017 right at that blow off top and look how not vertical it is right now like that that's pretty cool that's pretty cool this seems very sustainable are we falling in love with charts right now should we get someone on the bankless podcast to like chart with us perhaps perhaps i'm in conversations right now with ben cohen who i believe last i checked just said that he's down to come chart with us on tuesday so stated charlie chart show on the bankless uh livestream we don't do we don't do charting very often so this is a special treat and like i i do feel like it's uh it's kind of like candy it's it's a you know i'll partake in it every once in a while but i know it's not really good for me do you know but like every once in a while i'll indulge myself so that's what's happening hopefully next tuesday we'll have a charting show to the nation uh david another chart eath bitcoin ratio what are we looking like yeah in comparison to where we were at last week we are up just a tiny little smidge we were at point seven uh point zero seven two eight last week we are at point zero seven three so up basically like one percent on the week overall kind of flat but flat at a very very high level yeah we're kind of i guess we're looking at uh to see if we can beat the the highs of the year uh on the ratio and um looks like we're still getting close right the highs are point zero uh point zero eight yep yep so all right that will be a fun day when that breaks uh total locked value above 100 billion ryan likes to see that 112 billion dollars locked in d5 you know what's interesting about this week on total luck value d5 ryan uh what's interesting maker doubt number one it has been a long time since maker dao is the number one oh yes hello welcome back to the king's thrones maker that did you see there there was a uh somebody minted uh i can't oh did i put that tweet in there oh yeah i did put that tweet in there i don't know if you pulled it up or not um i don't think i did but yeah so one one single person i know i believe this is uh celsius actually it's celsius the the lending app uh unconfirmed though minted 150 million dollars of dye in one cell did this celsius minted 150 million dollars with a liquidation price of 3150 ether which is a pretty high number uh but yeah celsius minted 150 million dollars and that's why maker dow is number one in the tvl charts today well that's super interesting actually and that's interesting on a number of levels not just maker number one but celsius doing the minting that's kind of d5 mullet thesis celsius being sort of like a block file like a crypto bank if you will and they're doing something to generate yields now they're using d5 protocols right protocol sync yeah this is actually not new celsius has always been minting uh with maker just for no way i didn't know that yeah this is an old thing but like a hundred million 150 million dollars is that's the new thing like that's a large number it's a lot of money yeah that's news to me too though okay let's talk about the dpi d5 pulse index was it a good week for d5 oh you bet it was started at 370 currently clocking in at 410 up 9 on the week even hit a high of 442 dollars before that big drop uh so yeah dpi strong performance this week d5 is back baby that's too soon to say david's knocking on it yeah it's too soon to say but you know what tells us the truth is the defy to eat ratio here yo at this point flat is up it was flat this week the deep dpi versus up yeah that's not the most capitulation code sentence i've ever heard the dpi versus heath pair did not go down this week it held its ground in fact it is up point four percent so congratulations to dpi i wish i had some skis so i could ski down that hill david you'd be going real fast well um let's talk about bed which is the the ultimate split where you get a third a third or third third bitcoin third each and a third dpi what are we looking at on the week yeah very strong performance by the bed index which of course illustrates the market as a whole and the market as a whole was up 6.3 percent this week started the week at roughly 182 dollars currently clocking in at 195 and if you want to get some bad you can go buy it or mint it at indexcoop.combed sleep comfy in bed if crypto's stressing you out because of the volatility the bed index is meant for you so get comfy in bed i love this start man it's just so much more muted than like bitcoin and eth and dpi yeah because it's just like yeah well yes exactly and it's less like up and the down and it's it's just like it looks like the adult in the room here good job bed let's talk about this this happened and i barely remember it so apparently last week crypto market cap just topped three trillion dollars three trillion dollars um wow where does this end david where are we gonna end this uh this cycle over do you believe if you believe in cycles over 10 over 10 absolutely over 10 yeah that's easier to call now i feel like but like 3 trillion 12 months ago 18 months ago i remember i remember uh in december of 2017 we crossed a trillion dollar crypto market cap in in the ico mania and i remember asking my friends like all right like guys like bets on when we crossed 10 trillion dollars and i think i remember like saying may six months later yeah i was wrong i was the top but you know what like um this is how the human brain works right so like uh do you remember let's see 18 months ago again um people started calling us included started calling for like eth to 10k right right yeah now when i post hey ethan is still on the road to 10k everyone's like that's fud time kitchen 10k is bearish yeah yeah they're like 10k is bearish you know now people are calling for 100k and this is how the market always works right market psychology it's always like now 10 10 trillion dollars because we're at 3 trillion that feels very rational obviously it's going to 10 trillion you can't be wrong with that prediction sir right but like if you were to say a hundred trillion that would be crazy and if you were to say hey it's going back to 100 billion that would also be crazy right so this is how it always works every single cycle right bullet points are moved bullishness begets bullishness begets [ __ ] people like oh this thing's one dollar well if it can get to two dollars it could probably get to like five dollars and if it could get to five dollars it could probably get to ten dollars and then this just goes and goes and goes like oh i get ten dollars i get 100 and at some point like it just all blows up right like this turns into like this it turns on just like the this very ingrained like speculative fervor that humans have but again when i said when i look when we looked at the slope of bitcoin and ether very sustainable we're not there yet we're not there yet but maybe we will yeah i agree and uh you know there's different sectors now in crypto where things can bubble where other things are not bubbling um let's talk about this though i saw this chart so i'm gonna put out a fantastic report and this is um a graph of how long it took some major companies and also bitcoin to reach a 500 billion dollar valuation that's a lot so it took apple about 36 years to do that to hit 500 billion dollars in market cap in total value it took amazon less time 23 years it took tesla 17 years it took google just over 14 facebook did it in 13. you could see the trend here bitcoin did it in 12 years to 500 billion dollars eth just did it in six years right okay eth is the only chart that you see here that did it in less than half the time of the the other examples on the chart absolutely that's crazy this is i think this is um i mean what are we saying here like somebody could say well the value of the dollar is not what it used to be okay sure that's that's some effect but i think what we're really seeing is the difference between like these computing revolutions here right so you see like an apple which was a massive revolution in compute but it was physical like physical computers like the pc revolution it led that and then the lead mobile and then we get like kind of the internet with the google and the facebook and the and the amazon right and that's a revolution in it of itself now we have the network revolution the network economy that this has turned into and this is where you see ether and bitcoin and how fast the growth can be in these economies is absolutely astounding this is like blitz scale growth here yeah and there's such a such a strong story to be told here first off the pace of innovation of not just crypto but overall innovation always gets faster and faster and faster and when we start these shows we always say such a crazy week in crypto well when a network grossed a 500 billion dollar valuation in the most record time 5.8 years like that's because there's always so much stuff happening and this actually reminds me of that line that we said with a josh rosenthal and our crypto renaissance podcast the crypto renaissance the ren the actual renaissance took time because you actually had to build out the printing presses and then it had to actually diffuse out from a central point internet the ethereum is actually built being built on another network so it's a network on top of a network it's being birthed across the globe uh globally and like also it's not just bitcoin where there's only btc like you can do any assets any nfts whatever on ethereum and so this this malleability this open sourceness this permissionlessness of ethereum allowed it to be the fastest growing network uh in history which is pretty cool totally yeah chris dixon made the point when we had him on that um like the internet something like ethereum is a network of networks right all of these other examples are companies these are companies and so their permission you have to hire employees like with ethereum people just work for ethereum for free they set up shop there right they don't have to be hired and so it is continuously expanding in all of these directions at once so no wonder we're seeing this level of growth uh david this is uh your take this is from actually coinbase i believe this is their uh quarterly earnings report yeah what happened here yeah so last quarter it was the first quarter that ether volume uh was the number one traded asset on coinbase for the first time ever passing bitcoin uh and this quarter it happened again so for two quarters in a row ether the number one most traded asset on coinbase what is a definition of monetary premium right and what is money uh one of the definitions that we've talked about since like early in the podcast uh a couple years ago was liquidity depth of the order book is basically a good definition of money and this is always something that bitcoiners have have said for a long time right like what why is bitcoin money it's because it is the most saleable good the most liquid asset what's interesting when ether starts to surpass uh bitcoin on the exchanges um hard to deny now that ether is money and it meets the same criteria for money that bitcoin did although there was a lot of denial of that in 2018 and 2019. um yeah i feel i feel somewhat vindicated on that whole ethos money thing david how about you yeah 100 and i'd like to see the the numbers for other exchanges because centralized exchanges is where bitcoin finds its liquidity and ether can also find its liquidity there it's finding its liquidity there it's the most liquid uh asset on coinbase and that's not even counting all of the liquidity in defy and so if you want to add the global liquidity of ether you have to add the centralized exchange liquidity of which at least ether is dominating on coinbase and it's also clearly dominating in d5 because it's all on ethereum ether the most liquid asset of all time yeah it seems to be the case uh all right guys we got a lot more to talk about we're going to get to releases of course and the news of the week man there's so much news to talk about too but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back

on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right guys we are back talking about releases today david let's start here the ens airdrop this is the big one big airdrop maybe airdrop of the year i don't know if that's too much but it feels that way certainly because so far yeah yeah because if it's like like how many people actually received this for one but also the market cap of this thing has been absolutely extraordinary we had the ens guys on earlier this week so take a listen to that podcast and and take a look look at that show if you want all of the details but uh what happened here david we this is by the way our alpha alert so anytime a really cool thing happens like this an airdrop or something else we send it out to bankless premium members so they get notified but what was this airdrop what happened this week yeah so this has been a long time coming and no one really knew that the esteem was going to do an airdrop but if you had been paying attention to ens you would understand that the mission and culture and values of ens was to eventually have this thing managed by the community uh and so i remember talking to brantley milligan forever ago when they were talking when ens was really getting uh bootstrapped and talking about like oh so ens sells domains in eth but ens does not want to be a company ens wants to be a public utility and the reason why they have to sell domains is because of an anti-sybil mechanism if you don't but if you don't actually have to pay money for these things somebody will just claim all of them so they were selling ens names generating a treasury and now this protocol the name space of ethereum is now this public good and that doesn't that specifically should not be managed by two people or team of people but instead should be managed by the broader a community of people that are stakeholders and so this is just the perfect marriage between what we've all been talking about with dows and tokens and a public utility on ethereum so if you have an ens name uh that happened before the snapshot and the snapshot wasn't too long ago just a couple weeks ago um you can go claim your ens tokens uh there's a hundred million tokens they're currently trading for about 60 60 dollars uh the average airdrop recipient got between like maybe a hundred to three hundred tokens or so which is a pretty healthy amount uh and it uh there's a few a few formulas with how your uh your token amount was calculated the longer that you've had your ens name the the more tokens you get the longer you've renewed it for the more tokens you get if you've actually registered your ens name to an actual ethereum address you get even double double that all that information is in the state of the nation that we did with the ens team but this is this is really foundational ryan and i actually think that this is even more foundational than uniswap because ens is something deeper and closer and more related to ethereum the protocol itself than uniswap is they're both in the app layer but ethereum is really or but ens is really about the namespace of ethereum uh so i think that a lot of people wanted to compare ens to something like godaddy where you can register websites it's even bigger than that it's ens is actually comparison to dns where like the dot coms of the world and that is another uh dns is another global public good that has to be managed by this private company instead ens is now being managed by the people that are using it and so the ens dow is now being handed over to everyone that has a dot-e-address so we are all now managers of this open public good system yeah so like something like godaddy is just an app on top of of dns right it's not dns itself and and so reminding folks what this dot eth address is it's basically just a human readable name for you're an ether your ethereum address and recall an ethereum address okay one model of that is as a bank account so we talk about so often it's just like your self-sovereign bank account but more than a wallet more than a bank account more than a vault it's also your self-sovereign identity and it's becoming more like a passport uh every every single day so we talked with brantley and nick about the ability to sign on with ethereum i think these addresses are going to become increasingly important to individual identity in this whole web 3 world right so you're storing your nfts you're storing your tokens inside of your uh ether address if i want to send um some etu david or some tokens here an nft to you it's very easy i know you have davidhoffman.etha could just do that very easily rather than this like um public public key with all of these like characters um so very cool stuff you know one thing that blew my mind though is the price on this thing yes okay so like i know you know nick and brantley weren't the ones to talk price but let's see you and i talk price here for a second because this really surprised me all right so like here's the market cap of this thing and this is um not fully diluted marquee cap this is just like i guess market cap that is unlocked up in supply but here we are in coin market cap and we hit 1.3 billion dollars some highs of probably over 7 billion dollars in fully diluted market cap funds i think the peak was eight billion dollars yeah it peaked out at 80 yeah why do you understand like what like so why is this thing valuable to people right so like if you sign the constitution to get your drop which i did um it's basically like a not it's kind of a non-profit right you have governance rights in this thing you've been given a responsibility why do you think people are valuing it at six seven eight billion dollars i i definitely want to answer that question but i want to answer that question at the very end because it'll be easier to to explain that um and so some of the dynamics just to fill listeners in about what what happened here is like the ens token got air dropped then there was a bunch of shenanigans with the uniswap contract because everyone who didn't have enos wanted to buy it but there were zero liquidity at the very start and so if you were watching the uniswap like it would go like for a moment ens one ens token was worth a 577.100 thousand dollars and so like for a brief moment in time everyone was like a billionaire just by this weird proximity there being like no liquidity in uniswell eventually liquidity came in the market settled and that's where we started some to see some actual price discovery started around 20 to 30 uh which is again a two to three billion dollar valuation and then it zoomed up to 80 dollars per token and now it's currently clocking in at just below 60 a token but some really astonishing like imagine just like releasing your thing and like it immediately like it had no valuation enos had no public valuation it was managed by brantley by nick these guys that were just people eight people just stewards of this thing not taking profit and like not doing this for revenue just managing this open protocol and then boom the token launches and it comes out at clocking in at a max of eight billion dollars that's absolutely insane and so like to unpack what this thing actually is what ens actually is ens is a public goods it is a public good for ethereum the namespace of ethereum if you could go back one tweet right into my tweet the namespace of ethereum is a public good what do we call all of us because you can't we like uh ryan there's ryan uh here and then there's also ryan selkis we can't have two ryans one of them has got to be ryan s uh adams and one of them's got to be ryan s celcus right like we need two you hear that ryan sulcus there can't be two of us can't be two of us two different names one of us is going down you can't have con conflicting names because we need to actually point two things only one entity per name so that is called what is called a name space where we label all of the entities that exist in ethereum and with the ethereum name system we actually get to put in human readable names around these very complicated public addresses and so the ens is a public name space around ethereum the system for collectively deciding how we name things and this actually lends itself to how blockchains work ens is a consensus system it's a consensus for all identifying how we name all the things just like how a blockchain comes to consensus ens is a public goods that comes to consensus about how we name all the things so just like ethereum itself ens is a public good that needs to be protected from free riders and this is the magic of ethereum this is why this gets me so excited ethereum as a protocol like you said a network of networks ethereum as a protocol is finally able to price in public goods in ways that we've never seen before so like clean water clean air the free market doesn't do a very good job of like pricing in those those free resources ens is a resource and a system that is now establishing a market value which is somewhere between four and eight billion dollars right now and just how like proof of sake and proof of work is the protection around blockchains the value of the ens token is the protection around the ethereum name system and so ethereum is unlocking the free market to actually finally price a public utility and so ryan to answer your question about why this is so valuable it's because we don't know how valuable this thing is we have never been able to price public goods like this and so like and then like the the bullish side of that is like oh my god we don't know how to price these things like the last thing i learned that we didn't know how to price was ether and like the sky's the limit on that one the other the bear case is that these are public goods like it's actually really hard to like monetize public goods that's actually why they're called public goods so maybe they're not worth that much this is going to be a grand experiment about finally pricing in some public goods for the first time ever and i i think the price action is really going to be emblematic of how well ethereum can finally price these things that have always been left out of the market and ultimately caused a lot of human suffering but that's a topic for a different day yeah there's a you had a lot to say about that there's a lot there's a lot there i mean one thing one point that brantley makes is this yeah you were not dropped airdropped free money you were airdropped responsibility that's another way to look at it um i think the ultimate question of what you're saying is like the question of how to price a public good whether right now six billion dollars is overpriced or whether six billion dollars is is underpriced is ultimately decided by individuals who own ens tokens all right and so you tweeted this out raise your hand if you're holding your ens drop i choose to bear this responsibility so the question to everyone who just received this of which there are like a hundred and fifty thousand more or about 150 000 or so east addresses that were eligible to receive this is what you gonna do it's worth six billion dollars you probably made thousands of dollars on this i know people have made tens of thousands of dollars easily on this airdrop so what are you gonna do you gonna sell it are you gonna hold and if you're gonna hold are you gonna bear the responsibility of voting but it's awfully tempting to sell at these prices is it not and so what are people doing they're not selling right that's why price is going up a lot of people have decided that it's worth holding on to this thing could be more valuable in the future they want to participate in this network at any cost and so they're not selling but i've actually been pretty surprised at where supply and demand have kind of met with the valuation of this thing and to your point like nobody knows how to price it okay but like i feel like some things in crypto are definitely overpriced right now i just honestly i don't know whether ens is overpriced or underpriced like it's a legitimate project this is not smoke and mirrors this could be insanely valuable uh like team is fantastic the distribution seems to be and they distribute it to all a whole bunch of eath bulls who have done well on eath and so they're going to be some of the last people to sell right but like is it worth six billion dollars i legitimately don't know so let me ask you the question did you sell or did you hold david uh so my two ens names that i have at trestlestate.eve and david hoffman dottie those private keys are in seattle so i am holding okay yeah i know i can't it's all hypothetical yeah but i actually i have actually bought some in addition to that as well and so i've actually doubled what my airdrop is worth by buying some uh and i think i'm gonna be holding that for for a good long while uh and like it's also really something that's really if you're paying attention to the crypto twitter sphere something that's also emerges there's a big like culture around ens right now and i i i think it's just this very emergent property of everyone being really really excited about ens so like these memes are coming out and in the same vein that we saw memes about like chain link and all these other memes there's a there's a holding culture around ens right now which is like pretty damn cool we're gonna have we are going to have two moments of zen at the end of this podcast it's so good and they are absolutely phenomenal there are two songs about ens and ens dao they are actually catchy and i i hope you guys stay tuned to the very end so you guys can can listen to that oh yeah how can you not ens stands for everyone not selling i guess right that's the meme here can i can i get you in on a little bit more hope you and ryan yeah well you're gonna you're gonna crank me up on more ens or more ens hopefully okay convince me so i i have a claim to now david um part of me thinks that this is a bit overvalued my friend i love ens as a project it's fantastic i'm incredibly bullish but why should i hold at these prices how many funds do you think have purchased or invested in in ens vcu funds zero zero funds zero hedge funds it's all people no one's gonna dump on me no one there's no one to dump on you it's all people all the way down there's the only people that got the ens tokens were people that were using the ens system or were part of the ens team which was like you know building the ens system uh so yeah there's no one to dump on you like that's except my friends except your friends my friends and your friends right and so like this is kind of like dumb we can pump this thing to the moon if we all agree to not sell this is how this works i think it's a great project and look guys this is just another reminder to you of the value of using these protocols we've been saying this for the past like two and a half years okay use these protocols there's like we're not just saying there's you'll be rewarded as and you'll learn a new skill and there'll be some educational rewards and it'll enrich your life no you get free money like why are you not using these protocols okay like when we say you're getting rewarded you're literally getting airdropped money okay tokens value responsibility as well but these things have have value so we we published an airdrop guide about two and a half weeks ago now so it had 25 different opportunities this was number 16 guys so that that went to bankless premium members that's another reason you should subscribe i feel like we're uh we're shilling the bankless premium but like look what's the roi on that you spend 22 dollars a week and you get a few thousand dollars a month yeah sorry a week it would still be worth it though yeah yeah i did see a fantastic uh there was i think we put a meme on the weekly roll up a number of uh like a month or two ago about uh somebody's daughter wearing one of the crypto the cypherpunk t-shirts in middle school yeah that person's daughter got the ens drop no a middle schooler got a twenty thousand dollar ens drop changed her life andrew yang just got it andrew yang got it you're welcome we gotta go help andrew yang claim his airdrop we should put it in his address and see how much he got actually but anyway guys airdrop season really fun i think this is the airdrop of the year there's some great ones this year dydx but nah i don't know this is really fun from distribution perspective david we got to burn through these man we spent a lot of time on that but uh let's talk about this new podcast launch we teased it in the intro overpriced jpegs what is happening here oh ryan this isn't you this is carly no this is not me this is riley yeah newest you guys don't want to hear another podcast with me in it dear lord they probably those things probably do no overpriced jpegs with carly riley exploring the world of nfts and the metaverse we've always wanted an nft podcast carly riley's the person to do it uh ryan met carly riley while he was on the yang speaks podcast carly riley is the former finance manager for the andrew yang campaign sorry andrew yang for stealing your finance manager but she's great uh and yeah so now she's starting her own podcast part of the bankless network uh and so there are links in the show notes so go subscribe to overpriced jpegs it's going to be on a different rss feed than the bankless podcast so you need to go subscribe to that it is going to come out on the bankless youtube so we're going to share the youtubes but carly gets her own rss feed and i'm really really stoked for this carly is a fantastic content producer she's a great speaker she's a ton of fun uh and yeah i'm really really excited for this she's articulate she she knows her stuff i yeah i couldn't be more excited about the talent we're bringing in here and think of this as like the sister companion to bankless this is if bankless is we definitely talk about the metaverse and nfts and you know but like the show is also called bankless so you know we're going to be coming back to d5 and crypto money systems or these things this is the sister that talks about nfts in the metaverse all the time right you need this in your life two episodes a week one with a weekly recap the other with interviews you need this in your life so go hit subscribe if you like bankless you're gonna love this um all right david more releases a cross protocol is live this is like a hop this is like a connects this is a bridge but they're doing something different you could be a co-founder apparently you joined their discord you could be a co-founder they've like created a dow from inception in this thing what's going on yeah across protocol and one of the many many protocols for bridging money across the layered two and so that's not everyone i think by now people understand this we got hot protocol we got connects there's also mover now there's a cross just illustrating you how vibrant this market is going to be there's going to be a lot of value to be won by whoever can win through in their market in their network effects to be the cross chain protocol this one has this very interesting strategy of what they are calling a fair fair launch fair launches are no longer fair they've kind of been like played out and gamified but this they're trying to do a brand new experiment and i think this is this experiment by itself is going to be fun to launch where they are going to mint a dow token and then as a community they're just going to like manually figure out how to give it to right and so the community is going to determine the distribution right so not one person isn't top down this isn't a retroactive airdrop which is getting farmed this is going to be a very interesting experiment to see like can the can we just mint a bunch of tokens and then collectively agree as to who to get the who to give them to uh and i think that's it's humans all the way down right and so the human choices of this dow as to how they're giving out the tokens and the uh the if they can make sure that they do it correctly and not get corrupted along the way is going to be extremely bullish just for not only a cross but all the concept of token distribution at in general it's like it kind of like throws it into the face like you know retroactive air drops meh yield farming met let's just pick and choose let's just put in the labor to pick and choose who gets the token yeah and what i've seen with something like this it's going to be like meritocracy it's like you know that word gets used a lot and it gets abused a lot right it's like our company is a meritocracy right no it's probably not really a marital this is going to be much more like a meritocracy because i've seen these dowels in the early stages how they work is basically join a discord okay your co-founder i joined the discord i'm a co-founder i don't have time to like figure out everything the dow needs i don't i'm like involved in other doubts but i'll be kind of a small like time co-founder i guess but if you want to figure out exactly what the dow needs take a leadership role start contributing start actively doing things for the dow you can quickly rise up the ranks and you'll get rewarded on the other side this is like the create your own job path and people would be surprised at how many of these opportunities now exist in crypto and it's pretty unique it's unique like you don't find this in the regular economy i'm going to join a discord i'm going to figure out what's needed i'm going to create my own job based on what like it's it's a form of network entrepreneurship right you join a network you be a entrepreneur in that network and you create your own job that's what's happening in these dials and i think that's what across is doing i've always thought that the most bullish dows are the ones that figure out how to collapse the cost of contribution down to the absolute minimum so anything can be can be contributed and a part of that is the incentive and when you're very limited contribution of like oh guys i made a meme and you actually like get some tokens out of that like that's that's interesting so fantastic experiment let's see how this plays out absolutely okay coinbase uh brian armstrong said that they would be the defy exchange we were hoping for they just released the coinbase wallet as a standalone browser extension so you know how you have meta mask in your desktop browser well now you can also have coinbase wallet i haven't tried this yet but i i need to and it's good to see metamask having some competition in this space what are your thoughts david yeah that's exactly right like more competition the better metamask gets an unfair amount of flack for like basically supporting entire ecosystems worth of like uh support request tickets for things that are just outside of their control and so there's the front lines there's there's been a ton of hate on metamask lately and it's totally unjustified though they are doing like yeah they are doing they are spreading the mission and it's just like unfortunate that they that the entire crypto web 3 funnel funnels down onto metamask but congratulations to coinbase like this is this is your guys's win uh we want more browsers extensions i said at the beginning of this week that i think coinbase is turning a page i think they have kind of figured their their stick out and they are really like going hard into this whole web three defy world and uh this is an example of that yeah absolutely i mean we we went into the brian armstrong podcast and our mission was basically to say like hey it seems like coinbase hasn't selected its strategy for what it's going to do in d5 right with smart contracts and all of this what is your strategy right and i think brian said i'm gonna double down on open credibly neutral protocols and this is an example of that so hopefully uh these words are followed up with actions we're starting to see them rocket pool speaking of open incredibly neutral protocols yeah so tell us about rocket pools staking your eth in rocket pool um what just launched and um what's what's still unavailable too david yeah rocket pool main net has launched so rocket pool is a decentralized staking as a service protocol so if you want to stake your ether but you don't want to run a node but you also don't want to trust anyone to run a node rocket pool is a protocol for running nodes in a trustless fashion and so it's a it's a home away from home with regards to staking your eth they have it's been a long time coming for rocketpool to get launched they are finally live in a very limited capacity kind of in the same way that like arbitrarium and optimism have spun out their l2s in a very constrained fashion rocket bull has started its main net in a constrained fashion they've actually already hit their limit but the the limit is going to be expanded and expanded and expanded over time and so the rocket pool is going to be i think a very favorable place to stake your ether rocket pool has captured my love from a very beginning from very early days in ethereum they've been around for since 2017 just building and the cool thing about rocket pool is they have not cut any corners they have stayed decentralized through and through so like there's no multi-sig there's there's no no anything uh and it's actually that strategy has while it's very honorable has actually cost them in adoption but now that they're here now that they are alive they are out the gate and i'm really excited to see what rock and pool can do so congratulations to the entire rocket pool team and the entire rocket pool community that is stuck stuck with rocket pool i think because of the values that rocket pool has upheld so really really a nice day yup you can't stake your eath with rocket pool right now but as david said these um they're going to be expanding soon so they're out there you could have right but it could have it got felt it got filled up in the first 45 seconds as well and it was only like 150 eth but they're gonna like every single phase i think maybe on a weekly basis they're going to uh increase capacity and they're just doing this to have a measured phase launch so this will be available to everyone pretty soon um speaking of being available to everyone pretty soon david airdrop season okay this is joe lubin uh responding to something on twitter a little a little bit of drama but it's kind of aside from the story okay yeah yeah so aside from the story the main point is um he's hypothetically asking the question are we driving towards decentralization uh we are driving towards the centralization of seven uh several of our projects joe lubin says when mask question mark that's the metamask token by the way stay tuned and then he says something snarky but that's the main thing it's like when mask stay tuned so this little tease metamask with an airdrop okay this is like this is like the industry's best kept secret like it's gonna happen guys what do you do to get this airdrop all right you use metamask specifically use swaps not financial advice we don't know for sure we have no insider information this could also not happen but like it could happen yeah joseph lubin the leader of consensus which owns metamask goes when dollar sign mask stay tuned there was also another clip of the metamask i think community call answering this question when token they said uh we have no plans for a token but we are actively investigating the best ways to engineer a token and also distribute like this there's probably going to be a token uh i used to think that it was just totally going to be off of the swaps because that's the only verifiable way that metamask it can be a component it's definitely probably a component about it there's other ways to as well like but that involves like going into infuria where metamask routes its orders and then collecting the addresses that have used in fura to airdrop tokens there i think that distributions it's a very hard problem just by the nature of what metamask is metamask doesn't actually know what uh ethereum addresses are in it or not uh and so that's why the swap feature is the only verifiable way to airdrop a metamask token i think they're trying to spin up some sort of alternative distribution plan because i think that the distribution for mask is going to be really really hard but we're going to see how that goes yeah absolutely and again just saying the ultimate guide to air drops i'm sure this was listed in it meta mask yup uh let's see that was number oh that it's in there it's in there somewhere it's in there it's in there somewhere yeah oh it's an honorable mention okay so you're not just getting 25 you're getting like uh 35 40 or so air drops in uh the ultimate guide to airdrop which was published by bankless bankless premium you do that you get that all right let's talk about this what is diet wormhole david is another release for the week this is really really cool this is about the layer 2 ecosystem and this is maker dao with one of the coolest innovations i think of one of the coolest innovations of the year uh and so what this means is dye can now be minted on any of the l2s arbitrarum starknet fuel all these layer twos and this is not dye being minted on the layer one and being sent to the l2 via a cross train like hop like cross like connext or hot protocol you're actually minting it you are through a wormhole you are wormhole minting dye natively on the l2 and so it's coming out of the maker contracts out of l1 but being minted on l2 and so this there are some crazy cryptographic consensus magic going on here uh but this is exactly why roon christensen was talking about the differences between layer 2 roll-ups and multi-sig bridges you could not have built a wormhole through a multi-sig bridge you can only build a wormhole through a roll-up we're just we're just making up this is a wormhole is not a technical term by the way we are just making this up because that's a great metaphor but i'm getting the visual yeah and is this available now or is this i think so um maybe i bet you i think maybe the contracts are live maybe the ui's not not quite there yet but yeah this is a fascinating development where you like you can just birth an asset anywhere around the layer two ecosystem without having to use hop without having to use k'nex not that using those things are bad but it's just like you know efficiency but it gets efficiency i'm just paying layer two gas fuse i'm not paying main net gas fees right yes right wow yeah men's wire hunting die on l1 would cost over a hundred to two hundred dollars minting die on l2 costs uh 10 cents man i need to read more about this this is uh actually this this is the first time seeing this um let's talk about this rebrand for uniswap yeah rebranding potentially this is a governance vote still the unicorn this looks like a medieval unicorn something you'd put on like a knight shield like a suit of arms what's what's going on here okay ryan let's play a game here on the count of three thumbs up or thumbs down whether you like it ready okay three two one yeah so people can see that i like number four actually because that preserves in the simplicity that i love but like yeah one two three just a bit too complicated for me two's a little bit of a mess yeah it doesn't have like the apple you know esque simplicity can i draw it in the sand that means it's a good logo like that's a good taste it's a little too much for me but i like it like i would you know put this on my shield maybe that shield that you have i i like pulling forward like the medieval era of europe into like defy it's just like such a such a juxtaposition that it's so crazy that it kind of works um this is actually not official so this is actually going out for governance vote so if you are a uni token holder and you want to participate in say or name so yeah you wanna swap getting a rebrand question mark yeah you know what so this is the thing i feel like we're post uh medieval era david i feel like we're renaissance is this right yeah okay oh there web web two is medieval all right we are we are renaissance and then moving into the modern era that's what uh whatever josh we need your help joshua josh rosenthal what are we in uh raises okay matter labs uh matter labs just announced 50 million in new funding for zk sync pretty excited about this because this is like a starkware esque uh zk roll up it's going to have the evm general purpose smart contracts inside of a roll-up um they released some sort of a a test net i believe um a month or two ago i'm not sure when maynet is coming but it has to be soon and they just raised another 50 million dollars pretty impressive congrats matter labs what's the valuation on this now after they raised 50 50 million uh [Music] are hot and they're raising and they're well funded and yeah they're coming they're going to be here there were other races this week but uh that's the only one that we got yeah that's the only one we're talking about it's the best one yet jobs what's the reminder david get a job why haven't you got a job in crypto yet your web 2 job is not as cool as a web 3 job if you're not even in web 2 then it's definitely not as cool uh get a job get a job in crypto okay either work for a dow or work for a protocol company or some sort of company in crypto okay you're listening to bank lists so you obviously are already down the rabbit hole crypto's probably one of the top five things that you think about all the time if not like the number one thing so why not let it consume all of your waking hours just let it happen just let just let it just happen just give just give in just give up people people tell them have told me david that i say the word capitulate too often i was just about to say the word capitulate you should capitulate and get a job into crypto yes yes let's talk about these jobs uh these are new this week oh bit live section wise nice all right okay so bitwise is an asset management company bridging kind of the i guess the old world of finance and the new world of crypto love that company doing god's work by funneling boomer money into our crypto assets look at these job titles oh my god crypto research analyst nft specialist what wow that's awesome dream job research analysts you research smart contract platforms in web 3 all day you want to spend all of your day doing those things a crypto research analyst is a governance specialist these job titles are amazing okay governance specialists i want to hang on this one real quick because it's really really cool bit wise it's an asset management company they have assets under management they have to be governors and so you can be a governor specialist for managing the governance of i think they have tokens that you have to vote like be a proxy voter for yeah right how crazy is that so you have to wow it's such cool jobs guys uh head of growth at dex guru sounds amazing technical lead at draft lee an accountant at smart defy a product manager smart defy head of research at immutable sorry head of ethereum research at immutable head of tokens at immutable community manager dexable lead engineer at hat stop finance community manager e agronom a cto at e agronomy senior back end engineer smart d5 block chain technical cto merit community manager argon founding blockchain engineer highlight i could go on there are so many jobs on this job board now we have promised to read all of the featured jobs so that's what we have done guys but what you need to do is go to the jobs board link at the show notes bankless.pallet xyz jobs hit subscribe you get these via email and not only do you hear it from us weekly to get a job you get an email alert saying here are the jobs that you can get that's what you need to do yes uh man you don't find job titles like this anywhere else this is crypto i'm bummed that we don't have a meme lord but that's because all the meme lord jobs get snapped up too damn fast that's right we could use another meme lord too yeah maybe we'll post around david all right uh let's talk news of the week all right big news of the week let's start with a discord what are they doing man i would discord is where i spend so much of my time it is the the office for crypto that's like i'm going to the office and basically log into a discord server what did they tease this week yeah they tease an ethereum integration the ceo of discord says probably nothing with an image of the discord icon plus ethereum and it also has metamask and wallet connect right next to the connections page so some sort of like address authentication address integration into discord uh being teased ryan they know what we want they know they do know what we want they do know exactly what we want sadly there is a very sad part two of the story uh part two after uh let's see about a day later the same ceo tweets out thank you for all the perspectives everyone we have no current plans to ship this internal concept for now we're focusing on protecting users from spam scams and fraud web 3 has a lots of good but also lots of problems and we need to work through at our scale more soon so like they tweeze this they teased this thing and then they had to say like don't worry guys we're not actually doing this so yeah what the hell happened you wanted this is a two-day period this is by the way these are like tweets from the ct from the ceo jason citron who is the founder of discord right this is the guy who who would be in the know it almost feels like um something happened within that 48 hour period of time to like chill him on the concept or chill them on the concept they get it like a call from a regulator like what do you think happened uh they got i think we know what happened is that he got absolutely mobbed by the anti-crypto folk of the world right and no way yeah so here here's anthony xerox saying on a tweet this is uh this is wild there are literally hundreds of quote tweets like this people quote tweeting the the discord ceo and he also says imagine being this uninformed about something but also still have such a strong opinion about it so there are four tweets in here okay so uh somebody somebody who's not encrypted twitter says so this is the discord ceo teasing some sort of crypto integration make sure to let him know discord know how much you hate this both on twitter and here go there make a thread yell tell your friends to do the same thing nfts and crypto belong in the trash that's just one there's another one let's go on uh i don't like to use my platform for big statements often but discord recently had a work in progress uh yeah a work in progress blog post about a partnership with axi a community that exploits people in an mlm structure indebting new users and making them share personal data this is the antithesis of trust and safety we could go on there so apparently the discord yeah uh i am canceling my nitro subscription immediately and will be encouraging all my friends and followers to do the same i will not support a platform that aligns itself with crypto and nfts not to mention mlm schemes and sharing of personal data oof rough mla is multi-level marketing yes big oof big oof the ceo of discord informally teasing integration with ethereum while it's ethereum misspelled isn't surprising discord is a home of number of nft griffs masquerading as exciting projects and it's end vogue about know nothing tech lords but it's definitely a disappointing development damn i want to swear nothing i want to say everyone f off you don't know what you're talking about like ugh it's so frustrating and like this goes back to the cognitive dissonance that people have about cryptos like oh you didn't get rich off bitcoin well you hate it because of the environment oh like you haven't made any money off nfts that's because they're a scam oh mlm schemes guess what the dollar is an mlm scheme like it's so frustrating it's so frustrating and the fact like i understand as a ceo why he had to capitulate to this here's me seeing capituli but like damn is it is it really frustrating because like that could do like sign in with ethereum self authenticated like self sovereign identity where you don't have to sell your data to google or yahoo or facebook to sign in is the exact opposite of what they're talking about david here's the thing dude it's just a login with metamask if you don't like it don't freaking use it yeah if you don't like it don't use it why are you getting mad that somebody's building an integration to something like look the biggest discord server in the world is axey infiniti right right don't you think those members of discord those users of discord would like some integration with their metamask wallet i asked this question because i saw some of this pushback i actually didn't read everything that um that you just put out but um this guy said discord is pausing nft plans after the huge backlash apparently some people in the gaming studio totally hate nfts and i was previously unaware of that but you read some of the the quote tweets so i asked the question of um one of the guys who uh was tweeting this why like why do you hate it um and this is his response oh well you should give it able to view it i i may have just gotten blocked open it open it up in a private browser then okay let me let me try to open it up in a pr you can open that okay let me open it up a private i didn't even respond to it anyway you didn't get blocked i got blocked by basically saying okay so just so people know here's my response um uh he ryan tweeted this and he linked me to this thread and i said i appreciate this reply this is exactly what i was looking for i'm not going to use this thread to push back against these points but i hope you stay tuned into the nft community to hear the counter arguments apparently i got blocked over that yeah um anyway so it goes but basically the the thread now that i can see it in um incognito mode nfts are harmful to games and the entire thread is basically a few points one um energy okay so like the environmental issue every nft um that kills the environment right um which by the way in six months the ethereum emerged that'll no longer be an issue ethereum will reduce its energy expenditure by 99.9 percent if you know anything about this you've done any research then you obviously know that nfts are not on bitcoin also like individual nfts don't actually add more carbon to the air it's just like ethereum c ecosystem as a whole it's not nfts yes exactly that's another subtle point that seems to be missed and then going through it it's basically like play to earn is is um toxic to the gameplay mechanics right turns it into a multi-level marketing type scheme right and it's like my response says well then just don't play those games you're not losing anything from the existing games that you play like you don't have to play an axi if you don't want to and uh and then um they basically don't believe the premise of we control you control what you buy so they're like it's you already control what you buy in a centralized database and if the gaming company goes away then like the nfts go away anyway right so that's another point not really understanding the difference between like like property rights and being able to port your nft from game to game um also the one good point in this thread was basically a point that we've talked about before which is like what happens if all of the games turn into like these grinds for um for money right right what does that do to gameplay does that remove the fun right so like a whole massive thread of criticisms maybe a few points but mostly misinformation big thing like big swing and a miss so again i i don't understand why there's this disconnect and i didn't even realize until this discord thing that some of the gaming industry actually hate crypto like they hate nfds and they hate what we're doing here i didn't realize any of this was the case but i think there's a massive amount of um misinformation out there and just like like lack of education on what crypto is actually trying to do any other thoughts here yeah the concern about like what happens if these games just turn into a grind and they suck out all the the life out of the game you know what else is a grind working from below poverty wages in a country that doesn't have jobs to support you that's also a grind and that really sucks and so like gatekeeping is like oh i don't want to dilute the art of my industry to the point where like you actually are like revoking people's ability to make an income from themselves they do not know that the reason why accident infinity's so incredibly large is because it's supporting an entire like country's gdp right now it got people through kovitz philippines yeah so like sometimes this is why like these i understand that people have cognitive dissonance about accepting crypto there's a lot to swallow it really breaks people's brains but also you are doing so much harm by just jumping to conclusions that these things are harmful you are it is extremely frustrating i will stop there it is yeah it is extremely frustrating but now we know this pushback exists so uh we could talk about a little bit more uh no push back and saw the bees though they are auctioning off as many nfts as they could and this one is actually denominated in eth and it's for banksy art david what's what's the significance yeah so if i'm getting the story correct banksy went up to sotheby's and made a stipulation saying hey when you auction off my piece of art you have to do it in eth and so there's going to be a live auction for a banksy art piece and this is the auctioneer it's going to be like can i get 50 50 50 50 can i get 60 75 east that's crazy imagine how many like non-ethereum people very rich art collectors are gonna be in that crowd hearing and instead of dying out with their calculators that's exactly right instead of hearing dollars hearing eath and like this goes back to like uh the the whole the first time we had this nfte like bubble where we started realizing that art is going to be priced in eth well part of that statement was because we thought all art was going to be digital but now ether is moving into physical art so physical art is starting to get priced in each that's crazy it is crazy and it's super cool and uh yeah it's it's unexpected that it's happening so quickly it's what i would say um let's talk about this though some some bad news on the nft side is like the games are fun to play the art is fun to collect but the tax optimizer is here to ask have you thought about your taxes this year this stuff this was an article i read david nft games are fun filing taxes afterward is a nightmare i'm not going to go through this this whole article but it's just kind of a psa that the way the irs and other nation states treat game items is as like physical property okay so if your axi breeds with another axi and you get a new axi then you got a new asset and if you swap that asset for another axi it's an asset to asset trade and there's a capital gain on that trade and i bet none of you listening are tracking that stuff right no gamers are okay why would they but this is what the tax code says and what i'm saying is as ludicrous as this sounds right um one you should be aware of it and conscious of it because if you want to do the letter of the law with taxes you have to record these transactions but two my god how could we tax games in this way how can we tax digital goods in this way there's got to be a better system than recording every single time and reporting the irs every single time and axi infinity mates okay like we gotta we gotta do better than this david do you have any answers for us oh no answers but just more illustrations of how nonsensical this is imagine you're like you're you're grinding against this boss you killed this boss it drops like a legendary sword and you're like [ __ ] if i pick that up that's it i can't pick that up and when you pick that up right it's a tax event at that moment and oh my god that that sword is worth a thousand dollars so now you have a thousand dollars in ordinary income you have to file on your taxes and so i like terrible we already know that like crypto the way crypto works it's like just incongruent with a tax code but like previously like the defy tokens and and like normal ether like it wasn't that bad where you can still do your taxes complaining and like stocks d5 summer came along and started to really really get hard mess once gaming is here it's like it is it's like you are we all have to rewrite the tax code or else you are getting none of it because gamers do not give a [ __ ] about their taxes well but look listen to this imagine the exact same scenario i laid out right draw boss drops an item you go to pick up your sword right and it's a taxable event and you're 10 years old you're a 10 year old kid little bob is going to go to jail sorry sorry bobby i hope you've reported that sword to the irs god man anyway but you gotta stop playing the games your parents can't afford the tax bill it's bobby's responsibility sorry damn bobby all right all right let's talk about this sometimes yeah well you know what taxes can be fun right david joking about that that's for sure bitcoin news the new york city mayor-elect eric adams is going to take his first paycheck his first three paychecks rather in bitcoin wow this is a flag in the ground and he's saying basically i want new york city to be a crypto friendly city mayors around the country around the us have done this right mayor of miami some other mayors as well and it's really cool that they're doing this vitalik at this blog post about like crypto cities you know mayors and cities have a bit more uh ability to be flexible and experiment and new york city is actually talking about launching a new york city coin i wonder what they're going to do with this but it's kind of interesting eric adams says we're glad to welcome you to the global home of web 3. they're starting to see the jobs potential the economic prosperity potential they're starting to make the connection between that and web 3 and crypto what it what's your take david yeah this new york city coin it's of the same category as like the miami coin that happened not too long ago this is built on this dax side chain bridge thing off of bitcoin i'm not sure that connection there um and uh which is kind of weird because like bitcoiners generally don't like tokens especially especially not like city tokens but if there's enough traction to justify you know another a new york coin like absolutely let's do it uh so let's see what happens here i still don't know what this whole city coin thing is about but i mean i'm a fan of experiments i really don't know either and mostly i'm a fan of politicians saying hey we want this jurisdiction to be friendly to crypto um all right let's talk about there i guess i have to consent something okay crypto firm grayscale this is big crypto firm grayscale just hit 60 billion in assets under management what's interesting about this is this is now larger than the top gold etf and this is both incredible from a growth perspective but what a tragedy okay what a tragedy that we have not really an etf but a fund that has additional rent extraction like you know one two percent i forget what the grayscale uh management fees are rather than an etf and it's grown as big as gold and it doesn't actually track bitcoin closely not perfectly exactly all right so like the sec is in action on ets i know we got a features based etf we need a spot etf just take this grayscale etf and convert it to an etf do the right thing guys we're now we're bigger than gold you've waited four years too long for this four years too long retail could have had this already now you need to make up for for lost time is the svc listening you think to this david you think they're going to do that well hester pierce is yeah hey hester hey esther uh yeah we love your work by the way hasta we just you know sec has got gotta get moving on some things um gary though lukewarm on him yeah we'll see we'll come on the podcast and persuade us david uh jake travinsky okay the infrastructure bill you probably heard about this had some really um terrible language uh in the bill regarding um tax reporting and crypto and all of these things it passed right so it's a pass in the house looks like it's it's moving towards approval or was it approved david i didn't catch up on the news last week okay i don't know either but like for crypto what you know this is not great uh crypto stood up and pushed it out but here's i think the main takeaway there's nothing really we can do at this point in time okay so like how is this going to get resolved do you think david um well if this that does actually go into effects like 75 of the infrastructure that makes this crypto industry work becomes illegal uh and so at that point where did we just go to the courts because like it's not like we're gonna stop doing this uh and so i think we might have a destiny in court which will be fun to watch yep and it probably it doesn't take into effect until uh 2024 so keep that in mind also there will be some legislative pushes from basically the crypto lobby people listening to this um to get this amendment get this stripped from the bill so they'll be that pushed and then ultimately if all of this fails then we take it to the court system so not the end of the world i think crypto made a valiant stand against this and i think we'll have some other you know um steps up to bat to try to get this language out but we we got to remain vigilant and i guess that's a story there's nothing we can do at this point in time but we will sound the alarm when there's more that we can do on this sort of thing uh jerry britto has a good comment on that too we'll include that in the show notes david paypal getting some revenue increases on their quarterly earnings uh they plan to increase their crypto offerings you know what's so cool here is like corporations become addicted to quarterly earnings reports basically it's they're always looking for the growth right that's what the street wants from them investors want from them their company wants from them and once they get on the crypto train and they start realizing some of that growth for crypto they ain't coming back right they're going to do this more and more they're going to double down on a triple down on it it seems like that's what's happening with paypal and venmo any thoughts here yeah ryan here always says crypto pays you to learn about it well all these like companies these financial services companies like integrate with crypto and they're like oh there's a lot more revenue here than i thought let's keep going and so crypto pays companies to integrate with it uh and this is how crypto wins it does totally david let's do some quick takes here what's this one yeah first one tim cook of apple says he's bullish on crypto and that he owns some so that's kind of cool i kind of think that's the whole story is that the whole story yeah wait what coins do you think he has probably big bitcoin and ether yeah okay we're probably going to start there do you think he has doge oh god i don't know i wouldn't bet against it what's this next one matt huang of paradigm is joining the board at stripe stripe the the massive massive payments company that does a ton of volume uh matt wang a crypto native person coming on board there he says i'm excited to see them invest more energy into crypto and web3 this is super cool basically this is stripe saying hey we need a crypto native on the board and them getting a crypto native on the board because they're doing cool stuff in crypto i think that's what's going on david what what's going on with this dave dow david dow dave downs yeah it's officially it's a officially dave dow we have the dave token it's on polygon there are like 250 daves in the dave dow discord uh and so like what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to corral everyone into the day who's named dave or david or davey or from what i've learned if you're italian davide or if you are arabic uh dawed yeah so all all forms of david are welcome into dave dao we're trying to corral every single david that exists into the discord there's over 250 of them uh and this is actually generated um matt dao and dan dao dan dao is dave stout arch enemy is this just a fun experiment or what are you expecting to fall out of this yeah so yeah the cost of issuing a token the cost of making a dow have collapsed so low that you can make a doubt out of anything right now and so like i think this is a great model it was like when you strip away everything from a doubt and you just come compact it down to just one single thing that people share that is what this is right so you know the bankless doubt that's a complex narrative like we want bankless technology bankless culture there's a lot of things there what happens if you have a dow collapse down to just the bare minimum which is like one thing that people share and i want i want name dolls to get spun up all over the place uh and so if you click that uh that screenshot at the bottom uh somebody says finally a place for dave's can feel at home and then i quote and i quote him and say this is unironically the point of this and i say in quotes hey i want to get into crypto where should i go and if there's a bunch of name dows everywhere you can just say well well what's your name just go to your name dao and so we said dave dao is going to be maximally successful if we also get like ryan dowd justin dow sarah dow also to get started that should be our goal dave dowd the crypto punks of dave dallas by the way because we're the first ones uh but yeah i think this is a fun experiment it's just the perfect level of meme and realness to to matter and uh the goal we have decided the collective vision of dave dao is to buy the statue of david so we can so we can oh my god this is so clear so once once it's not for sale but like the power of crypto will we'll make it happen uh we are going to own the statue of david and it'll be property of dave dao wow this is very uh strange and interesting and uh you know i don't have time to start orion out but i'd probably join one so if there's some listener out there with the first name ryan then uh you've got some uh you've got some ideas that dave david has just dropped you um let's talk about this too optimism we're we were teasing it for the last couple of weeks what did they just drop yeah by the time that people listen to this the optimistic ethereum the evm equivalent version of optimism will be online the net the network is going to go down uh in 24 hours from a little bit yesterday so that's going to be coming up at the time of recording by the time you guys listen to it it should already be back up line or maybe it's in that six hour window but then boom optimism is evm equivalent uh which i think is going to be an iterative process but moving closer and closer and closer towards evm equivalence it's such a beautiful thing really excited for that congratulations to the optimism team yeah uh really cool for sure we also wrote a fantastic post this week about ethereum's roadmap a lot of people have questions about ethereum's roadmap like so when is the merge what's it going to include when the merge happens will i be able to um you know withdraw my eth uh what about what about sharding what about scalability when's that all happening we wrote it up in the ethereum roadmap update um trent from the ethereum foundation wrote that for us so it's just a fantastic overview we'll include a link to that in the show notes guys we will be right back with our takes of the week and also what we're excited about but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started hey guys we are back with the takes of the week dave let's start with the psa here don't get phished on uniswap this is harry.eve giving us the warning what's going on here yeah so for the listeners this is a visual thing but if you're on twitter those the links that populate on twitter that comes with with a preview right and so if you're used to seeing the same links you'll see the same previews there's a a link here that has the uniswap unicorn logo it says unicorn uniswap.org it says uniswap swap and they're all the same things that you'd see on uniswap uh so ryan let's go ahead and click that link and see where it goes am i gonna get uh fished here oh we are not on the unit swap page we are on a page called harrydenly.com who's probably the guy that made this website slash fake twitter unfurling and it says do you trust links well you shouldn't uh and so basically there is a way to make a link on twitter look like it's going to someplace and then take you to a different place and the idea is that like it could take you to a clone of uniswap that looks like uniswap acts like uniswap but instead takes all of your money so don't get phished this is a new scam that we've seen now that we know about it check your urls check your links verify everything guys and there are so many phishing scams out there okay so like discord all the time i don't know 20 times a day yeah i get hit up by things okay don't click weird links in discord i get text messages uh these days you know like ledger had a leak right for instance that gave away a whole bunch of you know uh people's uh email addresses phone numbers i've gotten letters okay uh like in the mail physical letters like phishing like please if you're in crypto yeah like basically uh if you're in crypto expect to get these things and they'll look like they're coming from legitimate sources that's how a fish works so this looks like it's coming from uniswap i get uh text messages from google right google support saying you got to check your gmail like stuff like this be on the lookout for it if you are in the crypto industry for any amount of time you are be going to become a phishing target so be very skeptical of messages from unidentified sources as they come in um david what's your take here yeah this is actually a talk that i gave i gave at a local san diego meetup condensed down into tweet form i'm still working on the talk but basically i say historically banking has always been centralized while artists have always been at the margins artists are on the frontier they are exploring the margins and i say with crypto the institution of banking is outsourced to the individual banking is now also on the margins where the artists are and i follow it up saying i'm so damn bullish on a human culture if you put the money next to the artists what do you think happens artists create more things like that's awesome and that is why i'm bullish on humanity yeah crypto is very bullish on humanity actually this is uh at least i think the ethereum those very much is um let's take this take from jason choi i'll read it out slow success builds character fast success builds ego that's the take he says it explains most of the people you'll meet in crypto wow that that's true this one hit me like uh as far as like hey this is my experience in crypto there are a lot of people in crypto that have gotten wealthy very quickly and some of them become pretty egotistical as a result of that um some of my favorite people are the people who have been here for a long time and have gotten wrecked a few times okay like just like made some dumb mistakes and gotten absolutely destroyed by them at some point in time right or at least been through some [ __ ] right like so going through 2018 2019 holding eth you had a 95 price drop guys okay even more if you kept on buying on the way down like i did right that was even more painful so that's the type of uh thing experience that really builds character and honestly it's like a quiet humble type of um type of character right but like on the other side you see a lot of people who man they just yolo bet on something now they know everything hi i've been in crypto for like eight months and i know exactly what's happening and i've made like uh you know a 50x return okay i see a lot of these people and uh they have pretty large egos because they haven't gone through the the trenches that others have so i don't know this one just resonated with me and it kind of explains what's actually going on it's like um too much success too quickly can build ego in in like when it happens to people let's do a thought experiment say there's two people both of them at one point in time both have a million dollar portfolio one person ground and did research and was patient and was re responsible and dollar cost averaged into responsible assets that went up and now that person over the course of three to five years has a million dollar portfolio this person b aped into dogecoin and they were poor for all three to five years and then all of a sudden they have a million dollars both people have a million dollars who do you think is going to be still wealthy like in the next year right right it's the guy that figured out how to actually maintain long-term wealth and long-term responsibility right like if money comes to you extremely quickly it can also go away from you extremely quickly so it's good to practice long-term thinking long-term responsibility uh because again that's what jason choi says builds character yeah and you know i know someone's listening he's being like hey look everyone in crypto has gotten rich quick okay don't talk to me i've been like investing for like 30 40 years right but like but then i go back to somebody like uh you had on uh layer zero this week dc investor right okay like dc investor has been here for a while and he's gotten wealthy via crypto nfts right but this wasn't an overnight success go listen to his story okay he he's been thinking about how to get out of the rat race and use his money so that his capital works while he's sleeping for like his entire adult life since college okay and like this is not and he's been involved in all sorts of different communities uh like this investment communities this is not uh you know uh suddenly he got rich because he made a lucky bet type of story and it's funny too because i see in somebody like dc investor that slow success that's built up character rather than the ego and uh yeah i think that's what you get so even in crypto people think it's like overnight success but it's but it's not and some of the best of my favorite people have have gone through some serious stuff in crypto in order to get to the other side here yeah we are blessed that crypto moves faster than the rest of the world and that includes our markets but you don't want to go too much faster than that that's when things get sustainable that's right and you know keep your ego in check right because uh this stuff is fleeting okay let's talk about this steak uh from sam altman david wants you uh yeah sam allman says there is a special combination of optimism excitement camaraderie exploration frontier speed and knowing a shared secret that existed in the startup community of 2005 to 2012. it has been dormant for a long time it's nice to see it again in the web3 community i really like that shared secret element and this is like the difference between the people that like like hounded the discord ceo the people that hounded the discord ceo to get him pulled back on that ethereum integration they didn't know this shared secret only we know the shared secret we've got the secret this is sam alton by the way i think this is the y combinator guy as well uh so you know that has some resonance here this is a take from polynya one of our favorites talking about modular blockchains generally but also has some fantastic takes and he talks a lot about the settlement layer and here's his tweet uh on five top criteria that mattel matter for a settlement layer this is the the base layer the layer one for assets and transactions and like the property rights layer that we talk about so much in bankless he said the five things that matter are a culture of users running nodes running their own nodes wide token distribution that's number two credible neutrality it's number three number four is lindy effect that's like time without it breaking and then number number five is liquidity and it follows up with this bitcoin is still arguably the leader so it's frustrating to see there's no concentrated effort to support roll-ups i think that's like two takes within the take right it's like bitcoin should be supporting roll-ups because arguably it's leading or it's number one of the number one contenders in a lot of these uh things but um i i guess you know my take off of this is a one i completely agree but this is also why not all layer ones are equal right just because you say you're a layer one doesn't mean you have these five characteristics your users running nodes wide token distribution credible neutrality lindy time without breaking and liquidity okay like and you have to have five of these to actually compete in the game and of the chains that are competing in the game it's honestly right now it's only bitcoin and ethereum that's right and like that's why we consider those two things the bankless things because they are actually fighting for these five properties absolutely yeah so anyway it was just nice uh to see kind of a breakdown of of what those things are and if you have anything to add to this david yeah i put out a tweet that was along the lines of like hey do you have a favorite l1 that you identify with and like everyone in crypto has their favorite l1 and then i said uh do you actually uh do you understand the values that are embodied in that l1 because if you haven't consciously thought about that you need to uh people just and then reply to that like oh my favorite l1 is this my favorite like kind of misunderstanding the point of the tweet um and so this when i say like do you understand the values of what is embodied in your l1 it's a lot of this like do the people run the nodes is the actual system decentralized by the people for the people the is there a wide token distribution do we all have access to the upside is it credibly neutral incredibly neutral or does it king make does it bestow rights that some people have that other people don't how long has it been running without breaking and then of course liquidity which we talked about at the very beginning of the show is the actual l1 asset liquid yeah do you know what's not listed there is a transaction throughput yes how many how many tps transactions per second you have well so that's why he says i'm frustrated to see that there's no concerted effort to support rollups on bitcoin because actually he he did actually put that there but it's again not at the settlement layer because tps doesn't happen at the settlement layer tps happens at the roll-up player that's right bitcoin could totally do this it's just not it just needs a heart let's do this david what's what's this tweet and what's the take here yeah this is klon klon is the og guy behind the cool cast nfts and he does a uh a first now and then later um uh uh tweet or picture there's two tweets two pictures 2015 there's this kind of like shoddy looking tent with a bunch of uh cat drawings that are hanging up on strings you know kind of looks pretty weak but turns out the guy really cares about cats and didn't quit and now in 2021 on the right side you see cool cats on like these led screen screens which are in new york amazing and so times square this is what i'm talking about this is the exact perfect representation of what i'm talking about when you remove central banking and you a push money and banking to the periphery where the artists are all of a sudden these guys that really care about their art that are going to stick through it get funded and all of a sudden we see cute little cats on times square billboards this is what happens when you fun artists this is the power of nfts this is the power of having a an asset like being able to democratize making nfts making assets to everyone you generate communities you generate culture you generate art so congratulations to klon if you're listening to this i actually met you at uh the la cool cats meetup i don't know if you know who knew who i was but i appreciate all of your work and i love your community yeah it's just like what this is like a golden age for creators man i think the opportunities here you go from kind of a tent and obscurity to you you go from like times square right and this is only possible because of crypto back in 2015 when khan was in this tent like this whole nft avenue was not available to him and didn't even even have enough thinking about it right yeah we didn't even it hadn't even been invented so what a golden era what a golden age to be a creator uh these days david let's talk about uh what what we're excited about so let me ask you the question what are you excited about this week yeah two things ryan two things i'm excited about these th this uh thing that i learned called manifold contracts uh and there's a there's a story here so while i was at nft the last day friday i went to an in real life nft art show and a little fun fact about me fun fact uh is once upon a time i was a photographer that was really interested in taking like cityscape city skylines geography pictures and then making like these hdrs where you would take pictures and across many many brightnesses and then compress them down into one image so you get the full range of color and spectrum it added like a bit of a surreal nature to these like cityscapes i go into this nft in real life art show and i see this uh very very surreal uh drone footage of new york and it was like 20 it was on a loop but it was like 20 minutes long and i watched the whole thing and i was just like mesmerized by it and so it's like this this guy took a drone flew it around new york added this like a i like algorithm to make it really really surreal really really like water colored uh he calls them the painted cities uh and then i met the artist because he was there uh and so there's eight different individual units that he was displaying uh and he hadn't actually minted these things and so i do a handshake deal with him and i buy every single one uh the whole series to swept the floor and the thing is we they weren't minted so it was a handshake deal and so i've had to go on a journey with this guy with this guy nate to actually figure out how to mint these damn things and i didn't really realize how big of a problem this is that is currently being tackled right now by so many different teams and so i asked around because if you meant them on like foundation if you meant them on super rare you're putting the um the what's that word provenance in in foundation or super rare and we don't want that that's a little bit of the web 2 model i'm sure super rare foundation has something to say about this uh but i want the artist to have the provenance i want to buy them from nate the artist not super rare the platform and so i want nate to mint the tokens and so going through the journey of like asking people around like hey guys like how do we how do we do this because i want my art i want my nfts that i paid a lot for to be on all the platforms not just the one that we minted them on we discovered this thing called manifold contracts uh from the manifold team and manifold is this cool nft minting platform that they call it stateless as in like it doesn't host anything it takes your tokens and mints you some contracts that is yours as an artist and then you can mint the nfts and that is again your contracts and then it takes the data of the nft the actual jpeg or in this case uh like a gigabyte size of footage puts them on our weave for decentralized file storage and then the tokens are owned by the artist but and can go anywhere open seas super rare foundation like whatever nft platform show up and it gives complete ownership to the artists so uh so manifold doesn't actually collect any rent from this process they are just supporting infrastructure to mint these tokens and i'm really bullish on that that's really really cool uh and so uh we're waiting for gas prices to come down because uh it's gonna cost a bunch of gas to mint these things but i'm really excited for that and just like learning through that whole process we're gonna get a manifold on a state of the nation to talk about this process and that is what i'm excited about only the first thing though the second thing is i'm also excited about metaverso in puerto rico which is the first week of december so puerto rico blockchain week gmoney's throwing metaverso i'll be speaking there so if you guys are going to mediverso in puerto rico for the first week of december i will see you there that's awesome very cool man yeah it's uh yeah i i would love to learn more about manifold honestly in this whole minting process from from that angle i've not uh not learned about that yet yeah no it's i'm glad i actually had the experience i didn't know that this was a problem that exists and now i'm exploring how to solve it and so i will report back when i find out ryan what are you excited about um what am i expect okay so i'm excited that like so i always think about this a little bit when the holidays come about which is like talking to friends and family about crypto right because you know they're gonna ask especially in up years usually they're quiet like in the bear market um so i tweeted this out uh was the most common objections to crypto you hear from your family and friends just you put that out there then i read through the objections david and my impression was like holy crap that's all you got right like most of the objections are just a result of a massive education gap like i was i was left again with the impression that we're still early it was just the same old stuff like nothing backs a bitcoin um the governments are going to shut it down uh it doesn't scale i can't buy my coffee with crypto yet it's like the same old objections that have been answered in a thousand ways a thousand different times like there's really nothing meaningful here that that's new or different uh and so yeah i was just left with that that impression that's like wow it's been a while since i've kind of peaked my head at up from crypto and like talked to people in the real world who aren't yet i guess crypto pilled aren't yet into uh like why we're in this industry in what we're doing here and the objections just haven't really gotten any better in fact the they've deteriorated right it's like even even like um what what does crypto actually do what are the products behind like wow i mean we have answers to all of those things now i mean go check out a dharma wallet just like where else can you get you know eight percent yield okay like like nfts where do they exist uh like the metaverse like facebook is even seeing this future uh so i think it'll be a different conversation i guess um you know during the holidays for for many people and uh we'll have a lot to show but like i guess just be prepared the objections haven't really gotten any better and i guess that's bullish for uh for crypto i think my take here is that if they haven't gotten better and they've only gotten worse that's because like only worse and worse objections actually can work anymore because like we've we've answered all the good objections here's a good objection and then we solve that problem right and so we're actually eating away at all the objections because we're actually delivering on some of these promises yeah i think i think that's true too so anyway that's uh that's what i got david you ready for me of the week uh yeah which one we got two of them this week right oh this one's good yeah okay so this is we've done this meme format before so this is the army man protecting the sleeping child right so we have the sec and it's protecting the sleeping child from a bunch of money coming in with the air drops like no sec does no money for the for the for the child meanwhile on the other side of the frame we have crypto scams coming in hot with grenades and knives going right for retail investors so sec protecting you from those airdrops but not from the scams hmm this about summarizes it and maybe uh is a call for a switch of priorities there um david let's do this next tweet what's this this one's great i'm pretty sure michael wong made this one but the last time i said this on the show it turns out it was actually you ryan so maybe you'll be correct this was not me this is not you okay so this is the the guy looking in the mirror of his card the mirror says objects in mirror are closer than they appear the guy is banks banks are looking in the mirror objects in mirror are closer than they appear what's in the mirror l2 scaling just coming coming fast coming fast just chase him down like a predator that's awesome all right guys ryan is about to give his very famous disclaimer but after the disclaimer we have two moments of zen they are both songs about ens one is about the ens dow one's about the ens airdrop they are both really catchy and i'm just extremely surprised that both of these songs are fantastic one of these the first one is going to be by a guy jonathan i think is his name that makes one song a day and he's done this for like 5 000 days or something like that something crazy uh and the other song is a rap artist that i don't know but they're both good they're both good okay so stay tuned for that ryan tell us about going west yeah yeah yeah stay tuned for the sick beats but i gotta tell you none of this has been financial advice of course ethan's risky bitcoin is risky all of crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but what are we doing david we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the banquets journey thanks a lot [Music] but still
