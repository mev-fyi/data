welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i am here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is an incredible episode we've been waiting a long time for this we are talking with nick carter today what did we cover so much so much nick carter is always a valuable person to get on any podcast particularly in the way that nick clearly thinks and thinks differently from most people in this space that get caught up in the tribalism caught up in the maxi warfare something that i would definitely say i do from from time to time so so getting nick's perspective on here and making sure that when we make comparisons when we make claims that they are grounded in something that is useful outside of crypto rather than just comparing you know cryptosystem a to crypto system b nick's perspective really makes sure that we are anchoring these things in time in relation to the systems that have come before crypto and using the lessons of of historical financial mechanisms to compare and contrast mechanisms that we find today in in the crypto land yeah and i i think nick would definitely consider himself a bitcoiner but he'd probably put an asterisk by that and uh i i don't think nick would consider himself at all a bitcoin maximalist he's he's very open in terms of um ideas one of the first questions we asked him was whether he identified with the etherean community and with the d5 movement and his answer to that was really interesting and then we talked some more about stable coins which has been a topic i've wanted to pick nick's brain on for a while weather particularly staple coins on ethereum and there's over 8 billion now uh dollars worth of stable coins on ethereum whether those are good or bad for ethereum getting his take on that was super interesting and then of course we got into settlement assurances really i feel like this episode tied a lot of other episodes together so if if you're just listening to bankless you haven't caught up on the archive go check the archive out episode two we talked about a monetary policy monetary theory that relates to this episode seven we talked about ether's value mechanism so we talked about eip 1559 so that comes in here when we're talking about stable coins episode 12 we talked about the protocol sync thesis nick has some really interesting perspectives on how to apply that lens of things to ethereum transactions so overall this is an episode that puts a lot of the previous episodes together and they all kind of feed into this conversation with nick carter it was it was great he's he's he's always good and then we finish off the conversation with two topics that bitcoiners and ethereans always butt heads about and that is kind of the the juxtaposition between a defy world and a crypto bank's world uh nick calls this movement free banking uh it's like the banking 2.0 but instead of gold it's bitcoin and without all the limitations of gold there are all the benefits of bitcoin uh and and nick believes that the competition the free market competition for banking services with minimal regulations uh from the government uh is is a interesting thing that is unfolding and where the regulations from the government break down the rules and regulations from the bitcoin blockchain come up to replace them you know the 21 million hard cap the easy to verify etc so that's always that's always an interesting perspective that nix particularly thinks a lot about and then we go into one of my favorite subjects which is also going to be the subject of my next article coming out in bank list next week is the progress of these nations that have that human civilizations have moved through throughout time so these different organizational schemes such as religion and then the nation state and now bitcoin and ethereum these all represent very similar constructs that humans organize and and stitch themselves together through uh and so we kind of talk about the commonalities found in each one of these different uh nations civilization schemes that enable humans to coordinate and and transact with each other uh and so that's that's where we finish off the episode uh and i'm really excited to release that article next week in bankless yeah and by the time you guys listen to this it's coming out on a monday it'll probably be the wednesday so it'll be like this week your time when you're listening to this that you'll be able to catch david's article on bankless david let's get to the big picture but before we do want to talk about some incredible bankless tools from our sponsors our first sponsor is monolith if you guys have your assets inside of ethereum but you also want to live your life monolith for our european customers might be the product for you they have their defy card which is a visa card connected to a smart contract wallet on ethereum so that when you go to the store you buy your coffee you buy your groceries you swipe your monolith card and then your die gets deducted out of your smart contract wallet sold for dollars and then you make a both a transaction on ethereum and a transaction on the visa network really crucial infrastructure for people that want to live a bankless life but don't really want to compromise and be that weird friend that doesn't have any real money so you can download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card today and then you can get some of the world's economic activity placed onto the ethereum network all right guys i am super excited to introduce you to our next new sponsor ramp what is holding crypto back it's really getting fiat into the crypto system that's what's holding d5 back the problem is a new user has to create an account with an exchange to buy some crypto they have to wire funds they have to go through a whole bunch of steps what's holding defy apps back the exact same thing users drop off in the sign up process and it really limits the d5 market to hardcore crypto people but no longer ramp solves that ramp has a delightfully easy fiat on-ramp service so it lets users get crypto eth die usdc in five minutes or less that's right five minutes or less no exchange needed and a new user can have crypto right into their account and start using the app so if you are a developer this takes about 10 minutes to implement they've got very easy to use apis apps like d5 apps like xarion ethereum taurus are using ramp you can visit ramp.network to see how easy this is this is really an opportunity for d5 developers to 100x their addressable market size this is like the ultimate growth hack and here's what's cool if you mention bankless they will on ramp the first 100k from your app of usd free so that's 100k free when you mention bankless go to ramp.network and check it out ramp dot network mention bankless and check it out all right david big picture i gotta ask man how was your weekend it looked like you had some wild stuff going on what what happened last weekend last weekend was a big weekend after this last weekend a lot of my uh attitudes and perspectives and and focus has really shifted i'm of course speaking of the the riots the protest and the police brutality that has flooded the nation in almost every single major city on seattle me my sister and my brother-in-law went down to downtown seattle to to protest uh extremely peacefully and i worked my way up to the front of a front of the crowd just to be there just to experience it all spent about 10 minutes there before the police started marching forward and indiscriminately pepper spraying which i got a face full of then i went home to shower and clean off because pepper spray is not fun and then i watch the news and i watch the news about the protests and i watch the news give a police report account of what happened which was from my perspective a total fabrication and everyone else i talked to at the the march was a total fabrication and then we watched i watched on twitter how this played out in basically every single major u.s city and so i fee i felt and i still feel very radicalized about this i i feel that the police are not the police but they are instead a police militia i feel like they are over equipped with thousands and thousands of dollars of of gear bulletproof vests bulletproof helmets fade like hard face masks uh you know heavy batons uh riot shields the the full works and their civilians the civilians of the of the city are are people in jeans and running shoes and that's it and it doesn't feel like they are the police they are they are a tool of the state and that's some people have been always saying that that's what the state is the state always has this stance towards the people because the people are the one thing that can remove the power of the state especially in in america where the american government and every state government the federal government is a protocol that allows for the people to change the protocol and so the current instantiation of the people in power are always at the whim of the people who hope that they can remove them from power if they so choose and so i've just become extremely cognizant of this stance again from the state towards the people that does not always have the best interests of the of the people and that and i've been focusing on that especially as it relates to how cryptosystems work at large where cryptosystems are inherently neutral and cannot have a stance towards people they just are tools they just are protocols for us to use and leverage and this is something that i've just been thinking a lot about lately well i want to get back to that some more but i i've gotta ask just like practically i've never had pepper spray in the face before what is that like what does that feel like how do you get it off pepper spray is oil based it's oily and sticky and it shoots out like a super soaker and so when you get it on your skin it doesn't you don't wipe it off it's not like a liquid it is like a paste and when they were aiming for the eyes and i got it right in the eyes it felt like bee stings in my eyes like everywhere i was immediately disoriented and discombobulated i could not see two seconds later and i had to people were around me and i just had to ask for help because i needed because they were the police officers were advancing right without warning by the way they just told all the police officers that were they're going to start advancing and they started taking steps forward and the pepper spray was brought out two seconds later two full steps into the crowd uh and so i had to turn around blinded uh and i had i had my video on on my camera on instagram live and so you you guys can see this video in person if you and and be with me if you guys want to experience that um but i had to ask for help i had to say like hey i need help i can't see anything and so people people put their arm around me and and walked me back from from the police officers as they advanced uh i i was immediately disoriented i think it's important to listen to people's experiences because everyone has experienced what's going on in the us in a different way but you were talking about the the protocol of of the united states david and written in the first amendment of that protocol is the freedom to peaceably assemble and when that starts to get taken away to the extent that that it is uh it's a breach of our political um that the u.s constitution the amendments are essentially america's settlement layer uh that's what preserves law and order that's what we that's our social contract uh and so i certainly get alarmed when that is um looking like it is being breached and uh i can understand from your experience how how like you felt like that was being breached you know here you guys are assembling peaceably and uh you're just broken up for seemingly no reason i i do think that a lot of the media wants to paint this as a right versus left thing and i would say that you know bankless is not a commentary on nation state politics but it does have a political position the bankless platform is absolutely it's not a right versus left thing but it is absolutely an anti-authoritarian movement authoritarians of course want to control they want to dominate they want to take over and the bankless movement is about self-sovereignty it's about freedom so whether you're right on the political spectrum or or left on the political spectrum if you're listening to what we're talking about if you're involved in crypto and involved in defy chances are you believe those things too you believe in the self-sovereignty of individuals and are against authoritarian estates that would try to strip those things away protocols not kings is our mantra wouldn't you say absolutely absolutely every single protocol on ethereum in ethereum itself and bitcoin itself is a protocol that used to be in the responsibility of this state that the protocol is now can now assume so you know the state and the irs and taxes and reporting and auditing all of these things that companies and individuals and businesses have to do is give the irs and give the state give the powers that be like a report of where all the value is and it's really the tool that the united the united states system at large uses to understand where all the value is in the world and because the world is on the dollar system the united states government gets to see like in a panopticon type of way where all the money is and because they control the protocol of the us dollar they control the auditing of the us dollar and so getting getting back home i immediately understood much better why ethereum nodes need to be able to run through tor why we need to be able to run an ethereum node with or without the state's permission in whatever capacity that we want because if ethereum can run through tor there's nothing that they can do uh if if the united states got hyper authoritarian and they banned ethereum nodes and bitcoin nodes that would make these systems a little weaker a little more fragile but putting putting these systems through the tor network so that everything can be hidden from the state is really important and this maybe seems like something radical that only a radical person might do but we've seen people get arrested for the things that they have put on twitter even in the last three days uh things that that people put on instagram the the state is watching social media and they're arresting people from what they have been posting um granted what they were posting was illegal but this that's where it starts right like it's first it starts from just the illegal stuff and then it and then it moves forward into maybe more subjective stuff uh and so i'm immediately cognizant of how incredibly exposed i am because of my uh the exposure i have towards being such a pro crypto person on twitter on instagram talking about how this removes the power from the state and puts it into the hands of the people uh that that i have left a trail of that sort of behavior and so in in china i would have been arrested absolutely uh and so i i'm now cognizant of privacy and the ability to run ethereum through tor in a private manner so i can have my freedoms yeah absolutely and this is not about doing anything you know illegal in the in the current system or legal with respect to the constitution but authoritarians could crack down for whatever reason that they want to and bankless and crypto is really a hedge against the rise of authoritarianism i i want to maybe leave this kind of our big picture with uh with one one thought uh and that's the the focus of this movement is also not burning down the the existing system you know the response to this can be uh we're frustrated let's burn everything down i think you know that's that's one response it's not necessarily the response that we want to take uh the response we want to take is build it up so what we're doing in crypto is we are building from the ground up an entirely new monetary system that enshrines self-sovereignty at its core it enshrines algorithmic issuance uh non-state interference at its core at the base layer and then builds up from there and i think that is something in these increasingly authoritarian times that is worth spending time on okay before we get to the nick carter interview wanna talk about our sponsors ave is a defy lending and borrowing platform with some new cool features that you might not be used to compared to other borrowing and lending applications on ethereum first and foremost the feature that stands out to me the most is their fixed interest loans and so you know variable interest loans can get pretty hairy right so maker dow launched at 0.5 percent and then it slowly skyrock it slowly ramped up to 20 which is which is a very wide range of possible interest rates and it's not really sustainable for you know some of the more typical things and so that's where ave comes in with their stable non-variable interest rates where you can lock in a specific interest rate and borrow against uh borrow assets using that interest rate and being able to depend on that fixed interest rate really important a really important money lego that we need in the d5 space to really have defy grow and mature in a dependable way but that's not all you can do you can also do flash loans on ave which is also a brand new money lego where you can borrow you can borrow assets at without any collateral so long as you also repay it back in the same transaction so there's a lot of potential here if you want to pay back collateral but open up a different loan with different collateral you can do that all in one transaction without all the slippage costs so ave and their flash loans allow you to do that they are the number four biggest application in dfi coming in at 70 million locked in d5 right now the bankless community really loves ave and we've just been watching ave climb the ranks of the of the d5 market cap so check them out at ave dot com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum wallet will work so try it out i want to introduce you to a new sponsor on the bank list podcast uh multis to run your business without a bank so we talk a lot about the

right guys let's just go ahead and get right into the interview with nick carter david and i are here with nick carter nick carter is a writer he is the co-founder of castle island which is a venture capital company he's also the co-founder of coin metrics which i use on a weekly basis nick we've been waiting a long time to have you on bankless and we are really excited to dig in today happy to be here thanks for the invitation guys nick you know what i think there's a lot we could cover today we want to keep this conversation dynamic and casual like we've been very influenced by a lot of the things you've you've written in the past but i i'm just going to dig in with with sort of a an initial question to get us started here which is are you an etherean is there any part of you that is an ethereum we know you're a bitcoiner what about and you can be both by the way david and i would both consider ourselves both what's your take on that man you guys are throwing me right into the deep end first that's how we do it feels like a trap so like maybe we should define what that means you know ethereum bitcoiner so like my preferred definition of bitcoiner is like someone that just believes or kind of effectively endorses the like the values in heron and bitcoin so um you know a acknowledges that it's important that there's like monetary commodities that exist outside the state and then b like you know is is pretty interested in property rights and uh and then see you know like the other kind of like assorted values that like underscore bitcoin um so i think you don't you know you don't have to like own bitcoin to be a bitcoiner you just have to kind of agree with the um with the kind of the thrust of the philosophy um for ethereum like i would say the valleys are like slightly more diffuse like they're not as well codified like there aren't uh totems to rally around like 21 million units um it's more like uh commitment to like rapid iteration and more expressivity um but i would say it's like probably slightly harder to define what the the core values in ethereum are um the other thing is probably just owning ethereum makes you an etherean right so i mean i own some like i've made ethereum transactions so in that sense yes in terms of the values like um i would want to see them like codified so that i can evaluate them well so let me ask this nick what's your impression of the etherean value system today just raw impression i think it's it's like still fairly malleable um for better for worse you know it was interesting to see the uh the prague power debate um develop because that was something that was like kind of stipulated the asic resistance was stipulated in the in the yellow paper i think and then there was like a constitutional debate almost and it was like well you know like these stipulations don't matter like um the world has moved on we've learned a lot it's kind of like how in the second amendment debate it's like well the you know the founding fathers didn't envision not to like make this super topical or anything the founding fathers didn't envision you know machine guns or you know really consumer grade like you know technology that would give civilians lots of killing power uh so like you have to read the text in context kind of thing yeah it was reminiscent of that in in that like there was a rejection of like a constitutional stipulation and you know an embrace of like modernity so to speak um i don't know if that answers the question but yeah i'd say fairly malleable however it seems to be getting more like bitcoin like over time i don't know if you guys have noticed 100 um 100 like a the governance process has become more difficult as like more stakeholders have emerged and they are heterogeneous in their like objectives um the pace has slowed down the pace of change which is necessary to focus on ether as a financial and like in monetary commodity has intensified um so in a sense like there's been a convergence of sorts in terms of the like values and the other thing is um [Music] i would say there's been much more of a focus on like how does ether itself monetize which is maybe the focus of this conversation um as opposed to in in the very earliest days like from what i remember of the discourse it was more like well you know it'll just happen and the monetization is just kind of a contingent function of the system's growth and like we don't know exactly how it's going to happen but it probably will if we build something important valuable now i would say there's a much more deliberate focus on well how do we ensure that ether is valuable um you know how like how do we retain the the monetary premium that's developing which like is like reminiscent of of like bitcoin philosophy i would say i really want to emphasize the my beliefs of an agreement that uh ethereum is trending towards a lot of the same values that uphold bitcoin and i think that we would see this and it's not ethereum dependent or bitcoin dependent i think all crypto systems that would have emerged that were like crypto systems that were predicted to emerge back in the 90s right before crypto was even a real thing we could have in hindsight this is more obvious now but some of these uh values are required for these things to to work right and so the praguepow debate was this uh debate about removing politics and and governance from the system saying that praguepow is a system that benefits one group of people over another and for that reason it should not be included and we saw that also with the the vehement rejection of on-chain block reward funding for developers that was that was a very contentious uh proposal that got swiftly struck down because of the political nature and the the inherent acceptance of the need to have a neutral protocol on ethereum and then also as as you said the the um the monetization the financialization of the l1 blockchain where uh the the value of the block space needs to be scarce and needs to be in demand and perhaps only is really suited for financial activity i see all of these things that that uh maybe perhaps on accident i don't think a lot of ethereans would say like they that they agree with bitcoinerism but at the same time all these values are emerging regardless and i think it's it's not and they're not bitcoiners values right they're not bitcoin values they're just the correct values that match uh what needs to be involved in creating a successful crypto system yeah that's very well put actually um and i think there's a few things where you can say definitely ethereum has uh become more approximate to bitcoin valley wise as you say uh the the monetary primacy of the system you know although you know there's still non-monetary uses of ether but i think the monetary ones are kind of outweighing them um the layered approach to scaling i mean you know tbd i guess but like certainly there's been much more of an embrace of layered approaches as like it's become clear that like there are real constraints in terms of the data overhead that a system can tolerate um and what was the other one oh yeah so this thing that you you mentioned like a rejection of protocol derived financing that's like a very important thing in my opinion um because it that kind of thing leads to capture in my opinion it like kind of really dramatically raises the stakes and turns engineering debates into political debates and it yeah i think that would have been a recipe for disaster and you know that's certainly something that like bitcoin prides is uh not converting ownership of units of the currency into like political power which can then turn into you know a positive feedback loop so nick you've um you've written quite extensively about sort of how these networks uh change over time specifically their narratives and we'll include one of your articles on this in the in the show notes here um you know bitcoin in its early days was many things but store of value digital gold was a smaller portion of it than it is today there was a contingent that wanted to make bitcoin a peer-to-peer cash system that contingent ultimately left they forked out they created their own uh community ecosystem network bitcoin cash right um do you see a similar sort of thing happening in ethereum where like people who believed more in this this sort of the the more nebulous um web three vision you know decentralized internet vision people who are okay with issuing tokens to developers in an arbitrary way as a reward system those people are essentially forking out and creating their own eth killers is that how you're seeing what's going on in ethereum right now yeah i think that's that's the correct interpretation um i i haven't like paid too much attention to like the the politics of the various eath killers but um from like the shallow look that i've given it it does seem that there was like kind of a big tent um kind of mentality uh early on when things were like pretty harmonious and like the the nature of the protocol hadn't really been clearly defined and people were projecting onto it features that they wanted and then when it wasn't borne out that way and when it kind of failed to develop in the way that they may have liked they you know expressed frustration or just left and certain alternatives uh which is i guess like the beauty of the industry but also you know like if you're interested in having the biggest possible network of users it's also a loss um but just like on on the topic that article i it's like it's funny that it it has so much currency and it gets uh quoted so much it was like a 10 minute exercise that i did and then i i was like i made the chart just like on my kind of like gut feeling and then i was like i went to haaseu i was like do you want to write this into an article and then it became this whole thing and now people cite it as if it's like canonical it's like oh yeah like the um the digital cash contingent was like 10 of the discourse in bitcoin's early days and like those numbers are pretty much made up just based on my like recollections so yeah you know it's not canon like i would welcome another attempt you know look at it someone else should should try it and you know come up with a better version or something yeah and i i'm hopeful somebody actually rates one for ethereum too i've seen sort of one version of it that i personally didn't agree with yeah there was one for a theorem yeah i you know i felt like i sort of agreed with the take but i feel like you know there should be multiple interpretations of the narratives it's very subjective i mean we're talking about like trying to do uh what historians do you know and like there's no like canonical history written as we all know um and but i have like subjective views the fact that your subjective views you put them out there and they caught fire basically and they're they're off quoted and everyone refers to this particular article uh that gives it some i call it meme density right like you kind of that's how canon maybe is set in these types of social communities yeah i mean i guess like i'm i i'm i sort of like have objections with that article i think maybe you know i was representing it in a pretty flat and linear way um there definitely were like competing intellectual threads in the cypherpunks like pre-bitcoin so for instance there were debates over privacy you know like bitcoin isn't that private charmium digital cash is much more private you know uh there are debates over whether they should just create a dollar like just wrapped dollars in like digital format or like new native units like bitcoin you know so like they didn't agree and like i think there are even debates over scaling like uh nick zabo's model was uh was kind of meant to be layered in a certain way so like whether they were creating digital cash or a settlement medium which was digital like there were big debates even before bitcoin and so in a sense those debates just got transposed onto bitcoin once it was created yeah absolutely uh it we're going to talk a bit more about ether the asset and its economic density but i think this this next concept sort of leads into this you've written a lot about staple coins recently including an article in bankless sort of posing the question are stable coins good for ether the asset or not and our listeners know that you know stable coins are absolutely exploding in popularity so i don't know 10 billion uh or so across various crypto networks the bulk of those stable coins are now on ethereum can you talk about that a little bit are stable coins on ethereum good for ethy asset yeah that's to me like the existential question right now and it's not surprising that a lot of debate has focused on this in the last couple months um i think it's a pretty important and general question for not just ether but literally every cryptocurrency out there um can you ultimately compete with dollars um or you know sovereign currency and now that it's clear that there are ways to kind of insert sovereign currency on chain uh that seemed to work and like seem to be getting traction um it's really night and day in terms of the usage modes in uh in terms of like what people are using for um you know means of wealth transfer uh for medium of exchange uh people love the stability afforded by dollars uh for better for worse um and there's this existential question emerging it's like is there even a role for the native assets in this world um and that's kind of the challenge i would pose to ethereums um the the reason that it's like bitcoin did this interesting this is one thing where bitcoin diverges very strongly from ethereum is that it asserts the primacy of the native unit and it really kind of repudiates non-native units and this is like fairly deliberate um i would say so um bitcoin i i like to say bitcoin is interested in cultivating its own utxo set and not really interested in um you know giving the time of day to alternative tokens that exist on chain and even historically there have been cases where you know counterparty tokens were sort of de-privileged in a certain way whereas ethereum has been very consistent about wanting tokenization um you know and so now that stable coins have migrated to ethereum and other places like tron to a lesser degree the question is like are people gonna still use the native token certainly i think it can be configured such that there's always a usage for ether in gas as a taxation you know kind of element um but you can't i mean the protocol can't mandate that you know transfers occur in the medium of ether um so that erosion is i would say potentially troubling but then you know the reaction the response to that is to say well actually these are not the same asset they don't have the same settlement assurances one of them is liability free and one of them is impregnated with liability and native uh crypto assets um are worth something uh just because by virtue of the market whereas dollars on chain are worth something because there's an administrator somewhere that is guaranteeing their value and guaranteeing access to redemption so there is a difference in terms of the assurances um so it's just a question of whether that is a material enough difference uh such that there's always a room for ether so i i would say it's you know very much an open question the other side is that um you know usdt and other tokens are driving demand for uh gas so they're you know they're using a block space which you could say is good because it means that uh you know people need to buy ether to pay transaction fees so i don't know it's a it's like a very complex issue i i actually haven't kind of made up my mind on it yet to be frank i think we're circling around the in my opinion what is the one central uh thing that differentiates bitcoin and ethereum at at their core uh i i believe that like the 99 of the genetic makeup of all crypto systems overlap but what we're talking about here is really that one that that big differentiator where bitcoin uh and you said this in my my other podcast pov crypto pod and it's stuck in my head uh where the bitcoin blockchain serves btc the asset but uh with ethereum ether the asset serves ethereum the chain and this has always been baked into the values of ethereum right like ethereum there there's no there was never any doubt that in order for ethereum to be successful it needed to have other things on it not just ether you know ether is meant to support other economic activity on on ethereum and ethereum has always been designed to be expressive and flexible enough to have a maximum amount of economic activity and as you said earlier we just the i think the designers of ethereum were like just assumed that with high amounts of economic activity on ethereum that the value of ether would just increa increase commensurately for whatever reason like we don't really know what that reason is but what you know where where there is high value and high value flow uh ether is just highly highly exposed to that just by being proximate to it uh and and so um i just wanted to get your thoughts on that yeah i mean i think in in i would say in both communities you have these assumptions which are kind of just taken as given which aren't like sufficiently interrogated so you know in bitcoin there's been this roiling debate for a while about the security and there's a big camp that just states effectively um it's fine don't worry about it and in ethereum i would say the kind of this the analog there would be the folks that just presume that ether would be valuable if enough usage you know accrued to ethereum the blockchain and i'm interested in interrogating that for sure um because i am i'd like to you know fi really identify the causal mechanisms there and i've seen probably some complacency around this i wouldn't accuse you guys of complacency i mean i've definitely seen your work um trying to identify those mechanisms but uh this is a new a new science you know um there's no established valuation template here so it's kind of up to us to determine how valley sustainably accrues to a system which is novel and which doesn't have kind of a nation-state to you know insist on its usage you know within its borders so to speak so the two mechanisms that ryan and i have identified that um aren't just uh guesses that proximate ether uh location to economic activity means that ether price is going to go up two concrete mechanisms that we've landed on are uh the fact that uh like with a stable coin like die a trust minimized stable coin like die has increased uh value capture mechanism to the collaterals below it which is by and large ether and so ether is acting as this very trustless as the most trustless asset on ethereum ether has uh undo like more exposure to the existence and economic activity behind dye uh and and so for any if if we believe that these crypto systems are you know the success of these things are come from the value of being permissionless decentralized trust minimize etc uh then ether has exposure to that because it there is never ever going to be any asset on ethereum that has those qualities better than the ether the asset and then there's also eip1559 which is a direct linkage to any and all economic activity upon the scarcity of ether and creates ether deflation um so do these two uh mechanisms resonate with you and how have you seen these two mechanisms play out from your perspective so i'm totally convinced on your point about make or die um although maker seems to be diluting this slightly which i find to be strange um given their mandate but yes so to me in an abstract way maker is a neo free bank with bitcoin or sorry i got bitcoin on the mind uh with ether acting as the um the trustless collateral um it's kind of a digital specie um you know it like when you had the free banking system you had a liability free asset at the base of that pyramid which was gold um in contrast to maker that was actually a fractional reserve system you know historically um but they they you know there still was this redemption for specie and um maker is kind of you know pretty similar with the difference being that because ether is pretty volatile it actually has to be over reserved um but yes you're absolutely right that that closes the feedback loop between using a dollar denominated asset and you know actually inducing reservation demand for the native unit so that's like really harmonious that's a really nice closed loop um and the value isn't bleeding out of the system you contrast it with a stablecoin which is redeemable for plain old dollars in a bank account and you could argue there's some value leaching out of that system and it's not clear to me that it's fully being returned in the form of fees like if i you know were the the dictator of ethan i could tinker i would actually probably like you know do something crazy like impose a tax on those dollar redeemable stable coins uh and say if you you know if you like in addition to the fees like if you want to use our block space you know you really uh you you owe us you know kind of thing uh that's sort of maybe a heretical idea um what's the the number of the eips that you mentioned i should probably one five five nine it needs its own name by now but yeah which one five five nine yeah honestly it's it's it shouldn't be up to you it shouldn't be up to you to know it it should be up to the ethereum community to meme it better yeah you guys should do a catchy name i mean it it's just a hard number to remember but you know so the idea there is that there is fees being burned uh a fraction of all fees paid or burned right yeah the bulk of the fee like we don't really know with these specific parameters but we're guesstimating above 90 of the fee gets burned and the rest gets tipped this is something that i i wonder about for sure so color me not 100 convinced on this in terms of being value creative so i also depart from the bitcoin community where uh you know this it's the same idea like when uh coins are lost bitcoiners like to say it's a donation to everyone because satoshi said that right but i actually don't know if i agree with that to me the question is like if they're lost and they're subsequently replaced if that demand doesn't evaporate um but if you know i you know like my my great uncle dies and i inherit his coins but like something gets lost in the shuffle and i'm a bitcoiner and i wanted those coins anyway am i gonna like if i go ahead and replace them then fine the impact of that loss really is deflationary but you know let's say he dies and he doesn't have any errors and you know his bitcoins are just lost does that really uh you know like how mechanically does that actually you know inject value you know he just kind of falls off the global order book um i'm not 100 convinced that all you know coin burnings or losses are like homogeneously affecting the value in the same way and so i think i guess the question for this eip is like are the people who are having their ether burned are they going to subsequently replace that ether you know and fill up their cup again uh to subsequently spend more and burn um i i guess you would say like heavy users of the chain probably would be incentivized to do that because they just need the block space you know from a in an industrial capacity because they need to do transactions um but you know just more generally i think i would like to to actually question this notion that all burned coins are necessarily deflationary if that makes sense yeah that does make sense um what what is your thought on the the narrative value of this though right so you know some might say a lot of the the value appreciation of bitcoin goes back to the its scarcity narrative the 21 million the like the the mummification of that um if ethereum has a burn mechanism that reduces its issuance on an annual basis does that increase the narrative around it being a non-sovereign speculative non-sovereign stored value i would say it depends so one thing i don't like um not to keep relating this to bitcoin but just to make the point so i i actually don't like how people enumerate bitcoin's issuance rate and say that that's an inflation rate um because it's kind of a totally predefined thing and so um to me like all the coins already exist and they're just sort of being gradually unlocked over time um i guess for ethereum there's like more uncertainty about what the rate will be you know in a few years so then it is probably important for investors to to know what that rate of change is um and you know i think probably the the biggest fraction of the narrative value is just the message to investors that the developers you know are really interested in in driving value to the asset directly and then the exact mechanism probably doesn't matter as much um it's but yeah so it's it's kind of a way to you know establish that vote of confidence like yes we're interested in backstopping the value of ether and here's our you know our current approach um that i would say should be balanced counterbalanced against the risk of it seeming too arbitrary uh in terms of like how changes are made i think there's always the risk that the some of these changes um that that happen you know without this long period of deliberation are interpreted as being arbitrary and kind of capricious um i mean historically like that hasn't been an issue for ethereum but as like the governance becomes more ponderous and kind of more deliberate i think that might might be an issue in the future so i would say generally yes like in terms of just being a general signal uh but i think there's there's still that risk that um it's interpreted as being you know too too malleable too easy to change system you know that has been a strength of bitcoin basically the the credible neutrality of its algorithmic issuance policy like no one has edited it uh everyone knows what it is it's uh not going to change but so as we're talking about like contrast between bitcoin and ethereum i was thinking about this it sort of strikes me that both of these networks what the what what they're trying to do is essentially bootstrap the value of their block space yeah so bitcoin does this through establishing kind of this 21 million fixed meme right establishing the value of its asset uh so it becomes so valuable that transactions on the bitcoin network the block space become infinitely more valuable in the future and ultimately this bootstrapping mechanism ultimately makes security of uh bitcoin depend on the value of that that block space as issuance decreases to to and approaches zero ethereum is kind of doing the same thing increasing the value of its block space but it's doing this in a sort of a a polytheistic way right like a poly asset way where it's bringing stable coins and nfts are welcome and all of these tokens are welcome because they increase the value of its block space and the the strategy has been fairly effective so if you look at uh coinmetrics um you you can see like daily revenue volume on bitcoin and ethereum and uh you know they're close uh bitcoin is a bit higher but nothing else no other networks are everything else just virtually is that a way yeah everything else is ridiculous is that a way to kind of see these networks is both are taking different approaches to bootstrap the value of their block space in order to increase and perpetuate their long-term security yes they are clearly approaching in different ways and like you i think it's absolutely critical to have robust fees and just sustained demand for block space um and i think that's what frees you from the like specter of inflation in a blockchain context you know and i think that this has been acknowledged for a while you know but uh if you don't like because it was interesting you like you saw this like some of the blockchains 2.0 we're like yeah we're we're eliminating fees and we're just going to pay for it with inflation it's great it's like much more convenient and no one has to worry about fees ever again and that now we have this like reaction where there's a realization that that actually has lots of like issues and like all sorts of like ugly uh you know outcomes there um and i think there's been a recognition that the the feed driven model or like primarily fee driven model is better in some ways so you know fees are like a proof of work like they dis-incentivize you from submitting on economical or spammy transactions and that's totally worth something because there's a real externality in terms of node operation um and you know just by pricing this commodity block space you know like i'm in favor of markets um you know wherever they can exist and uh just paying for things with inflation is uh is to kind of reject that doctrine and uh and say well maybe we can price you know we the administrators of the protocol can price things appropriately and manage it and i think that that's probably been kind of a failure um so yes it is interesting to look at the data and see that there's meaningful fees on bitcoin ether and virtually nothing else and i think that says a lot about where economically minded entities are actually apportioning their attention these days um and it's a really interesting question like we've seen tether leave bitcoin tether was a source of fee pressure for bitcoin um you know there still are kind of arbitrary uses of bitcoin there's you know open time stamps similar things i have mixed feelings on the the non-monetary uses of bitcoin but undoubtedly they help with as far as fee pressure goes so i think you guys are right to to focus on this as like the key distinction you know in terms of philosophy between the two projects um native assets versus just like arbitrary arbitrary usage so let's play let's play this idea out a little bit when we're talking about this podcast nick you brought up this idea of monetary primacy um and um you know i think what you're referring to is is basically that maybe you see ethereum sort of taking the route of bitcoin so uh bitcoin is primarily used to transfer bitcoin in large quantities there are a scarce you know there's scarce space in bitcoin block space so the more economically dense transactions tend to be high-value bitcoin transactions right that only makes sense you've used this shipping crate analogy to sort of talk about that and then uh usdt stablecoins they move off of bitcoin because they are less economically dense they don't need the security um protections of the bitcoin network and i think you would probably in you know your your framework probably celebrate that i guess the question is does the same thing start to happen with ethereum so there's more block space on ethereum and in the future with sort of the social contract around scalability there will be probably more block space on the base layer but still a scarce amount yeah i mean this is never going to should be amazon web services yeah and it has to be or else it doesn't preserve its decentralization but is that kind of what happens with ethereum do these less economically dense the cryptokitties do they move off of uh the base layer chain and go somewhere else yeah it's definitely hard to forecast i would say on the topic of tether like i probably wasn't actually popping the champagne when tether left bitcoin um some bitcoins were for sure it was like a weird event in that you know like both bitcoiners and aetherians were happy about the same thing which was yeah it was like the first time i've seen that um does that mean that one of these parties is wrong yeah or yeah someone has to be wrong right um exactly um but yeah there's also kind of a relief it's like well maybe tether isn't as linked to bitcoin anymore so maybe that's good i don't know um but you're right you know and one like very uh straightforward example of this is vera block so vera block was this i think it still exists it was this protocol that um would borrow bitcoin security and use it for other altcoins so they could sort of you know link their their blocks to bitcoin you know periodically and sort of inherit bitcoins security which is a pretty common idea we've seen a few all coins do this um kind of like a merged mining uh style thing but uh vera block was offering a fixed amount of you know it was bidding a fixed amount for bitcoin blocks base and when bitcoin block space was really really cheap in 2019 um it was occupying you know 20 30 percent of bitcoin block space and then as fees rose verablock got marginalized because the fixed amount it was bidding uh you know that bot that acquired less and less block space so that's a very simple example of this process whereby the most economically dense uh transactions eventually you know price out the the kind of less uh i don't want to call them spam because people that's like a really loaded word and so on but you know the less economically minded transactions and like the analogy i would use is like if you think of each block as like an empty cup and you have liquids of varying densities and the more dense the more kind of the larger the transaction is the happier you are to pay you know a heavier fee that that you know imagine large transactions it's like very dense like viscous liquids um in each block they sink to the bottom they get inclusion you know they didn't get inclusion in the cup uh and then the the lighter liquids you know they spill over the edge they don't even make it into the cop right and so because block space is scarce and bounded i think in the long term it's the largest transactions that are going to that those transactors are going to be willing to bear a higher fee in absolute terms uh you know to to move their like large amount of assets um and and those basically price out the the smaller or even not economic transactions so that's the theory behind this idea that blockchains probably in the long run have this this kind of uh economic primacy or or monetary primacy um and like we kind of see this in ethereum too like as fees have risen due to uh mostly stable coin usage i would say um and like if you look at stable coin transactions they tend to be pretty big these are like kind of biggish settlement transactions as fees have risen stuff like deploying a dow on aragon has gotten really expensive because it's pretty complex like it requires a lot of gas so to a certain degree those are being priced out and so like vitalik had a thread today saying you know blockchain started out being purely monetary in nature and now they're moving on uh to to you know harboring a real diversity of use cases and actually minimizing the the monetary element i actually think it's the opposite i would say as long as there is scarcity in block space the monetary usage is probably going to win out just for simple economic reasons for the simple reason that if i'm transferring a million dollars i'm happy to pay ten dollars in fees whereas you know that so that out competes like a like a smaller transaction basically yeah can i just say like dave and i were talking about that thread and uh like i totally agree with you like i i disagree with those aspects of italic thinking that the blockchain can be useful for everything it just tends to be the case that money use cases outprice everything else yeah it's just a question yeah that's right i think so and like unless i mean you know i've misunderstood charting or or something in the roadmap for ethereum in which case like there really will be an abundance of block space and then things will change but you know i under the way that i currently understand blockchains uh you don't ultimately really even want to allow arbitrary usage i think it's actually greg maxwell that said this he said something like there is unlimited demand for highly available replicated storage which is free and we kind of see this like if you look at the usage traits of bsv or bch people just use these to store data and that usage mode is like pretty wasteful i would say because that data is only relevant to the person uploading it and they may never want even to retrieve it whereas a you know moving money around moving the native unit around in particular that's likely to be relevant in the future you know so the the cost that that data is imposing that's a cost that you know the the system should be happy to bear because it's likely that that those you know that storage requirement isn't just being wasted long term so what you a lot of what we are illustrating is is uh talking around the concept that ryan and i have been harping on which which is a a term that i got from you you said you didn't coin it but i don't know who else did is settlement assurances uh and the primacy of a base layer that is is moneyness and monetized uh contributes to what we've been calling settlement assurances which is the assurances that your transaction is going to settle in a way that you is is expected to uh and this is in stark contrast with something like like stellar which you have called like a a landfill blockchain where just all of the trash just gets dumped on on stellar because it just doesn't matter because there's no fees whereas the high fees on ethereum and high fees on bitcoin contribute to the settlement assurances of these systems which allow um for protocol density like a high weight system uh because all of the money and all the finance and all the value are being added to these systems and ultimately that therefore fees are being paid and the fees are the livelihood of these systems like you i i think you can accurately predict into the future how long a system like this is going to last based on how much fees that they have um so one can you comment on that and and two can you uh kind of illustrate how you see settlement assurances and and its role in these crypto systems yeah yeah yeah so you know i think you can predict safely that systems that are meant to be capped like you know coins where issuance is meant to be capped absolutely need fees in the long term and the ones that are capped and have zero fees right now which is a lot of them a lot of the forks of bitcoin will be forced to reintroduce inflation if they can't you know accrue a significant a sufficient amount of fees and i would add this is also a challenge the bitcoin has to face too and i'm not exactly sure what sufficiency is but i know that zero isn't sufficient so you know that that much we know um and if you reintroduce inflation i think you know and that's contrary to kind of the established social contract i think you've basically failed uh so you know that that much is clear to me um it's interesting that the the kind of core logic of blockchain security changes as you go from a subsidy driven regime to a fee regime because in the subsidy regime you really want the native unit to be valuable and so it's important to emphasize you know reservation demand for the native unit but then in the fee driven regime the kind of unit value of the native token doesn't matter as much and what matters is just inducing transactional usage um so the the nature changes somewhat i think we still don't know for sure you know we're still in like the hypothesis stage here of determining whether the public blockchain model the like dominant model does generate like sufficient assurances in the long term um one thing i worry about is that the assurances change from being cryptoeconomic assurances to being kind of institutional ones where you have a certain kind of consortium of entities that actually guarantee uh settlement um and so then settlement becomes less effect a function of being buried under a certain number of blocks and more a function of just effectively being in the good books of the the guarantors of the system and there's a few ways this could happen um one would be you know if mining became strongly cartelized and you had big custodians that had contractual relationships with minors and independent minors got forced out and then the custodians could be the arbiters of what got mined and you know let's say custodian got hacked they would have a really strong incentive and like having the ability to conduct reorgs and so on that's one way i could see this getting institutionalized the the capture of a lot of the the token supply on exchanges is is a risk i would say in this context you know with custodial institutions and especially as you move towards a proof-of-stake world it's kind of an even bigger risk because they start to have kind of discretion over the system features which we saw with steam i think that was a great example the fact that so much steam ended up on exchanges introduced this like principal agent problem where the entity controlling steam and using it to vote on things was not the owner of that steam but merely the custodian so i think it becomes much more likely to have these kind of failure modes uh in a proof of stake world um so then the challenge is to like make sure it doesn't end up with with third parties so i i do think there's a risk that these systems go from being you know crypto economic in terms of the the the settlement assurances to being institutionalized which would turn them into systems that are pretty similar to to like the normal payment systems that we have today so one of the the concepts that i keep on harping on is the linkage between um your settlement assurances and the promises that you have that you can plan out your financial life into the future and long-term thinking and planning right like a lot of bitcoiners speak of a low time preference and they say that bitcoin and how stable of a system it is and the 21 million hard cap and the austrian money uh produces uh and and the strong settlement assurances of bitcoin including its censorship resistant uh resistance all gives these assurances that bitcoin is going to be the same thing as it is today into the future and that allows you to plan around that and settlement insurances provides that which is also linked to to property rights so it's hoping to get your perspective on um just the intersection between settlement assurances property rights and long-term thinking and planning and why all of this is important well settlement assurances doesn't fully do it justice there's settlement is just one part of the life cycle of using a blockchain you have the acquisition you have the steady state you know and then you have like the divestment state and what you're referring to i think is actually the study state where if you own uh if you have the private key corresponding to a public key which has a balance in that address then you have an absolute claim on that indefinitely and that is a that's a very strong property right uh it might even be the strongest form that has ever existed i mean it's so strong that it's brittle you know like some of the strongest met like metals like tungsten are really brittle um but the the reason it's brittle is that if you know you can easily lose access to your coins and then it's a problem um but yes i think this is the most profound thing about you know cryptocurrencies that they give the individual like power over their money which has not existed previously and it's very concealable it's very transportable those are new you know like there aren't other forms of property that you can do that with um and that's a very very profound thing um so it's kind of important to sanction that absolutely and make sure that that never gets impaired um so when there are and this is why i was cautioning about arbitrary changes to the system if there are things which impair those those kind of property rights for users i think that really decreases the credibility of the system so if there are confiscation events or unexpected inflation you know which is kind of a more subtle form of confiscation those are things which really damage those nice assurances that your coins are going to be there in the future um you had this happen it happens a lot with forks because forks tend to be really messy um but i think if you look beneath the surface of a lot of coin like a lot of long tail altcoins you'll notice you'll notice that these confiscation events happen a lot like dev funds will get enlarged or they'll be you know increased into perpetuity um you know certain coins will become anyone can spend and they'll just get swept like there's lots of protocol tweaks you know um hash functions will get changed arbitrarily to like you know let's say progpow had gone through you you might have said that would be an example of this so there's a lot of protocol tweaks which can like really impair the actual property rights of the users of the system and i don't know if there's enough of an acknowledgement of that you know i think like the task of protocol developers is like first and foremost to safeguard the rights of the users uh in this like you know cryptographic way and then to develop around that in a way that's safe um i know like vitalik has like really consistently stressed that he doesn't really believe in like truly absolute property rights um which is you know consistent with like the radical exchange philosophy um that would probably be one i mean radical markets radical markets yeah you know that's because they stress like really alternative compositions of property that i would say is another really significant distinction between bitcoin and well i i don't know if italic speaks for all of ethereum but yeah i would say not in that particular case yeah um because i would say that's a pretty risky view because you really do want the the the holders of the account space or the utxo set to to know and to be able to forecast many years in the future that they'll be able to spend their coins which is why it was so cool to have those coins from february 2009 be spent recently you know everything worked as intended the the holder of the keys was able to spend them you know like there was a beauty in that mm-hmm totally and uh one thing i'll add there is if you read finn brunton's book digital cash which is pretty good it's like a pre-history of bitcoin he talks about the extropians i think they're called and this was like an idea that um we should invent digital cash so that i'm probably like bungling it but digital cash should exist so that people could have a currency that worked for them as they were like sublimated into a kind of digital afterlife uh of you know of either being uploaded into the cloud or um being cryogenically frozen and coming back in 100 years and they would need to take their wealth with them and that was in he he claims this that that was one of the inspirations for the the creation of a lot of these digital cache schemas so the notion of like a truly persistent digital asset that you truly own has kind of that's been an inspiration behind the stuff even before bitcoin so i want to turn this conversation a little bit to something i know that you paid attention to and i think are optimistic for with the world of bitcoin and how that contrasts to the world of defy and that is uh the uh free for the concept of free banking uh i i if i if i'm correct in my perception and i'm not uh familiar at all with with free banking but i think that you think that free banking using bitcoin as the underlying asset uh is uh something that is ahead of us in in this world and that i think that that is the the bitcoiner version of what we are calling defy uh where you know where all of that same sort of financial services is found as applications on ethereum and do you believe do does that distinction resonate with you is that correct yeah that's yeah i think that's probably a fair way to put it i would say there's probably some things which you can't foreseeably do on defy uh this might change maybe that you can do in a in a private banking context so one of the big ones is maturity transformation which is like the core business of banks i would allege that that's not really possible on d5 right now uh which is you know um making loans and taking deposits and uh you know turning those illiquid loans like getting yield on those loans that you're issuing and paying that interest to depositors um you know i it's kind of hard to imagine how um you would a bank would issue you a mortgage in the conventional sense of the word um in like a defy context and you guys are probably going to interrupt and be like oh no there's like a project doing that but you kind of get the point like because basically you know underwriting loans is like something that requires like credit you know and uh i don't think credit per se really exists in the d5 context you know it sort of relies on this like web of interpersonal relationships and like social security numbers and stuff um and i'll probably be accused of having a very constrained vision here but i'd say that's probably the big distinction between you know like conventional commercial banking and defy but yes generally i think the the inspiration is pretty much the same like the maker system is a great example of um something that uh is transforming risk in a way that gives a token that users want to use which is die but also liens on the system's collateral and in the same way if bitcoin banking were to develop it would be kind of a similar thing um i think it's a both a scaling method and something that is convenient like people like financial services and they they desire them we've seen really explosive growth of blockfy in the last year to give an example uh you know so bitcoin native financial services are growing i think there's demand for that um i think that's really gonna be the case for for the whole cryptocurrency industry to be frank um i think you're gonna have centralized financial service companies on on ethereum complementing d5 most likely because they have different strengths you know the worry is like too much of the supply being captured by this but a certain part of it is inescapable um and so yeah i'm definitely of the school of thought that banking is and credit creation on top of these assets with the assets as the native collateral is is probably a good thing and it can be better than the free banking era because digital species you know like native units are like natively audible they're cryptographic in nature so it's easy to take physical delivery of them uh it's easy to verify that someone has them that's pretty different from gold which previously was the collateral of these systems uh you know it's hard to take physical delivery of gold it's hard to verify an audit gold so in a sense those those like nice auditability qualities make this system potentially a more stable and kind of honest system so that's why i'm always talking about proof of reserves that's kind of a way to return the guarantees of the collateral to these centralized providers um and i think that is is inevitable i think it's going to happen uh and you know hopefully we can sort of ameliorate it by instituting stuff like proof of reserve protocols so the etherean attitude here and for the bitcoiner in me when i put my bitcoiner hat on and compares the free banking with bitcoin world to the concurrent world and sees just a a a paradigm shift of improvement that i think we could expect from from that sort of world uh however the ethereum in me is pessimistic about the commitments to a trust minimized trustless uh protocolized world where the use of cryptography is kind of just where bitcoiners are on this on this train moving into a crypto crypto economic trust minimize sci-fi future and they get off on the first stop and they're like well you know i'll i'll call it good at bitcoin banks whereas like the ethereans seem to be like riding this train until it goes to its logical conclusion and seeing how far that they can take it uh is that a fair is that a fair take yeah that's probably a fair critique um i i think it was like arjun balaji that wrote this great essay about the constrained versus unconstrained vision uh which was which he felt was the big distinction between bitcorners and aetherians um i think you know don't like ascribe my opinions to all bitcoiners for sure um you know lightning is still pretty interesting and that is trust minimized in a really genuine way and then what i think will and should happen is for there to be lots of degrees of gradualism between like full custodial intermediation and uh you know true base layer bitcoin with lots of steps along the way um but uh there hasn't been you know there aren't like that many um you know smart contract there aren't that many kind of like all lightning analogs or alternatives on bitcoin that exist right now um and so you could say that's because of a lack of expensivity for instance so that's why i'm hopeful that we get um stuff like jeremy rubin's proposal through which would add expressivity uh because that's definitely an easy win um adding some more elaborate like smart contracting one follow-up question i have for you then uh nick is is i i do think not necessarily that your view is representative of all bitcoiners but that a number of bitcoiners do share this view um in the gold standard or excuse me in the bitcoin standard uh safedean talks about a world where possibly in the future you know there are a thousand banks that um you know are the only ones able to use the bitcoin network because of this scalability constraint we've talked about why you know blockchains will always have a scarce set of block space it's it's necessary as part of the design but going back to david's analogy of the sort of the first stop um are we sure we optimized that design space in in 2009 and is it really a compelling world is it really a bankless world if you know we limit the transactions on the the bitcoin network to those who afford it like it's no longer peer-to-peer it's no longer bankless uh the transactions are just high net ind worth individuals and and crypto banks and we're kind of back to where we started that that would be i would say the the bankless main critique of it but it's not necessarily a better world yeah yeah and i've certainly followed um you know the bankless uh editorial view um so to speak um i would say my first reaction would be um blockchains aren't fair you know they always do privilege whatever entity is willing to outbid someone else you know that was that was the whole uh discussion of economic density so that's just kind of intrinsic to their nature as long as there's a scarce resource the highest bidder is is going to to to win that auction right um so i would you know reject a teleology of blockchains which insists that they have to be uh open to anyone i mean they're open by their very nature and that's kind of the reason they're not fair is that they'll let anybody outbid anyone else but you know there's no notion of being of having guaranteed access to block space and i don't really see that changing um but i do i do the point is taken what i would say is i think where we are in terms of actually compressing economic economic value down into bytes is still very primitive and we have a lot that we can do in terms of compression the other thing is that as exchanges move from individual settlement to a net settlement idea between custodians and exchanges you actually free up a huge amount of block space so right now the way it works is like individual transactors deposit on exchanges and then they make withdrawals from those exchanges and that's like a very very kind of um data intensive way to operate what might happen in the future is that and then what they do is then they withdraw those coins and they send them to other exchanges you know they might get started on coinbase and then they send their coins to binance right what we might have in the future is just exchanges or custodians where you know you deposit and then instead of honoring those individual deposits and withdrawals as they occur the exchanges start to trust each other a little bit more and they actually maybe they only settle up with each other once a day and they settle the net difference between whatever the the users have deposited and withdrawn and so instead of having 10 000 transactions between coinbase and binance a day you have one or you have two and so this is actually already happening this like this move to like kind of real-time growth settlement um and it in a sense it like frees up a lot a lot of block space because you the big consumers of box base are actually being much more parsimonious about their usage and so there's this interesting effect where block space kind of gets easier to access in a sense um now you might like so hasu wrote an article about this he said that in the end exchange would be the only consumers of block space i'm a little bit more optimistic than that actually i think right now we are in a really primitive state in terms of being able to compress information um thanks to bad fee estimation and kind of poor industrial block space management techniques uh you know like not using batching uh we're still really um being very wasteful in the usage of block space the other phenomenon is like rising fees is an inducement to become more more stingy in your use of block space so there's a lot of factors which i think are combining to actually open up block space um but i would say that i would expect that um it would be fairly rare for lots of users to make base layer transactions um it's it'll likely be processed through a layer or two whether it's a kind of a more trustless layer like lightning or a more intermediated layer like banks and exchanges but yeah i think that's just the nature of the beast i think the base layer is kind of a wholesale network with the retail activity happening higher up i think we've talked a lot about the differences between you know bitcoin contrasted them anyway between bitcoins and ethereums but there there is a major difference where we're all united on if i if i could say this is uh against the centralization of these networks against the institutionalization of these networks and i do think it's incumbent upon us to guard against that centralization wherever it might might creep in um so a lot of shared values across these communities as well for sure yeah definitely um and i try and be pragmatic you know if if bitcoiners want credit creation they want financial services i'm not going to deny reality and pretend that doesn't exist and things like credit those those naturally develop you know that's like kind of the cornerstone of civilization is credit relationships um i'm optimistic that the the nice guarantees of these networks can be preserved even in a financialized world and there is definitely contingent of people that are um you know really resistant to the financialization of these networks but uh i i think that's kind of out of step with reality i have one one more topic i want to harp on nick before we wrap this up and it's the the concept of this this march of progress of these civilizations these organizational schemes that we've seen throughout history starting perhaps there's one earlier than this but perhaps starting with the most salient one which is religion which is this organizational system of people that all ascribe to this same set of rules and and it's a protocol of sorts and there's documentation there uh in the form of like the bible or the quran or the torah and each of these religions has a group of people that are are organized around it and there's zealots believers patriots and then these these religions seem to get supplanted by nations which basically had more or less the same construction right like a set of documentations protocols and rules for how to live um patriots that that would uh consider themselves you know to be a part of the system and responsible for upholding the values of the system and and we're seeing that same pattern emerge with uh these cyber civilizations these cyber systems like bitcoin and ethereum where there is like a white paper a protocol for describing how to operate and then the maximum list that make up the system uh how do you view the the is that an accurate representation and how do you view this progress of these digital whatever they are in in context of history yeah i i think that's the nation's analogy is an opt one and people often say that there's a religious element to blockchains or to bitcoiners um in particular um you know cryptocurrencies don't make any ontological claims about reality so i don't know about that i think that's maybe a bit of a stretch but um yeah these are digital commonwealths um they are fundamentally arranged around property and rules for how property can be allocated and distributed and moved and that's kind of the most fundamental thing about the state really um there's a set of protections that that property is is kind of upheld and there's no police force per se because cryptography helps with all that well that's what that's what the miners and stakers are are they not yeah yeah sure but it's you know that's kind of like the system design is intended to remove subjectivity and conflicts so you don't need that kind of reactive police force um and you know that's been attempted like i think eos had this thing where you could like steal back coins if you like convinced enough block producers to do it or something which totally didn't oh god like arbitration form or something so yeah they're you know they're new but like most of them you know to be honest are like plots of land in the desert and there's nothing growing there and there's some like you know beleaguered settlers that followed their leaders and their nice promises that they made if they're being an oasis and then they got there and it was just like a dusty wasteland that's what most blockchains are like uh there's very few that are actually thriving and where people are actually building things on their their newfound plots of land uh but yeah i totally see them as like homesteads you know out there in the wilderness uh and people are are trying to figure out how to take advantage of their their little plots um and with all the messiness that that entails um so the the digital frontier is how i think about it yeah because we wrap up i want to get get kind of a last take from you on this so we've talked a lot in this episode about ethereum and bitcoin and i think there are some in both communities that are rooting for the other community to fail i don't think that's you um you are definitely pro ethereum you don't want it to fail but to david's analogy it does feel like the bitcoin community is kind of getting off the train on the first the first stop and maybe ethereum you know d5 this bankless movement is seeing if the train can get a little bit farther down the track first but i want to ask you this question do you think it's going to work do you think this bankless thing this defy thing can actually work yeah should we just bail off the train now or what um can defy work or oh well i don't know what defy is i don't know if i've ever seen a great definition for it can banklessness work is that the question yeah so this whole thing of d5 protocols doing less with banks uh incorporating other money verbs on the base layer like borrowing and debt and lending essentially creating a block fi in defy essentially creating a coin based trading exchange and a uniswap in d5 these base layer protocols to allow you to accomplish money verbs the same sorts of things that would be accomplished in crypto banks is this whole idea going to work in your mind i think another way to phrase it is just replacing as many financial institutions as possible with protocols right so like instead of the nasdaq we have the uniswap right yeah yeah so um there are lots of functions and financial services which are which can be both codified and automated i think that's absolutely true um you know like what etf like what blackrock does is like pretty straightforward right and vanguard um so yes there are def and uh you know structuring certain derivatives uh you don't necessarily need a human and a lawyer to do that each time uh so absolutely yes um for a subset of financial services activity um i'm kind of yet to be convinced on whether you know genuine commercial banking uh can be kind of inserted on chain and represented as a set of contract relationships i think the low-hanging fruit is still remains to be exploited in terms of um identifying the the kind of tedious and automated functions which happen in the back office right now which can be represented in contract form um so there's kind of there's like a blue ocean there um and then some of the more complex functions are being targeted now which is maybe premature you know so it's definitely a question of timing for me uh but uh yeah i'd give you a qualified yes on that you heard it here guys nick carter this has been a pleasure to chat with you dave and i are big fans read everything that you write and uh it's been a pleasure to have you on the podcast man we're riding the train all the way until the end nick thanks for coming on bankless and sharing your thoughts with us really appreciate it thank you this was fun and uh dare i say challenging well i'm glad to hear it i'm glad to hear it thanks nick for for coming on and giving us your time yeah thank you my pleasure all right actions guys uh a few things that you can do the first is we're going to include some links to some of our favorite nick carter articles that you should go read one is called a peaceful revolution another on settlement assurances go and do that as your first action the second which we want you to do is go back and listen to some previous episodes maybe you're you're you know you haven't heard them yet you haven't heard the archive but we referred to a lot of them in this episode so episode 2 episode 7 episode 12 uh really those episodes build on top of the things that we talked with nick about so go check them out lastly we need those five star reviews david how are we doing on that we're doing okay but we could be doing better and so if you guys think that the bankless podcast and the bankless revolution belongs at the top of the itunes charts and that it should show up when you type in bitcoin when you type in ethereum when you type in d5 into your podcast search engine we want we want to make sure that bank list shows up there and the way that you can help us do that is by giving us those five star reviews there's a bunch of old podcasts that haven't put out uh episodes in years but since they came in during the ico mania they are still kind of sticky at the top of the crypto itunes podcast charts so help us replace those ico type podcasts and get them replaced by the bankless revolution and the way that you do that is those five star reviews guys thanks for voting for bank lists risks and disclaimers okay eat this risky we talked about bitcoin today bitcoin is also risky all of crypto is risky as is d5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everybody but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
