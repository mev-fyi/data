I think it's important to just remember uh 2022 both not just for the massive failures but also for the amazing technological and adoption backdrops that we've had and I think even the First inklings of cryptocurrency and double actions spaces ability to actually have very significant positive impacts on the world welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with Dave Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless ethereum in 2023 best guess to talk about this vitalik buterin on the podcast today we talk about what an ethereum application ecosystem is the title of this blog post what excites vitalik going into 2023 a lot of optimism dropped in this episode that you got to stay tuned for before we get in first a little bit of housekeeping for bankless listeners we are revamping our sponsor strategy uh going into the next year and we're going to be putting a focus more on the sponsors and the projects and the companies that are playing long-term games in crypto and so we're excited to be building out a strategic relationship with with Kraken the reason David and I like Kraken is because they're one of the few crypto exchanges that didn't rug us last year right David yeah they've also implemented proof of reserves before anyone ever asked them to so they have been leading the frontier of centralized crypto exchanges that can use cryptography to check themselves and so implementing proof of reserves before they were asked to just indicates that in Jesse and the rest of the Kraken team are here to do good by crypto and to leverage the powers that make crypto awesome so thank you Kraken for sponsoring this and we're excited to build out a strategic relationship with Kraken in 2023 a few things to look out for in this episode as always number one why vitalik thinks our villains are getting worse actually worse every single cycle um this being the maybe the worst cycle of villains of all number two why he plans to say ethereum rather than crypto moving forward in 2023 to describe the industry instead of applications built on top of it number three why he thinks simple defy good complicated defy bad it's a lot of nuance to that take that we get into number four how he thinks ethereum can actually solve the internet's big bad identity problem how do you determine who are the Bots and who are the humans how do you keep identity decentralized vitalik's actually bullish that ethereum has a massive role to play there and finally his answer to the question what is ethereum's most scalable use case that's an answer David I don't think either you or I expected you'll have to stay tuned for that in the episode as well what should people pay attention to as we dive in here I think the big question that is the overarching theme about this episode is how proliferated are some of the use cases that many many people and definitely us talk about for example daus how how much of a Cambrian explosion will there be with daos how many defy apps are there actually going to be are there going to be as many defy apps as there are websites or are there just going to be a few defy apps how many dials are there going to be uh and I this is one of the conversations that we start off this this podcast with vitalik he gives the example of Esperanto a esoteric language that was meant to be a universal language for everyone to adopt that would help support Global Peace and then also Linux fantastic technology with a medium amount of adoption in some specific cases versus the internet which is the most adopted piece of technology of all time how much a crypto adoption will there be in contrast to these three anchor points and what can we do to help make crypto be adopted as much as the internet and not be left to some esoteric hobbyist group who thinks the Esperanto language is cool and so we talk about this frame of reference in the application layer in the dial layer and the identity layer and how ethereum can really change the game and hopefully how we can move the needle in 2023 and look back on 2022 and take some of the lessons out of 2022 to make sure that we don't repeat them right but guys every episode with vitalik is a mustless and this is certainly no exception and David I'm excited to explore some of those topics with you in the debrief as well that's the show we record after the show for our premium members and in that David I think I want to talk to you about this idea of crypto maybe being a niche versus going mainstream something like the internet and also this theme that vitalik kept coming back to in this episode which was we actually have a role to play yes we can make crypto bigger and better and we can actually build towards a future where crypto is a technology adopted like the internet and not just some esoteric Niche so uh we'll be talking about that in the debrief too guys we are going to get right to our episode with fatality but before we do we want to tell you about these tools to help you go bankless the brave

know that actually vitalik welcome back to bankless how you doing thank you so much guys it's great to be here uh vitalik 2022 has been an absolutely crazy year um disastrous yeah and like the industry is hurting the community's feeling a lot of pain I just maybe just to kick this thing off can you just give your thoughts and Reflections on this like was this unexpected um what's your assessment of of the crypto Community after this crazy year we've had um so 2022 has been I think a complicated year right I think a lot of people are remembering the year for all of the yeah terrible stuff that's happened and within the corruptive space for all of the multi-billion dollar blow-ups but I think it's uh also important to remember all of the various positives that the crypto space has seen right um so the merge I think is the most recent one but the big one right this is something that the ethereum has been waiting for pretty much since its Inception right and it's been delayed and complexified and turned out to be more complex than we thought and uh lots of things have happened but you know now finally um as of uh September 15th I think it was uh zero six forty five UTC um you know we actually have a proof of stake chain right and you know doesn't it just like feel good to be able to say like no no not ethereum is it going to reduce its energy consumption by 99.9 but ethereum has existed energy consumption by 99.9 percent right like we're literally talking about going from a level of electricity consumption similar to the entire country of Austria to a level of electricity consumption similar to the entire country of uh I know maybe San Marino maybe Vatican like one of those right uh so huge success also from the uh just protocol security point of view um even a huge success from the usability point of view right so like a lot of people don't realize this but the merge was actually a transaction inclusion time decrease right and this happened for a couple of reasons one of those reasons is actually the easier one to understand which is that you know blocks have thousands of attestations that are coming on top of them and so you have thousands of confirmations happening in parallel and what that basically means is that a few seconds after one single blood comes you have the equivalent of what would improve of work glands be considered hundreds of confirmations right like if you go to etherscan.io blocks underscore Forks right and the most recent Forks block was six days ago in the proof of work era there would be multiple of these every hour right so that's the first reason the second reason is that because uh block times now are instead of being this like very random poisson distribution thing where you know what sometimes you have a block every yeah two seconds sometimes you have a block one way after a minute here we have a block and a nice regular pattern of 12 seconds and what this means is that on average you only have to wait six seconds for a transaction to get included right now this all sounds theoretical but just for my own very practical experience like my experience in using ethereum has just improved massively it's like you know night and day compared to let's say yeah you know July 2020 before um all of this stuff it ends before eap1559 happens right like these days when I send a transaction I click Send I wait a couple of seconds and then I see oh that transaction got included into one block and it already has one confirmation like it's not quite competitive with um you know web 2 oh my god let's pay 35 billion dollars so the latency is 184 milliseconds instead of 212 milliseconds as standards but it's like already good enough to be competitive with say credit card point of sale systems right and that's something that I think is uh really important to appreciate like there's been just this massive increase in the usability of the base ethereum chain that's happened pretty much under our noses and uh eip1559 was the first half of this the merge was the second half of this and you know the third half of this of course is going to be Roll-Ups that have pre-confirmations which is coming next year and uh later on we'll talk about how I think uh 2023 is going to be the year of uh Roll-Ups actually yeah hitting stage one of trustlessness which will make a mean that ethereum actually finally is in its scalable right but before that so the merch happens and the merge was amazing um 2022 was also the year of ZK EVMS right so five years ago the Zeitgeist basically was uh that oh there is this fancy thing called ZK sedark technology and like maybe theoretically it could make abstract proofs and you can turn things into polynomials and like put stuff on top of stuff and maybe eventually verify an ethereum block but like come on it's so high overhead that's gonna take like literally four weeks to make a proof and uh four years to actually audit the code to do any of that right um but fast forward to 2022 and we have multiple ZK evm implementations that are all promising some kind of mainnet launch next year like this is amazing right like ZK EVMS have just gone from being a non-existent pipe dream to being the I think queer and Manifesto long term and uh possibly even medium term future of scaling ethereum right so that's number two um then you know on the adoption fronts right sign in with ethereum has seen massive uh you know gains in adoption um ethereum I think goes in a great position to take advantage of people's desire to explore the very like various alternative Twitter results or if social media platforms right so uh forecaster signed into that within ethereum account lens sign into that within ethereum account and I've used a minnow forecaster and lens and they're actually great um fast forwarding to earlier in the year um I I feel like you know a lot of crypto people have forgotten about this but it's still super important to remember the Asia invasion of Ukraine in February right which is uh definitely an extremely tragic event overall but the part of it that is I think not quite happy is um obviously that they've succeeded uh in defending themselves far beyond most people's expectations but I think uh you know cryptocurrency payments actually worked for them when uh when nothing else worked and you know they've actually starting from that very first tweet that the country's official Twitter account uh you know made on the the morning or the day after the invasion you know cryptocurrency actually yeah has been a Lifeline for the country a Lifeline for a lot of civilians and the people right um and you know that's just like one example and then you know you have all these various small examples like uh you know continuing adoption happening in places like Latin America for example um you know I came to our engine tnl last year I came to Argentina this year and uh the level of sophistication has improved by yeah a lot right and uh you know we've been one of the things I saw for example is uh when I you know visited uh just uh recently there was a group I forgot their name I think it was called either defy Latimer or something uh vaguely uh called like this right but this was a yeah just a really lovely person from Venezuela and he was basically saying like hey you know vftx situations and you know helps me realize that D5 actually is important and like I want to help uh Latin Americans um you know who need crypto actually I interact with crypto in ways that are decentralized and that involve self-custody and you know this person actually knew a huge amount about uh you know Layer Two protocols a huge amount about uh you know different forms of self-custody and all of these things and so all of those things are you know continue to move forward um cryptocurrency got used for is continuing to get used for philanthropy a lot um so uh the last year was the year of um you know crypto relief India getting its money but um you know this year crypto relief India continued spending some of its money um also balveer it's this group that like I helped spin up that used some of the money to put money into these more now it's more experimental but potentially much more High payoff options um in terms of protecting people now and in the future against viruses and that's fun did amazing stuff like um you know UV lamps open source vaccine projects and uh a whole bunch of things and like cryptocurrency as a international payment instrument for philanthropy has just been huge there right so I think it's important to just remember uh 2022 both not just for the massive failures but also for the amazing technological and adoption backdrops that we've had and I think even the First inklings of cryptocurrency and abortions spaces ability to like actually have very significant positive impacts on the world um but you know that's the year so well vitalik thank you so much for coming into this with your your Optimus hat on and just reminding us that sometimes the bad definitely drowns out the good as someone who's been through multiple Market Cycles like every single Market cycle has the bad year right the down year right 2018 was was my first one there was one prior to that is 2022 unusual in any respects or is this kind of par for the course of like yeah this is this is what happens at the the the la the latter half of eight ball Market we have a lot of bad stuff but meanwhile there is Relentless adoption regardless uh no matter what year it is uh is 2022 unusual for you uh in contrast to other years of crypto I'm trying to compare 2022 against the yeah and of early to mid bear Market periods of the previous Cycles right um actually yeah if you want to show people visuals one great visual to show right now is uh the Bitcoin price from uh 2011 to now Bitcoin just because ethereum unfortunately didn't exist in 2011. um but if you look at that right you know you see again if the great Cycles right and uh you know you have 2011 um and then the really big one at the end of 2013 and then the even bigger one in 2017 and then the yeah and a super big one in uh 2021 right and see the the very first one at the left it's like so low that we don't even notice it right um like if you just click if you just click the log button wow and so the 2015 right so if you go down that flat part after the first uh Peak that's when ethereum launched right so then 2018 uh that's the uh flat and the kind of cup and handle after the second uh bull market that's when uniswap was created and started existing for the first time now let's look at the flat and like slightly decreasing line after the third bubble um that's when the merge happened and we had multiple zke VMS and we're starting to see serious layer 2 adoption uh so the Asia post uh Peak periods are always uh periods in which there actually are some pretty significant technological uh progress uh that is happening they are periods where I mean often it's easier for people to get back to work because the numbers aren't giving them dopamine hits every six hours anymore and their periods where a lot of real work gets done and even periods where the good gets separated from the bad right so one of the other reasons I wanted to make that analogy is that if you go back to 2014 right the uh the FTX of 2014 kind of uh Mount gox I actually kind of don't want to even call them out Glock CFC access 2014 because I just feel like the way like Mark repels did a whole did a bunch of horrible stuff but I actually feel like the way that he has handled himself post blow up has actually been kind of honorable like you know she hasn't tried to give himself a yesu Jewish style uh Redemption Arc or um you know in like kind of give himself attention on Twitter he just kind of you know what quiet for a while just diligently worked on helping people get their money back and you know working on on on gods and other and and other things right like that's uh it's like our villains are getting lower quality now right that's uh like Mark I think you know he is actually yeah like improved in ways that like I just unfortunately um you know don't expect uh people like uh so like Sue and Kyle to improve even a decade from now yeah but no very much hope I'm wrong though I yeah I think I'm enough I I I'm always happy when people positively outperform my expectations uh right but the milkbox blow up in 2014. it did feel like an existential crisis for the crypto space it felt like a huge crisis for Bitcoin it felt like a huge crisis for legitimacy it was an invitation for Regulators to swarm around the space and it's uh did have a lot of bad consequences in all kinds of places and it made a huge number of people very unhappy uh 2022 uh you know a lot of very similar things are happening except you know now we have a I think a much more interconnected uh crypto space and we have a lot more sophistication and so you know on the other hand a lot more fragility and contention happening right though I think it's important to remember that like in 2014 there was fragility and contingent too right because mungox when it collapsed it was both the thing causing the crypto price to prices to crash and also the uh thing that people were used to as being the place where price has moved up and down and so the market will had to like basically crash ants change where it uh where its numbers were coming from at the same time right and here you know this year we had the double whammy of uh you know obviously first uh Luna uh coming back down to earth and Tara going back to down to somewhere much much lower than Earth um and you know six months later obviously yeah FTX blowing up and then a month after that I think um but block five is like in a in bankruptcy or something like that now right so it's uh definitely Echoes of a similar situation but at the same time like I don't want to all be Rosy about it because I think uh the other thing that's important to remember now that I think will make 2022 harder to recover from than 2014 is that I think a community having like the severely High variance and like both High excitement and high turn off approach to existing is something that's a very good strategy when you're trying to increase adoption from 0.1 percent to 10 but it's a terrible strategy when you're trying to increase adoption from 10 to 70 right I think this is a a criticism I would have made of Bitcoin maximalism uh some time uh a go-to right that if you're just a small community then if you say uh you know incredibly over the top things about how the US government is the primary source of all evil in the world and money printing is the reason reason why you know we have some kind of military status dystopia instead of uh you know Switzerland like Happy Land for everyone um then it's uh you know you're going to turn off a lot of people who clearly kind of see through those attitudes and realize that there's a lot more complicated stuff going on in the world but at the same time there is going to be some portion of the population that like really believes in the thing you believe or is really receptive to the thing you believe and they're attracted to the passion with which you say it and so they're going to you know wants to come along with you and uh you know being in this kind of Siege mentality where they are one of the few brave Soldiers pushing forward the future even if um you know sewage portions of the mainstream world and the Paul krugmans and uh the Elizabeth Warrens and all those characters are you know rapidly against them like there's a group of people to whom that like being in that position of the Season narrative really appeals to them right but that's how you get from 0.1 to 10 and crypto is no longer in the stage of getting from 0.1 percent to ten percent so I think there have been adoption charts and like estimates that people have attempted to make and in some countries ownership of cryptocurrency is like literally at the 10 of the population level so now it look the space is at the level of trying to get from 10 to 70 and that requires different strategies and strategy is aware you know this really crazy stuff that keeps losing people five billion dollars keeps happening are like the exact opposite of what the space wants and needs to do right so I yeah you know I wanted to give the message of optimism but also give this kind of important message that there is uh a lot of work that needs to be done and uh you know the status quo even if it's a status quo that's like Siri kind of secretly exciting and fun for a lot of us like that's uh you know not the sort of thing that we want crypto to continue to be four years from now if we actually wanted to succeed is it is it possible we just get stuck in that niche of that zero to ten percent we never I mean I know it's possible but do you think that's a like a a high probability outcome it's a good question um back in I think 2011 or 12 one of the earliest articles that I wrote for Bitcoin weekly and it was called something like uh Bitcoin Esperanto Linux or the internet right basically comparing Bitcoin to uh like three different things that started off as being these very idealistic movements to replace the existing system with a totally different and much better system right so Esperanto was this constructed language invented by Yellowwood in the late 19th century the goal basically being to create a language which is easier to learn because it has much simpler and more regular spelling and grammar um and uh it's the theory was that you know everyone would wear an Esperanto in addition to their national language and everyone could speak Esperanto with each other and that would be the path to world peace right and Esperanto ended up not really succeeding right it's this fairly Insurance community at this point and you know there are speakers but it's like enthusiasts that are just uh you know in it as a hobby like even more much more than a yeah pragmatic Communications will work in actual attempts to make World Peace at this point right and which is like sad I mean I personally love uh like I never learned Esperanto super deeply but uh you know it's uh that's it's a really cool language I think the world probably would have been better if it got much more adopted what's cool about it by the way just so you turn it out for just a second it's a combo of kind of like I mean is it some sort of Latin derivative or this is really based from scratch they they built a new layer from the ground up so it's different it's uh Esperanto is interesting so like I mean I have this combination of very uh like positive and critical views of it um I think uh the the critical view was basically that it's a language that's drove to be Universal but actually it ended up being like very European specific so like uh for example the way that you make a plural in Esperanto is you add a ga and a j is pronounced yeah right so kind of like how in Eastern European languages or um or in German uh right uh so if you want to say some if you want to uh I think what like trying to think of like a good good examples for nouns in Esperanto this is like I think homo is a is like a person and homoi is people um let me just uh check that quickly um but and then you have like the and which is which is the accusative case right the accusative case is like the same like you know how an English like if you're doing something you say I am doing something if someone's doing something to you you say someone's doing something to me so I is the nominative and Mia C accusative so uh a lot of European languages have that for nouns and as well as pronouns and uh Esperanto has that for nouns as well um so it has a lot of these very European specific features but at the same time the good is that it is extremely regular um so it's uh even um things like so like English for example right like you have words like who what where when why um and then you have like well that because therefore at that time right and so or if you want like the negative then you have no one never for no reason right and like you have this kind of two by two table that's really complicated in Esperanto it's like a really yeah it's an incredibly clean system where like I think it's that like the first half of the word is like do you mean which do you mean uh do you mean that do you mean no one and then the second half of the word is like referring to a person or referring to a time or referring to a place um so it's got a lot of regularity in the grammar it's got a lot of regularity in the spelling right so English has a lot of this uh you know really dumb spelling rules and you have to memorize you know memorize spellings of a lot of words really thoroughly um including the word thoroughly which like makes sad totally no sense but I guess that's the point right even if you design the most perfect language from a technical perspective that's not how you actually get adoption for the language right so there's like the theoretical Perfection right so this is this is the analogy right it's uh you know it has all these beautiful technical properties but the adoption roadmap basically went nowhere right and instead like English had too much of a network effect and uh you know especially post World War II we were pretty much every major country except for the United States uh got turned into ruins um you know that I think set English on a past to dominance and uh I don't really think anything else is in a position to challenge it now right so that's Esperanto now Linux is an interesting middle case right so Linux is interesting because it's kind of succeeded and it kind of has not succeeded right so Linux is this open source operating system so it's uh an alternative to things like mac and windows so I'm speaking right now through a computer that is running a Linux distribution but Linux has had this uh interesting mixture of success and failure so Linux on the desktop is mostly a failure so it is a products that is continuing to be developed and it is very usable and I use it and I think it's great but it just doesn't quite appeal to the majority of people right but on the other hand Linux has become this really important select back end thing so Android for example which a lot of phones use runs on the Linux kernel a huge portion of all the servers run on Linux a huge portion of developers like including people who write the ethereum code base that not all but it's very significant portion their computer they run Linux on their computers because Linux is just very developer friendly right so there's a lot of uh play like specific communities and specific applications in which Linux is very entrenched and then there's this permanent dream of Linux as an open source operating system becoming this thing that really takes over for everyone but that just ends up never quite succeeding right and then the third is the internet and the Internet is just obviously you know completely taking over everything right and so my question back in 2011 is uh is Bitcoin going to look more like Esperanto more like Linux or more like the internet and I kind of was willing to accept all three possibilities as being likely and I wasn't sure yet I think today cryptocurrency is way past being Esperanto right uh but uh it does the question is like how linuxy is it going to be or how internety is it going to be and I don't know I mean it's very possible that it's going to be in the middle right so like it's very possible that well just one example in developed countries it's going to be like Linux on the desktop but in the yeah developing world it's gonna become like uh ubiquitous it's very possible that that in both worlds it's going to be something that's uh organized or concentrated around a few particular industries that where I'd say yeah reversibility of credit card transactions and other things just like totally makes no sense in cryptocurrency is the best thing that works it might just be something that people have as a store of value without really using day-to-day and when a big crisis comes it just becomes uh suddenly really important for people and people are appreciate it right or it's possible that um you know the next uh basically all of the infrastructure of the next wave of technology is going to be built around Linux uh oh sorry built around cryptocurrency right hopefully cryptocurrency analytics that would be more the web 3 that last piece of the web 3 meme yeah so which one is it going to be I don't know and I mean I am a definite Optimist on this I think which one it's going to turn out to be a depends crucial way on how hard we try and uh what we try to do interesting so you actually think that we have a lot of agency over the outcome of whether or not a crypto actually replaces the internet or just provides a few very useful applications I think absolutely um I think it's actually really important for like good people in the yeah ethereum space to recognize that they have agency and exercise it because I think if good people act passive then the things that take over just are going to be um you know the the drama queens of the world right and like I think we as people trying to build actually meaningful things you know have a responsibility to work hard to drown out the drama Quinns and uh that's a challenge and and I think sometimes it's the way you can't do worse sometimes we do better but you know I gotta try that is a challenge metallic but that like I I'm almost tempted to to um turn this into like give us some personal advice here like how do we do that all right so I I'm leaving partially 2020 to again feeling embarrassed that I'm in crypto oh you have a crypto podcast at your next how's that going how's that going for you and you know mainstream people outside sort of the the normies the people who are in the 90 not the the 10 uh they're looking at this industry and being like what is this just run by a bunch of kind of clowns and scammers like where are the adults are they I thought you guys you preached crypto values and then I see all of this and so um I'm feeling a little down at the end of of 2022 but also reflective in in terms of like why could we have done better what lessons could we learn do we need to like um I mean I know we've talked before about like how you call out you know scammers and kind of the social layer and you can you can Veer too far to one extreme or another but uh yeah what are you what are your thoughts advice for us in general and then maybe we can we talk about like uh lessons for the entire community so just to kind of start slowly moving into the Asia blog post we wanted to talk about a bit uh the Asia will start with the first eight words of it right so the title um I intentionally said what in the ethereum application ecosystem excites me instead of what in the crypto space excites me this is uh in experiments I've been uh trying right basically yeah like using the word crypto OS and using the word ethereum more uh and this is like a subtle thing I mean it's still an early stage experiment so I'm not entirely uh you know sure what all what what all the consequences of emphasizing ethereum in particular much where would be but like the theory here like it so first of all it's not maximalist right so it's not saying like you know focus on ethereum to the exclusion of everything else it's more saying we are not going to implicitly Ally with you just because you are a cryptocurrency by default right the Asia problem with the crypto space is that the crypto space is an ungovernable comments that has a no barrier to entry right so if you remember you know the basics of you know lrn or ostrom's theory of the commons and white Commons has create tragedies of the commons and what common says can be governed one of the basic ingredients for comments to be governed is gatekeeping right like you have to actually be able to um you know say you know this is us and this is not us and actually be able like have some level of enforcement or filtering in the thing that is us with the crypto space like the only qualification to be able to call yourself part of the crypto space and not have people complain is to just like somehow use cryptography and to have some kind of change data structure somewhere like those are literally the qualifications like you don't even need decentralization right like I forget has Iota even gotten rid of their coordinator yet I forget that no right the answer is no right but like xrp right like you know they're like still completely Central realized and but you know at the same time they are you know on coin market cap and uh you know still I think uh haven't apologized for writing documents into the yeah uh to the US government uh basically saying that they should be favored over Bitcoin and ethereum because Bitcoin and ethereum are China controlled so like so Vitality when you have a permissionless Commons you're saying the role of gatekeeper is essential and that rule is essentially a kind of a social layer type role let me let me throw the criticism at you that you might expect to see you probably won't expect to hear that now but like earlier this year you would have would have expected to hear that if you talk about the ethereum ecosystem well that makes you an ethereum maximalist okay and crypto is much broader than ethereum and we live in a multi-chain world here and so decentrals pumping your bag you're just pumping your bags and decentralized values can exist outside of ethereum or the so-called crypto values can exist so stop limiting yourself ourselves to ethereum that was kind of the Jiu Jitsu move some some pulled whenever you start trying to like redefine the boundaries and start to do a little bit of gatekeeping okay so this is a good point so here is my um analogy so suppose um that you have an American politician uh who goes on CNN and uh he says um you know here is a package of policies here are some things that I want to deregulate here are some things that I want to subsidize um and I hear some things that that I want to encourage and the combination of these ideas is needed to reinvigorate American Prosperity into the 21st century if you hear someone saying this from the perspective of a young non-american does that sound to me America maximalist no well right yeah no it doesn't right um like it does get it does get a little bit complicated right because like like there is definitely a like I think a real effect where there's like some Americans that sort of act like the non-america world doesn't exist but I think like just uh you know this the sentence that I just said like you know it is totally innocuous right um well the difference though is that uh being people are frequently born into America and then that's just like not actually their choice whereas when you come into the crypto space you're kind of like a blank slate and you get to choose your chain or tribe that you align with so I think that's the main biggest difference there that is true um though I think uh oh no I feel like the whole like I've even seen immigrants to America uh like but be on both sides over the uh you know wheel of American Prosperity discourse um but I think you know even still looking sometimes like oh look the point that I want to make about ethereum right is that I think that there should be a way to talk about ethereum that doesn't uh implicitly yeah you know lens Credence uh to the uh you know the Lunas and the xrps and the iotas and the Bitcoin satoshi's visions of the world but that still does leave room for uh kind of valuing the the good and the yeah honorable things that are happening in other ecosystems right so uh like I'm happy to say that you know I think the cosmos ecosystem for example uh yeah you know I deeply respect it because it is one of the few that's actually trying a very like different region of design space and you know they have this vision of uh you know a larger number of blockchains each of those blockchains has a small number of validators they use these protocols to talk to each other you know and they give up on shared security but they have to give up on side coupling but they have modularity and you know here's their arguments for wireless might be a good idea and like I yeah I really respects the fact that you know they have a technical Vision they push a technical Vision first they in my view have not been pumping zombie uh you know they have not done any they have not bought any stadiums they uh you know have not uh put the face of their founder up on cylinders all over San Francisco so look that's something I respect um you know the zikash ecosystem I think I've talked about about them considered consistently many times um you know Bitcoin I uh I value the self-custody uh ethos adds the decentralization ethos and I think that's one then we have a lot to learn from right so the thing that I'm getting at is that I think there should be a way to like both talk about ethereum and even talk about ethereum like non-etherium projects that we still think are contributing to good um but in a way where like we're not extending Alliance to everyone by default and so this is uh look this is one of the things that I'm in the process of thinking through right like basically yeah what exactly what is the the right formula for doing that as uh like if you think about things from that perspective right like in 2022 what's the worst thing that happened in ethereum land I would say probably like see this also depends on how you define ethereum land because nfts board Apes for example right some people would point to that and say look celebrity endorsements kind of pump and dump nft where's the nft well that was an ERC 721 on what on ethereum so is ethereum ecosystem question mark I don't know uh maybe something like that I would point to I think if board apes are the worst thing that happened in ethereum in 2022 that's really doing it okay yeah I agree with that too yeah okay um what's what's the worst thing that happened in Cosmos in 2022 I don't oh oh except for Tara I mean do you consider Tara and Luna Cosmos yes yes you do that is true that is a yeah that's uh that's why these boundaries are so difficult right it's a good point right see the this is why I'm kind of intentionally hedging this as a kind of thought in progress right because I think like ultimately there definitely is a trade-off between being permissionless in the good sense and being permissionless in the sense of like letting literally anyone who wants to come in and borrow your social credibility which is the type of permissionless system we don't want and there's probably some kind of balance to draw between those um will so that's actually an interesting case to unpack because like I I feel like no one blames Cosmos the ecosystem at all for the Terra Collapse by the nature of the app chain model everything's kind of like compartmentalized right and so while there is uh composability risk says in the value of UST that got spread across the trains and Cosmos all went to zero no one really blames Cosmos as a whole for that by the nature of how app chains come together uh perhaps one of the worst things to answer to after about the question what's the worst thing that happened in the ethereum ecosystem I'm pretty sure the Wonderland drama which was a kind of uh ethereum's microcosm of Terra it was an algorithmic stable coin stablecoin went to zero uh turns out Xerox sifu was the X quadranga uh Perpetual like fraudster scammer person uh that did happen on ethereum in ethereum D Phi uh and so like that that was on our chain that was inside of our borders this is true but I guess the Saving Grace is like the ethereum influencer elite never treated Daniella Sesto with respellitis dose of respect right yeah yeah he uh I I fought with him for sure yeah and I'm pretty sure even like the cosmos sub influencer Elite uh yeah did they ever like treat Tyra with that much deep respect I actually think so I know I don't remember any instance of this right it's so vitalik um we want you one of the main reasons to bring you on the show today is because of a recent fantastic blog post I want to connect these these conversations that we've had to this blog post uh first with this uh this first question um one of the things that I've been personally thinking about uh is and as a result of your blog post is um one of the main uh euphoric statements that like I echoed and many people in in crypto in 2021 echoed is like there's going to be a Cambrian explosion of Dao's there will be so many defy apps nfts and nft projects for absolutely everyone and then and that was like okay this is web 3 is replacing the internet we have this internet thing and where it's going to completely be replaced by web3 so earlier we were having this conversation it's like all right is crypto Esperanto Linux or the internet and you're like well definitely not Esperanto um hopefully more than Linux um perhaps as big as the internet but TBD and then when I was reading uh some of the components of your of your blog post which is like you said titled which what applications in ethereum that I believe in um I was thinking like oh maybe actually in the defy landscape there's only a handful of very strong very useful defy applications things like uh exchange dexes like uniswap and Sushi swap things like borrowing and lending services like Ave and then you know beyond that a few more but not too much more after that and then also there's a conversation on daos uh are there are there going to be a Cambrian explosion of dows where me and my group chat form a Dao and so does like every other group chat in the world for me down we have all these bajillion dials out there Dallas for every single stated purpose that exists or is decentralization much more surgically applied to a few more use cases and so these are some of the lessons that I I'm thinking of and this is guy wanting to think I think being an overworking thing for the rest of this podcast but before we dive into specifically your uh article I just want to to ask you as a whole what lessons do you think we learned as an industry in 2022 now that we are in December looking backwards like what what lessons did you personally learn vitalik and what lessons do you think we should all uh make explicit here on this podcast so that we can know to not do them again in 2023 and Beyond yeah I think the big takeaway is that I think the crypto space is added to most honorable only insofar as it actually takes its own core principles seriously um so like I mean well what those corporate symbols are should be pretty obvious right it's you know decentralization openness self-custody being transparent with people right and those are all values that FTX did the exact opposite of uh pretty much since the beginning right and those are I would say even even values that Terra violated to some extent I mean I think Tara's a more complicated case because Tara was a hybrid of a mechanism that was open and transparent but it was just bad with a mechanism that the the rescue funds which was uh completely opaque um but [Music] that was FTX I think uh definitely you know the exact opposite of uh openness and uh trust was this um a lot of the applications that grew a lot but then ended up completely failing they uh probably tried too hard to kind of integrate with the mainstream and doing that by compromising toward the mainstream ways of doing things and eventually it just get to the point where you realize there was just no point in having a blockchain left right so my one of the examples of this might be like the uh supply chain blockchain trial I think it was uh ASX or one of those groups that I did it and it just shut down recently right there's just a lot of these Enterprise blockchain projects that have quietly shut down over the last couple of years um and even the the blockchain project uh Enterprise projects that were not shutting down they generally went into the direction of hey how about we're going to be more public chain now right and like that's a trend that I feel like we've been talking about for a few years already um so what kinds of things have succeeded right so uniswap has succeeded Rye has succeeded um die um you know in the middle of a very complicated governance discussion wish it success uh you know the ethereum base layer succeeded ens succeeded right so um smart contract wallets Rising um account abstraction Rising um privacy technology I think it's uh obviously AJ hit a yes speed bump with uh the the various legal issues but that's uh I think something that's that is going to continue it is going to pick up again um next year and um over the next couple of years so there's just a lot of different uh things that like actually are blockchaining and open and decent and decentralized and trusted that basically survived the whole situation completely unscathed right and it's the centralized stuff where everyone is wondering like you know hey am I ever going to get my money back right and thus like there's actually different ways of having this perspective right so like the more crypto negative way of having this perspective would be to say that like oh crypto was more honorable when it understood that it was like a yeah very Niche gray Market thing kind of like the Pirate Bay and it just tried to be that um but then the speculators came in and tried to turn it into something much much bigger than uh what it was supposed to be and that's where all all of the biggest biggest harms are coming from right so like that's a view that you definitely hear from a certain tribe of uh like more crypto negative people but in some ways that's basically saying the same thing right so you know whether you believe the more crypto positive kind of like cilantro that or the more crypto negative Slants on that like the core idea that the parts of the crypto space that are honorable are are the parts of the crypto space that actually try to stay true to its values I think is uh something that there is a very broad agreement on and that's the thing that you know I want to double down on yeah I agreed um and um yeah the the things that did stay true to those decentralization values are still left standing at the end of 2022. so let's talk about this because you wrote this post uh what in the ethereum application ecosystem excites me and he broke it into kind of five different uh categories money defy identity Dows and hybrid applications and I I know you picked these five for a reason so let's talk about each and it's it's actually interesting because that that you put money is the first because um I think maybe it was um a lot of what you're saying I think the last time you came into the bankless podcast or maybe a couple times ago vitalik was like Hey money is one use case and that's cool but I'd love to expand outside of money and yet money is the very first use case so could you talk about this is this a proven thing what do you see in the in the in the money use case that's actually uh exciting in in ethereum no you make a good point so like I think there has been this uh contradiction in the ethereum space almost since the beginning between a vibe that wants to try to be more than just money um in part because it wants to try to be more than just Bitcoin um versus you know the reality that's just obvious from the outside of the space which is that uh cryptocurrency as currency just is far more proven than um all of the more speculative stuff I I actually think though that the two perspectives are more compatible than it might seem and the reason why they're more compatible than it might seem is uh because of the application category that I spent the least time on in this post is D5 right like I think uh the vibe that I was uh reacting to when for example I made that presentation and Paris uh about uh a year and a half ago uh was one where there was not too much attention on money a huge amount of attention on all kinds of incredibly complicated defy things and then a tiny amount of attention on you know non-money and identity and social stuff right and my view on defy that I will get into in this post is basically that I think simple defy good complicated D5 bad right like by far the most important applications in the D5 space in terms of actually being able to provide value to people are just incredibly simple stuff like for example stable coins right stable coins are defy they do involve significant financial engineering especially if they are something like die or rye the tristo work without centralized external collateral but they provide a service that's like very simple and dumb to the point where you don't even realize that it's D5 but you know they are D5 at the same time uh uniswap is D5 but it's just so simple and we've had it for like five years now right um prediction markets are D5 but we've had them for five years like generally I think uh D5 that we've had had for four years is uh generally a better kind of D5 a D5 that emerged in the last two years is my general take right and you're not saying that that just because of how old they are you're talking about there's a certain uh kind of product that came out of the early cohort of D5 that new D5 is fundamentally just different from it's not about the time right exactly I think well it's a product of the time but it's not about the time right it's a product of the time because the applications that emerged in the more old school period were applications that uh really cared about providing like this specific forms of utility that are very queer to people and in this like very abstract way where they're queer even if you're not part of the ecosystem already whereas the newer stuff it's like oh well we're gonna build a thing and you can liquidity Farm it and it looks like you can maybe get 11.4 APR interest and you know Hush Hush we're not going to talk too much about whether or not the 11.4 APR is sustainable so it just uh the newer stuff basically yeah tends to be more often justified by like short-term evidence of what it does and that's a very bad epistemology in the D5 space because it's just so easy to get short-term good performance by sacrificing long-term performance right whereas the categories of applications that existed for four years like if they did not have long-term value people would have forgotten about them by now so that although I would say like honestly four years ago even the ponzis were more honorable like what do you mean you know there were some pretty sophisticated games four years ago right where uh you know they're the these uh experiments where people would like stick their money and and then the first person to take their money out would lose some percentage and though you'd have to hold your other coins in the system for longer than everyone else or you'd have these games where if you're the last person to touch the thing before no one touches it for 12 hours you get a special reward and like it was just actually fun it was like it was like transparent that Ponzi was transparent everyone knew what they were doing rather than this fakery yeah so the game I'm pretty sure you're referring to is called just game just dot game I think that actually migrated to Tron because Justin son paid them to but it was very explicitly like this is the Ponzi it was a Ponzi game but huge emphasis on the word game it was a casino game that would be a great and awesome and fun casino game and it made no intentions on promising any sort of outcome if you lost and I think that's what you're talking about Metallica is like it was more Honorable in the sense that like no no one is like if you partake well partake in it like that's on you if you lost money exactly whereas the new stuff it's like there's a lot of obfuscation like there was uh often even layers of obfuscation going on like there's obfuscation uh trying to against VCS obfuscation Against The Regulators obfuscation against uh token holders against for early participants and Elite participants and sometimes it's this kind of layered game where like oh everyone understands that this thing refers to this thing and you know you have this arguments about like well why it has to be this way but then the problem with that with doing things in that way is that it basically creates no way to distinguish uh bits or no way for good projects to distinguish themselves from things where the thing that they're obfuscating is that their entire project disappearance game and uh like the good the good side of what emerged in 2021 basically turned out to be unsustainable and ended up just kind of like slowly offering lower and lower rates over time and the bad side of what launched in 2021 just ended up blowing up completely so it so in both cases it was over optimistic in terms of what it promised but you know one of the some of it degraded gracefully and some of it degraded very not gracefully and so what I want to go back to is just more doubling down on and refining the uh kind of fewer but really important ingredients that we have already known for quite a few years are actually really valuable in importance to people so you are still bullish on simple defy uh complicated Define not so much can we go back to kind of the money for a second and just maybe from somebody who's outside the crypto Industries perspective like why are you why are you still excited about the money use case in general like why do we need crypto money vitalik like digital money uh a central bank digital currency could do that right we could we could scale out what um PayPal is doing or you know um some other kind of are you just talking about digital money why why is this crypto money different or important well I personally have a used like cryptocurrency as money huge numbers of times over this year right and like for me the use case basically is like medium scale Investments and charity donations right like you know just sending a couple hundred thousand dollars to some uh charity that's you know giving money to poor people or supporting Health Care in Africa or some or somewhere like that uh just like quickly routing money to Medical organizations that are based in all kinds of countries these are um you know investing in US investing in startups these are all cases where cryptocurrency is actually significantly more efficient than the existing banking system and like I don't think that it's temporary like I think that there's structural reasons why cryptocurrency is better at surviving as a frictionless international thing than uh like Fiat uh traditional traditional banking systems do right and so I think it's actually is an open question whether or not cbdc is even will be able to compete against that in that same way right like if uh you know China launches uh you know DC APN does a really good job of it then like that could easily get a lot of adoption in China but would people be willing to use it in Vietnam or Singapore I don't know right so whereas cryptocurrency uh you know is a thing that actually yeah has like this very International reach already even today right so that's one thing um and that's just because it's kind of in a way trying to fulfill a very similar goal as the Esperanto language which is like you know F every single nation-state currency uh because of the borders uh but let's make a brand new currency and everyone can use that instead exactly right like for a uh from the point of view of a country yeah a government um having 10 of your National economy suddenly be a carried out in cryptocurrency is much more scarier than 10 of your economy suddenly being carried out in US dollars right because in the second case the US government has power over you in the first case it doesn't so the definitely is this uh structural aspect where because of its neutrality cryptocurrency has an advantage that Fiat currencies cannot have right and like there are countries that have a reputation for neutrality but the problem is that all the countries that have a reputation for the neutrality don't have scale once a country has when Once if they have neutrality they get eaten up by the countries that don't have neutrality because the countries that don't have neutrality have the larger armies exactly right or potentially just like the larger economies and the larger will to kind of bully them into going along with the local block um you know these aren't things that happen all the time um certainly right but that's just to be right so like I uh interact with lots of people around the world but I yeah you know I'm still ultimately a well-connected rich country person but then if you go out away from that and uh you go to uh you know all kinds of uh places in Latin America Africa Middle East southeast Asia and those kinds of places like there the financial system is often not even well connected to Rich Country Financial systems right like often enough cryptocurrency just is by far the easiest way to send money home to people's families cryptocurrency it can be even the easiest a way to make payments it could be the easiest way to save money that is uh much more guaranteed to not uh you know drop by you know like a factor of two every year for pretty much forever right like there are a lot of places where existing Fiat currencies are very unstable it existing Fiat Financial systems are very unconnected and where you know the banking system doesn't necessarily even wants to connect uh or wants to connect it right well basically because there's just almost no incentive for them to uh so those are the kinds of places where I think cryptocurrency it just has queer use cases uh even today and uh where I expect it's more valuable to succeed in the long term and where if you go to the places and you go to the meetups and you talk to the people the culture there just feels much more genuine and more real right like it's not talking about these kinds of issues theoretically it's uh you know you have people saying like hey I'm from this country and in my country there actually was a hyperinflation and because I was able to put money into Bitcoin and if I was actually able to protect my savings and like these are actual experiences that you regularly hear from people there right and I think a culture that is animated by those kinds of goals is just much healthier than a country where they like the thing that is animated by is like oh look uh you know I have a 36 000 monkey and that's my pass to get into some kind of elite New York City nightclub right it's like if I were to go to a New York City nightclub I'd almost want to see what would one of out of a New York City nightclub one is that I would want it to open at 4am um instead of closing at 4am because I think people who have the discipline to wake up in the morning are probably are possibly more interesting um I would want to possibly exclude people who have a monkey that costs more than thirty thousand dollars um or uh you know pretty much the exact opposite of what the the New York City monkey seeing is is doing right now right so that's uh you know you're just not going to get a a great culture when you have people that just don't have problems for themselves personally that are uh that that cryptocurrency can solve other than get getting rich off of other people's problems right um and so have like the cryptocurrency communities that are best I think are the ones that are not in that position and like developing world is one example and then I think another good example is like developed world but um you know it's a more like activist scene or like you know like certain like you know industries that get deep platforms buy Banks and payment systems all the time and those kinds of things um so that's uh you know like those kinds of places are the places where I can actually expects the most interesting work to happen over time um and those are the places that are in a lot of cases using blockchains and cryptocurrency already right and I think the main challenge there is that today a lot of the time people are using uh cryptocurrency by interacting with binance accounts and it would be ideal if these people had more more decentralized options available to them too and that's uh one of the reasons why I'm you know really excited about the social recovery wallet and you know smart contract while in account abstraction ecosystem uh you know why I'm excited about what your two technology to bring fees down and uh you know excited about privacy technology and all these other things arbitrim1 is pioneering

fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network I want to hop back over to the the D5 conversation before we tie a bow on the money in D5 conversations and move on to the identity conversations but on the D5 conversation [Music] to me we're in this like limbo period where we don't really know if there's going to be a Cambrian explosion of Dao's a a brand new wave of defy apps and one of the things that um Ryan and I would previously communicate on the bank list podcasts uh is that you know the defa the application layer the defy layer is always kind of the frontier there while there's not that many uh well there's not that much room for layer ones and layer twos out there like there can't be there can't be as many blockchains as there are applications there will naturally be more applications than there are blockchains and like kind of the a large part of the wealth generation of the protocol layer is not like completely over but it's we've gone through that adoption wave like ethereum is half a half a trillion dollars or maybe a quarter trillion dollars um uh and and so like the one of the things we've communicated is that like the application layer is where a lot of the wealth is left to uh to create there's lot of wealth creation on the application there and so if maybe maybe you were too late to explore the rise of the protocols but the rise of the applications will never stop coming right there will always be new applications on the frontier to explore and that is where that's why some of the concentration of wealth in ethereum I don't think is the biggest problem because the application layers this natural diffusing mechanism because new defy apps new tokens tokens go up and down and a new place to establish wealth but if we're if I'm if I'm now kind of considering that there's actually fewer D5 applications than there really needs to be in and instead of there needing to be thousands and thousands of D5 apps there really only needs to be like 10 or 15 to really be comprehensive now I'm starting to worry that like uh there is less churn and there is less opportunity out there um do you have any thoughts or Reflections on this there's definitely less low-hanging fruit out there right and I think that's important to just recognize and I think there's a huge amount amounts of opportunity right like if you can make a wallet that a billion people use that's a huge opportunity if you can make a stable coin that can actually survive you know anything up to including a US dollar hyperinflation and you know Doge forbid the US dollar hyperinflation actually ends up happening then you know that's uh a huge um oh opportunity as well if you can you know create something that can actually you know be a Lifeline for everyone going through that situation um if you can get signed in with ethereum to work and you can like unseat Facebook and uh you know Google and Twitter as they kind of log in overlords over the Internet that itself is a huge opportunity right and there's there are still huge things that are Loft on claims that still can be built but they're harder to build right like you can't just build um you know obfuscated casinos and get people to throw 13 million dollars in and just uh have a fairly quick path to Victory um so that's the the place where I think the space is in now and I think the people that are going to be more successful are the people that are actually willing to put that kind of hard work in next on your list of uh applications that you believe in is identity and there's a line in your article that I'd really like to to pull out where you say um for for a long time I have been bullish on blockchain identity but bearish on blockchain identity platforms can you unpack the difference between those two things what's the difference between blockchain identity versus a an identity platform sure so identity is a complicated term that refers to a whole bunch of different ideas right so like the concept of authentication just proving that the identity that you are using to sign a particular message to post this a particular message to send a transaction is the same identity that you registered at some point before right even if it's totally pseudonymous like even if it's a PHP public key that is part of identity attestations um I attest that uh you know David at the hospital and Ryan Sean Adams are both participants in this thing called bankless that's a part of identity um the governments of Canada tests that I have a telecom I'm a citizen that's part of identity um domain names or dot ethnames like vitalik.eth also parts of identity proof of personhood proving that I'm a unique human and this is the only account that belongs to me in the system that's part of identity right like identity is this very nebulous bubble term that refers to all of these things and sometimes when people say they need an identity solution they might be referring to any one of those or any combination of them and those problems are very different problems that and their problems that have very different properties like they have for example if you're a different properties in terms of the level of sexualization they might require in terms of the level uh the extents to which the problems are social the extents to which you can make a solution that works for a small number of people that doesn't grow beyond that small number of people and these are all actual use cases and they're all specific needs that people have but the problem is that for the last decade I've also noticed like this very abstract blockchain identity discourse where there were people that have been intentionally trying to create identity platforms like they're people who try to create identity blockchains and I'm by default and you know have been and still am very uh not bullish on a lot of those right because uh basically they just trust have the mindset of starting from the point of view of identity as an abstraction as opposed to starting from the point of view of a concrete set of use cases that people care about regardless of whether or not they can later narrativize those ideas those use cases into being part of uh some grander space that they can call identity right it's like meme first as opposed to problem first and the problem first as the approach that I think is uh more viable there and I think it's more viable everywhere um and I think ethereum is the place where identity Solutions in the sense of solutions to all these specific problems that I identify are happening and are pretty rapidly growing I think part of your answer is that um identity isn't something that you can go ahead first at you can't make an identity app you can't have an identity startup identity is something that is emergent it is something that is naturally composed from many different sources of inputs that are that may or may not be able to interoperate with each other is that a fairer assessment yep I mean it almost has to be like a byproduct of the thing that you're building right like in in a certain way like um why is there sign on with Google or sign on with with Facebook it's not because they started with the identity solution but it's because Google made Gmail just so damn valuable and its app ecosystem and so every like everyone has a Gmail account now you can use that to sign in I I'm just wondering how you how you think like identity Solutions again we could have the Esperanto problem for just a microcosm of identity where we create all these great identity Solutions we're like hey world come use it and the world's like we don't care we'll just use English it's fine um like how do you think identity actually happens uh as an export from the crypto world like practically how does this bottom up emergent thing manifest I think you had it exactly right in that whatever the thing is that gets the network effect has to get the network effect for some other reason first right um one example that I think is good to zero in on is ethereum wallets versus pgp cues right bgp Keys like have for a long time been the number one exciper Punk meme right like we have a Cypher Punk world when everyone has a pgp key and when people could use this pgpts to sign an encrypt messages and that's been around since what like the early 90s yeah people tried really hard to have key signing parties and attest to each other and uh and have pgp encrypted email and uh even have all kinds of apps to make it easier and you know all of these different overlay layers but just uh none of them have really worked well and what has worked well well guess what we have ethereum accounts now and what is an ethereum accounts well it's a private and public key pair and so now guess what you can sign into stuff with an ethereum key you can encrypt stuff to people's ethereum keys with a tiny bit of extra work right and so you just get all of this immediate benefit that's only possible because you already have a user base of billions of people that have ethereum wallets which they got originally for like basically financial reasons right because they wanted to hold cryptocurrency or you were doing uh D5 stuff and occasionally nft stuff with it so one question I have about this model um how I I think it requires a significant amount of standardization across attestations on the on specifically the attestation side of things like vitalica test that Ryan and David are are do this Bank list thing uh the uh country of Canada a test that Ryan was once a citizen there sorry for doxing your own uh America attests that I'm a citizen of America uh Spotify a test that I'm a huge fan of The Sheepdogs how do we do these things need to be the same standards or how do we make this uh the identity of all of these different attestations all composed together so that we have like my identity rather than just like a bunch of disparate systems that don't really talk to each other I think standards though emerge over time right like the pope protocol exists and uh lots of people use it and Pope I think has so far been more successful within the ethereum ecosystem than anything that calls itself an attestation protocol right like they've uh you know actually gone out there they have the network effects lots of people have popes I have dozens of popes and um you know the thing works in the thing is continuing to grow right um so that's the that's just like one example or something that I think is succeeding I mean there I think there's definitely room for a couple of other things to succeed as well um and then at some point they're going to grow to the point where they have to talk to each other and at some point they're probably going to agree on like aligning cryptographic standards or something like that and you know hopefully we'll get to something reasonably soon wise identity in the crypto space it's a huge conversation uh we all everyone comes into crypto and they kind of get this vague semblance of an idea that like something about crypto has to do with identity then they learn about like oh my ethereum address can represent me um but why is this better than my nation state identity what is lacking in nation state identities that ethereum or or um private key identities really brings to the table like why is this not a meme and why is this actually a good product um I mean it solves problems that people actually have right like people I I think uh obviously wants to have an identity in the sense of like just wanting to have an identifier like a username that other people can use to talk to each other um crypto in addition to being a useful set of products is an ecosystem and the community and people in that Community want to talk to each other so it serves that need to uh people I think wants to be able to do stuff on the internet without that stuff being dependent on um you know Google or Facebook or Twitter uh being like being able to do whatever they want with their accounts or even just like seeing the yeah all of the actions that they're taking so there's this like queer value that I think speaks to things that people in the in the crypto space one to two and even to dreams that people outside of the yeah crypto space have have had for a long time right like this is um you know making the internet more decentralized in a way that I think a lot of people have wanted to for like decades at this point um and so I think it's uh in a great place to actually get that kind of adoption I think one of the one things uh that really excites people about identity and crypto and and uh you know really ethereum signed this whole like sign in with ethereum movement is that it's actually really easy to Envision log in with Facebook log in with uh Google log in with metamask or rainbow wallet or or something is that is that the goal that we're looking for is that like when you said like the decentralization of the internet is that one of the parts of the internet that we can actually decentralize with ethereum is that like the explicit Vision that you kind of have I think absolutely okay all right well Bangles Nation you got your work cut out for you let's get this I think actually I think on an identity this is going to be seen as a big win for nation states well there's a portion of nation states who are a little bit like uh don't step into the money thing we have that covered I mean what what kind of um nation state doesn't want um the bot problem mitigated on the internet and uh to help identify who the human who the humans are and who the robots and by the way the nation's day answer to this is a social security number and a driver's license that you have to like and like a selfie come on that is not internet native at all so there's some low-hanging fruit here if we can do this but let's talk about um uh Dows for a minute vitalik so we think about Dao's the use case you said you're still bullish on them um our Dow is going to replace corporations uh is there is there something less that that they will do why why are you still excited about Dallas as an application and what function do you think they can fulfill yeah so ironically enough I think Dao's are well set to replace a lot of things other than corporations right like corporations are actually yeah one of the forms that I kind of specified the Dows are less likely to be able to replace and the reason for that is that I think uh corporations benefit from the ability to Pivot and the ability to Pivot is like almost the inherits opposite of a certain type of decentralization that people really want but also corporations are not they are big enough that they can afford to set up like more regular infrastructure like legal infrastructure and security infrastructure and so forth and so they don't really benefit well from the other architecture which is like hey let's just uh not bother with that stuff and have a multi-sig of seven people right so my view is basically that you know there's two architectures that make sense one of those architectures is like let's quickly speed up a multi-surg of seven people and the other architecture is a yeah let's think really hard and create something that's like very credible news role very able to resist all kinds of takeover attacks and use it to run really important stuff that we want to last for many decades right whether that's ens or whether that's a stable coin or you know something like proof of humanity or something like queros like let's figure out how to make that extremely robust right so that's something where I think Adele makes a lot of sense and then the Ball Z sake of seven people use cases are use cases where I think something that you could call a dow makes a lot of sense right but it's like a Dao where you're not really emphasizing this word contract logic you're emphasizing more the decentralization of just like very open and spontaneous collaboration patterns that can be very agile between fairly small groups of people and the smart contract side of things that's actually pretty minimal right so those are the two architectures that I'm more bullish on architectures that try to do something else I'm less bullish on right so like things like you know the like the original Dow trying to be a Dao that is a VC fund like uh yeah the more time goes on the more I think like yeah actually that doesn't really make a huge amount of sense right in those kinds of cases like you're getting the disadvantages of decentralization which are that you move slower and that you open up things that other people in a competitive environment can use against you but you're not really getting too many benefits from decentralization either so like if you want to do that kind of VC on your just spin up a VC fund right whereas uh you know Adele for like maker Dao or Dao for proof of humanity right now for ens like that's something where that kind of value makes sense and then a down the sense of uh you know a group of uh five or seven people that just wants to like quickly collaborate without bothering bothering with a legal entity like that's also something that makes a lot of sense and do you think vitalik there's going to be some innovation in the governance structure of Dao's or do you think we've basically discovered all possible governance that you know that could work with daos I think we need Innovation um so this gets into one of the other topics I've been really big on over the last year right which is non-financialized governance like governance that can resist attacks from like say 51 of the token holders or the token holders getting bribed or those kinds of situations and I even argue that it's the financial use cases where the financialized governance is the most important right like if you look at a stable coin for example like make or doubt it has I think what what were the stats I think I'd have been opposed to 7.8 billion dollars of collateral but the market cap over the maker token itself is like somewhere around 500 million dollars right and so if Baker tell really was governed by maker holders in an unrestricted way then you could just go and buy up half the maker tokens and then use that to manipulate the oracles and you could steal a huge portion of all the collateral and that would just be a really big and profitable multi-billion dollar attack right um now the reason why that hasn't happened to makerdale specifically is because maker Holdings are fairly concentrated and there's like maybe a dozen people that have more than half the total Supply and it just so happens that there's a dozen people or kind of Fairly aligned on the vision and they're you know either honest or at least they have enough other interests that would be yeah really hurt if they did something like that right but in the long term that's not the sort of thing that you really wants to rely on right and so I think it's obvious that if you want a stable coin that scales the collateral has to exceed the market cap of the profit taking token and probably by even more than 17x but if you want to do that you have to have some kind of governance that's not financialized or some kind of governance where there's some kind of intentional friction or speed bump that prevents mkr holders or the token holders of the system from being able to quickly Implement whatever gold age they want and take over the system as you're talking about all of this I I just want to you know remind listeners to a a bankless mental model that's at least helped me think through this and this is like from games like Civilization that maybe some of you have played where you have this concept of as you're leveling up your civilization you have like a tech tree right and you have to learn the basics of like mathematics before many generations later in the tech tree you uh can build nuclear reactors with your civilization or launch someone to the moon like you need your math before you get your physics before you get your nuclear reactors and the question people have outside of crypto is like okay cool you've been talking about this forever how come you haven't done it well think about the tech tree right you sort of need the money defy use case in order to build the network effect for identity to be valuable and then once you have identity you can start to tweak governance because some of the non-financial governance cases that you just mentioned really aren't very popular possible without identity and knowing who's a human who's not on chain and so this is all kind of a big ethereum Tech tree that we're kind of building out uh in in Peril that's what this reminds me of anyway which which lends me to kind of the last uh piece of um of what you wrote vitalik this category for hybrid applications what are what are hybrid applications can you just like tease that out for us for a minute hybrid applications are applications that are not entirely on chain but that benefit from being uh connected to a chain right um so basically think of it as centralized services that use the chain and commitments published to a chain as a way to constrain their behavior and keep the system honest um so the nice thing about hybrid applications is that they uh I mean obviously scalability challenges basically don't exist with them right like as long as you can make you know ZK snarks that are powerful enough you can make some of these applications already um so scalability challenges don't exist privacy challenges are a lot smaller especially if you can trust the provider and sometimes even if you can't trust to provide the provider even um and the deployments challenges are much simpler because in a lot of these cases it's not even something that requires changing the workflow of the user it's like purely an overlay that runs on the side and only people who wants to interact with the overlay have to right so probably the simplest example of this actually is making centralized exchanges a safer with proof of solvency protocols right like if you have exchanges that actually yeah you know publish commitments to say the yeah all of all of their user reliabilities that's uh and then they have assets on chain and by having assets on chain they're proving that they actually have the assets that match the user reliability is like that is an example of an application that does use the chain and even uses cryptocurrency but it is also a centralized application and that application can keep the workflow of being a centralized application but still get a lot of benefits from being hooked into and kind of being Shackled by the decentralized system um games are another example or like you can have Game servers that are post the state to chain using zero knowledge proofs and that basically binds them to actually follow the rules you know uh that they yeah committed to um the the Dark Forest game right is uh probably one example of this um voting uh yeah mentioned as an example and there's many different kinds of votings voting even going all the way down to something as simple as like Twitter polls for example right like you could imagine a blockchain based Twitter like forecaster says yeah has an ethereum based Twitter like firecaster um make a a poll where you use one of these fancy voting mechanisms uh to vote in the poll and the Voting is totally private the Voting is even coercient resistance and that's also hooked into uh Pope uh popes and so you can limit the poll to a certain group of people right but then forecaster is like I guess not quite a hybrid application because forecaster is aiming to be a decentralized system but you know you could imagine something a kind of centralized like also plug those kinds of components in right and so you get kind of the efficiency of centralization and the robustness benefits of uh decentralization at the same time right so I think there's a really huge number of applications in this category like on some level almost anything can be improved by requiring it to submit roots to chain and requiring it to be open about when it changes its rules right and that's just something that you can just like go and add on and you know it might not have benefits at first but it might have benefits that appear years down the line and just uh the cost of doing it is in the long run so low that I think there's a bunch of applications where it makes sense yeah I actually haven't really spent too much time thinking about this but this is actually really uh uh kind of mind-blowing in the sense that it's actually doing some of the things that we're already doing in other parts of uh the the ethereum landscape like what what do layer twos do they post data to the ethereum layer one that uh forces uh the layer two to play by the rules right and this is kind of the same model for what you're saying you can see so many other use cases what is proof of reserves it's a centralized company that's not really changing much else about this business but it's posting data to a public blockchain that allows people to check on itself and so you're just saying that uh the general purpose utility of centralized company centralized teams centralized projects whatever can just publicly post data to a chain that allows humans to check on whether that or not that company or team or whatever is doing the thing that they originally committed to doing and really what is the original like ethos of a blockchain and to begin with the whole idea of a chain a blockchain is to like check on human Folly right make sure that humans are not being bad uh and being able to verify that uh and I I think the the flexibility that this model uh offers which is just like hey you have a centralized company that requires human trust well you can prove that trust with a blockchain uh is like probably I think the most uh broad utility broad broad way to provide blockchain assurances to the world that I can really think of yep absolutely that's their goal so the broader question I I think really really the the reason how that will actually end up is just like at some point uh the companies that do this are just have a competitive Advantage versus the ones that don't uh that's like perhaps like the capitalism Market forces argument for why this will happen but I want to kind of Zoom back in into the near term and also go into the one of the last sections in your article of italic which is how do we get there and then a quote from your article I want to read is that the Luna market cap got over to 30 billion dollars while stable coins that were striving for robustness and simplicity are often ignored for years non-financial applications often have no hope of earning 30 billion because they do not have a token at all but it is these applications that will be the most valuable for the ecosystem in the long term and that will bring the most lasting value to both their users and those who build and support them this paints this picture that all these flashy scams and like the Lunas the Wonderland's uh FTX will always get more attention and more adoption than like these boring hardened basic Primitives that like crypto so desperately needs and so this kind of lends itself italics like one of my existential crises I've been having recently is that like crypto might actually not be good in the short term uh because it takes longer for these hardened real protocols to get built out meanwhile we can generate like 10 000 apy ponzis along the way for three bull markets in a row uh do you think that this illustration of crypto is true and how do you how do you suggest that we accelerate the good things that we can take and show our moms uh this is uh you know where we get back to one of my yeah points uh uh a bit earlier right like we have to recognize uh you know our own agency right like ways yeah I think all just needs uh work much harder at um you know both doing all that we can to help those applications um and doing uh doing less that we can to help applications that even if they look shiny in the moments are not actually all of the um all that meaningful long term um you know just uh being willing to get excited about stuff other than making huge amounts of money um of the you know organizations in the space um can do much more to explicitly support uh some of those projects right like I yeah like even just uh you know giving Grant like a few million dollars worth of Grants to people who are honestly trying like trying to make wallets that properly solve the self-custody problem right like these are try to get to the point where like the yeah how hard you have to work to get uh to get funding as a wallet developers like at least comes close to approaching how um how easy it was if you were just running a DFI project and it's just uh also just like talking about the yeah some of the job problems that these uh projects are solving and why it's why it's so important to solve them and I think it's uh the best that we can do for an hour is a combination of all of those things um another important thing that I think is important for the space to do is like continue the conversation with uh regulators and not just in the United States but you know Regulators around the world right I think it's uh important to get out the message that like what we as the ethereum space want is not even necessarily a regulatory environment that's friendly to everyone but a regulatory environment that satisfies the requirements of being friendly to maximum friendly to like say people building account abstraction while we start working on zero knowledge proof protocols but without being friendly to do Quan right and like what does that even look like um it's uh another one of the conversations that I think is where worth having and trying to figure out right because I think at this point to the uh you know well the political appetite to make an environment that's friendly to Duke one is like definitely close to zero at this point right um and so if it gets uh you know important to kind of take the lead in the conversation of like how to be friendly to you know people making account obstruction wallet specifically without being friendly to do Quan and that's uh it's a more difficult one um and that's uh definitely something that I'll keep thinking about too yeah yeah I completely agree by the way I'd love to see a vitalik regulatory post some time on vitalik.ca I think that would be a cool post um vitalik thanks a lot we we appreciate you coming on and talking about all these things maybe uh just sort of final question on a little bit of a personal note uh I'm just curious for you so we are ending 2022 entering 2023 um it's been a big year certainly for ethereum a lot to be excited about uh at the end of 2022 shipping the merge all of these things but um what do you see your role in crypto as as we move into 2023 and and and Beyond yeah you know the old office space what is it that you'd say that you would that you do here uh vitalik like what's what's kind of your role how would you describe yourself foreign I feel like the answer is still some of everything right like I think now that might change over time you know that but that might be yeah other things too right but for now um you know it's uh definitely some combination of uh like increasingly trying to help projects that I like that are building good applications succeed and you know helping to explore and understand the application space better um you know still a lot of important ethereum protocol stuff better um and uh you know participating in the discussion on like scaling um trying to kind of push the evm in a good trajectory so it gets uh you know functionality that people want without getting the complexity that people don't want um trying to I guess continue to interact and connect with the various ethereum communities around the world I've made it a goal next year to spend some time visiting places that I have a historically not spent much time visiting to visiting I mean that was my goal for this year too right and I did end up spending you know months in Latin America but I know next year other places too and so that's sick right now definitely some of everything and uh some of just like letting other good people um you know kids continue doing great work um and uh I guess uh helping the ethereum ecosystem move over to being in this uh in like a very stable and self and uh self-supporting thing that just keeps going forward on itself it's not like are you really trying to turn gas into Mana is that really a thing the one place where we could do that is in the context of multi-dimensional eap1559 right this is the proposal where I consider having just one gas limit we have one limit for computation and then one for like data and one for um you know maybe storage operations like one of the dimensions could just be called mana and uh no no I think that would be cool and fun I like I I like ethereum being fun um but if it's going to be anywhere that would be the place there uh the place where it is but we'll see that's awesome wait was there a World of Warcraft was Mana a thing in World of Warcraft I don't remember my wildest yeah yeah man is like the primary like limited resource for like anyone uh using magic this was the game all along vitalik wanted to create Mana in this decentralized ecosystem all the way back to his uh nerfed World of Warcraft character it's come full circle indeed like you know ethereums you have soul bound tokens uh we're getting closer metallic this is a Diablo Maxi podcast by the way yeah it's true it's true you gotta confess Still Still blizzard though uh same company uh metallic thanks a lot we really appreciate it yeah no thank you guys too it's been great action items for you bankless Nation uh another fantastic vitalik podcast we've got a few more in the queue we'll we'll uh throw sorry a few more from the archive we'll throw links to those in the show notes also you got to read what in the ethereum application ecosystem excites me by vitalik we'll include a link in the show notes there's also another article I want to draw some attention to it's an article that was posted earlier by the time you listen to this last week from astral code X10 it's called why I'm less than an infinitely Hospital uh hostel to cryptocurrency why I'm less than infinitely hostile to cryptocurrency I think a great article from an outsider's perspective looking into the space and very rational uh as as to which use cases have succeeded so uh go read those and uh that's it gotta end with this as always none of this has been Financial advice it never is on uh on Bank list of course ethereum is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope
