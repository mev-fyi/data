we spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to distribute it dutch auctions english auctions free mints allow this ultimately we decided to settle on free mint because like one is i want the community to be completely aligned with me you know i'm not doing this as a cash grab if i don't create value there there's no value to be had i wanted the market to decide what it was worth i didn't want to say i think this is worth this and then people would be buying it on my belief of what i think it's worth where it's trading right now is like way higher than i anticipated it to be trading that doesn't change the fact that i plan on executing no matter what the price of it is right and then finally i would say that you know just as an homage to crypto punks right crypto punks were free to claim i was also able to include people that otherwise might not be able to afford it not everybody has one eath or three eats to spend on a brand new mint for community that they don't know so i think it allowed me to have a more diverse group of people which i think ultimately leads to more creativity which leads to better ideas
