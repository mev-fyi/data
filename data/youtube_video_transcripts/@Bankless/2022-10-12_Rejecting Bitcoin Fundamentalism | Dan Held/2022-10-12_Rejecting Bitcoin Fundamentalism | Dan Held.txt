foreign [Music] welcome to another state of the nation episode where we talk about something in depth that is going on in crypto this is saying no to bitcoin fundamentalism David this has been a theme in crypto lately former Bitcoin maximalists turning against Bitcoin fundamentalism who'd you have on the podcast what are we going to cover today we had Dan held on the show and Dan held has been a Bitcoin proponent Bitcoin believer for a very long time and I actually don't think Ryan that their the Bitcoin maximalists are turning away from Bitcoin maximalists they're turning away specifically from Bitcoin fundamentalists which is a new term uh and it's actually how Dan held ended up on the show today when he tweeted out a tweet that said say no to bitcoin fundamentalism and I and I like you caught that tweet a little bit by surprise like oh Bitcoin fund mentalism Dan held saying no to bitcoin fundamentalism don't know what Bitcoin fundamentalism is but it's interesting that we're seeing a Schism in the Bitcoin community so this is what this episode is about what is exactly Bitcoin fundamentalism and why are so many Bitcoin leaders rejecting it uh and so we spend the first half of this episode uh defining terms and just like getting things making things really really clear so we can actually talk about what we need to talk about which is this growing cultural divide in the Bitcoin community before we get into the episode guys we want to thank our friends and sponsors at Galaxy they want to tell you to take an adventure in crypto right now take that adventure and get rewarded they have these epic Learn to Earn campaigns and campaigns is a good word for them if you've ever played you know video game you've gone on like a gaming campaign of some sort this is similar except it's for crypto you get to level up while you explore crypto they've powered over 5 500 task based campaigns you can also get a passport and these are things like invitations to go explore the arbitrum community in a specific protocol for instance and uh rewards waiting for you on the other side there's also an opportunity for Builders as well so if you are not a D5 user maybe you're a builder maybe you're launching a protocol There's an opportunity to partner with Galaxy to launch your Learn to Earn campaign just connect your web3 wallet and you can get started uh teaching people about your protocol and going on these campaigns together David this is a really cool opportunity I feel like it's gamifying making crypto learning more interactive and fun to play how can folks get started with this there's a link in the show notes banklist.cc slash Galaxy but that's spelled g-a-l-x-e and this is where you get your web 3 passport and so while you go on all of these Adventures on do all these tasks on these campaigns you get credentials and you get to put them in your little web 3 passport given you by Galaxy to prove that you've been to cool places and done cool things in the crypto metaverse and so all that is available in the show notes and more pretty awesome building up your on-chain resume as well all right David I know why we're talking about this but what should folks pay attention to in this episode and we are pre-recording this because I know you're at Devcon this week actually and uh so we're pre-recording this I was not able to make it to this episode so it's just you and Dan today and what should listeners pay attention to one of my favorite lines out of hazu actually is that ethereum culture is Downstream of Bitcoin culture as in Bitcoin culture is like the source of all other parts of ethereum culture but also I think that can extend to really the crypto World At Large is Bitcoins first it is the most on the frontier and we can use some of the goings on in the Bitcoin Community as like a microcosm and so I think this is a lesson not just for the Bitcoin community and a hurdle that the Bitcoin Community has to get over but this also relates to your community as well whether it's as large as the Bitcoin Community or maybe perhaps as small as a very very small like you know token Community this is about group things this is a story about group things so while listeners are listening to this I think they should pay attention to in what ways does this story to identify with this story with my part of crypto that I'm in and Dan does a good job as he Parts apart the good and bad parts of group think group thing isn't inherently bad but it can be if it gets out of control uh but also if you are just interested in building on bitcoin part of the the non-fundamentalist camp what Dan is calling the Bitcoin rationalists they're all interested in restocking and kindling fires of Bitcoin building after that Bitcoin fundamentalists have kind of driven out of the Bitcoin culture uh and so the Bitcoin rationalists want Bitcoin building back uh and so Dan and what he's doing at trust machines and various other Bitcoin layers are working on how do we reincarnate a Bitcoin a builder culture in the Bitcoin world and so uh if this interests you and more stay tuned for the episode uh this is kind of cool for my part I'll be looking at how this compares to our episode that we did a couple months ago with Nick Carter it was so frustrated specifically yeah oh really he was so frustrated with the Bitcoin maximalist Community he just kind of rage quit and this looks like a group that is not so much leaving the Bitcoin or Community but trying to reform it in a healthier more pragmatic more builder-centric way so we're seeing a culture a cultural reform maybe taking place with leaders like Dan health and I'm anxious to see how that plays out and I'll be looking for what that reform might look like in this episode the first time I think I've seen this in the crypto space and uh hopefully it means healthier times for Bitcoin guys we're gonna get right to the episode with Dan all about Bitcoin pragmatics and about saying no to bitcoin fundamentalism but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or lost money to a thief and a lot of

fully committed to working on and promoting Bitcoin to the world and also has some thoughts about the current state of the Bitcoin Community which is going to be the topic of conversation today Dan welcome to bankless thanks for having me David this whole conversation got inspired from a tweeter a tweet that you wrote uh that you said say no to bitcoin fundamentalism can you talk a little bit about about that tweet like what is bitcoin fundamentalism because this is a new term that I haven't heard before and overall what's going on in the Bitcoin space that inspired this tweet to come out yeah I think what's going on right now in the Bitcoin Community is you've got like if we use a religious example which you know with all crypto l1's I think uh religion is a really good way to think it through it um if we think about it like a religion you've got like Christianity let's use that as an example but then there are sub you know groups within Christianity where you might have um you might have Catholic you know or not not Catholic but you had like Methodist or Presbyterian or some of those kind of or lutherans uh whether it's basically they all believe in the same thing but just different flavors of it or different styles of it um and so what's happening in the Bitcoin Community now is there isn't really a good terminology to label these subgroups and that's where I've been trying to do that of kind of like labeling what are what do these groups look like and that's where I think the you know rationalist versus fundamentalist term I think is a good way of kind of uh breaking you know taking these groups and identifying them with um kind of like a key like a key labeling of what they are um to pretend that everyone's going to agree with any sort of movement whether it be religion and L1 or something like that I think is pretty silly um I'm certainly not trying to be devices divisive I'm mainly labeling these subgroups and trying to help people think through hey what what group do I belong in or what group is advocating for XYZ activity um so I put out a tweet the other day that said reject Bitcoin fundamentalism and the way that I Define Bitcoin fundamentalism because I don't think it's been well defined nor is it like a common terminology Bitcoin fundamentalism would be I would say cultural elements that are being brought into the the Bitcoin community that don't represent what I think are the core values of the Bitcoin ethos for example some of these values are you know taking I would say very subjective very cultural things and inserting that and making that part of what Bitcoin is and I just totally disagree examples of that would include you know people claiming that earning a yield or earning an interest is usury or some sort of 1500s-esque medieval sort of uh religious response to interest which earning an interest or earning yield is simply a free market activity old bitcoiners or OG bitcoiners that have no qualms with that they might have qualms with the way that the risk is represented and I certainly do agree that we should call out the risks of these things but to say that yield or lending or interest won't exist in the Bitcoin world and that it's evil is fundamentally anti-free markets and Bitcoin is absolutely four free markets and we've got some other things as well like for example people will call out certain influencers for making money um I'm not speaking about myself I'm speaking about another individual in this space making money building a course and how to teach women to get into into Bitcoin and uh they they said that making money from educational activities is you know sort of a perversion of um this pure ethos of of you know giving out all of your time and effort to help Bitcoin and I think that's really silly because one it's a free again a free market activity if people want to buy the course they want to buy the course if you want to give away a course you can give away of course you're you're free to price your services or products at zero but to call out someone that is doing I think a fantastic job of educating people about Bitcoin and calling them out because they're making money I think is just you know can appear and simple very like um what's the uh it's sort of like a piety sort of thing of like hey the the most the most bitcoiner of us don't take any money and is this like you know the celibacy or piety sort of thing going on which I don't think is what Bitcoin is about at all so these are a couple examples I know we're going to dive in further but just for the audience that that's kind of like where I'm coming from here yeah and putting a name on these things I think is super important and I think why I want to spend the even more time actually like defining out what what's going on here what's going on in the Bitcoin Community because once we can name something and then we can talk about it just a little bit more more clearly and so appearing over the fence and also by the way I totally appreciate like the the some people some people don't really get it but like the religion metaphors are just so apt sometimes in the crypto space especially when we're so tribal and so so appearing over the fence at the Bitcoin land and and hearing what your answer was for what Bitcoin fundamentalism is to me it's a little bit like there's this cohort of bitcoiners that have perhaps started to take things just a little too seriously have taken things a little too far and now we're like perhaps a snake biting its own tail like they've taken some of the memes and really just Twisted them beyond what they were really intended for and so there's when we say Bitcoin fundamentalists Perhaps Perhaps you also might mean Bitcoin extremists would that be also a fair characterization or would you push back on that depends on everyone's definition of what an extremist versus fundamentalist might be um you know I would say like it certainly isn't maximalist I think the term maximalism represents a pretty large group of bitcoiners who don't really have any sort of sub identity to connect with right like if you're a bitcoiner what other name do you take on like moderate or rationalist or fundamentals none of these have really taken off I think that's somewhat Troublesome because like a lot of people in Bitcoin they're not homogeneous there's not a homogeneous um sort of perspective of what Bitcoin should be or what is what is ethical or not and so I think that um you know maximalism I think is an overly broad term to identify a group of people and I wouldn't say that many I think many Maximus wouldn't even agree that they are maximalists they're more they would consider more moderate or rational there just isn't a term for that um but I guess fundamentalists to me would represent not extreme ideology but more of like ideology that actually runs counter to what Bitcoin represents because in this scenario it's not subjective of like hey I I do or don't like what you're thinking it's more of like if we look at the principles of Bitcoin and why Bitcoin is important and what what it's setting out to do are people adhering to those base principles of what Bitcoin represents um so by using their own sort of measurement stick of Ethics are they themselves using the correct measuring stick is what I'm thinking about sure sure and how why would you would you accredit the reason why Bitcoin fundamentalism has come about like what was the main reason as to why it exists yeah that's a good question and it's super hard to pick apart I don't think that there is one single sort of variable here I think it's a culmination of the activities that occurred in 2016 and 17 where you had um you know Bitcoin toxicity or bitcoin's defense mechanism Bitcoins white blood cells attack companies and Powerful individuals who wanted to change bitcoin's protocol these are the block size Wars the block size war is what I'm talking about here um and I think this was a good thing Bitcoin stood up in the community uh stood up and said we will not let powerful individuals take Bitcoin and change it to their whim I think there's a very powerful movement and a really really cool movement to represent bitcoin's decentralization and the and the ethics and the Eco and the ethics and uh sort of the community um after that event you know this with the successful I'd say absolute destruction of Bitcoin cash I don't think anyone would even consider Bitcoin cash I haven't heard that word even mentioned in almost a year now two years the only the only reason why I've heard of it is because Roger there got liquidated on and going along on on bitcoin cash and some like I screw up exchange a couple months ago that's the last time I've heard of it you got margin called and then it didn't pay up right you didn't post margin and and uh there's a whole there's a whole lawsuit with that but anyways um yeah I think you know with Bitcoin cash you know the market fundamentally rejecting Bitcoin cash it looked like the you know the the regular people the plebs were on the right side of History here and I think that they for sure were um you know just arbitrarily changing block size versus more scaling Solutions which everyone nowadays talks about L2 l3s other layers on top of a base layer as the way to go about scaling of course some scaling occurred on L1 but the Bitcoin Community wanting to keep that as limited as possible um after that successful event of bitcoin's community rising up and rejecting this corporate and Powerful individual influence over Bitcoin over the Bitcoin Network there was sort of this lull where you've got this intense I would call it like an army that has no purpose right there's no real purpose for the Army right now because there's no one trying to make changes to the Bitcoin protocol that would be what might be perceived as detrimental so with all these white blood cells going you know in the in the body going on and you get tons of white blood cells looking for something to attack there's nothing external to attack so they're focusing on something internal so right now you've got somewhat of an autoimmune issue where you've got the Bitcoin Community attacking itself and looking for impurities or or bacteria or some sort of you know virus coming in there and trying to attack it and really there's not much to attack no one's advocating to make drastic changes to the Bitcoin protocol I think a lot of people nowadays much better understand scaling what bitcoin's all about I think in the 2016 through 2017 era you had a lot of misconceptions around why Bitcoin was useful or or what or how blockchains worked so I think what we're seeing now is you've got like individuals in this space like Nick Carter and others and myself who don't fit exactly these set of core fundamentalist parameters and so people lash out and then claim hey they're not pure bitcoiners um or hey they're they've got Financial incentives so they're they're impure or there's all sorts of uh XYZ check mark they're looking for to either keep us in that in group or out group but what's funny is is what I'm seeing now too is that most people actually identify as more of a moderate and most of them are pretty tired of these Purity tests interesting that's really really interesting I love the analogy of an autoimmune disorder and it's just to recap what you said is that there were there was this era in Bitcoin where uh that we had the block size debates and block size Wars and some people were on one side other people were on others but also if you keep on like going down that history it was actually very clear that there were like large-scale corporate influences on one side and maybe some also some individuals that perhaps believe that the block the Big Blocks were good but largely the Bitcoin Community was uh mostly on the side of don't change Bitcoin like keeps keep small blocks and this was a big war and this was like a scar in Bitcoin the Bitcoin communities like history like memory like the shared Collective memory of all bitcoiners remembers like the block size Civil War because it was like a it was a painful time in bitcoin's history and and markets like even like the price of something on like or the chart of something is something that like it's the aggregate of all the brains of all people participating in this thing and so we can extrapolate like the market by back into like the social community and so what you're saying is that there was this like traumatic event that's in the Bitcoin Community memory that the Bitcoin Community has overcome that right like we we grow stronger through traumatic events and now we're on the other side but a part of the Bitcoin Community hasn't totally moved on from the um the vibe of people are coming to attack Bitcoin and we must defend it and so what you're saying is that there's this part of this Bitcoin community that is in like this fight-or-flight mentality all the time perhaps too much and they are just hyper aware hyper villaging and like ready to attack anything coming after Bitcoin and perhaps have gotten a little bit too sensitive in that realm and now have gone after just like normal bitcoiners who aren't perhaps so like uh militant or aggressive about preserving some amount of bitcoin's values but now we've diverged and so this this Schism has created what we are now calling Bitcoin fundamentalism versus Bitcoin rationalism is that a fair summary of of the of the events I think that's an excellent summary that's uh it's a really good synopsis over what I'm trying to say yeah and and uh listeners might remember we had Nick Carter on when he got like quote unquote canceled by the Cyber Hornets would you say that this is that that event was like a one-to-one correlate of what we were talking about right now was that like an adjacent kind of thing like how relevant was that event to this whole story yeah I think that's it's exactly on point for this story there's a whole series of these Matt carollo recently had that happen to him I've experienced this over the last two years you know the last two years in this space and um you know with Nick I'd like to kind of pick apart what happened to Nick a little bit so uh Nick and then also interject if you think I'm I've haven't said it accurately because I'm pretty sure this is exactly what happened um Nick invested in a um either a like some sort of identity or some sort of like like digital identity company where through private keys and through blockchain Tech you can own your identity and use it to validate or log into different Services right the business model was like sign in with your private Keys instead of sign in with Facebook or sign in with Google it was sign in with your private Keys it was also an ethereum wallet at the same time and it wasn't it wasn't Nick it was castling Island Ventures his VC he's at GP at Castle Island one of the founders so people extrapolate you know Castle Island being synonymous with Nick Carter um yeah it's Nick Carter Nick Walsh and those are the GPS yeah I forget if there's any other GPS I know there's a couple uh I don't know their Partners there um and so you know Nick has been doing Investments like this for a while like people forget that it's first uh analytics company was uh focused on blockchain analytics but it wasn't just Bitcoin analytics it was across all blockchains so parsing through blockchains pulling out identifiable information in terms of like smart contracts or other information that corporates or company you know companies might be interested in and so helping you know folks navigate blockchains not just Bitcoin but every blockchain now people forget that that coinmetrics was his first company that he started um and also like you know I've known Nick for years now so I I've known Nick for almost three four years now and so like I've I knew him from a coinmetrics nick where he was like this I would I kind of view him as like this neutral impartial individual who just really likes Bitcoin and bitcoin's proof of work um but he by no means I think said like oh I reject everything else because I'm just uh absolutist and I think that this is the only way to do it he more of I think was very eloquent was saying I believe in Bitcoin and I like it because of these reasons and then defended Bitcoin because of those those first like kind of the first principles first principle stance of like whether it be monitor credibility of the monetary policy or credibility you know or proof of work uh using that as like a real world way to take physical energy and and build that around the Digital World um so you know I think what happened there is a lot of bitcoiners had thought he was you know more of like a Fundamentalist where it was just reject everything and so there was this fervor that developed around his investment in this company where people said oh he's a coiner now or he's not pure because he invested in this company and what's funny is all of his Investments are transparent I haven't been to castleisland Ventures uh webpage but I'm sure there's probably a portfolio section there there is where you could probably go see every investment he's made and and even his first company coinmetrics is not a Bitcoin only company um and so this fervor developed and I think this is where I think Nick went a little wrong in it I've got a ton of respect for Nick I still very much uh think he's one of the greatest champions for Bitcoin out there he's one of the most eloquent well-spoken individuals in this space I would say even amongst the entire crypto industry uh Nick is a great Champion for for what we do um I think what I admire him about him the most is how eloquent and how measured and calm he is and I think what happened as he allowed the crowd to see him get aggravated or him get a little bit annoyed with the criticism and then that opened it up to where they use that as a lever to kind of to push his buttons a little bit and I think he showed them that it was affecting him and that's where I think he lost the battle with the mob or the mob sort of kind of you know spiral out of control as he reacted to the Mob and the mob used that to attack him and so that spiraled into this um I would say something that didn't I don't think represented Nick the best he could have been represented he's this calm really sincere mild-mannered sort of guy and I think in this moment people saw him lose his cool a little bit and people use that to attack him and kind of attack his motives and attack um you know how pure he was as a bitcoiner so I think some of this was a little bit on you know obviously I think it was unfair the criticism to begin with um and then I do think it was kind of Nick's own react his own reaction to it that led to a little bit of like a uh like an accelerated response of mob Nick mob Nick and to until it kind of spiraled out of control um overall though the mob or the fundamentalists shouldn't have been too should have been too surprised I mean Nick did all this above board none of this was like under the table none of this was should have been surprising and so I found it pretty disturbing and I stood up and defended Nick um you know at the time saying like hey Nick's a great proponent for Bitcoin he's been transparent about all of this the entire time and it would be a shame to lose someone so eloquent and so on point as Nick Carter where he has defended Bitcoin and in both the public spaces on TV um through research papers and to lose him over what I perceive as just like a normal business activity which is VC investing is really really silly um and so I think what happened now is Nick basically turned on his replies to people who only follow him and hasn't engaged on Twitter as much because I think that experience sort of scarred him a little bit I've been through a few of these cancellation moments myself so I know exactly what he was feeling at the time not exactly but I know directionally what he was feeling so I can understand why he reacted the way he did but you can't let them sense that weakness in you or that uh you know that sort of like you're showing them some emotion you're showing that their their criticism is working and when that happens I think it really opens it up for a much larger attack Vector versus going hey I recognize your criticism I disagree or just don't reply on Twitter for a day or two and come back once you're once once things have cooled down a little bit certainly and I've definitely noticed that this has this has been a reoccurring theme in the last like 12 months uh in in Bitcoin land there seems to be this like brain drain from one side to the other uh like you know Nick Carter is like now not really and like it's like the brain drain versus the Cyber Hornets I mean maybe maybe you can uh uh say like if the Cyber Hornets are on one side or other or not but it seems to be like there's people like you Nick Carter like almost basically everyone that I respect has gone to the side of like saying hey there's this like extreme side of Bitcoin that really like grinds my gears like can you talk is is that a real thing or is that just something I'm observing is there is like this brain drain from one side to the other definitely I mean you've got like Matt Corolla one of the oldest core devs um you've got Greg Maxwell like the OG OG cordov who said you know if we expect Bitcoin to survive on its own without us helping it like that's the surest way to have Bitcoin fail um I say like a lot of these individuals very much represent that sort of Middle Ground I don't want to name other names too because they've either reached out to me in private or um have come out in their own sort of way to talk about it but I think there's a very what I'm seen as a pretty sizable movement of a lot of people just not having another name to identify with because it's maximalist is like the only title to identify with and I mean I thought about going back to the old term called bitcoiner and Chris burninski and I were talking about this at mainnet where him and I were talking about how this sort of schism or Schism is create is uh being uh kind of like happening at the moment and you know we both talked about well like what if we reclaimed the word bitcoiner you know like the the OG term for Bitcoin or before the term Maxi became about but uh that's a very old term and I'm not sure if a lot of people really understand it so I'd say like the new term is like rationalist or moderate I think moderate's kind of boring and watered down a little bit rationalist is a little bit a little bit arrogant I would say too because it's like claiming that everyone else is irrational um so it's tough these things are difficult as a marketer I find it pretty interesting to see how these narratives will will sort of create a shelling Point around certain identities so whether that be like fundamentalist or moderate or fundamentalist and um something else um so I think you know there's a lot of people who don't agree with the fundamentalists but they just don't know what to call themselves and so I think that part of this movement is is figuring out you know what is that new identity and also what does it stand for what definitively what is a fundamentalist identity versus a moderate um I'm not you know there's not like a website where you can go to and compare one to the other hey pretty new yeah it's you know I think it's just a cultural thing it's a cultural and social thing where slowly people start to identify it one to the other and then there's signaling whether you put it in your bio or not um and none of this by the way I don't think this is nearly the same sort of scenario like we had back in 2017 with the Bitcoin cash hard Fork right no one's advocating to make a change to bitcoin you know this is this is more of a cultural difference rather than a um hey we want to fundamentally change what Bitcoin is um or we want to use influence to change um a really fundamental characteristics of either scaling or bitcoin's monetary policy I don't think there's any sort of changes like that on the moderate or rationalist camp that is really advocating for anything like that so this is purely cultural where people are going hey I just don't want to be identified with these other people but our mission I believe is the same thing right and so just to put this on a scale for listeners to understand this is not a civil war where some some side is trying to Tinker with Bitcoin in one way that the other side doesn't like Bitcoins being left out of this Bitcoin the blockchain Bitcoin the system is like not totally relevant here it's more about like what does the community believe and stand for and like because the Bitcoin Community checks itself very very well and one thing I'm concerned about Dan is that the Bitcoin rationalists or whatever this like non-fundamentalist side of this debate or like Schism is it seems to be created in opposition to the fundamentalists as in the rationalists are are a group of people that exist because it's an agreement of that all these people that are in the Bitcoin rationalist Camp don't like what they're seeing in the Bitcoin fundamentalist camp but then but if that's true then like that Bitcoin rationalist Camp simply exists because of an antithesis antithesis to the Bitcoin fundamentalists which like groups don't really stay composed very well when they are their existence merely is in opposition to something else is that so is that even correct does the Bitcoin rationalist Camp merely exist in opposition to the Bitcoin fundamentalists or like is there a different like cultural shelling point for the rationalists like latch onto that's independent and unique yeah I mean there's a ton of overlap of values that we both agree upon and also like I think a lot of people who are fundamentalists may not even identify themselves as fundamentalists um even though they are just because it's like a new term and they may not really understand what it means and also it's being new newly defined most of them would probably refer themselves as like Maxis or hardcore Maxis or some sort of some sort of representation like that and I'm certainly not going after the maximalists I think Max Muslim represents a lot of bitcoiners and that's not what I'm talking about here um I do think like you know for the for the rationalist I think what they really care about the most is like free markets there's no moral uh you know weighing in on how people spend money or how people earn yield or borrow against something or invest in other assets outside of Bitcoin uh for example and so I think this is a core tenant of of from what I've heard on the more moderate side for example there's a lot of individuals who claim like alts are immoral or something like that um first of all it's a very loaded term I'm not sure if a moral is the right word or not as if free markets libertarian I could care less what people want to buy or sell um if they want to buy Doge or Tron versus uh you know a share of Apple I'm not here to morally weigh in on what is good or bad I personally like Bitcoin the most and that's what I'll speak about positively but I'm not going to sit here and waste my time going hey I I think you're a bad person because you've you've yelled at or or you're a bad person because you bought this or that asset um and you know what what's funny is with some of the fundamentals I do agree like look if you frame it for newbies as like the only one of the only assets you can hold where you have custody over the asset is Bitcoin or like a like a um you know any sort of asset that is a uh a bearer asset right like gold cash Bitcoin ethereum whatever um you know I do agree that you know for newbies they're like yeah you know equities are a coin or real estate's a coin fundamentally I'm like yeah totally good at what you're talking about as a bearer asset but we're going to look a little bit nuts when we say that to people where like people have real world assets outside of Bitcoin um and I do think Bitcoin is a phenomenal asset but that doesn't mean that I I mean a majority of my net worth is in Bitcoin but I still have still have equities I still have you know private Equity et cetera so I think that um kind of framing everything as Bitcoin only to an extreme isn't really useful for anyone I get that the the seed of the idea starts with like hey it's a bearer asset it's a really pristine asset and I do agree with that but we have to take I think a little bit more of a moderate stance and so for me I think the way that we're perceived now or at least this fundamentalist group is perceived is you've got you've got a casino right which is like a crypto market and there's another casino next door which which is the equities Market and these are all speculative activities uh you know in the crypto Casino you've got um you've got like craps which is big and don't don't take these analogies too seriously I'm just coming up with names to pair them with games uh like bitcoin's craps ethereum is is slots you've got yield farming on any chain might be roulette and so you know people are wanting to enter the crypto ecosystem and through these speculative sort of waves they want to go experience whether it be Bitcoin or something else because they they get some fomo and they want the human nature is inherently speculative and so what bitcoiners look like we look like the or like the the more fundamentalist bitcoiners they look like a preacher outside of the casino and they're going hey son you're going into the casino and you're going to lose money and uh a lot of people were like yeah man it's also sinful yeah it's also sinful and you know that message is just not going to resonate with people because they're going to be like first of all I know dude I'm going in like it says Casino you know I've heard about it before I'm going in now of course you know bitcoiners like to pull out the regretful posts and people lose their money and they're like oh man that sucks well so do people that lose the at the casino too but people are still going to go in right so instead of the kind of like the I would say like fire and brimstone preacher instead you could stand out the door outside the door and be like hey son go in have fun uh but taken from me an Old Timer you're probably gonna want to roll some of those gains into Bitcoin yeah good job you made 20 extra money on Doge Doge ain't an investment Man You're Gonna Want to Hold something else for a long time I think that is what I've shifted my narrative to over the last year and a half and I've seen a lot more reception to that of kind of like you're not a bad person for buying these other assets but you know I would highly recommend that you think through this long term and think about what you want to hold what you want to huddle what do you want to huddle for a very long time and um and that's where I think the uh the Bitcoin community I personally believe that the moderates are rationalist with that softer sort of approach is is much more that that sort of narrative resonates with a lot more people and um I just don't think that the really fire and brimstone sort of approach I don't think that really converts people and I've been I've been in the space 10 years you know I've seen I've seen a lot of narratives and I've seen a lot of ways to talk about Bitcoin and I just don't think that that way is is very constructive and if we look at you know there's all sorts of metrics you can look at I think the dominance metric is somewhat silly because there's no dominance based on cohort like the Bitcoin dominance metric isn't based on yearly cohort it's based on like Infinity new altcoins being created versus Bitcoin market cap so it's not a great metric but you know if the fire and brimstone approach worked then why are we seeing more alts and ever exist so I just don't think that that that that is working at all yeah and I can definitely resonate with that because during about the second half of 2021 was really like this alt layer one part of the of the bull market the like uh Solana wanted to come kill ethereum Avalanche wanted to come kill ethereum Phantom wanted to come kill ethereum and me and Ryan just never really like resonated with these chains and we never really gave these chains like too much exposure and it was two out to our mistake I would say where we were like these these chains have compromised on decentralization they have a large amount of insiders and I mean we wouldn't use the word like morality but like the undertones were there and people like picked up on it and like we got a lot of flack and we got a lot of pushback and a lot of resistance and people like lost faith I think during that phase of 2021 is to like how bankless is like on the frontier of things because we were like these these things are like they're morally inferior if you will like that's all it's all multi-coin capital in Kyle somani and like these things are destined to fail because they're fundamentally centralized but people at the time did not not care they're like you eat Maxis just like do you just want us to pump your bags uh I'm trying to like I'm trying to get mine you got yours I'm trying to get mine stop like subjugating me to like your Superior whatever and like we had to learn that lesson it's like yo like for and so we've we've adapted our messaging to first get uh wealthy then get healthy as in first figure out how to make your money because then you can have the time and the patience and the capacity to learn about the values of decentralization but you can't go in the middle of the bull market and be like you know what everyone needs to stop and learn about today decentralization that doesn't work very well uh and so I can definitely resonate with these stories through and through yeah no I appreciate that that story that you just shared it was um it took me a little bit while to kind of rock that like hey most of the people here are just here for speculation even the bitcoiners you know there's a lot of people who bought Bitcoin and they're like and they'll start kind of like spouting out some of the Bitcoin narratives but they'd never really truly understood it they bought it because their buddy bought it and uh Bitcoin isn't in this pure you know pure Bitcoin is not uh hasn't been Bitcoin has been tainted by speculation of course every asset has there's nothing wrong with that taint though uh some bitcoiners like to believe that oh it's it's singular and it's and it's and it's taint to where it's like the least amount of taint but look people are trying to speculate across all of these assets and so our job your job and my job in our respective communities is to take the uh come for the speculation folks and keep them to stick around for either the sound money or smart contract platform and I think that's ultimately the job that we all play is that we we take those speculators and we help educate them and tell them how this all works and so yeah I think it's a it's a message people don't want to get you know it's I think there was a I don't know if it's a meme or a joke in some of the Bitcoin circles which is like you know you're not going to convince someone about Bitcoin if you go to like an nft Meetup and you start talking about like Austrian economics they're like this just your conversion rate is going to be at a zero it's gonna be at a basically a zero um and while that might be personally The Narrative that I like for my audience it's not a narrative I'm gonna go out there and really hammer on because I just don't think it's going to resonate with the mainstream audience um you know there's a really funny analogy that Pete Rizzo came up with if we don't want to use the religious analogy for the Bitcoin the different Bitcoin factions we could use one that is music related so he goes man look you're pop music your pop music for Bitcoin right he's like look your message resonates with a lot of people but the metal Rock guys the fundamentalists they're like dude your music sucks it's like watered down it's too bland yeah right yeah you know what I'm talking about versus like the metal Rock eyes are like yeah I want just that I want that pure metal just give it you know give it to me straight give me some give me some of the tough love give me some some hard rock and uh I think that's a really good analogy too of just like there's this um divide in the community as well between like the moderates and rationalists where I think those you know that what we talked about like the um kind of the more moderate stance a little bit and a little bit more of like the less fire and brimstone take is what people that converts the most people and we probably you know I think when we look at over time how this develops we can look at different kpis around this right like follower counts engagement Etc and you're seeing a lot of these I would say more moderates or rationalists really you know really kind of step out in terms of their performance on social which isn't a you know a hundred percent correlation with quality or actual message Market fit but it does I think show to me show me that there is a I would say like a pretty big pretty big group that is more moderate uh rationalist rather than fundamentalist because the moderate or rationalists are getting more and more followers and more and more engagement which to me represents narrative Market fit arbitrim1 is

wall icon to get started one thing I want to unpack with you is a little bit of the the Cyber Hornets right uh and and I've seen again correct me if I'm wrong but the Cyber Hornets tend to be in this like this Bitcoin fundamentalist camp they're like this unified hive mind body they're all kind of faceless you you know when you see them on Twitter and they also kind of look like the same like frog armies that are in different communities or like when Daniel Sesto was at the peak of his like career like he had his own like Army and it all kind of looked the same and then like the moderates are quieter and they kind of lurk they have their opinions but they're confident in their opinion so they don't feel the need to go out on Twitter and shout and that's that's who I kind of see inhabiting this like Bitcoin rationalist basis like the the the middle like the the moderate middle who's like just more rational right and less extreme and doesn't really have to engage in like these crazy Twitter Antics so would you say like the Cyber hornets do lean into this uh into the the Bitcoin fundament uh fundamentalist Camp yeah that's hard to say you you've got like for example like the plebs and the Cyber Hornets which I don't know if those are like exactly the same comparison but it's basically the idea that you've got a group of individuals who identify as not important people and they do that on purpose because they're like hey look it doesn't matter if you're important or not but the Bitcoin Network all that matters is that you're an individual and that you have you know when you run your own full node that you represent yourself you don't need it to appeal to any Authority and I actually like a lot of those principles of like reject reject influencers reject people of influence reject companies and all you need is just your full node where you direct connect connect directly with Bitcoin and you don't need to appeal to anyone else that's like pretty cool I agree with that to a certain extent right um what I don't agree with with some of it is just like you know blindly attacking people for perceived impurities and and I'm not sure if that's you know the Cyber Hornets or plebs who do that more often um but I would say and I don't want to like lump everyone together because I don't think a lot of cyber Hornets or or plebs really agree with a lot of the Bitcoin fundamentalist stuff so that's what's really tricky is like you've got like Maxi cyber Hornets um uh plebs and I'm not sure if like labeling all of them as the problem or all of them as a problem I don't think that's super useful because they uh I think a lot of them have different ideologies but I think the core root of it is that these plebs or cyber Hornets represent kind of the the common person so I agree with I agree with the uh kind of like core root ethos of what they have um I don't agree with dog piling and just a dog pile in so whoever's doing that whether it be cyber Hornets or plebs or they just Dogpile on people I've seen some really really horrible things that they've done with certain uh influencers or certain researchers or core devs even or they just pile on and attack them and I think that whether that be Bitcoin or anything else I don't really like that sort of behavior personally so I find that pretty distasteful but I've seen that behavior in other spaces too so I'm not sure if it's just just a Bitcoin thing or something else but I certainly I certainly would not agree with that sort of that sort of uh pylon sort of activity sure so who are are there like leaders in this like Bitcoin fundamentalist camp like are there generals of this whole side of thing I don't know I I I'm getting the hint that you don't really want to name names but like are there like self are there self people that are waving the flag say hey where the fundamentalists come join yeah I mean look I as soon as I name names and they're going to come out and they're going to create content around it and that's where it gets like a little bit different names if I do you can you can handle the names you want but is Corey clipston a Bitcoin Fundamentalist I mean look uh Corey and I go back a long time to where when he first started out with uh with Swan like I helped him think through a few things and also I'm a huge fan of any sort of startup so I I like the idea that people get in the trenches and go fight and make something happen um I don't appreciate how he's attacked me and others I think it's very unproductive um so I'm not sure if he'd even agree that he's a fundamentalist because the term is still being defined but if someone were to fit that I think you know I think he's got a pretty high overlap with that um but again it's not me saying that he's uh he's a bad person or something I just think he identifies more with like very culturally identifies with some of that that Vibe and feeling okay I remember I uh interviewed Corey on my old podcast POV crypto uh with uh CK from from Bitcoin media uh and it was all about Swan and what swan was in education and he was very nice and cordial and then and then we stopped the podcast he was like yeah I had to put on like my professional face because we like just started this company and then I've over the next like course of two years I proceeded to get attacked by him on on crypto Twitter I'm like dude you were so nice at in that one podcast and now I've been pestering him on Twitter to come on Bank list but he hasn't responded to uh responded to my requests well he should come on I think it'd be a good it should come on he should come on yeah I'd love to talk to Corey yeah I think you know there's sort of a group too that like part of this fundamentalist group is like inserting God into Bitcoin which is is really bizarre like uh like God like God family stake in Bitcoin which is like such a bizarre it's such a bizarre sort of like framing for Bitcoin I mean look I was around there from the almost from the beginning it was Guns drugs and Bitcoin that was what Bitcoin was about I mean very very libertarian you know don't tread on me I've got my AR-15 I've got my Bitcoin in cold storage and uh I believe that you know fully full legalization of drugs I mean the first one of the first use cases for Bitcoin is Silk Road right right so that that is OG Bitcoin to me like super libertarian ideology and people are very rock star Bitcoin rock and roll Bitcoin yeah yeah well I guess that's pop Bitcoin now it's not not extreme right right yeah that's why I said Rockstar but then corrected to rock and roll Bitcoins yeah like yeah maybe it's like I mean it's like classic it's classic rock maybe yes maybe it's more Classic Rock versus like death metal or something um so yeah I think that uh you know this modern day kind of like God family Bitcoin look I am I'm a huge proponent of of strong families like I'm not saying that I'm an anti-family person um also if you want to believe in God as a Libertarian I'm like go ahead you're free to do that and and I will defend you know your ability to you know worship freely even though I don't agree with it you know as a Libertarian these are naturally things that I I agree with on a on like a uh a personal level like people should be able to do these things um and and of course dietary whatever whatever you're into I'm totally cool with that I think making that a part of like a check mark or like taking that ethos and and putting that on top of Bitcoin as like a cultural check mark that you need to have is kind of silly um and if you look at you know you know I would say like follower accounts and engagement with these types of individuals they haven't grown nearly as fast as the more moderate rationalists can't because I don't think most of most people want to be like yeah I've got four kids I eat steak and I go to church like if that's your life that's great I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do I'm just saying like that shouldn't be the check marks that you have to have to be a good bitcoiner so um I do think that they're taking their personal lives and extrapolating that to the Bitcoin ethos and they're free to do that because Bitcoin has no marketing machine like it's just we're all part of bitcoin's marketing machine there is no centralized one so there isn't a central narrative and that's why I keep going back to like follower accounts and engagement is if you look at more moderate rationalists I think that their follower accounts over time their engagement over time has been increasing as less and less people resonate with that message um and I don't think you know these things are like inherently at odds you know if one group wants to you know this is like Methodist versus Presbyterian like I don't think there's like this great Methodist or Presbyterian battle going on it's just more of people want to associate and and hang out with and and and work with some individuals that have more of this stance or that stance um so yeah I don't think it's like this like um you know Civil War sort of asked in that moment it's more of just like cultural identity right and I think of course Nick Sabo definitely got it right when we talked about social scalability right and I actually am ready to move on in this conversation to kind of just talk about the future of Bitcoin and leave maybe the the fundamentalists behind because I do think that time will eventually leave the fundamentalists behind simply because they are not socially scalable like if you have to believe in God's stake family and Bitcoin you're gonna you're gonna like people can like all of those things but don't want to necessarily have to be confined into that box in order to be accepted by the Bitcoin community so if we're in order for Bitcoin to scale out to the whole world it needs to be more socially scalable uh so in order to wrap this conversation up Dan like what's at stake here between the fundamentalists and the rationalists like why do we need to fight this fight or or do we at all yeah great question like why even bring this up right like who cares how people identify themselves um what I care about the most my number one objective is the adoption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to ensure Bitcoin success the code itself no matter what that code is but whether it be Bitcoin or ethereum is useless without people believing in it both bring value into the chain they bring in adoption they bring in development and all of these are critically important for the network effect to continue to propagate and for the blockchain to ultimately succeed humans require marketing messages in order to be convinced to try this new thing whether that be Word of Mouth your friend telling you about it whether that be an ad from an exchange trying to get you to buy it or whether that be a webinar this podcast any one of these mediums or pieces of content that help you understand it these are all step forwards and getting and increasing the adoption of XYZ protocol for Bitcoin that's the one I care about the most and that's what I spent my you know the last 10 years basically my entire working life focused on so for me the success of Bitcoin is predicated upon us developing messages around why Bitcoin is valuable and useful for people and propagating that in in a way that reaches the maximal audience possible so how do we reach the most people with the right messaging is what I care about of course I can't control anyone else says nor would I so people are free to use whatever narratives whatever narratives they would like but I think for Bitcoin to succeed this is at least the narrative I'm trying and what I see a lot of others trying I think that's the maximal conversion sort of narrative we're looking at like the maximum conversion narrative um and I think that's important that it doesn't get diluted or watered down with some of these other as more cultural things where individuals are trying to say that you know lending is evil or VCS are evil or um you know you're not a bitcoiner unless you know got family Bitcoin sort of thing I think that these are fine you know it's fine for people to go preach that but they sh if that is a net detriment to the adoption for everyone else I think that's a really scary place to be in um and I think the worst part of this too and and so we're all free to choose our own marketing messages so there's nothing we can do about that I think the scariest part is more around development so um you know chasing like chasing Matt Corolla or like criticizing Matt carello because he was slightly critical about these cultural issues um or you know going after XYZ Bitcoin developer uh because they don't adhere completely did it completely to this I think that that's probably the longest term you know risk here is that we start attacking companies uh people building companies and core Developers for not being pure enough I think that's probably the biggest thing that we're fighting back against on the moderate rational side is the fact that you know to build to make Bitcoin succeed it will have to change slightly over time whatever those changes may be are in the future and I'm not trying to say XYZ chain change needs to happen it's just more that you know for example like we had Taproot as an upgrade right little things like this will exist over time or it might be a Bitcoin layer like Layer Two like that was a you know like lightning for example um or side chains like rsk liquid stacks these these sort of things represent I would say like that's what I talk about when I talk about changes as like incremental changes of like either layer Tech or very small changes in layer one so with these changes and with apps being developed on top of Bitcoin whether it be a centralized app or a decentralized app like you know D5 related this needs developer Talent funding and a culture that welcomes building and I think that right now some of the fundamentalist Vibes are very very kind of anti-building and they're anti-free markets and so they tried to subjectively choose what they think is the right project like Lightning's okay but uh RS lightening the liquid are okay but rsk and stacks aren't you know like very very subjective sort of sort of framing there and I think that that's net detrimental to the space if there's this subjectivity being pushed on what's acceptable or not I actually think tarot is is probably one of the most interesting developments on top of lightning because it's going to force these individuals to reconcile their beliefs where lightning was okay but now we're talking about every asset you could possibly want on lightning so that also means coins to them right so you know they have to reconcile the fact that they're pure L2 solution is now being polluted or being used for other types of assets being transferred whether that be a stable coin or or a company Equity or a governance token or something so I think that that'll be an interesting kind of showdown of their beliefs and how they reconcile that um yeah so for me I think it's the anti-building anti-building sort of culture that is the biggest net detriment and also the fire and brimstone sort of narrative building I just don't think that those are net positive um and I think that the rationalists want to go back to sort of the fundamentals of what big net funds is fundamentals is the wrong word I go back to the original kind of Bitcoin ethos of Bitcoin ethos was very open to building um and I think this is a great place to end up in in this conversation where like Satoshi was a fan of uh namecoin you know so like Satoshi Satoshi is a fan of name coin um you had uh hellfini talk about you know nfts the early Bitcoin ethos and nfts actually started on bitcoin with a counterparty with rare Pepes people forget that you know defy and a lot of the stuff actually started in a very early fits and starts on top of Bitcoin for example also like join Market which is a market to mix your coins together AKA coin joins that's one of the earliest ways to earn yield in a decentralized manner and that's been around for almost eight years now so Bitcoin has a lot of this had a lot of this Builder ethos and I think that through you know the fork Wars uh the block size Wars you know that was a lot of like intensity around how changes are made uh there was a I would say a Slowdown of the Bitcoin building ethos and that's for example why I'm at trust machines I'm a part-time over there helping out the marketing org in terms of helping um take the products that we're developing on these Bitcoin layers and helping people understand that you can build some of this function some of this D5 function on top of Bitcoin so we certainly can't do all the cool things that you can do on ethereum or Solana or these other chains but we're trying to bring back that Builder ethos I think is the is the core narrative here yeah and I think that's I think that's very aligned with a lot of what I'm seeing out of the Bitcoin rationalist Camp is that uh perhaps they feel just a little bit muted in their ability to express their Builder drive on bitcoin and is that is that what trust machines is really trying to do is it's uh trying to offer surface area for Builders to actually like latch onto for Bitcoin it could go into trust machines a little bit more and what it is what it does for sure yeah so trust machine machines were started by munib Mane was the former founder of stacks to be clear we are not a Stax accelerator we're not just building on top of stacks what I find most interesting about trust machines is that we're building on top of any Bitcoin layer that has the functionality that we need so that could be lightning rsk liquid Stacks whatever it may be and we're looking to be the consensus built with sys of Bitcoin so building a new suite of Bitcoin applications that are in a you know decentralization is always a spectrum but uh which you might call defy so building Bitcoin D5 applications on top of Bitcoin which to me is really really cool because they believe that Bitcoin has an asset I personally really really love it and I think that Bitcoin lacks a lot of that uh smart contract functionality that we've definitely seen evidence of usage with on ethereum and Bitcoin salon and other chains and by bringing that back to bitcoin I think there's long-term value accrual with that so at trust machines we're going to be building a suite of products these products being mostly decentralized products that are built on top of Bitcoin that enable you to lend to borrow um it right now there's only a few products uh the first one coming out is zest zest is like Maple Finance which allows undercollateralized lending to occur really interesting sort of uh structure there too much to cover in the next two minutes but um a really cool product there we also have console which is a decentralized um sort of messaging platform a decentralized Discord if you will and so those are a taste of the first couple products that are coming out of trust machines but I'm really excited for me I've always worked on C5 products I'm going to Kraken blockchain.com Etc so for me this is a kind of a whole new world of looking at defy and exploring it and so yeah that's we're on the rational side you know I look at things like yield farming and other things at the ethereum and Solana ecosystems have and and find it both fascinating and something I'd like to try to bring back to bitcoin if possible so extrapolate out for us into the future say trust machines is maximally successful it achieves all the goals that it wants to achieve what what does that mean for Bitcoin um what does that mean for just the whole ecosystem as a whole yeah I mean like I've said before we've seen that there is demand for using Bitcoin or you you're a point a there is demand to to use D5 applications we've seen that very very clearly uh whether that be nfts yield farming staking lending borrowing I would include all of these as like d5s d5s applications then we have the usage of Bitcoin on other chains wrapped Bitcoin wbtc with bitco that and other wrapped Bitcoin Solutions I think are very evident of the demand to use Bitcoin in decentralized applications even with the critical flaw of the Bitcoin being totally centralized and wrapped which or some of these are some of these Bridge Solutions aren't these are more bridges rather than wrapped coins but I don't want to get into the differences here in the next couple minutes um so to me as a as an individual who's both in a product and a marketing function for the last 10 years that's pretty indicative of uh demand for a solution like that so by bringing some of that back to bitcoin I think we bring back a lot of that speculative interest if we go back to the casino analogy Bitcoin only has really one game it's like spot Bitcoin it's like spot Bitcoin yeah there's Futures and options and stuff too but you know on the Bitcoin native chain we don't have like yield farming and if nfts these sort of things and I think these speculative games lead to long-term value accrual for the underlying blockchain as big as as the speculative waves for Bitcoin have led to bitcoin's adoption these speculative waves occur for other chains and have it led to their adoption as well and so the more games we have to play the more speculative d5-esque games that we have on bitcoin the more financial games if you will that we can bring back to bitcoin I believe that leads to long-term value accrual for Bitcoin so for me this is something I want to work on that I believe has a really great impact on bitcoin's long-term adoption rate and this certainly fits in my model of like how a successful blockchain works because when you have demand for financial games that ultimately collapses down into demand for Block space which is what keeps a blockchain alive uh so Dan I wish you and Trust machines the best of luck and thank you for coming on bankless well David thanks for having me this was a fun Journey Down the cultural side of the Bitcoin community and then uh yeah the on the casino games front I think we have a lot to Admire from the ethereum side in terms of what you guys have done in terms of like nfts yield farming um it does accrue demand for Block space and that's long-term what Bitcoin needs so totally agree thanks for having me and I appreciate the conversation Dan if uh people community members listeners or other builders are feeling inspired by this conversation and they are interested in learning more about trust machines or
