welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless guys there is a massive opportunity we've called it a trillion dollar opportunity in the layer 2 world we want to unpack it we're going to do that in two parts in two episodes the first episode is the one you are about to hear we're going to talk about ether economics in this episode what do else use the coming of ltus do for the price of eth is it beneficial is it parasitic will we actually get in a layer 2 season with layer 2 tokens we unpack all of that in tomorrow's episode there's going to be a part two where we talk about public goods how they are the killer app of these layer twos how you can work for these layer twos and work and to receive public goods funding and how layer twos will ultimately win the battle for hearts and Minds using public Goods funding and economics David that episode is coming out tomorrow the one we are about to listen to is today I'm really excited about these episodes and by the way there's no guest it's just you and I what uh can listeners expect to hear oh it's classroom time with Ryan and David man it's gonna be great there's so much information to get out there and each one of these episodes represents its own opportunity uh and and people who generally think that like public goods those are the things that you donate to or those are the people that work towards just you know public goods and there's no upside there because they're public goods you're wrong this is where things change and this is the beautiful mechanism of retroactive public goods funding where we are injecting Silicon Valley type upside potentials into people that build public goods products and this is something that has never before seen on the face of this Earth or in crypto economics at large and so if you think that that is just like oh Ryan and David talking about public goods no we're talking about Alpha and we're going to tell you about how you can get potentially the billions of dollars that are going to be generated from Mev and block space sales on layer twos and how that can go into your pocket when you build something useful for these layer twos but that is all in episode number two which is coming out tomorrow later episode number one which you are listening to right now is all about how The Ether economics change and in a layer two Paradigm uh as Ryan said and of course as we ended this podcast we talked about perhaps a liquidity mining incentive programs that may or may not be coming for these layer twos and of course as we hit stop on the recording we just launched or we just heard that optimism launched its layer 2 liquidity mining program so you know these things are coming they are here today and we can start building towards getting some of that money into our pockets right now and that is all about all of these opportunities that layer two offers for for you for me and for the world guys uh fantastic episodes coming up

welcome to a classic David and Ryan episode this is just the two of us so I I think maybe the format is uh David I'm going to be kind of interviewing you and then adding color commentary because this is something that you wanted to talk about a while uh we're talking all about Layer Two and the possibilities in layer 2 at the eth level the ethereum level at the layer 2 level and then working on public goods so um I don't have to introduce you guys this is my co-host David how's it going man good this is my co-host Ryan how are you doing I'm doing great why are you so excited about layer twos David oh because there's just so much surface area for opportunities Ryan like you listed them off like the the opportunity for ether the asset to become even more money are huge and so there's there's things to talk about that with that like how layer twos will impact the youth burn rate how layer twos will impact reservation demand for eth how layer 2's impact the the staking rate of e the apy you can get from staking youth on the layer one and that's just with eth there's also Bridge opportunities and yield opportunities there's also the layer 2 token themselves each one represents an opportunity of them in of themselves there's also the opportunity Ryan to spin up many many layer twos and so these things are infinitely forkable and infinitely copy and pastable and and there's all these economic things to discuss and that's even before we get to the secret opportunity that so few people are talking about which I think is going to put billions of dollars into entrepreneurs hands over the next 12 months and ultimately become to a trillion dollar industry which is fighting for what we call retroactive public goods funding where public goods turns into upside as same level as like a web 2 Silicon Valley startup exposure but for building public goods products I think Ryan this is a coming trillion dollar opportunity over the next decade and we are on the cusp of seeing this ball really get starting to roll so I want to make sure the bankless nation knows what's coming because there is a lot of opportunity just over the horizon if you're playing a bankless drinking game this episode uh please do not use opportunity as your word because I think I counted like eight times or something that David just said opportunity and I think look that's the that's the theme of the show is there's this new uh why space that has opened up in front of us this New Horizon which is Layer Two and it has so many opportunities for for expansion it's like crypto is new again right like uh you missed out on original Bitcoin in 2013 you missed out on ethereum in 2015 2016. well now layer twos are open for you and there's so much that needs to be built out in this ecosystem so we're going to talk a lot about it okay let's start here with the Bold case for eth because you and I believe layer twos are actually bullish for eat the asset not everyone believes that in fact I've been seeing a lot of things on on Twitter a lot of pushback about this saying uh layer 2 tokens in particular and layer twos themselves are actually parasitic to either the asset and to ethereum the network so let's spend some time talking about the opportunity that is eth in a layer 2 world but let's start with that question David do you think layer twos cannibalize ethereum do they cannibalize the layer one especially with them launching their own tokens with these tokens going to be competitive with ether as NASA I think if we saw layer twos having their own tokens and those tokens become instantiated as money in those layer twos then the argument for do layer twos cannibalize ethereum would be a lot stronger but I do not see that actually shaping up to be the way that layer twos work uh the way that that if the trajectory seems to be is that layer twos are probably going to all issue their own tokens optimism just announced their token if you're paying attention to arbitrum you kind of know that they're probably headed in that same direction as well and there are other layer twos that also have their own tokens but they all accept ether as money inside of each one of those ecosystems and so ether is the currency inside of optimism inside of arbitrum and and even on arbitrim you call it a eth and on optimism you call it optimism eth and this is the native currency of these layer 2 Chains now part of the argument for these layer twos being parasitic for the ethereum layer one is that they sap away transaction demand from the layer one and they put it on the layer two and so well you know clearly is parasitic because if we're taking away transactions from the base chain where which is the chain that pays for security and we put it on the layer twos then like well that revenue is going to a different spot and now it's going to revenue for the optimism token or the urban Trump token or the ZK sync token instead of actually being paid for ethereum validators and like yeah this is true to some degree but you have to remember that layer twos are blockchains that also settle on ethereum itself so all of the revenue that all these layer twos create from selling their blocks that turns into block space demand for the ethereum layer one so the way that I explain these a lot this to a lot of people is that they are like solar panels for economic activity that hook in that plug right into the ethereum layer one so optimism arbitrum big solar panels big solar arrays they get the the uh how big these solar panel fields are are a function of how cheap their fees are because the cheaper the fees the more economic activity they can support and so by reducing fees on the layer twos they actually are inducing more total economic activity that otherwise wouldn't have been available on the ethereum L1 I mean optimism and arbitrum and layer twos they're not pulling away economic activity that requires less than five dollars per transaction because that economic activity simply doesn't exist on the layer one they are actually creating that on the layer 2 and acting as an aggregator of economic activity and injecting it into the layer one so in some ways they do borrow from economic activity on the layer one but it's stuff that should have been on the layer 2 to begin with and it always Aggregates and puts it back onto the layer one at the end of the day yeah you know what this argument reminds me of is um basically have you seen this have you ever seen this map David this is a map of uh this map of the US and uh the U.S states in this in this map looking at this on on YouTube if you can see the visual but we'll try to include a link in the show notes this is U.S states renamed for country trees with a similar GDP and if you look at the State of California it is a similar GDP as the United Kingdom Texas is similar in size to Canada the nation state so one state the United States is the size of a major G7 Country Canada Florida is the size of Indonesia New York state is the size of South Korea and I think like l2s argue with that l2s are parasitic to ethereum would be kind of like saying New York California Texas and Florida are parasitic to the U.S economy it's like no these are part of the U.S economy right it's like uh not everything has to happen not all of the GDP has to be produced at the at the federal level in fact the GDP of the US is the sum of all of the GDP the economic activity of its states of its its vassal States and you know these uh these states they have different tax codes and they have lots of autonomy but they still adopt the coinage of uh the U.S government for example they still received the defense and security protection of the U.S military as well and they are they are states in a union and so to me this is a this is a very useful analog right it's like they're all part of the same ethereum Nation if you will and ethereum is is kind of a United United uh set of chains after a fashion you can also see this David in if you go to like uh the burn leaderboard here right these are actual applications paying their taxes they're consuming ethereum block space and right now you see things like ens and openc at the top we expect that a lot of these things will move to layer twos over time a lot of this economic activity even when you scroll down a little bit farther you start to see arbitrum how much over the last day did arbitrim pay in taxes of 33 eth I expect someday this entire burn leaderboard will be full of layer twos Etc blockchains yeah yeah the the demand and is going to we said this in the past the demand is using moving on ethereum mainnet from block space demand that is from users and to Applications we already seen kind of that transition and ultimately it's going to land it's just other chains that are primarily going to be the primary block space consumers and so all this is additive to the economic you know uh impact the economic throughput of ethereum it's like a a union of chains not completely separate chains that's that's a useful analog to me when I think about this and I really like that the state's model because there is huge benefits from all of these different countries turning into something more interoperable than separate Sovereign Nations and being more like states where you can just freely walk across borders from California to Oregon to Washington or eventually from California and walk all the way to New York like trade can happen across all of these things because they all settle on the same protocol and we even have a highway system right our state highway system exactly and like there's no there's no tolls between California and New York oh there's probably some but the point is is like you can drive from California to New York without ever having to prove your uh prove your citizenship or have to you don't have to pay like terrorists or like you know trade trade taxes because we're all on the same protocol and so the growth of the Californian GDP has spillover effects to every other state and so it's pretty crazy when you see the con the city or the the state of Texas being as large as all of Canada the whole entire mass of land that's above America but it's as efficient as the smaller mass of land which is Texas uh and like United Kingdom the former like Empire of the world is equal to just California just one of 50 states and so like this collaboration of layer twos is a very much a growing the the pie ecosystem that all ultimately comes and settles down to the main ethereum layer one and so it's giving optionality and it's giving autonomy to every single layer too to do what's best for themselves and layer twos will therefore have to do what's best for their users because that's their job their job is to aggregate users economic activity to make it cheap and then ultimately come and secure that with the main ethereum layer one let's talk a little bit more about the the economics in the Slayer 2 world so uh what about layer 2 fees what happens to Layer Two fees so I can pull up a chart in a second layer two fees like optimism it's hanging out at about you know 50 cents call it to like 90 cents some of that rain arbitrim's the same some of the ZK Roll-Ups are around 10 to 20 cents I believe uh you know some of this is from memory and you compare that to mainnet and the mainnet transaction might be like eight dollars ten dollars or something so on the order of a 90 to 95 percent reduction in fees but will it always be like that or will ltu fees increase over time yeah there are reasons why layer 2 fees will go up and also reasons why layer 2 fees will go down the near-term impacts of layer 2 fees is definitely down because we are just at the beginning of layer two optimizations there are things that all these layer 2 teams can do to make their fees go down that they're responsible for but then there's also eips like eip4484 I think is the right number some combination fours and eights uh where like the it reduces the cost of call data on the ethereum layer one which is going to drop layer one layer two feeds by an order of magnitude and then there's also sharding as soon as sharding comes into play we have Layer Two fees going down by another order of magnitude and so like each one of these different subsets like development on the layer twos themselves by the layer two teams uh eip4484 for reducing call data costs and then also adding in sharding each one of those represents an order of magnitude fee reduction and can finally get us down to what vitalik calls the internet of money with sub five cent transaction fees and probably much lower than that now we can also increase transaction fees by just the normal way that you would do that which is increasing the demand for Block space so as block space gets consumed and it has more and more in demand as we've seen the ethereum layer one you can see fees go up and you and this is why like things like arbitrary and optimism have somewhere between like 25 cent uh to one dollar transaction fees because well there's actually a decent amount of demand for these things uh as evidenced by how much revenue they're making we'll get to that later but there is eventually an equilibrium point there are so many layer twos that have been able to scale out to their their maximum degree uh it attracts a lot of economic activity and that induces a lot of economic activity so it's not like fees are going to be permanently down only there will be upwards price pressure for Block space demand for the layer twos and it will hit some sort of equilibrium but the beautiful thing about this Ryan is that when a layer 2 gets too saturated for particular use cases we can just make more we can just have another layer too and so if we need a layer two with Hyper cheap fees there are different design constructions and different optionalities that layer twos have to make sure that fees can stay as basically as low as as the layer 2 teams want and so the long-term equilibrium of these things is a little bit unknown but with the amount of ammo that we have in the tool belt to keep pushing down fees on the layer two is pretty significant and so I would be very optimistic to seeing less than five stand transaction fees and sometimes in 2023 and then also scaling that out to more and more users being able to access more and cheaper and cheaper fees all right so what we're seeing right now is Layer Two transaction fees that are about 90 to 95 percent cheaper than um than layer one and we're getting some EIP improvements that will massively reduce those transaction fees yet again right you mentioned too that are coming and once these two are implemented we'll probably see like sub five cent transaction fees maybe sub one cent transaction fees we also anticipate the same time because when you create more block space there's more cheap cheap block space there's more block space demand so demand will eventually like catch up and then fees will increase from the there you know above above one cent in Into the Future so I guess right now we've got fees hovering around where they are for the next few months in six months to 18 months a massive fee reduction that will carry us over for a very long time until block space demand that then catches up with it so when we talk about the fee differences is there a difference between I know there's two classes of Roll Up is there a difference between optimistic Roll-Ups and DK Roll-Ups with respect to fees yeah so for the user fees ZK Roll-Ups are always going to be cheaper just by definition of what they are those are the faster cheaper transactions they're just also harder to build and harder to develop on than optimistic rollups but the cool thing about this both Roll-Ups both roll up design constructions they amortize fees across users and so actually the more users that are using Roll-Ups the more the fees are shared because the fees are ultimately the cost of making a layer one transaction and so when layer 1 transaction from optimism or arbitrum is shared amongst 10 people versus 10 000 people the more these Roll-Ups are used the cheaper the fees get so this is actually really like awesome mechanism and just really good mechanism design where the the more and more these things are used the cheaper and cheaper the fees get because the cost is split against amongst a wider and wider set of participants this is uh more true for ZK Roll-Ups than it is for optimistic Roll-Ups because ZK Roll-Ups have very high fixed costs as in the transaction for CK Roll-Ups to put a transaction on the layer one is about the same size of data every single time whereas as economic activity on these layer Twos for optimistic rollups I like arbitrum and optimism as they grow the actual cost of that layer 1 transaction also does increase but it increases linearly as usage can grow exponentially so layer 2 usage of optimistic rollups can grow exponentially while the while the L1 transaction cost grows linearly and so they still can this is a like directionally right they can still amortize higher and higher transaction quantities across more and more users and so this is a beautiful thing about Layer Two is that you just can't do at the layer one level which is as adoption grows the cheat the fees actually go down rather than up so we've got Layer Two fees going down over time at least until such a time that massive block space demand catches up with it but what about layer 1 fees what about ethereum mainnet layer fees are we ever going down there uh probably not I would say just because like the opportunity to spin up a new blockchain and then have that be the aggregator of fees down to the layer one there's so much potential of of defy of crypto left to make newer and newer use cases for what we can do in the crypto world that is going to be unlocked with layer twos that it's ultimately going to aggregate a bunch of new economic activity and then put that down onto the layer one and that is going to increase block space on the layer one and so even if like users stopped or even if like layer 2 stopped using L1 block space like even users would start going back to the layer one but that's just never going to happen there's always going to be some sort of just like basal level of demand for ethereum layer one block space and that that basal level of demand is only going to increase as more and more layer twos come online and as they they themselves create higher and higher block space Demand on the layer one uh yeah so we've talked about this concept David of um you know even in Bitcoin in the early days economic density right so what we've done is we've compressed far more value far more economic activity uh into onto each dollar spent on ethereum mainnet fees because now it's not just me buying something on on uniswap as an individual uh user you know that block space fee is the sum of you know maybe thousands of transactions on a set of layer twos that then collapse down to a spend on ethereum and that's been the trajectory of all successful fees like more and more economic density of the transactions you remember in the early days when Eric Voorhees was was telling us about his Satoshi dice where he's actually using Bitcoin block space for like what was it almost like an earth it was a fun gambling a fun gambling app that used on-chain like gambling metrics and it used in an incredibly like uh a lot of Bitcoin block space in an incredibly inefficient way and it very soon it'd be became impractical this is like the early days of Bitcoin 2012 2013 time it became impractical to actually run Satoshi dice on bitcoin why because other more valuable transactions crowded Satoshi dice out and that's exactly what's going to happen with ethereum mainnet this is why I agree with you David I don't think mainnet transaction fees like they'll ebb and flow a little bit but they're never really gonna go down in the future and so that's actually a good thing though overall because we want High transaction fees on ethereum mainnet in order to prop up the defense budget the security budget for the ethereum network and all of the the United States the United chains of ethereum so that's actually a very important feature and function now where people get stuck though is they still think that the ethereum mainnet is going to be home for users in the future like individuals paying 30 40 100 transaction fees on ethereum mainnet what would you say about that right so if you're a user trying to use the ethereum layer one think about who you are competing against like right now you're competing against other ethereum whales who have like a ton of ether and are insensitive to gas prices and you're also competing against other blockchains right and that is the long-term competition for ethereum layer one block space do you think that you have enough ammo to compete with other blockchains to consume ethereum block space like the answer is no yeah I'm gonna say no on that you can feed it with an entire like state level economy it's like competing with the state of California to get your transaction through right it doesn't matter how big of a whale you are eventually you will get pushed out to the layer twos like the the tide will always go up and up and up uh just because like you because layer twos are just instantly cash flow positive because any block space demand for the layer twos turns into block space demand for the layer one so all layer twos have to do is have any ounce of utility around them and they start being pretty competitive with consuming layer 1 block space and so like it doesn't matter how big your bags are like you're going on to layer twos eventually no matter what because that tide will catch up to you yeah so just don't go there kicking and screaming I mean I think some of the message we're talking about in this in this episode is um start to look start to seriously investigate building a home in one of these later twos like go drive your car through the neighborhood see if it has nice schools nice houses see if it's kind of a vibe that you like because uh sooner or later and I think it should probably be sooner you should think about migrating all of your activity to these layer twos and we've got a lot of contenders to pick from right you know optimisms you can and the nice thing is it's not not like just like a neighborhood because you can have you can live in multiple locations at once but the location you're probably not going to want to live in you're going to be priced out of is the Manhattan which is essentially ethereum mainnet it's it's too crowded too busy too expensive block space price is going up so some of the message of this episode is start to investigate some of these layer twos because you're going to have to migrate so may as well start start right now one thing that has really been a big Advantage for the early ethereum users is having a big footprint on the ethereum layer one like if you use uniswap in 2019 you got the airdrop if you use DUI DX you got the airdrop and so like now is the time to start growing your footprint on layer twos like just grow cast your net do the things because crypto pays you to learn it you don't know how or when or how it's coming but the sooner you establish your Your settlement on a layer two and start just going and doing normal layer two things living your Layer Two life the larger your footprint will be and the more surface area you'll have for airdrops or just other generalized opportunities totally and given what we just said uh right now some of these layer twos like even a dollar on off optimism that's a little expensive for transactions but but realize it's going to get significantly cheaper in the future like we're talking six months 12 months 18 months from now once some of these uh ethereum Improvement proposals go through so you have that to look forward to as well but let's talk a little bit about the uh the layer 2 Paradigm that we're entering and the impact to Ether the asset of course we we talk a lot about ether the asset um as an ultrasound money for instance as a reserve currency for this thing we're calling the ethereum economy but how do layer twos directly impact the value of ether the asset again some have called it parasitic I think we've made the case for why it's not but but walk us through why is it not parasitic for ether the asset right and let's begin by recapping the three pillars of each value capture the three points on the on the triple point asset you have ether consumption via eth burning via L1 block fees then you also have the stake rate as in how much yield in in each terms how much apy you can get from staking your ether and then how much ether it has the reservation demand for ether like how much collateral can it be on these layer twos how how much money can it be on these layer twos so these are the three things that really Define ether as an asset locked in D5 or slash locked in layer twos the burn rate how much ether is getting burned and then the stake rate and so the layer 2 Paradigm impacts all of these things and it really always boils down towards how layer twos are solar panels for economic activity and so let's start with the eth burn rate when when layer twos like have a bunch of economic activity on them maybe it's like gaming on immutable or defy on optimism or arbitrum or any other possible design considerations for any other layer twos of which there are many of all of these scale out the possible economic use cases of ethereum from where it is today at like a five to fifty dollar transaction fee average and it also goes up from there but then it lowers that threshold down to five cents or below so the sheer amount of economic activity that can come to ultimately be settled on ethereum always turned into block space demand for the layer twos and so all these layer twos which are collecting all of this economic energy from the world around it come and start burning ether and they start burning ether a lot Ryan you earlier showed the the eth burn rate on the ultrasound.money website I'm gonna show that again yeah so right now we are arbitrum is is doing 20 or 33 ether per day and optimism is slowly somewhere just below that as well like we are just in the early days of layer twos and burning ether and this is before arbitrum even has a token and before optimism token even goes live and before liquidity mining incentives and so we'll get to all of those things because those are all relevant just just camp on burning for a minute so for people who uh maybe maybe they're not quite sure what the linkage between burning ether is and actually the value of of ether as an asset So when you say burning what do you mean can you talk about etha's a deflationary asset and what this what this who ultimately gets the uh the benefit from this burnt ether certainly yeah so eip1559 is the famous EIP that changed how block transactions work on ethereum about 70 of all blockchain L1 fees on ethereum gets burnt and the reason why it gets burned is multifaceted but it's basically uh when we have when ethereum generates transaction fees High transaction fees we don't actually have to give it to the miners or we don't actually have to give it to the stakers because of how secure ethereum is anyways especially under a proof of stake Paradigm and so we're taking in all of this extra revenue and previously we were just spitting it out to Miners and they were just selling it on the open market and with eip1559 it takes in about 70 percent of all transaction revenue and that number varies but 70 seems to be the equilibrium and it burns it and so it's the this is the excess of the ethereum economy this is the people are spending more than what is needed for ethereum to secure itself and so it takes that excess revenue and it just burns it because we have it's extra we don't actually need to send it back into the economy and because sending it back into the economy implies some point at which it goes back into the economy we don't really want to this like bestow some privileged position in the ethereum economy as in either the stakers or the miners or anyone it needs to be credibly neutral and so what's the most credibly neutral thing to do we just burn it and what that does is it's basically a buyback for on eth so if you own eth you are basically being paid this Revenue because just by owning the thing and so instead of injecting it into one specific part of the ethereum economy saying like hey the miners should get this or the validators should get this or vitalik should get this instead dead the ethereum economy says well if we burn it we can give it to everyone it's like basic income for everybody everybody if you hold the eth right you get your dividend dividend you treat them dividend except the best part is you don't actually like it doesn't actually go into your wallet it doesn't actually have to make a transaction on ethereum your ether is just more valuable implicitly because the other ether has been burnt there's lines out there so this is why we call Ether like ultrasound money because as we go into the merge you can see uh like uh if you hit that simulate merge button which I think maybe you already did Ryan yeah I did yeah negative four percent per year as in ether is deflating at four percent per year do you know Ryan how much gold is inflating I I I know like base numbers I don't know the exact numbers but I'm gonna say like it depends right because the more valuable the gold the more uh inducement there is to inject more Supply into mine more but I'm gonna say like one to to three percent per year is that about right yeah it does it does vary over time but the the 1.5 is the average metric so gold the the the non-place dollar value assay inflationary at one point five percent ether in with today's numbers in the merge is negative four percent uh Bitcoin inflates at zero percent over the long term uh ether currently with this today Sanders inflating at negative four percent so when you say when you say Bitcoin is zero percent over the long term like I kind of understand that but that's also like a little bit of Bitcoin or speed like practically what we're getting in the market is about a 1.5 issuance uh rate for for Bitcoin something to that effect until the next happening and then that that gets cut in half again um but yeah so this um this four percent per year that's based on the the seven day burn rate and you tweak the numbers because any seven day period of time there'll be a different burn rate so if you pull that back to 30 days it's uh it's a little less it's a negative 1.7 percent burn rate but like we're talking about some pretty big numbers if you we haven't even been in a year it's been about like nine months I guess August since EIP August 2021 since EIP 1559 went uh live we roughly burnt two percent of all each supply is about two percent okay 2.2 million in each supply has been burnt in this in this nine month period of time so uh we're talking about some pretty massive numbers and what you're saying here is the link between Layer Two and this burn rate is layer twos are going to burn by far the most amount of block space because they are going to expect them to be the the largest consumers of block space they don't even show on the charts today guys right that's how early there they're not top 10 they're not in the top 15. you have to look to the top 20 to start to see arbitrum but that's all going to change is what we're predicting and they're going to be some of the top burners and all of that burn goes back as a dividend to anyone who holds eth you don't have to stake you don't have to validate you just have to own some yield in the ethereum economy and you get the proceeds of all of the layer twos so what you're saying is just in that first pillar layer twos are good for eth the asset yes right uh Ryan do you remember when I say uh defy summer what gas fee numbers come to mind um what was the sustained gas fee like I just feel like I saw a lot in the 300s I felt it was a lot in the 300s maybe that's just whenever I looked it was at least there what uh what number did you have in mind yeah two to three hundred it was at over two to three hundred for at least a couple months in a row and that was like the on-chain bull market for ethereum the average gas gas fee over the last seven days right now is 45 and it's been that way for the last two months or so uh and this is because like D5 summer like a lot of on-chain activity is a huge bull market huge Mania but like it sustained two to three hundred way for months uh and so like that would put us at like a negative seven eight nine percent deflationary rate and so when I when I use the metaphor that layer twos are solar panels then they are collecting energy to burn ether that is going into burning ether at the layer one these are solar panels for economic energy and that ultimately comes to the just the throwing ether into the furnace over time and why is that a good thing we'll just make one link and then we'll go to the to the next um to the next pillar that you're talking about the reason that's a good thing is because burning ether is a public good why because the more valuable ether is the greater security the ethereum network has and the greater security for all of the United chains of ethereum all of the other layer twos so an ltu burning eth on ethereum makes ether more valuable and increases the security budget for the entire ethereum network so it's like California Texas Florida they're all paying their taxes to the federal government and the federal government can then spend more on National Security and of course these states uh can secede at any time of course that you know their Chains It's a completely opt-in Network so it's not as if ethereum is like forcing These Chains to become uh Roll-Ups and become layer twos they are doing that of their own accord but that's how you get a self-reinforcing economy and the beauty of this Ryan is that when there is a lot of ether burn that again burning the excess revenue for the ethereum protocol it also means that ether ethereum doesn't have to issue as much new ether because if ether increases in price that means we are getting more bang for our buck when we issue and mint one new ether to pay for security if that ether is more highly priced we get we get more value per unit and so as there as the ethereum protocol collects all the revenue from burning ether it means we don't have to issue as much and so this turns into a positive feedback loop of value accrual because we are burning so much the price is going up the value of it is going up and so therefore issuing more ether it requires less issuance uh and so which furthers how scarce it is so it's this great positive feedback uh loop of security and then the higher security you get the more later twos you attract because more people want to be associated with uh with ethereum because they want that security to underlie their chain as well um the each stake rate does that actually you know have any impact in layer twos that was the second pillar you said of the three pillars of ether uh you know value proposition does the stake rate change at all the eat sticker is a complicated Beast especially in a layer 2 world right now like I said earlier 70 of ether block space uh transaction fees go into burning ether implying that 30 goes to the east stake rate that probably changes over time in a layer 2 environment and it's one of those things where it's going to need more data for what we do know is that if you if you believe that layer that ether will go up in price because more and more ether gets burnt and it's also becoming more and more money in all these layer twos that the dollar denominated apy is also going up bigly the ether denominated apy is is a harder thing to reason about there's a lot of a debate out there as to where Mev gets captured is Mev and that means minor extractable value as in if you are an ether validator when you are the it's your turn to propose a block you get to order transactions as you see fit and there is a specific ordering of transactions that you can make that puts more money in your pocket and so validators compete on how much Mev that they can extract from the blocks in a world where a lot of economic activity is going to layer twos and layer twos just bundle up a lot of transactions and put them down on the layer ones there is that implies that a lot of Mev ultimately goes on to the layer twos and this is actually a conversation that we'll be having later in the show as to what layer twos do with all this Mev some natural naturally some Mev will work its way down to the layer one how much that happens is to be determined there's definitely going to be Arbitrage opportunities as like optimism settles all of its unit swap trades onto the layer one and then there's an Arbitrage opportunity there with optimism's version of uniswap with the layer one version of uniswap versus arboretum's layer of uniswap that is all Arbitrage opportunity and that creates Mev at the base layer the proportion of this is to be determined there's a lot of data that we need to really look at but I think the main thing to take away is that perhaps in ether terms ether denominated terms staking apy is about the same but in dollar terms because of how bullish layer twos are for ether the asset and dollar terms goes up bigly so we got the burn rate which positively impacts uh like the Val the value of ether very likely the East stake rate that's that is probably neutral you know maybe maybe some good maybe bad we'll call that uh we'll call that even call it neutral and then uh the last piece is the demand for eth so what what is the impact of layer twos on the demand for ether the asset well very simplistically layer twos need ether to make layer 1 transactions so the protocols themselves have to have a supply of ether in order to run the actual Layer Two And so each protocol generates its own renovation demand but that's probably orders of magnitude smaller than the total reservation demand reservation demand is just a term that people use when there's these things entities that demand to hold some currency uh and so layer twos have their own native demand for ether maker Dao for example has reservation demand for ether with how much ether our end maker Dow vaults and you can imagine as we unlock new use cases for crypto on these layer twos that are have super cheap fees we can create new protocols that induce their own reservation demand for ether the most trustless asset on ethereum uh and so as as we come up with new use cases as we come up with new D5 apps and as people take their ether off of the layer 1 and puts it on the layer two just the reasons why people can want to hold ether just goes up and so we were there's always this frustration about like I can't do anything on the ethereum layer one because of the fees well as soon as we solve that problem on the layer twos we unlock a lot of reasons to deposit ether into the layer two for this reason or that reason and so it just creates more surface area for ether demand for different use cases that we haven't been able to unlock for yeah so Layer Two is the first thing you said is layer twos have to have some ether in order to pay their taxes because their taxes are due in denominator and eighth because they they're basically they need to buy block space from ethereum and they have to pay for that block space need so that's one source the other source that you're saying is all of these like applications on on the layer twos themselves inside of these Layer Two economies and I I think you could start to see that these are some stats from uh Bridges there's a bridge to arbitrary a bridge to optimism there's already David on arbitrim alone at this early stage in the game like pre-arbitrum token there's 1.3 billion dollars worth of eth on arbitrum it's been bridged to arbitrum that's a lot that's about like it's it's almost getting close to a half it's a quarter of a percent of all each Supply okay again getting close to half locked up in the arbitrim economy um optimism 148 million I bet that will swell in uh value too these are only two of the layer two networks we could look at all of the others right and even it's funny um you know alternative layer ones and side chains also have a lot of Eve demand you can you could see that in in the bridge stats as well so ether as an asset in these Layer Two economies as like a primary monetary asset is uh that's going to be a source of demand a very like inductive source of demand as well and it'll form a lot of the the basic total locked value inside of these ecosystems too so I said man case right there anything else you want to say I mean overall like pretty bullish we're gonna burn more eth uh staking rates are going to be about the same maybe positively impacted maybe a little negatively but call it a wash the same but the demand for ether as an asset is going to be massive in all of these layered to economies and if they are successful which we think they will be in these economies in Layer Two grow that will just massively increase the amount of of demand for a monetary asset like ether inside of their economies just to add on to the bridge aspect of things like Bridges demand ether because you have to hop from arbitrum to optimism to the L1 and so they need to hold ether but then they also need to hold stable coins and so there's also going to be stable coin Demand by uh by these Bridges and these layer twos and one of uh one of our friends Jim Bianco he's always expressed bullishness as to if we want the next leg up in crypto prices it needs to come from on-chain stable coin liquidity so stay coin Supply needs to go up in order for D5 to really have its next moment and when we have yields coming from all these Bridge mechanisms where you know people you can get onto optimism or Arboretum instantaneously but getting off takes seven days and so our there's these Bridges like connects like hop uh like li-fi that have all of these all of these uh deposits into their bridges that allow people to hop in and out of these layer twos instantaneously and so they also create a lot of stablecoin demand and stablecoin liquidity some in the form of usdc of course but also if I'm in the form of dye and other decentralized stable coins and those stable coins ultimately have ether as reservation demand somewhere else and so as stable coin Supply goes up because of the liquidity needed for Bridges and also other generalized D5 use cases the demand for ether goes up because these decentralized stable coins like fracks and die use ether as collateral behind them and so this is just one example of like the immense amount of surface area that comes with layer twos that will ultimately settle back down to kneading ether in people's pockets so guys if you're playing your drink drinking game you're looking for opportunity number one all right we did we just said it opportunity number one is ether the asset okay the fundamentals it always is it always is like the economics for ether the asset in an L2 uh world could not be stronger I have no I I just don't even understand why people think that ltus are going to be negative for the price of eth it makes absolutely no sense to me uh at least on any long-term scale there might be some attention premium that L2 tokens get in like the short run right really excited about optimism token arbitrum token whatever other layer 2 token we're going to sell our eat for these things that might happen in the short term but you could see the gravitational pull and force of ether as an asset fundamentals are only going to get stronger all right guys that was all about ether and a layer 2 world and the economics of layer twos as a result was fees in the second half of the show there's also the narrative trade we know that crypto runs on narratives we know that crypto runs on attention what happens when we start doing liquidity Mining and token incentives with these layer 2 tokens what happens when the same growth that happened with the liquidity mining for all layer ones starts to happen to layer twos is that going to create just the layer 2 season is that the layer 2 narrative game that is coming up there's plenty of evidence to suggest that layer 2 season is around the corner it's easier to spin up layer twos than it is to layer ones and so what that will create just a Cambrian explosion of layer twos that's the thesis so we're going to get to that part of the show right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors

and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of the Cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrum or Boba Networks maker Dao is the OG D5 protocol the maker Dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker Vault and use your collateral to Mint die directly with maker the power to Mint new money is in your hands the maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced Dows in existence they've been here since the beginning they've seen it all and so you can mint die with the assurance that your collateral is safe soon maker will be present on all chains and l2s so minting dye can take place on oasis.app xerion zapper or any other D5 protocol that you use follow maker on Twitter at maker Dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence uh let's talk a little bit about maybe the second opportunity right if those are the fundamentals for this network there's also I feel like a a narrative opportunity right and so we talk about so so much on Bank lists like decide which type of investor you are are you a fundamentals investor are you a narrative investor are you a Trader and bank that's always excuse more towards the fundamentals uh definitely not on the trading side but there's also some narrative plays that are kind of fun and I think Layer Two season is going to be a narrative David can you make the case for Layer Two season is this going to be like the the alt one layer like the alt one explosion that we saw uh previous summer and summer 2021. Ryan I can certainly make the case for later I knew you'd come through so the the first thing that I'd say is that it is trivially easy to spin up a new layer too in contrast with a brand new entire blockchain and that's because of how layer twos already have a very difficult problem already solved for them out of the box which is blockchain security you do not need to securely your layer 2 if you just settle down into the ethereum layer one ethereum the security components of ethereum which is highly optimized for and it's the most secure blockchain in the world you can just borrow from ethereum security while you create your layer 2. that's the whole point of a layer two is that you can have scale without sacrificing security and so by reducing the barriers to spinning up a layer 2 you are naturally going to induce more and more layer twos to work to be spun up and we saw how many layer ones got spun up in 2021 Avalanche Solana Phantom dfinity all of these layer ones and some of them got started in 2020 but they really hit their moment in 2021 and all of this came from the the demand for Block space that the ethereum layer 1 couldn't satisfy and so all these layer ones got spun up but that's hard mode like spinning up a whole entire entire new blockchain is hard mode where in contrast speeding up a layer two you can actually just Fork optimism you can just Fork arbitrum their code is available to you and so spinning up a layer two is trivially easy and the best part about this is that as soon as your layer 2 has any ounce of demand for the block space it becomes cash flow positive which is something that all the alternative layer ones are so far away from okay so why let's but like why is a cash flow positive I think this is a really important point the economics of layer twos are just too too good why right because they don't have to pay for security right okay right right so like does Oregon have its own military like it has it has its police force it's got that but like no it just outsources all of its military to the United States which is a way better military like the budget of for the U.S military don't talk organ David I'm sure they can muster something yeah they got they got something right but like the United States military has like stealth bombers that we don't even know about and this is the same metaphor for layer twos where no you don't need to fund your own security mechanisms you don't need to pay for security there is no issuance of the optimism token every time a new optimism block is produced and the reason for this is because they just settle their blocks onto ethereum and all of a sudden the defense of ether in proof of stake ethereum becomes a Defense Force for optimism so there is no new but there's no security budget for optimism because it hooks into the ethereum layer one the ethereum layer one pays Security on optimism's behalf on arbitrum's behalf and so that creates like there's no net new issuance there's no inflation in the actual token as a result of security that is a problem that every single other layer one blockchain has to contend with Solana is inflating at nine percent Avalanche is inflating at 5.5 percent uh other layer ones are inflating above 10 percent ethereum layer twos they inflate at a rate that is chosen by them just for basic incentives I think optimism is inflating at two percent but that's they opted into that they'd actually can turn that off at any moment yeah and that two percent goes to what we'll talk about later public goods it goes to the actual Improvement of the optimism ecosystem and all of the other uh ethereum layer twos just to put some numbers on this I know we've talked about this before on various podcasts but just you know it's worth repeating okay this is the security budget the chains are actually paying it's a number that like I don't know why more people don't talk about um Bitcoin pays 36 million dollars per day in security in the form of block rewards issuance new Bitcoin being issued to its Defense Force which is Bitcoin miners ethereum pays 37 million dollars in security issued an eth by the way post merge that's going to drop all the way down right four percent yeah it and so that's going to drop from 4.13 to probably around one percent and then when you subtract the burn that's where you get into deflationary ultrasound money territory where we got negative you know two percent issuance or something like this Solana pays 8.5 million dollars per day almost as much as ethereum like a quarter of ethereum's Defense budget okay Avalanche pays 3.7 million dollars okay so they're all paying a lot for security and this is the amount of Revenue that they're generating for that security ethereum is almost generating all it's actually it's oh so it paid uh it pays 37 million dollars at least in these figures and then it made 46 million dollars in in Block space sales so it's actually net positive which is one of the few times in history I've actually seen ethereum or any change yeah yeah and and so net positive but look at if you scroll down to uh I gotta find it Solana 46 000 per day so it's spending eight million listen this guys it's spending eight million dollars per day and it's selling it's making in terms of tax revenue tax costs 8.6 million tax revenue forty six thousand dollars okay there's a difference in company Ryan there's a deficit there right bearish government would you buy those bonds because that's what you're buying with the sole token you're effectively buying bonds that secure that so uh and now you know supporters of all of these all one ecosystems will say well these transaction fees this block space demand will increase over time I'm like yes okay maybe and if they do they'll no longer be cheap right all right so where's your competitive Advantage uh Avalanche paying six hundred thousand dollars per day right so also uh or actually making 600 000 per day so also at a deficit although I have seen to be fair to Avalanche I have seen them start to produce more and more block space sales so that is a good sign for the Avalanche Network it's still nowhere near where it needs to be in order to to be uh net positive but okay all that aside what you actually said what David actually said here guys is layer twos don't have to pay any issuance all right it comes free they're organ okay they're not like they're not paying for their own military it's like a small percentage based on what they use it's like a excite it's like a Usage Tax excise tax is paid to the ethereum network in terms of block space sales no issuance fee so none of these Layer Two tokens actually have to issue create more supply of their token to the market so like they have ultrasound money assets if you will like deflationary assets if you will if they want to from day one effectively and what we're saying is that is a killer economic Advantage right and this is what you get when you align with the ethereum protocol when your if protocol decides to use ethereum for security you don't you don't have any costs because ethereum just protects you on its behalf and all you have to do is pay the small taxes to the ethereum L1 that that enables it to secure your transactions in the first place so a hundred percent pure Revenue as soon as you can create any sort of demand for your block space on the layer two you're in the green you're in the green and so Ryan like we saw a lot of these alt layer one ecosystems really get bootstrapped by VC funding what do you think happens when the optimism token starts trading in a few weeks and then the arbitrum token comes out and like like you're seeing like five billion dollar market cap plus like that's going to generate a ton of incentive for the same sort of thing to be created around layer twos except again it's just the economics are going to be much more sustainable and so there is I what I think is happening is on the horizon there is just this insane layer 2 Mania when so many people wrap their heads around how easy it is to create a layer two how instantly cash flow positive it is and how much surface their area that surface area there is to spin up new ones like I think we're on the cusp of what we're always been calling Layer Two summer we just don't know which summer let me let me show you guys the graph so the thing we've been missing I think is uh layer layer twos that have been able to actually sustain this this this traffic and volume and like the layer two is like optimism and arbitrum up to this point and even now still they've still had their Governors on they've been in this very slow rollout phase right but the big thing we've been missing is once those governors are removed is tokens and I this is Avalanche if you recall last summer but they did is they launched an incentive program for defy to uh essentially like giving people avax tokens in order to use defy on Avalanche I want to show you this you can't see the date but the date is August 18th it's hit August 18th August 18th there you go August 18th 2021. I see if you would spot on this chart David where is August 18th on this on this chart Avalanche Total Lock to Value oh it's uh let's see it's right there where the line is Ryan where it just starts going up and to the right the tvl on Avalanche just is nothing and then August 18th it starts going up into the right and so Avalanche 13 million in tvl on August 18th to just a few months later it was 13 billion dollars before the end of the year and tvl of course stands for like total locked values those amount of assets on the Avalanche Network right totally and so you you saw multiple orders of magnitude going from 300 million to 13 billion in like four or five months as soon as there was any sort of like Avalanche liquidity mining in program uh granted again there was a lot of pent-up demand for this block space and so Avalanche was at the right right time at the right place and so there was a lot of demand for Avalanche black space in of itself they just needed something to get them kick-started during that same time frame without any growth arbitrum went from uh 300 excuse me arbitrum went from 30 million to 2.5 billion in the same time frame so like well done arbitrum in that same time frame without any liquidity incentives it went from 30 million dollars to to uh 2.5 billion in that same time frame and wear it to and now it's at 3.4 billion before any liquidity mining incentives optimism went from 70 million to 400 million in that same time frame again without any liquidity incentive so what happens when these liquidity incentives turn on and there is a direct secure economic cryptographic bridge to the ethereum layer one so porting your money over to optimism or arbitrum is so trivially easy versus having to spend up a whole entire new blockchain so there's this massive economy just waiting for these incentives and now with optimism's token getting getting launched they haven't launched any liquidity mining details but maybe they will um Arbitron perhaps the same as soon as this kicks into gear like you're going to see just an absolute migration onto layer twos which is why we are saying go go check out the houses go check out the roads check out the schools but get ahead of the crowd because as soon as the crowd moves like you want to have that real estate before the crowd moves there yeah and I think what's crazy David is uh if you look at all of the United chains of ethereum we get to a figure that's about six billion dollars and that's pre-token incentive and so what we're saying here is there's not only a fundamentals play but there's also a narrative play as soon as these layer twos start to uh to issue tokens they're already competitive with alternative layer ones when when you compare you know total value locked and you compare like the amount of Revenue that they're actually generating like the amount of Revenue that arbitrim is generating it's generating like double the amount of Solana and so is optimism in terms of block space sales revenue okay it's already generating double what's the thing it's missing tokens token incentive narrative like these things that uh for some reason haven't haven't quite caught up to the fundamentals yet but that's the case that's what we think is coming and I don't know David if if you want to put any timeline predictions on this of like when it's going to happen like it's really hard to say whether this is going to happen in June in July like what other factors are at play but what we're seeing here is just all of this raw kindling this Tinder that all it takes is some ignition maybe some um influencer maybe three hours Capital like apes into a token or something like that and and sets off this this frenzy and then you have the narrative if in full effect and you have L2 season has begun basically I will say there is going to be one big difference between the liquidity mining incentives of other chains versus what operatrum and optimism is doing liquidity mining is a short-term game you are basically paying for people's attention you're paying for their tvl and So eventually that runs out it's a great way to get attention it's a great way to get mind share on your application because like when you pay like I don't know 5 10 50 million dollars a day in liquidity mining incentives like you're going to get attention and people are going to fight for that um are like famously optimism is a very long-term thinking organization uh and same same with arbitrum as well and so they are very cognizant of how liquidity mining is a short-term game so they might not be as aggressive with their liquidity mining incentives as other alt layer ones were because they are thinking for the longest term possible um so there is a cultural difference I think between these layer 2 teams versus these layer 1 teams that are different with that is going to create a difference in my mind with all layer 1 summer of 2021 versus the coming layer 2 summer but we do know that they have tokens that they need to distribute in a fair and Equitable and decentralized Manner and as users you can compete and fight for those tokens if you want them and you can get your hands on them if you do the things that the protocols want you to do yeah to be determined so so optimism and arbitrine may be their longer term thinking but here's what's going to happen right we're going to have a whole bunch of alt layer twos yeah and these will be Forks of optimism and arbitrum and you know any of any of the ZK roll-up chains that that can be forked will be forked certainly and uh more short-term thinking project Founders will spin these things up and you know some would argue already have to some extent are already creeping down down that lane and then we'll we'll still see a frenzy right it's like as soon as the narrative takes hold I expect a whole lot of frenzy maybe not from the ogs but certainly from the new crowd who wants to capitalize this on this narrative that's what we've seen with everything encrypted in the past all right guys so that that was the bull case those are two opportunities for you in the LT world the L2 Paradigm uh David I think we should just summarize this and then um we should get to a part two episode because uh we're going a little bit long here and I think this is going to require two parts to get everything we want said uh so give us the summary of what we talked about and let's um let's give a precursor to what we're going to cover in the next episode in part two and when that's coming out yeah yeah just running through it again uh layer twos they will borrow some economic activity from the layer ones and they will put it on the layer twos but they will in aggregate create way newer brand new use cases brand new economic activity on the layer twos which will ultimately come down to settle on the ethereum layer ones layer ones block space will be consumed primarily by these blockchains and ethereum will over time become a blockchain that settles the blocks of other blockchains and so layer 1 fees are up only meanwhile we have so many paths forward for layer twos to reduce their layer 2 fees there's optimizations at the layer 2 level Innovations at the layer 2 protocols themselves there's ethereum eips like 4488 and also dank sharding as well uh and and there's and and so Layer Two fees are down only while layer 1 fees are up only this increases the eth burn rate this increases how ultrasound the ultrasound money actually is Bridges the cross chain Bridges will create reservation demand they will create yield opportunities both in ether terms and in dollar terms and the growth potential for both the growth of the layer twos themselves and the quantity of layer twos is just off the actual charts and then soon as liquidity mining incentives get kicked in uh man it's Layer Two Season baby and it's just right around the corner yeah absolutely what we're saying the big opportunity for Ethier I think with Layer Two uh the Advent of layer 2 use and the fundamentals look strong and then there's a narrative opportunity with Layer Two season coming up as well so that was only half of the layer two bull case I think there's uh even more to cover David we're talking about a massive public goods opportunity a secret trillion dollar opportunity what are we going to cover in the next episode when's that coming out oh yeah right well first off it's coming out tomorrow so stay tuned uh but Ryan there is this opportunity with with layer twos that no one is talking about we just covered all of the basics The Ether economics The Tokens The Bridges people know about those things there is a massive opportunity that no one knows about that is unlocking this new domain of crypto that has never been seen before like I like Green Pastures untouched snow and it's massive Ryan uh and it's about the combination of like Silicon Valley Web 2 startup incentives but with public goods as the product crypto and ethereum is here to do one thing which is to solve human coordination and what we are doing on the layer 2 ecosystem with block space rewards and what we are calling retroactive public goods funding it's putting the startup potential the upside Equity of something like Facebook or Twitter or something massive but we are putting out where the product is public goods and there Ryan with all of these layer 2 block space sales that turns into billions and billions of dollars of monthly Revenue that can go into the hands of entrepreneurs Building Products that have never been seen before on the face of this Earth it's something that I am extremely bullish on and I'm making a call to action to the bankless nation to get ahead of the curve because the amount of opportunity that awaits in the layer 2 Innovation field be with this mechanism which we are going to describe in part two is absolutely massive never before be seen products coming from never before seen funding mechanisms and I want the bankless nation ahead of the curve here so guys you will have to wait until tomorrow we're recording this episode in two parts that'll
