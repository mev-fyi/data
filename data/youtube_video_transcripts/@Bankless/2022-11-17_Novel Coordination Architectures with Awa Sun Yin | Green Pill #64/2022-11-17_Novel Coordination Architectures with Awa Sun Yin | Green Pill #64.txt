foreign [Music] ation looks good on the Pod today I have a very special episode with my friend AWA the co-founder of anoma what is a Noma and why does it matter anoma is a application a decentralized application architecture that allows for complex applications to be built with fundamentally New Primitives so basically the fundamental Atomic unit of anoma is the intent which is basically something you want to do a financial transfer that you want to do I want to turn a token X into token y I want to send tokens to person X I want to trade an nft for tokens um or I want to say hey fund a quadratic funding ground so you bought broadcast an intent which is basically like a Json blob and multiple users can create their multiple intents and then there's this gossip layer where there's an agent called a solver that goes around and collapses the intents together into outcomes that are um collapsed on chain so basically why why is this a fundamentally new architecture for building decentralized applications but now the gossip layer provides a way of doing counterparty Discovery that's totally decentralized and scalable so we talk in this episode about not just like what would it look like to build a DEX on top of a Noma where the counterparty discovery is decentralized using enoma's gossip layer but also nft marketplaces quadratic funding on top of a Noma L2 sequencers just the general design space of decentralized coordination and this is a really interesting episode for me because I believe that the more money Legos there are for creating decentralized coordination the more we can solve coordination failures solve multiple or traps create a more regenerative crypto economic world I just really feel this this this this thesis coming together that the more money Legos there are for regen crypto the more we can make crypto regenerative the more we can regenerate the world with crypto and you know like bitcoin's new grants protocol is kind of this money Lego that allows any Dow to use quadratic funding in their ecosystem anoma is kind of a new decentralized architecture that makes it easier to do decentralized coordination and a lot of these coordination failures are multi-polar traps or multi-agent systems that require better tools for decentralized coordination if we're going to build the apps that are going to that are gonna they're gonna solve this space so and anyway a little preview of the episode there for you I was just so uh Technical and Brilliant and I'm a big fan of a noma's architecture if you've been attending shelling point or been a part of the regen web3 movement then maybe you've heard of them but if this is your first time I think you're kind of in for a treat because it breaks my brain to think about the way a Noma has architected things in the way that that could complement a whole ecosystem of regenerative crypto economic projects do you know any regenerative crypto economics projects and on uh so it's all coordination it always has been andoma is a new tool for coordination and I'm really excited to give you this episode of with the enoma team enjoy working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful

other for a little while and you've kind of pulled me aside and told me about what you're working on I think it's really exciting so looking forward to unpacking it this episode so with that is my tee off I will ask you what is a Noma so anoma and we go straight to the point right um so tldr phonoma is um it is a third generation of how you can architect blockchains and it is um architecturally something that allows you to build all these modern applications that you see for example nft marketplaces Bitcoin quality funding rounds all these complex applications um that require kind of party Discovery and solving so it allows us to build all this uh applications but without requiring any centralization point in any of the components that would be one part of it but another advantage of this architecture is that it does expose a bunch of Novel Primitives and it allows you to build applications that you will have a really really hard time in some cases it would be impossible to build on some of the existing um programmable settlement architectures got it so um it sounds like you're building a new coordination architecture that kind of gives New Primitives that are just kind of elegant for a more decentralized World namely I mean counterparty Discovery being baked into the protocol I think is really interesting so could we dig a little bit deeper yeah I think we're on public goods funding and quadratic voting and plural money they have been I've been reading a lot um all the Publications from the radical exchange group and I'm really excited about it because right these are the kinds of ideas and applications that benefit from animal architecture the most and this is primarily because um the key if you need to remember one thing about anoma is that the fundamental unit in the normal architecture it is not a transaction like a finalized thing that can be settled on chain it is the intense and the intent is basically a description of an individual's uh desired end state so the users do not Define like I this is my code stack of smart contracts so you just don't Define like um I want to send um I want to trade one Bitcoin for it but they want what they actually signing off is the end state that they're okay with it um and whims to start with the intense centricity of this architecture um you can actually include way more information in the user intents um imagine something like where you are no longer compressing any more things into like um transactions but where you are for example um that's a really good example for this would be a ballot for a quadratic funding of voting um where you where the user with with the beauty of um this mechanism is that you're not voting yes or no or this or that you're voting this is my list of preferred projects that I want to funds and based on how much you want to allocate for my total budget I'm actually expressing a more complex set of of the values what's the next step after an intent is broadcast is there someone that settles settles that like finds does the counterparty discovery and then settles that to an actual layer one chain transaction yeah so um actually what happens when you when the users multiple users create different intents and then they might uh that might in the end uh be part of a uh of an application but um what happens is that the intense get gossiped around in what we call the intake gossip layer disappeared peer Network that is not consensus relevant and um any peer can be a gossip node and you can like gossip it around you can choose specific Network kids platers where you think your intent is more relevant for um this is all up to the user and up to the customer operators so this creates a kind of a set that is um you won't have a global view of all the available intents but they all are floating around waiting to be settled and remember intents cannot be set up by themselves because they describe what the end state is but they do not describe they cannot be they're not finalized transactions so they cannot be settled per se um so at the cost of layer they are there is a group of Asians what we call them we call them solvers and solvers are a crucial um kind of network Asians where they have been sended to monitor the intent gossip layer and then try to figure out which intents can be combined in a way that they satisfy each other so just to give you like a brief exam it goes more a simple example to follow through how the astronomics work um think of an intent where you want to swap um if for Bitcoin and I'm just using this as an example but in reality intents can be arbitrary values can be even arbitrary code um it's just like the swapping is easy to for people to grasp um the intent actually says I'm okay with the end state where I have minus one Bitcoin as long as I have plus a thousand eight this is everything that in him says right right this goes into the gossip layer and then the solvers look at this and then they also try to find like okay there's actually two other intents that indirectly um uh can be uh combined into a valid transaction that can be found actually settled um this might be the case for a simple uh swap but they might also be the case where a solver ends up combining up to hundreds of thousands of intents and then in the end um they all all those intents are gathered and they crafted um a transaction that is valid and satisfies that the intents of thousands of individuals so the solver a convenient combined with user intents the intend gospel player and activity of the solver is what enables the centralized counterpartic Discovery and distributed solving and at the end of the solvers activities what you end up with is a transaction that can be settled on chain and afterwards it follows um Costa Demento and then follows circumstances right okay um so I mean I think that you know this is quite a novel architecture in that it's got this intent gossip layer which isn't it has to have to do with con consensus but it's almost like you've kind of got this um Marketplace in which different agents can broadcast intents and then there can kind of be like mini marketplaces where you have different types of solvers that specialize in collapsing different types of intents and you can start with applications that we already know that are good for blockchains like trading one token for another or one nft for or for tokens um but we could also do more complicated multi-agent and maybe hundreds of agent type of intent solving applications am I saying that back to you right yes we actually got the high level idea really correctly as in for example even when it comes to uh fungible and nft start trading that you such such thing as like an order book you don't even need that like when you're creating 10 you're kind of like creating an on-demand order before whatever it is that you want to trade that's like one characteristic that is really flexible from the user side and there is no need for it because the protocol doesn't understand what a trade is or where the NASA is and there's no need for the protocol to understand that um and then coming to an example of uh that you mentioned multiple agents was like just two parties in the end situated or something like that um imagine something like and this is the early stage I kind of want you guys to think about the framework first and get that and then from and then next time we can jam about like some cool applications that we could build with that but even an application like git coin it's already multiple Asians right um the credit defining Realms has at least three kinds of Agents ones are the grams so the projects I want to see profoundly then we have the funding partners that will be funding the matching posts and you have the contributors yeah even it's more complicated you for example with the matching pole funders Partners they have like giving categories they own right yeah like so it should have just started a decks back in the day uh but yes quadratic funding is powerful um yeah sorry continue yeah so um I'd actually remember that you mentioned me one of your first episodes in this podcast that um one problem with the Bitcoin team is that you actually have to do tons of compute so like and that um with the finalists list the payments based on the matching poll and the contributions to individuals like you end up with this massive um end-to-end dimensional Matrix so you have to solve right and um that can make me that actually is a very interesting thing because in Anonymous model an interesting idea would be that um Bitcoin would not have to become this party that um uh kind of like allows or can it becomes this kind of like facilitator for projects or individuals or our funding Partners instead all of that could be autonomous and then this model what Bitcoin will specialize in which is incredibly hard and at the moment you there is no formal market for it is solving for qf rounds which is what you guys are already doing and you're developing extremely hard code to like try to like produces compute and solve like the final key of round yeah totally it kind of like it would it would turn Bitcoin and or or maybe like whoever arranges the quadratic funding matching pool um into just an intent that's broadcast and then get coin becomes maybe the first solver on the network and maybe is this a marketing layer in order to facilitate people to broadcast to those intent but we no longer have to run this yeah the interesting thing exactly so the interesting thing is would be that basically all those agents will be issuing their own intents into this peer-to-peer system and there will be some kind of like um um the commission kind of identifier that allows you to tell okay all this intents are related to the next key gr round and but get coins Broadband would no longer be this one that um like facilitates or uh like kind of enables people to participate or not Bitcoin which is the friend that would just be visualizing what's going on in the peer-to-peer layer so there's a lot more permission on maps and on the other hand you could formalize it in a way where you say for example okay we have Bitcoin that is operating this incredibly complex but specialized solver for qf Realms uh there's a ton of compute and specialized software that we have to write to make this efficient um if you want to use us then you can even like um you can even request or give the option for the different participants in the network to fund the solving of Bitcoin so for example intents could include a small fee that gets in the end um paid out to bitcoin the git consolver if the Efron was actually you settled right okay so instead of so Grant's protocol is about to launch which is the new decentralized version of get coin grants I I'm told I only have public information about this talk to what I've seen on the get coinblog but basically instead of having a state machine where everyone adds their transactions to a Smart contract and then uh someone goes in and when the round end turns that into a qf matching output which is very computationally intensive and then everyone can claim their payouts you would have in the inoma style architecture you would have people broadcasting intents but are they intense just like I'm picturing in my mind as like just like a Json blob like yeah like I will give one one uh die to Project X on the condition that I get at least 25 matching for it you can do something like that yes yeah I'm just making up a very Sky level architecture here but um and then there's also matching uh pool contributions where people say I will contribute 25k 50k to this matching pool there's intensive what goes in a matching pool that's maybe signed by Bitcoin or maybe we could further decentralize that and then at the end of the round basically all of the intensor kind of capture the 700 000 contributions per quarter so I don't know if we would if there would be like a rolling solver that would have them or if they would all be solved at the end of the round once we have all the data on the table there's a lot of books ability yeah would be able to choose how you handle that got it so instead of a state machine basically on the smart contract you have this intent gossip layer that is sort of the Fertile ground on upon which this happens and and um I know my State machine is quite unique it utilized on a different design for smart contracts what we call validity predicates this is uh the difference is that um we up we maximize the verification on chain but the computation and execution um is as often as possible and um this is what makes it also um it's more efficient with for example parallel execution but um what would happen then is that once the git consoler submits this transaction that finalizes this round um all the payouts get triggered fully on chain all the intents get fully settled and there is no further involvement uh from any of the teams um I want to take a step back and just say out loud why I find this architecture really elegant um and and I want to get your reaction to that so uh I know that I'm associated with this this meme about coordination and how it's all coordination and I believe that fundamentally that web3 is going to enable new systems of collective intelligence in which multi-agent systems can come together and uh create outcomes that are greater than the sum of their parts in them and I believe that web 3 is a new primitive or we can now transfer Financial value and so and we can do decentralized governance over these systems so we can build things that are buy of and for the people with web3 that's like point one of why I'm just excited about the whole space but building upon that there's this category of things that are called coordination failures um and they're also called uh multi-polar traps and an example of a multi-polar trap is um is basically like oh I like open I like open source software it's uh it creates 400 billion dollars per year in economic value and anytime I need to build a new website I just do it with open source I download nginx as my web server I guess postgres has my database server um or actually a set of decentralized examples of this the graph uh and eve.limo are these open source tools and um but part of the problem is that I get those tools for free and so there's no incentive for me to pay the maintainers of those tools and that's the first poll of What's called the multi-polar Trap problem which is basically there's no incentive for the system to regenerate itself because the open source is available for free online but the second poll of the multi-polar Trap is that if everyone free rides on open source software or any public good but I'm just using open source because that's you know where Bitcoin started and where I started in this space um the first poll is why I'm getting this for free why would I pay for it and then the second poll is if enough agents free ride on it then that causes maintainer burnout people quit their jobs on open source and they go work for like JP Morgan or something like that um and that's the second poll of the multi-polar Trap which is basically like the system collapses because there's a lack of incentive and then you're in this place where like open source software is unsecure under maintained underfunded and and that's how you get to the multi-polar Trap where open source can simultaneously be creating 400 billion dollars per year in economic value and also there's no way to coordinate outcomes of it and because I it feels like a Noma is an architecture for me for solving multi-polar traps where I can say conditionally like okay I don't really want to pay for this but I also don't want it to collapse I'll broadcast an intent where if other agents agree to support this system then um we can all do it do it together and anoma feels like an architecture for me for solving multi-polar traps how does that feel to you you're gonna make a kofunda Christopher really happy when he listens to this episode if he um we have a vision paper that talks about this and actually the initial paper of anoma did speak a lot of our coordination problems and multiple of traps specifically and we were like the entire background story was that we're trying to pursue uh the design and of actually the serious creation of infrastructure that allow people to coordinate we can avoid looking at existing architectures and like settlement would not be enough and that kind of inspired us to come with exercise architecture that is not only flexible from an end to end in a decentralized fashion but also where the intents allow you to express in like what you usually you want the outcomes that you want in a way more complex Manner and it would allow you to create this mechanisms that could solve with the polar traps as you have described got it um so have you all iterated away from that sort of framing as the white paper has evolved is is that still a part of the vision it is still pretty Vision division papers still on a website um the the new white paper that we have been uh sharing with people at the conference list maybe you got a physical copy that new white paper is just a little bit more focused into the architectural efficiencies in the in the industry so it does talk more about um ifanoma we're live tomorrow what it is so you can fully decentralize or applications will benefit the most and why a new applications you can build but that is just to um just because the framework is so different from what we all used to like ever since we are right now at the stage where Simmons when vitalik was trying to explain ethereum so all people who were used to cryptocurrency protocols and scriptable settlement like at that time I just can't imagine how much how challenging it was like so to to tell people who all they knew about were hit the Bitcoin and color coins most or like the construction change um and then Vitality came I kind of was to say like you can do something that's a lot more expressive at the same layer and so the challenge that we had in the past year and why we kind of changed the way we're communicating about anoma is the case we realized that our long-term goals were a little bit far out so like you guys are showing a few groups that's like to think about coordination failure and coordination problems multiple of traps like I was incredibly excited to run it to you guys in Denver Sean Point um but still still I think when you want to get people's understanding of how powerful that is we kind of want to focus in the short term in some of these applications you can build just to get people used to different work and there's architecture so they can start later on thinking about okay there's a lot more yet to be built that we today don't know which other applications that could be built with us yo well I mean just to speak to the this Market I mean I know I used in my example open source software but I've kind of been public goods build since I got into this space and I've learned about uh climate change and the funding of Journalism and basically all of our global national local public goods and digital public goods um are in some form composed in this multi-polar trap problem uh coordination failures public goods funding failures are multi-polar trap failures and that it just makes me exciting that excited that um you know when there tend to be money Legos in an area it means that there's being advancements made in solving some of these problems and uh I don't know that's that's why I know my first struck a chord with me is just wow the amount of important problems in the world that are multi-polar traps uh is very vast and they're also existential to humanity and and so I think that's what got me really excited about this direction when I first learned about you all yeah um and actually the discovery that we had was that while we're building those systems to bring more tools for coordination and more large-scale coordination for people we also realize the same infrastructure and the same properties that these protocol exposes are the ones that most modern and interesting

and the projects like when does when does it launch uh when can we start playing with applications that use it does it feel like adapt how like that kind of stuff yeah um so I would say like at the moment my first mission is to like tell more people about how we're thinking about anoma as like the protocol um and I'm what I I'm really focusing personally is and try to explore which applications we should build first as like examples similar to how ethereum will launched with three applications um we're looking at just picking three applications that currently exist as in for example I really hope to have um something like looks like fun job token trading and the marketplaceless but I kind of want to have something that is not defy and so I'm really excited to build for example Bitcoin as one of the example applications because this one is really complex right now already and it will benefit a lot from anoma um and then at the same time we're exploring a bunch of other novel applications at the moment thinking about um in the world of multivariant multivariable bartering as like you can barter anything if you can express it in an intense and there is no you just create your intended and see what happens later and it might be subtle might not be settled but you can barter with anything and um another thing that we're exploiting with is for example A multi-dimensional Dials so those that can handle more um on one hand also privacy so like composable privacy and having one application the ability to easily handle which parts transparent data and which parts of private data um this is like another advantage of enormous architecture that allows you to allows developers and users to reason through privacy in a very easy way um and there's just many other applications that we're just thinking about right now and that this right now we don't know which one is gonna be the ones that people like the most but we're gonna go for it is um by mid next year we're going to have a uh um attachment with those applications already live so um and then people will be able to play with them great um yeah well I mean I I can of course make interest to get calling people if you want to talk about uh building a quadratic funding application because I I almost think that um at the moment uh so actually we're chatting with the Bitcoin guys because it's not announcing and I was wondering how that's the new it can look like um but suddenly it is really important for a Norma to see teams like Bitcoin and a bunch of other teams that are doing research into interesting governance mechanisms interesting like forms of poor money these are all applications that at glance clearly benefits from from Aloma but it's also for us to kind of like make sure that um because it's new we kind of don't expect that people will be the ones that straight off will build on um the application so we'll be building directly the intent formats the validity predicates and provide the right SDK for solver in a way where um in the case Bitcoin the hardest part it would be which is the one that the computes the eqf results the heart we cannot write but at least we can provide it in a way where you can just use that code um and then directly operate a solver got it cool well yeah I mean I think that it'd be interesting to see the new decentralized modular uh ecosystem if uh of git grants protocol what the intersection of that is with Noma is there any sort of switching costs like say I'm using a d-app on ethereum today most of our audience is on ethereum but we also have people on Cosmos and Solana uh who listen I'm wondering if there's any sort of switching costs uh does Bitcoin grants on the new decentralized grants protocol feel just like a d-app that is on a Noma so architecturally the way we are thinking about anoma is we're building and deploying the global a year one but you can actually use the same globally one as a layer 1.5 if for example you want to keep the Encore on on ethereum which I think makes a lot of sense a big part of the community around Bitcoin is um cares a lot about ethereum there's no reason why it makes no sense why you have supports it um so the way you would use it that way is that you will get the kind of part of Discovery and distributed solving part in the end you're producing a transaction that is later on set on directly on ethereum so on one hand you get um the entire decentralization part until that but then you can still do the final payouts um using ethereum and some of this infrastructure has already been built for the other protocol which is Nevada um this is this uh trustless um two-way bridge that we have built and then anoma could also use this as like the bridge protocol for it got it so I would say like um there will be some ux straight UPS because um I normally layer one for adapt has an incredibly uh straightforward ux where we want to basically once you have created an intense it will be settled as it was described so this kind of declarative application declarative Paradigm for applications which in my mind I think is very important for if you want any all these applications to ever reach Mass adoption because otherwise the moment in order to use any of the steps or protocols securely or privately I need to understand so well then the line infrastructure the privacy and then everything how integrates with like the front ends with infrastructure so that's infusible um so the benefit of using anoma or billion Anonymous la1 is that you get this entire declarative uh Paradigm for your dad but if you um just wanted to decentralize specific component think of for example not just Bitcoin but also openc or the optimistic or secure relapse at the moment have centralized sequences then they could use the number stack to produce the final State translation for ethereum and then that will be passed through over the year the bridge got it okay so in my in my mind I've been thinking of this as mostly an application layer phenomena but you could actually compose parts of layer choose uh and which are more protocol level uh with this with this application with this architecture did I hear that right um it's more that you can really pick and choose which part it is that you wanna um the thing is that about normal is that it does offer things that no other um Solutions don't offer kind of product Discovery or distributor solving but anything any application that might need that part can still in the end choose where to finally settle right and this is like the layer one when F of 1.5 approach where uh you're not doing the final cinnamon but you are doing different ethereum you can even go a step further and say let's think of a world where ethereum um a really I think it was incredibly valuable because of the security model and you want to rent as much security from ethereum is validators as possible you can even deploy anoma as the layer 2 and ethereum where the entire execution um gets validated on ethereum as a chain [Music] got it um really can't wait to see what this ecosystem turns into and you know my whole theory on on one of my one of my sort of thinkings about regenerative crypto is that the more money Legos we have for doing regenerative crypto the more regenerative crypto will exist the more crypto regenerates the world and it's kind of this Domino's effect and and you know I think of like the quadratic funding protocol the Bitcoins building and you know other quadratic funding protocols as being core money Legos for salt for creating more coordination for creating more region stuff and it feels like a Noma for me is in that is in that category so can't wait to see what it looks like at maturity is there anything else within this design space of solving multi-polar traps that really excites you or any anything that I didn't ask that you want to say um I yeah we didn't get to touch Panama at all is that something that interests you or it should let's get into it okay so um we're actually working on two protocols one is anoma which is an entire architecture um it's for adapts but then they use this Auto protocol what do we call Nevada and the thing that you guys might find more interesting about namara is that we are thinking of privacy in this protocol as a public good and um so what the protocol does is very simple it if no matter what assets do you want to use as means of exchange so as tokens or entities or any kind of assets that has been originated on ethereum or any um fastenality enable chain um those you can use as money where you get the Privacy guarantees as the cash has so you enables full shield that transfers it even allows you to retrofit privacy even if it originating chain did not have uh privacy natively speaking um so it's a so the main purpose is to offer asset diagnostic privacy but um the other characteristic about how we're thinking about the protocol is um I think fundamentally so far we'll be thinking of our privacy as a future but it is more right to think about it as a public good because the future is useful as independently but privacy is not if only one person uses it because the limited sets are weak if they are there's not a lot of volume usage in there um so privacy by the Nevada protocol is regarded as a public good in the sense of um it is built in design in a way where you cannot exclude access it's not excludable and on the other hand it is clearly anti-rivers public good because more people use the should look set um and the contribute with different kinds of assets the stronger the priority guarantees every individual gets from it um so we are experimenting with a bunch of funding mechanisms so the protocol itself we fund the shielded set so if you use if you choose to use Shield transfers over transparent transfers the protocol will reward you with um with something and then it has also a its own governance mechanism that the person kind of um is a limited form of liquid democracy where you can select a public goods funding console that can allocate as well parts of the treasury to find different kinds of public goods that could be privacy but it could also be software Bitcoin art anything else yeah um it feels like a kind of core compliment to anoma to have this privacy preserving layer one uh technology next to it and it seems like it's gonna just allow an enoma to do more things in in more places but I think the Privacy thing is actually a really important one to drill in on because if we're broadcasting all of these intents to each other in what ways can we reveal the intent and enable a solver to solve them but also not reveal too much about ourselves and you know in poker if you broadcast your intent you're actually losing the game and so there's there's kind of like a a line that you have to walk there and I think it's great that you're building infrastructure for it yeah so actually I there's two points I want to remark related to namata um the way we're looking at the Mata and how it relates in the future of melanoma is more that it is an immediate step to get people in the decentralized world to be more used to some of the properties that we have recently unlocked such as the assets can freely move from the protocols through which they were originating and you can use them in different chains like namata to gain some features like privacy that you could not get in the originating chain so I think right now we have seen some protocols live in bridges but I think so far it's still in its infancy we haven't established a good president where people truly understand how a model chain in a crushing world looks like that's one thing and the other thing is privacy but um this what you mention now about intents and privacy it's actually uh right um so the I skipped this part but the state machine of fanoma is is um very unique in the way that it handles different kinds of privacy States so it handles transparent I know my issues wasn't but um for shielded anoma in privateinoma it depends like it deploys other kinds of cryptography to be able to still verify those kinds of intents and um this is true like at the moment with just transparent Aroma you will have the you will lose privacy even at the intent level because both The Who and the what of the intents will be fully readable change just like right now on any blockchain um but already with the with tiger the unified execution environment we can make at least the intense be shielded and shielded means that the who is kept fully private and celebrate ends and even the the what however has to be transparent because of the reason that you mentioned which is solvers need to be able to understand what the intent is in order to find which other intents can be combined but we are looking into making an intent fully fully private and at the moment we are designing tag in a way that is able to leverage some kind of homomorphic encryption so that um when you create an intent it's fully fully encrypted so nobody can read it you pass it along to another person the other person doesn't compute to them so that's it but um sadly the state of fhe is still a bit early and um we don't know how this right now seems to be the right direction so enable fully private intents but at the moment um it is not practical but there is a world so you like to have like fully private and online if you wanted to but I think the motion before we say we need privacy or we do not need privacy I think um the most exciting thing about anoma is that it approaches privacy from more developers perspective as in okay what do applications need and applications do not need versus like the Korean approach which is always transparent always private it's more to make it easier for applications to reason through what parts need to be private when and what parts would be public one mm-hmm yeah um it just feels like there's a whole world of cryptography and zero knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption that is going to be one positive externality of all the stuff that's going on in this space is the research into that that and I and I agree with what you said about privacy being a public good I think uh it's really foundational that y'all are building that into the infrastructure of anoma and the the projects you're working on is there anything else that you want to say that I didn't ask I'm just going to ask open any questions because I feel like you understand this design space way better than me if you know of more teams that are exploiting building all these interesting ideas and coordination mechanisms but they are definitely hitting some barriers constraints with the existing architectures I'll be really interested in just using them as source of inspiration um because for us when you build a protocol you are making the design decisions so that you can enable as much as possible even the things that we don't even know that people want to build um but being able to pick up some applications especially not just C5 applications even though we know people want to use them um I will I would really like to be able to pick more applications as examples that are more in the realm of uh better coordination mechanisms better public good scientific mechanisms and better Governors mechanisms or anything well it feels like you've built the the Legos and now it's a matter of evangelizing them and building an ecosystem around them and so if I'm a builder out there that's listening to the green pill pod maybe a regen Builder which is most of our audience where do we where do we go to to learn more about anoma and how to build on top of it so the first step is certainly to get used to this framework and stop thinking about this and you will be breaking your current understanding of how like the centralized applications work and this isn't necessary this is going to be necessary for a step um so the thing I recommend the most to read is the animal white paper it is a draft but it does actually talk about even git coin is an application I didn't finish this draft yet and I want to talk a little bit more about other applications but um if you just read the first pages of the white paper it will definitely give you the right framework from the get-go and um just stay tuned by looking at uh I just want to learn some Twitter and then once it is ready to import and showcase some of these applications that we were built um you can already start playing with it beautiful all right and where can people find you personally online on Twitter we'll have a link in your in the show notes here it's uh awasan Yin is your is your Twitter handle so we'll have a message on it cool all right well thanks so much for coming on the green pill pod really excited to see what what is built on a Noma and maybe we can have you back in a year or two and do a retrospective on all the things we learned and the cool stuff that's been built there yeah thanks for having me it was really fun you bet
