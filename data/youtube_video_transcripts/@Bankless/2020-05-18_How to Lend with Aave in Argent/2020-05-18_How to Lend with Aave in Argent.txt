hi everyone this is d5 dad i'm excited to show you how you can use ave in the new argent wallet upgrade so i'm going to click the button at the bottom center that says invest and then i'm going to choose ave at the very top then i'll just lend some eth in this case to earn interest on my ether i'm going to click the big orange button and then choose to put in one each so once i click invest that's it i'm not paying any transaction fees and this should settle in about 30 seconds or less now once once this settles you're going to see under the finances tab my ave eth so there we go it's already settled in a matter of a few seconds now that you can see how i've put money into the system let's pull my eth back out so i'm going to click on the ave eth and i'm going to choose to sell it back so i'm basically returning the interest earning ether the ave ether and i'm going to get back my one eth and we'll just watch this tab here under finances and eventually under this other token listing tab in the wallet you'll see that i have one ether again so what's magical about this is the fact that you know you would normally have to pay transaction fees and it normally takes about two transactions to at least put money into the system so anyways it saves you time and it saves you money and it makes it simpler here so it should show up here any moment there we go boom done all right hope you find this helpful
