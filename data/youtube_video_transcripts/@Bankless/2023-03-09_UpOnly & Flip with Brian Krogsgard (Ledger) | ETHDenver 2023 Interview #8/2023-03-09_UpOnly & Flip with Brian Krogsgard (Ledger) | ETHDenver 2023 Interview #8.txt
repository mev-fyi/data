[Music] thank you bang to this nation we got the last interview of the day here at the axelr interoperability Summit and this one was a surprise a very pleasant surprise it's not really going to be about interoperability we're talking to Ledger Ledger cast also known as Brian crosgard from up only from daily open under fellow content producer and a long friend I've had in the space we talk about his company flip which is all about nfts uh both being an nft Trader but also an NFC Community member at the same time and after we're done talking about flip we'll of course talk about up only and all the other content that ledger puts out but first before we get to that conversation with Ledger a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023. why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you're a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of D5 where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrum the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the eth layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrim is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview bagelization we're talking about somebody different today here at the XLR interoperability series we're talking about Brian crosgard you might know him as Ledger what's up Ledger uh not much how you doing did I just talk to you what did you tax me yeah no no all right I'm docs I live in Alabama keep going I was born in the 80s so I've been putting on my podcaster voice because I'm doing all the whole interviews but you're also a podcaster so I know you don't need it uh when people approach you at these things do they know you from Brian from Flipside or Brian from up only uh they don't know me as Brian at all that's a good point that's a good point uh are you that ledger guy yeah the one in the in the corner of the screen yeah the small the small little small screen yeah yeah so you're you like me well I actually no longer operate my own OBS I got Luca behind the camera operating my Ops and also Dave here nice uh you still do your OBS uh yeah when we record a show why do you put your own camera small and down in the corner uh it just kind of was organic from the very first show that we did because I was actually trying to help Kobe stream and interview a bit Lord right and which was random um and then like all these people from this like like cast of 2021 characters came on that and we had like seven or eight thousand people join that show live and that was episode zero and in it I was like I'm just kind of here so I made myself picture in picture and then it just fit after that plus I kind of like it I like being I we learned one thing in crypto don't be the main character right yeah I am never the main character so that works fine for me you are the you contribute a lot to the conversation man but no like look at Kobe Kobe can be that guy that guy can be the main character so what is it what is the status with up only uh up only is a podcast that records sometimes and whatever the hell you guys want yeah pretty much yeah yeah we have no obligations because I don't know if you know but our sponsor collapsed and turned out to be a fraud yeah the sponsor world has been different ever since then let me tell you yeah and honestly we've been uh kind of slow playing it just we'll be there when it matters sure sure is that like a news tagline welcome to up only TV we'll be there what it matters when you want us we'll be there for you yeah oh man okay so uh but you are here to be Flipside crypto ah no no not flip side Flip Flip not XYZ slip.xyz in the vast world of crypto company names there's a flip.xyz a Flipside crypto and I think there used to be another one that changed names that had flip in the name okay I think flip side might be my other buddy Wills project Swift flip side is like a very uh query driven developer sure data thingy okay well they're irrelevant tell me about thread that's right no they've seen like they're a cool project what is their name you should uh so we're flip and it's flip.xyz and we're a nft aggregation platform but we're kind of like if you take some of the best things from exchanges and aggregators and research platforms and slap it all together and it's a all-encompassing experience in one place and it's on desktop and mobile and it's damn good and not enough you know about it so you should go use it yeah so who is flip four flip is for the person that definitely has a wallet maybe has an nft but they don't necessarily treat nfts as altcoins with pictures okay um like I care about their nfts yeah they care about the nfcs they own like I'm you know pudgy penguin 965. um and I'm invested in this community and I'm going shopping for my nft I'm not just trading derivatives of nfts at the margins of floor prices okay so not not the NFC power traders that blur is going after yeah I think they're going after a different market and I think they've done a great job at that and getting liquidity in it we're we're going after people that kind of like if you think of it in a erc20 landscape like a swing Trader not somebody on five minute candles sure um and momentum trade yeah but it's like I always say this in in my own investing it's like okay well I'm gonna invest based on fundamentals and trade based on technicals and with my jpegs you know like I'm gonna pay attention to the price you know like if I buy something I could think it's the coolest thing ever but if I buy it for point one Ethan that goes to 10e I'm gonna be tempted to sell it so like the price does matter and a lot of platforms ignore price and metrics and Community Driven stuff and we have all of those interesting metrics but the Creator the community the art is still first and foremost okay so what can flip really do that other nft platforms don't really offer uh the big thing that literally nobody offers and we've had since day one is a native mobile app and what it's best at is being a notification Hub so I can follow your ens and if you flip uh you flip an nft anywhere so you trade something and sweep something I can get a notification and it's like hey David is aping checks right now sure and checks are 0.2 each and I'm like well David told me about Matic when it was 11 cents so like I better freaking get over there and sweep like 50 checks or something so okay so you get notifications of anything like that for all of my friends that I've told hey you should totally buy them at first they could set notifications that if I ever sell my MFR they could be like yo David what the no and they will yeah yeah I gave away so Charles Reed is a big crypto dick butt guy and now I've said crypto time I'm also a big crypto guy yeah no I've said that so he gave me one and I told him Charles I won't sell it and I did ask him though I was like hey can I give it away to somebody as part of a like a thing and he was like yeah that's fine so I transferred it to someone and melt them literally like the same day was like what have you done because she thought I sold it I was like melting I did not sell it do not kill me I'm so sorry she would too yeah I know I've hung out with Milton a couple times in New York within five minutes every time I'm meeting here we're talking about crypto dick bus yeah and now we are too and that's just how it is but if you're obsessed like you get those notifications it's directly in your feed so like all the wallets I follow all the collections I follow it's gonna tell you like uh out of standard deviation price movements it's gonna get tell you hey this person listed that if I'm following like I have this uh azuki that's like my favorite azuki it's got these background Firefly things and the guy finally listed it because and I knew because I was following it on flip and it's like hey it popped up on open C send me a notification and I'm like okay I like it but I don't like it for 16.90 sure so but you get all that information and by the way if you ever just want to share it it's the best single nft landing page in the world go try it for the nft newbies out there that need a good UI anybody like you know if you think of your sources of truth there's uh ether scan from a data perspective right open C except for open C is like no no other exchanges exist right ours is going to show the accuracy of etherscan and the trustworthiness of open C but it's also going to have like just a beautiful interface okay so when Melton did come and say yo why did you give away your dick butt which you usually did you get notified by a flip I hope she did I'm sure she did I'm sure she did she may just have like a direct brain connection with the she's like somebody gave away so it seems to be like really at the intersection of people who care about collections yeah but still play the trading game so all I really care about Cool Cats I'm willing to sell my cool cap but I'm also willing to buy another cool cat because I really like the Cool Cat system so it's like somebody like willing to play the financial game but still enjoys a collection at the same time yeah and I thought I find what most people do is like they actually they may have one thing they really care about um like I was talking to Luca from pudgy Penguins recently and I think it might be the only collection that I've never sold something from and I I didn't realize it but I like I think I'm a pudgy Maxie well I'm however in my pudgy bottoms bottom seller there you go I'm sorry yeah like point four or something about what people they may be a a pudgy Maxi but they're a cool cats enjoyer sure and so like they they actually see the monetary side of some stuff that they're not totally in love with but then they've got like their version of a Grail community and for that one it's not about the money but they you know they still want to keep track of everything they want to know the news they want to see what their portfolios were so we have like a portfolio evaluation tracker nice with multi-wallet we have taxes of course we do uh Ryan's gonna love that one all of a sudden Ryan's gonna love it me and Ryan are just gonna nerd out on the taxes so it actually will transition your cost basis between your multiple wallets so every wallet that you've connected to flip we can generate a report and send you your tax basis if you your harvesting if you're you know loss harvesting or or looking at like long-term gains it'll qualify that tell you what you've made um it's it's pretty dagged I'm cool man I'm sure a lot of 2021 nft Traders or 2022 nft Traders are now like oh I wish I had had that when I was 2021 yeah exactly yeah well now they're still doing it but they're like I cannot believe I lost fifty thousand dollars on a JPEG uh did you raise for flip like how is this whole thing raised in late 2021 was our seed rounds and that was led by distributed Global in chapter one and we'll probably be racing again this year um and we're in it for the long haul to build well uh and one other thing you mentioned earlier kind of some of the Hot Topics we're doing some stuff around like a royalties API right now okay because we think part of being catered to communities is to really Empower them it's to be opinionated but not necessarily political like we're not telling them hey here's what you should do with this royalties API right but you do deserve the information of like sure my community I want a token get my Discord based on whether they paid royalties or not you can do it cool and so that's one of the things where it's more of like creating tooling specific to those communities so we're trying to think pretty deeply about that side and get a bit opinionated um yeah so that's yeah I'm excited very very needed especially as uh other platforms are really just marginalizing everyone to have the the opt-in platform yeah and that's something that I think a lot of us saw coming for a long time is like the race to zero for fees and yeah um you know liquidity and nfts is good in a way um but I think like if you take something non-fungible and then just make it completely fungible you're not really you're kind of upending the original purpose and to me right like the ERC 721 spec is a deed or a title or a receipt for a thing it's like this thing right and I think that's still important and that's the future use case of nfts but derivatives platforms are still huge and they can like from a volume perspective they can trade at multiples of the spot platform right so it's not impossible for board eights to do a billion dollars worth of derivatives trading all right but like a hundred million dollars worth of spot trading of the underlying so who are you looking for uh in for flip what's your ideal customer and on the hiring side if you're hiring or BD relationship side who are you looking for to join the movement yeah what movement what do you guys call yourselves we say flip and then say go to flip.xyz cool but yeah ourselves flip we from a customer perspective we want people that are excited about nfts excited about the long-term future of nfts like there's more than even just the speculation side of nfts I'm really into experiential nfts so like hey I'm at this event and I'm I listen I didn't spend any money to be here sorry but let's say I spent a thousand dollars to be here the art or the nft is actually my receipt with a visual component but like I'm happy to have spent that thousand dollars I don't need long-term value from it but that nft can still be my token my access pass my like my you know the the various gated components that nfts can serve an interesting purpose for we want people that are excited about what that means what the community side of nfts unlocked uh and then from a business development perspective if you are one of these communities if you're building nfts if you're looking for better tools better places to send your community uh talk to me beautiful uh what is the future of content production tell me about the future of ledgercast up only and Ledger doing content yeah I still do content every week but more on the technical side of things uh weekly open and ledgercast but uh up only is still here I promise um we you know we talk a lot and we'll we'll get back to a more regular format pretty soon sure but we uh if something really big happens we'll pop on yeah I'm sure yeah I'm sure hopefully I could take a little bit more break before that happens yeah uh Ledger if there's anything else feel free you got an open mic but otherwise thank you for joining me I'm just happy to be here and man you all are doing great work it inspires me so I appreciate it well hey before I had Luke behind the camera and Dave behind uh on the Audio I had Ledger teaching me everything I know about OBS and so the crossfall nation goes back pretty far awesome good to see you cheers foreign
