foreign ation how's it going on the Pod today we have venkatesh Rao who's a writer and consultant has co-authored a paper called the unreasonable unreasonable sufficiency of protocols with Tim bako Danny Ryan Josh Stark Trent Ben Epps and uh and others uh Bastion oh I'm sorry if I mispronouncing your name Bastian and they have just announced the summer of protocols program which is basically a study that will uh it will be a program primarily virtual that will run from 18 weeks from May to August and it will set uh it'll fund a set of full-time researchers and affiliate part-time affiliate researchers to think broadly and creatively about protocols and when we're thinking about protocols here we are talking about things as small and as human as handshakes and eye contact up to Global coordination protocols public goods funding climate protocols nuclear launch protocols air traffic control to cpip DNA RNA so basically what we're doing here is taking a protocol Centric view of the world and studying protocols producing research about protocols so basically the goal of the program is to catalyze a conversation and experimentation with all different types of protocols cultural social political ones also technological ones and get the world thinking in a protocol first way to Foster what venkatesh calls protocol literacy so basically the idea here is that Protocols are under theorized and under tinkered with uh and and that they should be first class Concepts alongside things like institutions and Nations and platforms and structuring how we think about the world so what would have to be true for us to think about protocols as a way of advancing Humanity in in a similar way that institutions and Nations have so basically summer of protocol uh excuse me Summer protocol core researchers will be producing long-form writing about protocols over the summer and and and that's what summer of protocols is there is a link in the show notes to apply to some of our protocols to read the paper that venkatesh has written and this episode for me was just kind of a minding my a mind-expanding episode when thinking about human coordination in a protocol-centric world and it just makes me really exciting excited to talk to venkatesh about this because I feel like this is a core knowledge unlock for how we coordinate in the in the 21st century we're building a coordination that's why I always address y'all as coordination uh building a network stake of people who are coordinating and and I think that a protocol Centric mindset and studying the protocol-centric mindset and figuring how to create regenerative crypto economic protocols is a really key tool in the tool belt um and if not this is just a really fascinating episode with someone that I deeply respect and I think is really really smart so um I think that you're really going to enjoy this episode about summer protocols with venkatesh route working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical W-2

greenpill that's Gro dollar dot org slash green pill what's up Vega how you doing I am doing good how are you doing Kevin pretty good recovering from East Denver uh it was good to meet you IRL there absolutely yeah a lot of people I met them for the first time there yeah yeah awesome well I've been I've been following your work for a while and I'm really excited to see you getting deeper into the ethereum community maybe we'll start with what is the summer of protocols yeah so the summer of protocols it's a program we are about to kick off so the application processes are now open and applications are due by the 21st but it'll be uh a bunch of smart people just hanging out together in a Discord and on like you know live calls thinking about protocols in the broadest possible fence um and writing about them and tinkering with like speculative ideas about protocols so uh the way this came about is a few months ago Tim Baker reached out to me to ask if I just wanted to like spend some time thinking about uh protocols broadly myself and I gave a talk at uh Devcon in October which is well received and after that we started uh what we call the pilot study and the pilot study was all of us love ethereum and tinkering with it but uh we haven't really spent much time thinking about protocols in the abstract and generally how it relates to other kinds of protocols whether it's like you know older computer protocols or like social and cultural protocols for everything from like shaking hands to you know wedding ceremonies and also like protocols in the sense of the climate protocol called protocols in the sense of like diplomacy and we realized it was a very rich topic and we ourselves had gotten nerds sniped by it so this is a bunch of us it's including Tim Danny Ryan uh Trent um Josh uh Bastian a bunch of people from the EF and I talked to a bunch of others as well and we realized that anytime you sort of think about protocols in this broad sense uh you get nerds tonight because it's a really interesting broad topic and there is such a thing as a protocol's first way of viewing the world and we thought that was really interesting because today when you talk about the world you tend to do so in like you know nation state first ways or organization first ways and protocol first ways of thinking about the world we think are really rich so we did a pilot study and that came out um just now a draft study titled the unreasonable sufficiency of protocols and that's kind of the um we're using that to prime the pump for the summer of protocol so the hope is a bunch of smart people will read the paper get excited get nerd sniped and put in applications and we'll collect a bunch of them and have a very nice summer thinking and working uh around protocols so that's what some of this got it um so it sounds like you're interpreting protocols here broadly so we're not just talking about tcpip or the ethereum proof of stake protocol but also social protocols like handshakes and wedding ceremonies and things like that and uh sort of the idea is that Protocols are critically under theorized and undertankered with as a first class concept uh alongside Concepts like institutions or platforms or nations they're maybe as important in the 21st century and how we think and act in the world and so that's why you've been uh nerd sniped which I just had to Google it's a slang turd term for uh giving an interesting problem to a person who is usually a nerd so um uh so the summer of protocols it sounds like uh is an 18-week program running from May to audience uh to August um that will fund us a set of full-time researchers and part-time researchers to think broadly and creatively about protocols and sort of Advance thinking about protocols as a category did I get that all right yes that's exactly right that's what we're hoping to do and if we succeed then maybe next time next year this time when people are talking about something like say the Russia Ukraine war they won't just talk about it in terms of say two Nations at War and other nations getting involved somehow they might talk in terms of all right what are the protocols of War and Peace uh how might we think uh better about like relations between nations can we upgrade the protocol of interactions so that's the kind of like a broader effect we're hoping to have to change the terms of reference for conversations about everything not just you know Computing technology mm-hmm well that'd be incredible I can't wait to see what's going to come out of this um what uh so so can we maybe go deep on one protocol and just sort of interesting attributes about it I think that over dinner we were talking about how the handshake protocol evolved during covid so that people would like elbow bump each other and like kick each other and stuff like that and so like the mutation of protocols over time and their adoption in certain subsections the community is interesting to me but I'm wondering if we just go deep on one protocol of your choosing for the audience in order to really kind of uh stop and smell the roses on on on protocols and what's interesting about them yeah let's do that so there's a bunch of different options of course we could talk about like you know uh Computing protocols like ethereum and TCP IP we could talk about like political protocols like you know very uh Kyoto Protocol or the Paris agreement for climate but actually let's start with the one you just mentioned which is handshakes which because they're like very simple everybody has experienced them but they're like deceptively simple because there's a lot more going on under the surface of handshakes right so for example the very fact of like why would you have like an open-handed gesture as like a greeting right and one Theory it might be made up but one Theory I've heard about it is it evolved as a way to show that you're actually unharmed and not reaching for your sword or your gun right so that itself tells you something very critical about what the gesture is doing uh as at a functional level as well as a ceremonial level it's like starting off uh an interaction on the right foot by saying I'm here I come in peace I'm shaking hands with you I'm not armed or I'm not reaching for my arms and you notice this by the way with many uh greeting gestures like you know the folded hands that also not only is it a gesture of respect and reading it also it feels that your hands are folded and not reaching for a sword or gun right so it might be like a just so story but it relates to the definition we start off with in the paper of normally when you think of coordination problems are we tend to be gloomy about it we assume that it's like you know two strangers meet it's more likely that they'll fight than just get along as friends and like maybe do something interesting together and protocol actually biased the initial conditions of uh in this case handshake protocols they bias towards um non-conflict or conflict right so I think that's why it's such a great example and then it's jacks up so I think of a handshake as a small P protocol it's a micro Behavior but then you can think about how does it like um get composed with other behaviors uh more complex handshakes greetings and things you actually say like hello how are you then how it might segue into introductions how it might lead to like you know ceremonial parties and so forth so it's like you stack it up and then you get big p protocols like you know what is a party a party at one level is a bunch of people shaking hands and saying hello and then having conversations but at higher levels there's more and more layers of protocol like Behavior so I think it's actually if people are starting to think about protocols I actually recommend starting with something very simple and familiar like this and then asking what are the fundamental insights and then thinking about like you know more complex things like blockchains or climate treaties yeah one of the things I like with starting about handshakes is that they're so relatable uh especially when I was just at East Denver and probably shook the hands of of so many different people but I like this idea that protocols can uh can be composed into larger protocols like a party as a protocol or a governance I mean I mean if you think about nation state level governance there's probably a lot of handshakes as a protocol that are composing that and it's interesting to think of to think of what you said about handshakes as basically an alternative to to violence if if violence was the way that humans tribes used to coordinate with each other and now we've invented handshakes as an advance that helps move to more non-violent diplomatic based uh based coordination then it makes me wonder what are the bottoms up protocols that that have allowed us to move from um from just like warring nation states to to democratic institutions with each other like what what is the you know if ethereum has erc20 and ERC 721 what are the what are the most basic Primitives of protocols that that the audience that is composed of nation-state diplomacy for example yeah that's a great question and I think it's one of the most politically charged questions and I think it's actually interesting to start with uh David Graber um the author of debt uh who died recently and he had like a revisionist history that was at odds with a lot of political science uh theorizing about how interactions between communities and nation states actually began and in his book Debt which I have mixed feelings about but he has this origin story of uh Commerce and his um theory is that um currency based exchange for Commerce is actually a later development and commerce actually began with credit relations within tight communities and uh the way it happened was within a community if everybody knows each other like a small village everybody is part of like families that know each other from childhood so if you think about such a community you don't even need things like handshakes because everybody knows each other so intimately you're almost like uh before you're aware of it you know everybody from like a small child to the grandfathers right so handshakes are a way to like greet people from the outside and at the Commerce level barter is something you might do with people who are passing through the village as opposed to people who live in the village all the time with whom you might have more like a credit account system right and things like token currencies issued by like sovereigns who are in the capital city far away from the village that's like yet another third you know trusted third party and if you think about how relations happen within Villages between villages between villagers and a stranger passing through and then between distant Villages that might want to trade Commodities that they don't produce and use the king's currency as an intermediary you've got like uh trade and commerce as one very important pillar of like uh uh the set of protocols that down relations between political entities at all levels from say villages to Nations right so you've you've got Commerce and trade relations you've got like friendship and hostility and that leads to like military protocols and uh things related to that right like um if soldiers are Marching through your village do they get to like eat your food for free and sleep um in your houses right so there's lots and lots of uh things that layer up to what it means for two political Aggregates to relate to each other it's very simple if it's two families next door to each other and it's family to family protocols Village to Village gets more complex and by the time you get to like you know U.S to Russia or Russia to Ukraine you're talking about like basically the history of the world in a microcosm so all of that is um protocols I think can it all starts with the building blocks as simple as handshakes yeah it's really um incredible to hear the history of human coordination sort of reframed in this way that makes protocols a first-class citizen of how humans coordinate with each other yeah and it's not that it's a it's not a necessarily an unfamiliar way of thinking about these things it's just not a primary way like we're so used to like making um agent-like entities the first class uh uh elements in our thinking so whether it's individual humans and you're talking about Sovereign rights or you're talking about a village as a political entity even when I just did my description I was using those as the building blocks right and I think the thing about protocols is they make relationships the first time first class entity so inter-subjectivity rather than the individual subjectivity right so you talk about like let's talk about like say nation states you can talk about two Nations as the individual units or you can talk about pairwise relationships and there are protocols for that so there's this thing called the most favored nation status which is um countries give to each other and that's like preferred trading Partnerships and so forth so why not think in of the you know entire world as a set of pairwise relationships and then you ask yourself which of those relations are good which ones are bad how are those relations changing how are they mediated how are they formalized versus kept informal all those are protocol questions that I think you could spend like a lifetime thinking about them in these terms without even like spending too much on the individual entities yeah well you know it's interesting to hear what you said about uh agent-based actors in these systems being thought as the first class citizens but um I think I was saying over over dinner when we chatted at East Denver that um you know what you said about you know reframing from a protocol Centric view of the world reminds me of when I read Botany of desire and Michael pollan's whole point in that book was that you can look at like humans as um planting crops whether they're I think it was Apples and marijuana and maybe potatoes were the examples from Botany of desire and if you think about it from one perspective the the humans are cultivating the apples and the potatoes and the marijuana so they can feed themselves um but if you look at it from the plant-based view of the world it's almost like those plants have co-opted humans in order to reproduce themselves uh a little bit more and I I wonder if you could have the same sort of take about protocols where um Protocols are sort of leveraging the agents in in in entering into a symbiotic relationship with the agents in order to replicate themselves what do you think of that take I think it's actually a lovely take and it gets very uh interesting if you start to develop Philosophy from the basis of it's these relational entities that are the units of like you know selection and evolution and you could say like you know they they make the joke about a chicken is just an x-ray of making more eggs you could think of um uh think things like agents are just protocols ways of making more protocols or more advanced protocols right I love that way of thinking because you can frame the history of human civilization as uh generations of like these individual agents whether at um human level or Nation level sort of feeding into generation after generation of like different protocols going from like the hobizian state of war with some political theorists think was the original state where it's everybody fighting everybody uh all the way to like uh you know what Francis fukuyama calls the end of History where democracy is the pattern of relationships that's evolved uh as the mature form right and there's a lot of good thinkers who've thought a lot about this from various angles so two I want to reference and immediately is um Hannah Arend the philosopher uh she bases her whole uh political philosophy on the idea of mutualism and how really humans by themselves off on desert islands are not fully human they're like they can call themselves Sovereign individuals or whatever but you're not fully human until you're actually in an entangled relationships with other humans and it's the entanglement that actually constitutes who we are and uh other authors in this uh when Donna haraway is one and Ursula Liggins of Science Fiction uh sort of explores these themes a lot and it's kind of interesting that a lot of the best thinkers on these topics are women because um they tell very different stories about history and civilization and yeah you know mutualism then men tend to and that bias I think shows up in her thinking so in many ways um when I say think in protocol first ways as opposed to age in first ways I'm kind of saying try and think from like more of a feminine perspective and this is kind of challenging for a lot of people but these questions often yield very different and interesting insights if you start from that premise that mutualism and entanglement is the foundational basis of everything mm-hmm it's it's really interesting to to sort of consider um the the next place my mind jumps is to um the the intersection between this work and and your talk at Devcon um and I'd love to just tee that up with this quote that I see on on the summer of protocols website which will be linked in the show notes it goes like this Protocols are the very embodiment of an whiteheads observation civilizational advances happen by extending the number of important operations we can perform without thinking about them so basically when the handshake went into uh in into circulation as a protocol it allowed us to uh not have to think about oh is this person attacking me or not do they have a weapon in their hands um similarly TCP as a protocol allows us to um transfer information with each other an important operation without having to think about it um there's no newspaper boy or a newspaper girl who has to deliver it and ethereum allows us to coordinate Financial interactions uh and I think the smart contracts that like Bitcoin grants and optimism and everyone is building are allow us to do more important operations without uh thinking about them which is how civilization advances and so to me this is how I connect your work to the theme of this podcast which is how do we regenerate the world with crypto um with with the idea that the more hyper complexity in the world the more the important operations we can perform without thinking of of them by loading more protocols into our brain is a way that we build uh civilizational Advance which to me feels like it has some sort of parity with regenerative crypto economics so um yeah what's your response to that prompt I'd love to also if you could just give us a tldr of your Devcon talk I just really found your Devcon talk very incredible as well yeah so let me start there the Defcon talk I think is called uh civilizational hyper complexity or something like that and uh I was very deliberately choosing the prefix hyper because you know you can um people use the word complexity um a lot and Hyper often gets attached to things like you know there's hyper objects and that's a term in Philosophy for talking about like you know what is climate change or climate action it's a hyper object in the sense of this multifaceted big emergent thing that it's really hard to think cohesively about and hold in your head all at once so it's these objects that are far too complex for any individual to hold in their head which means you kind of have to act from within them and deal with them as a complex system and that's a very different regime of behaviors and there's lots of good Frameworks for thinking about them I happen to like the kid infin framework from ads Snowden which I used in the talk to talk about regimes of complexity and how they behave and how in like simple regimes you might like you know think about the system understand it build yourself a little model make a rational plan from A to B and then do the actions the plan indicates and then you get to your destination that's what simple uh things are like in more complex regimes you might have to do trial and error in even more complex regimes you might just have to disturb the system a little bit and see how it responds and kind of get in tune with it and the theme there along this evolutionary trajectory to hyper complexity is the more complex a large system gets the more dealing with it effectively becomes a sort of like being in tune with it vibing with it and sort of um internalizing its harmonies in your own mind and becoming an organic part of it and this relates back to what we were just talking about which is how do you like um sort of almost let your individuality dissolve in this larger system and Be an Effective part and it scares some people because that's like a board-like hive mind way of thinking about it but how does that relate to the quote which I used in the talk and also we cited in the paper um civilization advances by the number of things you can do without thinking about them think of that as um just like at an individual level like you know when you're learning to drive a car initially you're extremely conscious of everything because everything is in your awareness you have to like pay attention to driving breaking action rating but as it becomes powerful memory it recedes and it becomes part of the automatic parts of your brain right and that's like as you grow older and learn more skills your brain starts to fill up and at some point you become slower at learning but until then that's how you as an individual evolve and grow you learn more and more behaviors there's a lovely Japanese phrase for this by the way it's called Shu Hari which is I think it goes conscious incompetence um oh sorry unconscious incompetence where you don't know you're incompetent and conscious incompetence where you're aware that you don't know how to do a thing then conscious competence where you master a skill but you're still aware that you're employing that skill and then finally when you're the zen-like master it's unconscious competence where it's completely receded into the background of your brain now apply this kind of like individual learning curve concept to civilize positions as a whole whether it's from like you know Village scale Aggregates to the entire world trying to do climate action it's the same thing like there are some things we are really bad at like right now we are really bad and fumbling at creating electricity in sort of clean ways and using it to power our lives so that's in the uh conscious incompetence uh bucket now and hopefully as we've complete the energy transition and away from fossil fuels it will become part of the unconscious competence part of our civilization where you won't have to think about it just like today uh what's a good example like walking on the street is an act of um unconscious competence today like if you're a particularly particular country for a while you know you walk on the right or left side of the street you know how traffic behaves even without thinking about it you kind of do the right thing at intersections uh and even though yes there are accidents and fatalities and so forth It's surprisingly low given the number of people and vehicles moving around in like a very close packed environment right so those are like the civilizational equivalent of behaviors that have become unconscious and I think the Whitehead quote gets it exactly right like each time you develop a protocol and everybody learns it and internalizes it and makes it an unconscious part of the Behavior everything improves we get more abundance and Serendipity and peace and we get less scarcity and you know doom and a war so this is how I think civilization progresses by putting these good behaviors into Collective unconscious um competence right um are are all sort of protocols that are moved into muscle memory good things um I'm just thinking of like you know uh crypto people who have learned to uh launch Ponzi schemes or like I the the movie producer who is harassing all those women and using his position of power like he probably over the course of his 30 years created some sort of muscle memory of doing that um and and so I guess like is there some sort of evolutionary selection mechanism or the more regenerative or like mutualistic uh protocols will get selected for over time how do we root out like bad habits that also become muscle memory is is kind of what I'm aiming for there yeah this is I think the important question and in the paper we actually post that as one of our main hypotheses which is that good protocols out evolve bad ones because you're exactly right there are entrenched bad protocols which have like uh maybe even no redeeming qualities at all and only negative impacts and they are only in place because somebody in power has the ability to keep them in place and apart from like maybe the one or two selfish kinds of actors at the center who are like benefiting it's like a negative and the hypothesis is that eventually good protocols um overwhelmingly out evolved bad protocols and the sort of premise behind that it can be cashed out in a multiple different ways but just as a reference point for example Francis fukuyama's theory of the end of History I think is an example of that kind of evolutionary hypothesis where his hypothesis is the end of History happens when the final kind of government which is liberal democracy starts to become the dominant Universal form of government now there's problems with the theory and people have called it into question and so forth but I happen to believe that it's roughly right and it's actually an approximately correct description of history that all the possible governance systems of like evil dictatorships and theocracies and blah blah blah have eventually slowly been supplanted by uh liberal democracy and even though we've had uh what's known as a democratic recession since about 2009 in the long span of History counting from like say you know 10 000 BC to today that's like minor little dip overall the progress The Arc of History has bent towards democracy and I I use that phrasing um specifically because I think this is a kind of hypothesis that's similar to Martin Luther King's um The Arc of moral history bends to its progress I believe is this phase I think something like that is true of the evolutionary Dynamic of protocols and I think the mechanism that drives it is actually technology so anytime a new technology gets invented it can be used to disrupt some sort of bad equilibrium protocol and challenge it right like talk about Divine Stein Affair that you just mentioned like this guy was going around Hollywood abusing women for a couple of decades what made the Mewtwo movement happen when it did and yes there was like General cultural factors making it the right moment and so forth but I think one of the biggest factors was uh the culture created by phones and uh sharing like personal valid testimony in the form of videos and so forth It's like over the 10 years after the iPhone was introduced we all got very used to a culture where bad behavior was much harder to do in secret like if you're being an ass on social media and the direct messages with somebody you could be like you know screenshot uh revealed for who you were right and I think that culture played a big part in shifting away from that particular bad equilibrium where the technology helps shift towards better protocols maybe not perfect but better so evolutionary sounds better yeah yeah it feels like moving from protocols that are hierarchy and power based to network based was maybe part of that as well yeah and there's another I think good hypothesis we state in the paper and all these by the way there are more questions than answers and our point with both the program and the papers to encourage people to come up with both better questions than we have and better answers than the ones we kind of like you know straw man propose but in this particular case yeah one of our other hypotheses is that protocols as a first-class citizen naturally lend themselves to becoming more P2P rule of law decentralized over time fundamentally because of the way they interact with technology and this is not to say there aren't like centrally controlled highly centralized protocols like you know if you go to the Royal Court of the monarchs of England which I think most people in the crypto world would have a diff test for there is such a thing as a protocol for appearing in court and bowing to the Monarch or something like that so that's a centralized protocol around a monarch right or to take a less socially loaded example I like thinking of the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope these are hugely expensive multi-billion dollar centralized resources sitting out there in space and all the astronomers who are like eager to use them to do their research and conduct observations at a fundamental physical level you can't like turn this into a decentralized P2P thing you might do it at outer layers where you say everybody put in your proposals and bids and maybe we can vote on them and treat the telescopes the commons good that we then decide how to use together but the resource itself being centralized forces a certain centralization of the protocols that get designed around it right but overall yeah I think they're exactly right I think it's a strong incredible hypothesis to say that protocols tend to be more P2P and interact with technology in a way that makes them more rule of law friendly than other kinds of like entities um how big is this Rabbit Hole like if you were to put protocols into an n-dimensional space like mutable to immutable technological to social um I'm not even sure what vectors there are out there but but uh it feels like there's just a lot there and just just coming up with a taxonomy of different types of protocols and and placing them on a map would be it feels like a really interesting exercise to me absolutely and that's one of the exercises that we hope somebody takes on through the summer and as a starting point what we've done on the structuring side there's actually a two by two as it happens in the paper and that one we just they might not be the best Dimensions but we just picked them so one at the x-axis is from soft to hard and the y-axis is from Atomic to systemic and that's one two-dimensional way of classifying uh protocols right like you can think of like um carbon emissions treaties as like systemic and hard because they're like about hard measurable numbers you can talk about like um you know crypto graphic signing as hard and atomic because it's a low level Behavior you can talk about like soft and systemic things like you know the culture at um like Christmas is a soft and uh systemic protocol where yes there's like small hardened things like Christmas trees have like ritual expectations but overall it's not like TCP like when you say Christmas is a celebration that is prescribed in certain ways it's not prescribed in the same cells as pcpip so those are the two Dimensions we used but you're right when in our discussions leading up in the study uh we talked about like dozens and dozens of uh potential variables that affect it and we started collecting a very rich set of examples of what we think could be reasonably called protocols and this is one of the pages in the summer of protocols.com site it's just an index of protocols and I think one of the things we're hoping people will do is just look at this Rich set of examples start thinking what the various ways you could classify them and come up public perhaps the most elegant and I'll be dirty here like the most elegant eigen structure of uh protocol space like maybe the obvious ones like heart was a soft or Atomic versus systemic they're just the Cosmetic superficial variables and maybe somebody can do some deep thinking and come up with these are the 15 dimensions of protocols and these four subtle ones are the ones that really carry most of the information and those are maybe the eigenvectors of protocol space so I would love for that to be a project somebody takes on yeah what are the most interesting prompts that you want to put to the audience uh and you know the audience is 7 000 people who are crypto native that that uh you know if your crypto native you're building your life's work on top of protocols so one of the most interesting props prompts that you want to put out there um maybe we could just go through those one by one for the remainder of the episode yeah let's uh do that um so we've tried not to be like um too heavy-handed in suggesting particular um questions actually we started there like one of the initial discussions we had was hey maybe we should do like the DARPA Grand Challenge uh guys do it like you know just list a bunch of moonshot things and then a bunch of little problems and so forth but the more we talked about it and the more we realized how rich and complex this is the more we realized we want actually people to come up with their own ideas of what's worth researching and we want to take a step back and uh try and like give them fodder for thought in the form of like just um stimulating um ideas to think about some provocations one both from ourselves but more importantly from other people so there's a whole reading section in the site with like I think 100 readings at this point and I want to call out uh maybe a couple of them that I think are particularly interesting um so the first one Robin Sloan he's a one of my favorite bloggers he wrote this great little piece called uh specifying spring 83. so it's actually literally a little toy proposal for a protocol to do something in the realm of what Twitter and RSS and email subscriptions do now so for a way so spring 83 that Robin Sloan has proposed is a protocol to allow websites to connect to each other and sort of a public publish subscribed way but in a much more how do I put it Artisan bespoke way where it's literally I have a little site I have a little widget like thing there maybe I updated saying hey I'm working on this new novel maybe and then I have a bunch of friends who are subscribed to it and they have a little box on their site and it kind of shows up on that so that's roughly the idea of spring 83. so I strongly recommend people read that for example and think about all right what other kinds of cute little protocols can I just make up why does why do protocols have to be these heavy things that people at Google or the ietf or whatever come up with where it's like you have to think of them as this huge planet spanning has to run all of the world's infrastructure type thing why can't we Tinker with protocols the way we Tinker with Legos for example so just make up protocol so that's my first prompt especially to be technically inclined listeners here and I particularly want to encourage listeners to forget about crypto when you start out thinking because protocols I think are so fundamental if you get anchored too quickly to a relatively sophisticated class of protocols like blockchains they're thinking will be too narrow so start with something like handshakes or start with something like you know family of four protocols we're used to like SMTP that email runs on and ask does it really have to work that way we all have computers connected to the internet and they can talk to each other through packets what other things can happen right so for the engineers in particular I think that's a good place to start so Robin Sloans another article I want to reference which is also in our list of references is an article by Matt Webb it's called who could write protocol fiction and this is a lovely little piece that is basically a provocation and challenge to fiction writers it's like right good science fiction or regular fiction stories about protocols why do we like we were talking about this at dinner right why is it that we still don't have like more than a bare handful of good stories about the internet like they're still when you go to the movies or watch TV it's really really bad it's like people might Google something briefly that's the extent of the internet's appearance or you might get like some very lurid unrealistic annoying way of doing the internet like you know I like the last installment of the Die Hard franchise where I think Timothy Olyphant plays this uh super hacker who like captures and Ransom wears uh the social security systems database it's like just the idea of the internet and the idea of like holding data Ransom is at the heart of the plot but fundamentally it's not a story about that it's a story about Bruce Willis and that other guy going and beating up a bunch of bad guys and like protocols on the internet play a little side role there and mat Webb's article is basically a challenge to um go write stories where Protocols are a first-class citizen in the plot itself and how it works and um I think he mentions this example or maybe it's in some other uh thing but it's uh uh pandemic the movie that came out in 2013 that's a lovely example of a proper protocol type fiction because it goes about like you know pandemic response protocols it didn't do the stupid thing of like making a Maverick outside of the hero and all the bureaucrats are idiots who don't know what to do it shows you how health response protocols actually work and the serious educated uh uh experts who spent a lifetime studying diseases actually do know what they're talking about and like do things to like uh stop the spread of the pandemic and of course kovitz since then has given us like a more realistic version of that uh but yeah pandemic the movie and the lyrics there are a couple other references I want to cite is David Brynn the science fiction writer wrote a lovely essay this was around 2013 I think uh which is called something like our favorite Trope a world full of idiots and that's kind of true like since about the 1970s our style of you know fiction has been the world is irredeemably broken nobody knows what they're doing all the systems are corrupt and the only hope is these radical individualist Maverick Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis Die Hard type who single-handedly take on and like force the system to do the right thing and I think that's trained us to in the exact opposite of protocol first thinking it's trained Us in like uh Maverick genius uh who takes on the world thinking which is just like fantasy love right so yeah I would say first I I know I kind of wandered off but to your question I think my first prompt is go look at all the readings that we've linked to in our list of readings pick a handful of course read our pilot study too but yeah look um expand your sources read a bunch and sort of start thinking let the juices start flowing and think about protocols in a very rich way so that would be my first prompt right amazing um yeah I mean I'm just looking at the diversity of protocols on the paper nuclear launch protocols voting Robert's Rules of Order TCP climate protocols training and llm weddings handshakes pinging public key cryptography uh handshakes and and it's it's this is one of those papers that have just blown my mind Blanca so we'll link we'll link the the the papers in the summer of protocol in the show notes here um is there anything I didn't ask about the paper or the summer protocols program that you want to say uh let's see um yeah so well I I don't want to say a little bit more about the summer protocol itself so if you're looking for two kinds of researchers so the main application is for co-reacher researchers and affiliate researchers so core researchers you'll be funded full time for 18 weeks to basically write a long-form um think piece about protocols that's for a broad audience uh doesn't have to be about technology or crypto it can be about like you know purely cultural protocols or so forth so we want you to write um challenging piece but we also want you to kind of like build something so if the written piece is something like a think piece or a short story fiction whatever you kind of long form you want to do the other piece I think of it as a tinker piece so something composable an artifact that other people can build with so of course if you're an engineer and I'm good at programming you could do things like make up a speculative protocol and uh release like a reference implementation like Robin Sloan spring 83 is a good model to follow there but for example if you're a fiction writer and what you want to do is like do a protocol like thing so you could write a short story and you could produce like a World building set of elements as like you know a set of characters and like places or something that could be your storytelling kit that would be a good thing to try so that's what cool research is and the other application is for affiliate researchers these will be part-time and mainly in the second half of the program and what we're trying to do here is rethink the true test of a protocol is whether or not you can get other people to use it so we want to give our core researchers a chance to like uh persuade an audience of like willing and ready affiliate researchers to you know work on their protocol so if somebody comes up with a speculative protocol uh convince some of the Affiliates to join you and like build on it so we're if you if you want to be an affiliate if you want to be in this group of people who work with the core research projects apply for the affiliate program but we also have two other roles we're looking for people for one is simply resident experts on various protocols so of course ethereum is easy we already have Tim Becker and Trent van apps who are co-authors on the paper they serve as the resident experts on ethereum uh we have um your old uh partner Scott Moore serving as the resident for git coin and like public goods but we want other resident experts for like you know international relations Healthcare protocols so if you are an expert on a protocol and would like to be a resident just reach out to me we'd love to have you just join the community and support our researchers and maybe do a guest talk on some like you know protocol people don't think office protocols like I mean we've been casually chatting about handshakes as amateurs in the handshake World maybe there's an anthropologist out there who's actually studied handshakes in depth if you're out there and listening please come on board and give us a guest lecture on handshakes so those are the four roles you can be co-researcher affiliate researcher resident expert and guest speaker so any of those interest you go to the site and reach out amazing well maybe whoever's doing research on handshake protocols can uh save me from offering someone a handshake when they're offering me a fist bump in the vice versa which is my most awkward nerd interaction at uh East Denver when we talked about that that at dinner so we talked about that as like a protocol Miss where you initiate a handshake and the other person responds with the fist bump response and it's like a moment of confusion it stuck in my head and the following day I I posted on fire cluster I'm hanging out in my hotel lobby anybody want to come hang out a couple of guys came out and then they met each other they did exactly that protocol one guy reaches out for the handshake and the other did the fifth Clump so it's kind of funny once you start seeing the world in protocol first wave you can't unsee the world it's like everywhere you look everything looks like a protocol and that's why I think people get nerds flagged by this it's not that we did like an exceptional job writing this paper I think the topic itself is like a nuts like type topic once you see the world this way you can't stop great well uh all I heard was that I'm not awkward it's a protocol miss when that happens like a cash Miss yet well um as we're wrapping up I just kind of Wonder like in a world in which you're maximally successful what does that look like so take us through summer of protocols 2023 it's August it's September there's been a dozen well let's call it uh papers or research reports written on protocols you know what's the advancement what's the what does it look like in which you're maximally successful coming out of the summer of protocols yeah so um if you're still trying to like of course design the mechanisms to make this kind of maximally successful outcome happen uh so the things we want to be is so yes let's say it's August and we've had a very successful summer and like a dozen people have written like great uh papers and produced great artifacts that a whole bunch of people are excited about working on they've started building on it maybe they've started building a couple of actual projects and startups or like planning like longer research projects with um other sources of support so a lot of like low-level ground level activity has started off but rather than that what we'd like to see is the discussions that have happened along the way have seeded a much larger Community like you know we hope uh we'll have a Discord open and it'll be relatively open to anybody who wants to like just hang out with the researchers and just talk protocols and we hope that even outside the purview of this program just with us like working in public to a certain extent and writing and you know tweeting and forecasting about these things as we work that it'll create like a larger conversation and other people you know feel free to join us permissionlessly like you know take the summer of protocols as like a hashtag or like just a banner where you can just do your own thing without like being formally part of the program if you don't want to apply because you're busy with other stuff but you want to write an essay and tag it summer of protocols on your blog do that drop us a line we'll share it on our Discord and we kind of want to have this kind of like open uh participatory permissionless kind of like um team going and I think that's like six months from now but I'm really more interested in what happens like a year from now or 18 months from now where we hope in some ways all the really smart thinking that goes on in the crypto Community around protocols it's sort of like been jailbroken out of that narrow context and this thinking gets situated in a much broader context where we can actually I don't know rejoin Humanity because at some level I feel um I I have two personalities I have my crypto personality when I talk to other crypto people and then there's the other side of me that's like a regular human and that code switching is both annoying and gets in the way of like you know the Whitehead Advanced that's um on offer here like if we can broaden the conversation bring other people into it whether or not they're interested in cryptocurrencies we want them to be interested in protocols and hopefully in 18 months from now maybe memes that have grown out of this program will start hearing them in like you know newscasts maybe politicians will start referencing memes that our researchers come up with in talking about International relationships maybe there will be like you know major feature stories and magazines that take a protocol first view of important issues so we want to have that kind of impact and that's why we need the strongest possible applications here so please if you um if you yourself think you who can do great work here please apply and even more importantly since I'm talking to a crypto audience if you know people who are outside the crypto bubble or Echo chamber who you think are already doing really smart thinking about protocols or protocol first ways of thinking about the word Point them to the program we'd love to have them and both broadening our minds and then broadening their own and each other's yeah well uh it feels like this is a public good for Humanity so I'm really excited to see what comes out of it I'm uh I'm gonna be following along closely so um anything else you want to say before we wrap uh that's it I think so yeah check out summer of protocols.com and uh hoping to hear from a lot of you yep so we'll have links in the show notes to the paper to your Twitter and to Summer of protocols so click that link in the show note and apply the summer protocols can't wait to see how this turns out thank God thank you so much for joining me thank you for having me thank you
