gameplay is very bearish right now from a market sentiment robbie you're in the trenches with the builders is there some hope here should we be bearish or is there a reason that we we should remain excited about gamefly and if so what are those reasons my strong belief is that the successive game should be entirely decorated from the general crypto market games will truly be driving success on on web 3 and mainstream success and we almost stopped talking about it is like game by being in a beta mode because it's well hey there's this game over here that has a 100 million players and under the hood people are using an ft's people are truly digitally owning their items and experiencing 10 times the value they could get through a web 2 game and that's when the narrative is obsolete because the product is there the adoption is there and out of the top 10 most mainstream game developing companies in the world well then eight of them have full-time web 3 teams and i'm not saying they're going to launch this year and next year because games take time to build
