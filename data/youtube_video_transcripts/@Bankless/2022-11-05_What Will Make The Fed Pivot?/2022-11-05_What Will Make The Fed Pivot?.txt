it's going to make the FED pivot though like what are the indicators that we're really going to be looking for so there are two ways to Pivot and neither of those is a good one there is a systemic liquidity crisis that will make the FED pivot between brackets if the base of the pyramid is at risk of being destroyed then the pyramid wouldn't exist anymore and nobody wants that policy makers included so they make sure that that doesn't happen were that to happen the Federal Reserve will need to intervene very similar to what the bank of England did when the UK pension fund industry was about to blow up and the second way to Pivot would be if the labor market gets it so bad that inflation starts to slow down and people are losing their job and they can't spend money anymore and the Federal Reserve is like okay maybe we did enough damage we can slow down a little bit that I think is the most likely path ahead which makes me want to think that we're going to see some pain through the real economy and risk assets still between now and the first off of next year and then you know going into the second off of next year I think the set of circumstances will be more friendly
