prices hitting all-time highs the bitcoin etf is finally here and defy 2.0 is healing the planet all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the headlines and important narratives from around vegas this week as always there are going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to shout out our sponsor pool together v4 pull together is a no loss lottery and it's a great place to start if you're new to d5 deposit assets check out the daily reward drawings and remove your funds at any time dive into the pool at bankless dot cc pool together andrew yang came on the podcast this week which we are absolutely stoked about andrew has been a dream guest for a long time and the episode did not disappoint andrew's brand of politics has always been a pro-technology one uh being open-minded about novel approaches to our system of governance and it seems like bankless and the crypto community and andrew yang are trying to solve similar problems but from different angles andrew wants to upgrade our political protocols things like changing the way we do primaries and introducing new voting mechanisms as part of dismantling the overwhelming dysfunction of the two-party system andrew founded the forward party on top of these platforms the peak of the conversation was definitely andrew claiming that the forward party will be the crypto party what is there for you know uh the crypto community in the forward party i want to make the forward party the crypto party truly because i do see the alignment is very very deep and the parallels are so strong where you have this system you could say the political system of the financial system that you see that it's failing and failing in its various ways and then you say okay maybe we can do better in my case i do want to try and help the political system upgrade itself and modernize itself and i i want to make the case to legislators that the crypto currency community is a force for progress a force for innovation a massive provider of jobs i tweeted something where i said rule of thumb if you face a trillion dollar industry that could define the future like don't screw it up you know like it's a pretty it's a pretty simple message it's like guys like please please please like take a bit of time to figure out what the hell you're doing here because like this is a very very significant generator of jobs and value um i think that's pretty common sense later in the episode we initiated andrew into the world of ethereum with his own dot eth address and earlier this week andrew minted an nft from andrew yang.eth and it sold for 6.9 eth nice uh welcome to the club andrew and it's clear that a certain brand of populism is really hot these days and we talked about it in market monday this week uh crypto is also a populist movement but i think it's a different kind of populism than we're used to it's less overt what you see in contemporary american politics is this form of populism that panders to its ideological groups offering simple solutions for complicated problems giving people short-term fixes that make for good sound bites but the crypto version of populism isn't as easy the crypto political platform is calling for an overhaul of institutions and although we shouldn't necessarily fear change it often brings chaos and growing pains with it uh crypto offers real solutions to fundamental problems and every day that passes makes it more feasible to implement those solutions that's the lindy effect so danny ryan came on layer 0 this week to show us the kind of people working under the hood of ethereum the kind of person that dedicates pretty thankless hours honestly uh to build a protocol that's making all of our lives better so what kind of person is danny ryan well he's got super long hair like long hair uh he's from colorado and he's obsessed with hard problems and that's actually the thing i've heard a bunch of times from these big brain core developers they love obsessing over hard and important problems in working for the ethereum foundation danny uses his skill set to communicate uh distilling problems into their fundamental components getting everybody on the same page about things so they can bring elegant upgrades to this complex space i really enjoy explaining things i really enjoy teaching and so i really enjoy like finding the right metaphor or the right like thing analogy to communicate a technical concept to people who maybe aren't as deep in the weeds and so because i get to deep i get to be deep in the weeds then i also get to then turn around the other side and communicate outward the ethereum core devs met in greece earlier this month to work on proof of stake mocking up a test merge to mimic the real merge coming soon there is a lot of deep technical stuff happening here but i think this picture is good enough for the tldr we like it when devs are smiling this week we also continued our journey down the d5 2.0 rabbit hole and our coverage this week gave me a number of aha moments zeus from olympus dow made a long overdue appearance on state of the nation to discuss how the dao and its native om token have mooned while also accruing a sustainable pool of capital to back the protocol we also covered climadow which is a fork of olympus that actually uses carbon credits to back their native token klima so klima is taking this even further with aligning the incentives of the protocol the users and the environment i think on the surface of defy 2.0 you'll find just a new crop of memes and a mobilization of the frog army but if you look deeper down i think you can make a good case that some real new primitives are being unlocked scooby trooples of alcomix echoed this when he came on for a special episode this week and that's when it all really cracked for me in this model you put your lp tokens you sell your lp tokens to the protocol to receive the governance tokens but if you are just receiving the governance tokens which i'm pretty sure are newly minted and you are selling them to do that again and again and again how is that different than just yield the just dumping the yield farms from the original method where is it where does that difference come in so if people are only playing the strategy where they are you know like recycling the you know the the alcx they get from the bonds back into slp to buy more bonds um you know that's essentially exactly what's going on with yield farming especially like the the yield aggregators who who take you know the lp tokens and stuff like that it's essentially the exact same thing right um except that the protocol is now getting more and more and more of that liquidity share and it's rooting out the toxic liquidity that's a part of that pool so selling mechanism that forces that one-way function of liquidity into the protocol yes so basically instead of renting liquidity in exchange for inflationary governance tokens uh defy 2.0 protocols use bonding mechanisms to purchase and own liquidity in exchange for inflationary governance tokens i think the big level up here is aligning incentives and you've seen it in the communities forming around these new protocols instead of having mercenary capital just jumping around from yield farm to yield farm people are sticking around now that they're incentivized to support the protocol over a longer time horizon as an offshoot of our defy 2.0 coverage we laid out how anybody can create a borrowing and lending market for a defy asset using rari capital's fuse pools borrowing and lending is essentially all that a bank does and we've decentralized the borrowing and lending part but i think we've now taken another step forward protocols can now be agnostic to what specifically is being borrowed and lent this is a paradigm shift and what it means to create value represent value and compose value across different assets you've heard a lot about daos but what does it mean to contribute and get rewarded by daos if you're starting to familiarize yourself with what a dao actually is you may be starting to ask yourself oh what's in it for me well not gonna make it luke what's in it for you is that work culture is changing work is becoming increasingly freelanced gig based open removed from the constraints of contracts and corporatocracy dell culture is reflective of this you choose how much time you put in and there's a unique freedom in being able to establish your own role and work structure dows need developers community managers content creators designers coordinators but a lot of the time dows aren't out there recruiting uh you have to break into the community see what it's all about and find a place to start contributing it's a reputation game and your reward for contribution is ownership so on tldr i usually cover just more ecosystem-wide stuff less time-sensitive but since this was such a heavy newsweek i just wanted to kind of list off the biggest headlines and see where we're at the pro shares bitcoin etf started trading this week and was the fastest etf ever to surpass one billion dollars bearish total value locked in defy is at an all-time high bitcoin set a new all-time high and ether basically set a new all-time high bearish pleaser now healed the world by buying the one-of-a-kind wu-tang album that super villain martin shkreli hoarded before going to jail for securities fraud bearish coinbase is launching an nft platform bearish polygon is teaming up with draftkings bearish ftx raised 420 million 690 000 bearish and facebook is trying to strong-arm its way into being the centralized corporate center of the metaverse actually bearish so with that i want to quickly shout out our sponsors matcha alchemix ledger and arbitrum bullish also this video wouldn't be possible without them so thanks a lot and finally none of
