you have a deep belief that we are 21st centuries doing our best to interact with 19th century institutions with information technology from the 15th century and it's up to us to design the political and economic systems of the internet generation yeah i still believe that wholeheartedly institutions in general like democracies they respond to a certain society to a certain technology to a certain education and access that was there when they were created so if you think about it like having representative democracy for example it's like a brilliant idea when your means of communication is like pen and paper and a horse you don't want everyone in the room because they can't physically live in the room because they can't get to the room and also because they don't have access to the education they need that changed dramatically society moved forward to a place where we can represent ourselves but we're still stuck with institutions that were designed in a time where we couldn't represent ourselves and it's not going to get better until we design institutions for this society
