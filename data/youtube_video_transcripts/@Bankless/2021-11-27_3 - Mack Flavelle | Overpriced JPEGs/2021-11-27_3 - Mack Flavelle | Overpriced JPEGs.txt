[Music] hello everyone welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i am carly riley on today's show i have mac flavelle who i'm so excited to have brought onto this podcast because mac is very fun he actually was the person who came up with the idea for cryptokitties which is one of the very first nft projects and in fact was the project that gave way to the erc 721 standard that all nfts today for the most part conform to uh so we talk a lot about about the history and what it was like back in the early days why cryptokitties was able to be so successful we also talked about his latest projects he's now the ceo and founder of big head club which is the company you might know for having partnered with miele cunis and ashton kutcher to release stoner cats but he's done a number of projects since that as well with big head club uh so he also at the very end of this episode makes some predictions about the future of the space so stay tuned for that a couple warnings before you totally dive in here um one we curse quite a bit in this episode mack is a bit of a cursor i'm a bit of a cursor and then when i'm around somebody else who's a cursor it really gets unlocked so uh please just be cognizant of that if you have kids around or if you feel uncomfortable with swear words for what it's worth probably worth putting it out there and then also we recorded this episode a number of weeks ago and it was actually before matt's latest project had dropped bighead club's latest project had dropped that is their ghostbusters project um so they launched a collection of nfts for around ghostbusters uh the animated film that is released releasing soon um so anyhow that there's some time timing differences because we talked about it as if it were coming up but it has already happened now so you can go check out ghostbusters um the afterlife on openc and i think those are all my caveats so please please enjoy this episode uh we'll hear from our sponsors first though xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the tokens across all of your wallets but it also displays the nfts that you've been tirelessly collecting xerion even reports the value of your nfts in your overall portfolio giving you the most comprehensive report on the entirety of your crypto portfolio xerion isn't just a place to get an understanding of your portfolio but it also hooks into defy activities like trading borrowing and lending all in one convenient place so you don't have to memorize all the various define websites to do all of your default activities to get started go to xerion.io bankless and load up your wallet or wallets into the xerion interface and supercharge your defy experience and enrich your nft lifestyle that's z-e-r-i-o-n bankless i want to give a special thanks to overpriced jpeg partner block block not only because they are a sponsor of this show but also because they are my employer blockblock is an innovative blockchain lab we work across nfts and the metaverse and our goal is really to push the industry forward with every new project we take on we founded and currently run the meebit style which just partnered with larva labs to create more metaverse friendly renderings of me bits which is awesome we are also partnered with a sundance award-winning filmmaker to build the first dow that will own a feature-length documentary film we have a ton of cool projects down the pipeline and are really looking for cool people to partner with on this so go to blockblock.io to subscribe to our newsletter and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io here we go i am so excited to have you on the show mac you and i have actually i've had the pleasure to chat with you a number of times before this so i'm not meeting you for the first time here um and i i want to intro like introduce you by saying that you have been a part of at least two groundbreaking projects in the nft space and i want to name those projects and see if the audience can spot the theme so the first project is cryptokitties you may have heard of it and the second project is stoner cats spot the similarity so mac what is your thing for cats i will i can legitimately tell you my things for cats right now and it has to deal with cryptokitties so also okay we're going to tell a story i'll tell you another story about cats after because there's a third cat thing you don't know about uh but here's where the cat thing comes from so wow we're just gonna get ready to do okay so i used to work at a company called axioms in and axioms then was a foundry before that was a thing or an incubation something a startup studio you know we never quite found the words for these beta works was pioneering this model years ago in new york and that kind of thing um at axioms then we build incredibly high quality software it was award-winning we won like apple design awards and webby awards and all sorts of things and we did that for partners and it was a lot like i describe it as like when you first get into like making apps or technology you always have a friend who's like oh i got an idea like i've got an idea wouldn't it be cool like you should make my app and axioms then the founders rojo and some who are brothers had that experience but their friends were like generally billionaires and so when they were like i have an idea then they'd be like and i have the money to make it then we would do that and we would you know make really really really great apps and charge people for it and part of the privilege of that entire experience would that we would have profit and with that profit we would say oh now we think we can shape the world like it's interesting to learn from our partners and we had the privilege of being very selective about who we worked with and that was very nice but then the byproduct of all that was a small pile of opportunity that we had in front of us and so i essentially led the consumer foundry there and that was the like if we don't have a partner but we're going to build something what are we going to build and then that was kind of like well let's get mac to come up with something and not that we got to do what i wanted but at least like i would try and convince people what we should try or they're trying to convince me and i played a pivotal role in that consumer foundry self-directed part of the business um and so that was a lot of ephemeral messaging apps that was a lot of mobile games that was a lot of like oh we're gonna build the next snapchat and we're going to we're going to build the next like flappy bird or this kind of thing like how do we hit those kinds of massive trends and waves and and we realize the luck and the discipline and the commonalities and the discrepancies between those two examples i just gave and okay so rob said to me you know we're doing all these consumer experiences and we're building all these things and rom says to me he says how do you feel about the blockchain and i said i'm pretty sure that's like a fancy word for bitcoin that libertarian [ __ ] use for why they want to take down their governments and he was like well no but uh maybe and he's like how do you feel about making the blockchain fun and i was like well that's a [ __ ] dumb idea like who who would who would want to do that for any reason and he was like well if you want to keep your job you do he hates it when i tell the story that way because he didn't actually say that we were good friends and he never threatened my job but he was like no dude like this is a massive opportunity and as a business we want to look at this and like that means you need to look at this and i said okay so i went into the woods and i came back three days later and i came back with three truths and the one truth was that i'd always wanted to build a gardening game something where you put a seed in the ground and you do not know what color or what shape the flower that blossoms will be that kind of discovery seems really fun to me like literally for over a decade i've been trying to put together a gardening game but you listen to the birds coming the songs the birds make is different depending on what gardens are in your garden that sounds fun and beautiful so that was one truth like this gardening game thing and the second truth was that the only thing i'd ever seen on the blockchain any blockchain that i gave even the remote is the [ __ ] about was it cryptopunk so and this part i used to not tell people because i found it kind of embarrassing but in 2017 i didn't tell anybody and i spent 35 dollars buying a crypto punk do you still have it i do oh man i bought it because it looks like wonder woman and i love wonder woman and it was the first time that's badass we can do a whole thing about the like avatarization and the pfp's not having to try to buy things that look like themselves i can tell you about the sexist racist people by crypto punks and the price of rarity of black female traits versus others and crypto books i'm the only person i know who given choice to buy any crypto punk on earth virtually like this was four years ago and then when i buy it look like wonder woman i don't know if you can see me right now i don't look like wonder woman yeah well you're you're being absorbed by an oni ronan's head right now you look like you're about to be eaten for those who are not on on youtube i'm sorry you can't see the look right now but it's it's a look it's a lot going on uh so so that was two truths gardening game crypto puns is the first thing that matters and the third was that cats are opt out you do not explain why you're using cats if you're building consumer applications you explain why you were not using cats if you were building these medications they're the gasoline of the internet people love them they have been viral since before literally since before the word viral existed cats have gone viral like it's just if you're trying to build things for muggles they're trying to build things for normal people who do not give a [ __ ] about how the magic works you just want them to care then you put a cat on that [ __ ] and that is my cat fit now the other side of that is i didn't come up with stunner cats but i didn't hear about stoner cats and i was like cats and my [ __ ] spiderman radar did his thing and i was like that's probably a pretty good idea long answer that's the cat thing um that's amazing and and we will get into stoner cats later so you started to tell your story obviously i i gave you a hard lead and i know but so your background you're working at this agency your boss essentially comes to you and is like yo we're doing blockchain stuff you're like ew weird libertarians in their basement you don't know anything about nfts so right like you don't know that term you're coming at this being like okay i just need to make this weird technology thing fun and cats are what consumers want and so i don't think people really realize like you you conceptualized and came up with cryptokitties and cryptokitties brought us the erc 721 standard which is what all nfts essentially are today that's correct correct every nft that you care about is a 721 standard nft except for functionally two all of the top shots because they're on flow but they are built based on the lessons of 721 because it's the same architect behind both it is dieter yeah flow is dapper labs which did crypto kit you did crypto kitties with and so yes dapper labs was a byproduct of cryptocurrency success after cryptocurrencies blew up we created after labs to manage the success and so actually actually there are three nfts that matter in this earth that are not 721s one is top shot two is the crypto puns because they predated us remember i saw those before we made grippy kitties and then the weird thing which i had actually forgotten until i was talking to somebody two weeks ago is that uh crypto kitties are not pure 721's the standard wasn't finalized there's one call there's one like method call on 721 standard that does not exist inside cryptokitties so they're like 98 721 it's a weird little for for the historical nerds of this technology who either exist or who will come along that is like a cute little fact but yes the 721 standard that literally every nft that most people who listen to this will ever care about are truly and honestly a byproduct of us trying to figure out how to make cats [ __ ] because if you have a bitcoin and i have a bitcoin and we trade bitcoins you nor i care starting with a bitcoin and with a bitcoin we're good but if you have a pink cat and i have a blue cat and we trade i care a lot because i don't like pink cats i like blue cats and so i have a text message to one of the most famous nfd collectors of all time named richard and richard is the guy who just said no he just said no to nine and a half million dollars right so richard is my oldest friend who's into blockchain like richard and me are supposed to go hitchhiking to ghost towns together and [ __ ] we have like a weird thing we built apps about weighing elephants and all sorts of [ __ ] from the old days long before any of this and when i first came up with these cryptokitties things i messaged richard and i because he's my he was my bitcoin guy and i was like hey man i think they're gonna make my bitcoin cat idea and he said what bitcoin cat idea and i said where the bitcoin cats [ __ ] to mine bitcoin that is how i first described and like honestly a month ago richard sent that to me as a signal message and was like this this is an nft oh you need to post that somewhere send it to me i'll post it i know you're off social it's a it's a whole thing it's a whole thing and so and so make that an nft post it make it an nft it'll sell a million dollars i got one about top shot too that i don't show people very often but i got one about did you know right away that cryptokitties or or how long into the process did you realize like hey this is gonna be a thing um we got excited early on but it wasn't obvious i don't think most people ever know that what they're working on is obviously gonna work out or or is that next type of arrogance that i don't have i have other flavors of variance but not that flavor so there was a couple there was a couple sort of like um inflection points or moments of note first of all one month before we went live we uh went to east waterloo so that was an ethereum conference in waterloo a little town in canada and vitalik was going to be there and everybody was going to be there like is the one place where you could get all of these people in a room at once and we sent four people fabiano benny jordan and arthur and they didn't even have tickets to get in they just went there there's pictures now of them like finishing the code for the alpha trying to get in they spent three hours on the friday night begging people for tickets to get into that conference and they somehow worked their way in they're like scalping tickets to eat waterloo and benny is a [ __ ] maniac the best sense of the word uh and benny got them all put on tie-dye shirts and brought like helium balloon shaped like cat emojis about [ __ ] sparkles and stickers we didn't have a brand [ __ ] i was wearing is it we didn't have a brand at this point so we took a picture of a cat and put it on a space background and write cryptokitties and that was our brand for the the whole thing was bonkers we had no idea what we're [ __ ] doing we went to eat waterloo they ran their alpha the ux on the website was functionally non-existent like it was really and truly borked but there was one little booth at east waterloo where you could go there and the weird cat guys were doing the cats and you could go there and like press the button on the ring the network three times and roll the dice and see what cat you got out the other side and from there motherboard the vice thing the like vice news device tech yeah they wrote a thing about us and that was like huh that's like it was weird that they were there in the first place but it's even weirder that they wrote a little thing about us and so that was the first inflection point for me then we had a telegram group because this was four years ago discord wasn't quite what it is now like for this community telegram was everything it was always telegram and uh we built this little telegram group of sort of alpha users and that grew to like a thousand people in the month leading up to the launch and that was like uh oh there's a signal yeah there's people in east period at that time not obviously actually but uh and then the night before launch i remember one guy writing i i got three more moments for you they're all quick but the night before launch one guy in the telegram group said this is better than any christmas i cannot wait for tomorrow and when i read that i was like oh really like i'm also excited but that's that's true like you realize i just said i wanted to cats to [ __ ] on the blockchain like it's been a week i swear to god we spent a week at axioms zen going to meetings about at what point do you hand the sperm to the other cat smart contact transactions there was like baggy sperm meetings that were legit scheduled it was very professional is that what the calendar event said it was like disgust cat sperm it was it was a whole thing uh about three days after we launched no no no it was before we launched so we had a private beta we let a couple people like start it was the real cats but it was like a little private space and the guy who worked at axiom zen but not on the project at all like very not related to what we were doing came up to me and said thanks for the trip to vietnam and i was like what do you [ __ ] mean he said well i just sold two thousand dollars with crypto kitties and i'm going to vietnam and that's because you and they're like people who were using ripple kitties at that time were like you know 10 people in the office and 50 people not in the office and again i was like huh and then the last one i i'm you're calling me right now in my parents house i now live here built a nice little house me and my family we all live here very cute but at the time i did not live here and at the time i was staying in the basement it was three days after we launched and i walked upstairs and two things happened at once one somebody sent me a message it was like you just sold a cat for thirty thousand dollars which i now i know now like in our multi-million dollar blah blah blah like right that seems like nothing but at the time at the time nothing like this had ever happened i promise you and and and we're like oh [ __ ] and we melted ethereum like our website was broken the network was down everything was broken i'm not smart enough to know what any of that means just that like my phone is exploding yeah you just knew there were people you worked with who were very freaked out we [ __ ] up everything and we built a 30 000 cat and it was at that point literally that we're all just like and that was day of launch when was the thirty thousand dollar cat three days i think it was three days uh i think it was three days later i'm pretty sure like at least the way i have now encoded the story in my head i know where i was i can see the stairwell over there and i think it was three days after lunch uh and yeah then it was just like okay this is fundamentally different like we don't know what we're getting into and do you think were people at the time really into it because they were actually like oh this is this is a fun game like i want to play this or or was it like the novelty of it and the people who were already blockchain enthusiast enthusiasts was like oh amazing a new use case for this technology i love um most people who are very blockchain native hated cryptic police most people who were very blockchain native were legit like the icos were everywhere we talked about right before we turned on the thing i wrote a blog post when we launched called [ __ ] your ico because the thing to do in blockchain at the time was to write a white paper and you would write a white paper and you would say if you give me wild wild amounts of money here's the thing that i'm going to claim to do in the future and this was a business model that worked a bunch of well i don't know kind of sounds like road maps but like wanting more money is that yeah no it made the distinction their 25 million dollars it was it was it was a crazy time and and we went out and said we're gonna do something different this was fundamentally different we said we're going to build a product and we're going to ship a product and then you can pay us for it if you want that doesn't sound revolutionary that's called business for the last like thousands of years in human history but at that moment in blockchain that was very strange and very different and was very good uh but a lot of people in blockchain didn't like us be in ethereum didn't like us because of our success like truly and honestly we crippled the network we brought it to its knees many people messaged me saying [ __ ] you take your cats off this network we're trying to do important work and you are [ __ ] it all up and for like six hours i was i felt terrible i was like oh what have we done and like sorry we were just trying to play around and like oh no we heard ethereum and after six hours i started laughing and i like kind of haven't stopped laughing since the batman who laughs over here like it's just too much that you can't handle my cats like that that was just you can't handle my cats couldn't handle it all these dudes who thought that they were gonna take down the government because they had like great libertarian values and great ideas on how technology could destroy the middlemen and they couldn't handle my pink [ __ ] cats and that was the moment where i was like oh i'm the bad guy i'm the villain and i think that the villain with the pink cats is my new hero so you are bringing new people into into the space and just so i'm clear on this because i was i was like vaguely aware of eth back in 2017 but i was not following the icos i told you this before we joined i like saw i had a colleague i worked with who was like showing me cryptokitties and i was like the [ __ ] is this like so weird and like pieced out from it you know um and so at the time all these icos were basically the difference between an nft thing today is they were trying to raise like 25 million dollars or these these massive sums of money and it wasn't even a piece of art like there was no clear utility tied to it correctly it was basically just like bitcoin did it really well so come give us your money because we're a variation on bitcoin is that is that a fair way to characterize what all these icos were uh no yeah no no no no that's like reasonably accurate um in every case it was like we are going to release a coin soon and that coin is going to be valuable because more people after you are going to want that i want to buy it so it's it feels a little mlm which i sometimes accuse that very very very mlm okay multi-level marketing scheme multi-level marketing for those who don't who don't know mlms okay and so you come along and it strikes me that you're sort of a character that was not as you said not natively interested in being in the blockchain but it was a crypto i was the kid crypto kitties and i was all the kitty not the crypto and you had this crypto friend and and was and he was like all right you have to come do this and so you being more of a consumer-oriented i know people kind of a person were just the the perspective that at that point the community was sort of missing in the people who are building on it that's what it sort of feels like to me does that that that's sort of i know you're gonna be humble about it but that's sort of fair you were like all right i get consumers so i'm gonna do this thing that's gonna make all the purists really mad but it's actually gonna get consumers into this space i didn't realize we would make purists mad when we started uh i just thought that we could make something that people wanted and understood and that was different and new and to be clear we did a bunch of so i have a like sort of hypothesis or a strategy or something about launching these things that is significant and it involves being true to the purists until you hit the tipping point so the way cryptokitties like spiral out of control in the best way possible spiraled up into the stratosphere was that we made a bunch of decisions like the price of cryptokitties was listed in ethereum that didn't make sense to almost anybody at the time why would you listen to ethereum it's not in us dollars everybody here is thinking us dollars and we're like oh well we're making this for people who have ethereum and user theorem we know diagrams a lot but the goal of cryptokitties was to be infamous we didn't plan on making millions and millions of millions of dollars we left the door open so that we could that was rohan's genius me and dieter were gonna do a certain thing and rohan was like guys like make sure that they can give us lots of money if they want to thank god he did that was very like rohan's very smart what were you what were you going to do ah honestly i was thinking about this i was trying to remember there was right near the end there was a key decision that rohan came in on and it was like it wasn't like add a zero but when we remake the walls wolf of wall street movie later about this and sometimes [ __ ] he basically was like just add a zero like yeah why did you why like why did it like charge more or it was just like charge more to charge more charge an order of magnitude more let them pay an order of magnitude more uh and we should talk about the crypto kitty's pricing algorithm that is one of the [ __ ] smartest things i've ever seen in my life that was all dieter that was not me by any means but uh we did a bunch of stuff that was really honestly true and native to the ethereum ecosystem including having rock solid smart contracts like to be clear that 721 standard with these cute little cats and this pink website everybody else was doing matrix [ __ ] it was like a green writing vertical and like black background this is syria but it's a block that's the future twitter whatever he's doing and we're like we're gonna do cat puns our community is a super fun place to hang out like but that mattered a pink website with cat puns well-designed play i won't even go so far as to call it a well-designed game but well-designed play and then rock-solid technology underneath it all a bunch of those things appealed to the ethereum people if we had made trash then the people who came in and were like oh yeah i have thirty thousand dollars in internet money to spend on this would not have once the people came and spent thirty thousand dollars and then another day late or something you know what thirty thousand might have been day one in three days it was a hundred thousand dollars because there was also a hundred thousand dollar cat moment where we're just like okay like [ __ ] the wheels have come off this is this uh what have we done i i don't want to speak for them i had a whoo what a moment and but at that point the new york times comes along when you sell a picture of a [ __ ] cartoon cat for a hundred thousand dollars on the internet then you hit a tipping point and the mass comes so when we're building these things like yes i was always thinking about the consumer and that's just how i can't help not think that way that's sort of how i'm wired but being authentic to the community that was in place where we showed up these people who had values and like we did not appeal to the libertarian fundamental nature but not everybody loves the ethereum i make fun of them everybody who loves ethereum is a neckbeard with a [ __ ] libertarian vent oh i'm the first person this is true i'm the first person ever to use the word neckbeard in the new york times there's a there's a twitter robot that will scour the new york times and find first-time uses of words and after i did one of my new york times interviews about this and i always used to use this line with libertarians and that because that's just like a sound better guy i got a tweet that was like congratulations you're the first person to ever say next year i was like okay wow that's that's that that's like goes in the the twitter bio or the resume or the linkedin you no longer have that or the tombstone or the or the tombstone um i actually do want to talk about this pricing structure if you're serious about wanting to talk about it and why it was surprising it's dead simple but it's beautiful so cryptokitties i mean we did a bunch of [ __ ] so well and a bunch of [ __ ] really stupid and uh one of the things that dieter put together was this pricing mechanism so at the time on the blockchain nobody could figure out english auctions these standard auctions that we're now used to where like you have 24 hours and the price is going up so we have to use dutch auctions and dutch auctions are where you have a starting price and you have an end price that is lower than the starting price and during a set period of time the price goes from the starting price to the end and the reason that's interesting is because anybody can buy it whenever they want and obviously you should wait longer because the price is going down but if you wait too long somebody else will stop it so it's a very interesting use of auctions for price discovery which is the unsolvable problem in launching new products how much should i charge for this and so cryptokitties was interesting every 15 minutes for one year we released a new cash that is how we made money that was the main way that we made money and there were some other little things that we did but this was the vast majority of the income and it was a significant amount of income every 15 minutes the clock cap got released that's what we called them quadcasts and they come back for one year it was 96 a day and so 365 000 functionally over the course of the year a little bit less than that and the pricing was beautiful the pricing was the average price of the last five plus fifty percent and so the price would go up and it would go up and up and up and it would get astronomically high and people would finally be like [ __ ] that i'm not paying that much for a quant cat and then the price would come down because it was a dutch auction and when it got to whatever was deemed reasonable at the time then it would get bought and that got included in the next batch and so you had this constantly fluctuating floating price floating that's my new word and it was incredibly dynamic way to understand what people were willing to pay and then because most people weren't around for cryptic kitties the thing that made crippy kitty so interesting was that you might get a new gene inside those cats we had this big gene puzzle and the only way to get new jeans which was like the low number exclusive [ __ ] if you're a collector you understand this but the only way to get that hot new [ __ ] you couldn't get anywhere else was by buying our clock cats and then unboxing it basically and seeing like oh it doesn't have one of the special stuff and sometimes you could see it when you physically looked at it you'd be like oh that one looks cool but sometimes there would be a real secret lock deep inside the jeans we built this weird-ass gene structure around that game and so that clock cat i don't see i have never seen that repeated and i'm not totally clear on why because i've also never seen a better way to kind of price something again where people want to give you a lot of [ __ ] money this is a method by which they can but if people decide that uh what you're selling isn't worth that they can discover a price that they feel is rational and it kind of like serves everybody really well that's yeah that's so interesting and you know i've seen dutch auctions done plenty of time since then but never quite in the way you're describing there um was this being done on like a bespoke website like openc was around but obviously very new this is like you had you're obviously bespoke openc wasn't it was started around that time though maybe it wasn't like as far as i know i could be wrong but as far as i know open c was born to make crypticities usable like oh wow there were other spawned it all you spawned literally all of it we created a large series of problems and many people have come along to solve many of those problems you should hear dana open c talk about the open c mafia you know you people like with the paypal mafia so there's a kitty hats mafia the one of the first things that ever exists on top of crypto kitties was kitty hats hats on cats and a small team of people came together in our discord became friends and built cats on hats one of them is employee number one at open c now one of them is employee number one at axe infiniti one of them is the lead designer at dapper and two others played significant roles in consumer revolution and this was kitty hats this was hats on cats it's like you know this is what's so beautiful about this space and and because there is the like underdogs versus the institutions element obviously to crypto and like you know like wall street bets bringing down melvin capital and like all these people with a huge position on on uh on gamestop like putting a limit at like 4 20 69. like and these people are bringing down like massive institutional hedge funds then it's like the people who are bringing down the future of banks all met because they were like put cats on hats like yeah it's like i got [ __ ] hate always coming back to this but dixon wasn't wrong the next big thing looks like a toy my my latest hypothesis is that what he was wrong is too strong of word what he was he was too narrow i don't think the next big thing starts is the toys limited to technology i think the next big thing starts as a toy is culture period pink haired rappers all my shitty 40 year old friends [ __ ] hate soundcloud rap they hate that emo mumbly pink haired [ __ ] and they sound like their parents talking about rap they're like they're not even rapping like oh god i [ __ ] hate the auto tube those guys like can they even freestyle it's like sharp old man what the [ __ ] do you care this is these kids are making art and and art like the impressionist art movement that became such a big deal in pairs uh rock and roll as we know it like so many massive trends in art and culture started out looking like a toy you have so many people who who who've thought that defy was how crypto was going to go mainstream and it's now so clear and i guess should have been clear from the beginning that it was going to be nfts and art and music and weird cat games and like everything we know about the internet has been leading us to this point uh but it's it's just so eminent now because it's all identity people don't buy content people honestly don't spend that much time thinking about investing like normal people don't d5 is really great for everybody who's smart enough to figure it out nobody who's a [ __ ] normal human being understands what the [ __ ] d5 is going on about but identity people care deeply about and nfts are really just a placeholder for identity the heart of that here's a very weird specific question were there royalties baked in to cryptokitty sales like are you still getting some of that sweet sweet cryptokitty money uh let me think about what we did what we said was that so dieter again whose name has come up very smart guy the cto the architect engineer the guy behind the 721 standard and and a lot of my ideas about crypto are um a byproduct of basically studying in his school i think of it like kung fu [ __ ] like i got beater style you know and uh in theater style if you own an nft then you should truly own it you don't have to pay us royalties you don't have to do a goddamn thing because you own that [ __ ] on the other hand if you want to use our website to perform a transaction we will charge you a fee and so that's what we did with pribicides if you were going to breed them or if you were going to buy i honestly forget if we check i don't think we take a cut if you were just selling them we said like that's not our business you own it so you should be able to sell it there's no royalties it's not ours uh but on the breeding of the cats which was the main mechanic we always said you can go do that on your own build your own marketplace if you want build your own website call a smart contract directly but if you go to cryptokitties.com and use rui to do this yes we take a small fee for that got it um so you've kind of made reference to this in this conversation and i've heard you talk about it in other conversations where after cryptokitties or at a certain point in that phase all this major ip started coming to you and including and the nba which i think leads us to nba top shot that actually surprises me so hey like really like did you have all these companies and brands were coming to you saying hey we want a piece of this and then b how many of them really got it and how many of them were just like chasing a trend that they saw temporarily um [Music] yes they all truly just came knocked on our doors it was every major brand it was every vc it was every ip owner i mean not every everything exaggeration but like in droves they wrote uh they came to our door where this was that after the new york times like they like read it in the new york times were like no the new york times wasn't even that we just were making like like millions and millions of dollars selling cartoon pictures of cats and whether you were jurassic park or the nba or dr zeus or anybody it was like what hmm why why are people paying so much money for your pictures of my cast they're just making memes out of our [ __ ] we got our [ __ ] on giphy and somebody gave you millions of dollars for your ship how about you give us one of those this was like a this was a thing that everybody was feeling uh because yeah and to be clear because of the icy odom like right now you know um crazy summer of or spring and summer of of uh nfts and we're on saturday night live and like we've all just lived through this insanity that is this recent spin of enemies the last time [ __ ] was this crazy was 2017. one of the things that we got right with cryptokitties was just the timing and the line that i used to use a lot but is true is that like if a knitting magazine could find a way to write a print article about blockchain in november of 2017 they would have everybody wanted to have some way to write bitcoin in their link-based [ __ ] or it wasn't blockchains like bitcoin block saying that so in that time when everybody needed to have an angle anybody whose job involved technology their work needed to have some kind of informed opinion on the blockchain that's when we showed up and we're like yeah you sell cat [ __ ] for a lot of money what so yeah everybody came and then oh yeah no most of them didn't really get it not at all no most of them are like well and there's an interesting question of what they got like i've just told you about kitty cats kitty hats kitty hats was hats on cats and it was amazing and it has led to hundreds of millions of dollars of business value being created by the people who organize themselves in our discord to come up with that [ __ ] uh and the fundamental concept of kitty hats is one of the biggest ideas in blockchain us at the time which was extensibility somebody else built kitty races it was a [ __ ] dumbass car racing game but you put your cat in the car and you race it and the thing about kitty hats that i loved i was telling the story the other day and dance as i'm lying when i tell a bum hello anyways first time i seen kitty hats my reaction was [ __ ] you you didn't ask us for permission why the [ __ ] are you putting hats on my cats those are my cats or somebody was like dude like this is the blockchain you're missing the point exactly you remember the conversation we had about extensibility and about how really cool this is and then me having this moment of life oh that is cool like as long as i'm not being disney about this when as long as i'm not being so [ __ ] precious about my little mickey mouse here this is really really neat people are coming along and building value into this product into this ip and this network and ecosystem that we're trying to build these people came and built value for our consumers which builds values for us this is [ __ ] incredible actually that decentralization and extensibility is a beautiful piece of blockchain and you'll notice that nba is not doing that so when a lot of these brands come this goes back to your question of who actually got it very few got it nba are very interesting and i salute them for being the pioneers that they are they have made a [ __ ] ton of money for being pioneers to be clear like top shot has been very good to nba but that wasn't obvious they took the risk building that and even then my point is they've leaned into parts of blockchain that work well for them which is true ownership of these moments and the economics around it and some of the sort of blockchain primitives that build up this ecosystem for sure but this other huge ideas that they definitely don't want anything to do with which is like oh yeah we're going to remix the nba brand because this is extensibility no you're not really not everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives

one way to to do this and i'm putting you on the spot here but it feels like what you did in the cryptokitties era was identify these ways to be really innovative in the space and and the big piece i think you brought to that was just understanding consumer behavior and saying hey nobody's tapping into consumer behavior in the blockchain right now the industry has obviously gotten more sophisticated since those days but do you feel like there are gaps right now or or real areas for innovation that you see or you're excited about again i'm putting you on the spot yeah no no no i i i so nfts are interesting if you give people what they want then you will be stuck in the present or the past and so like sometimes i get mad when people like oh i'll tell you about oni ronan people like why are you like spending thousands of dollars trying to teach us about history we just want pixelated animal pictures that's like what we're here for we want to flick our pixelated animal picture in the next 72 hours to make a lot of money that's why we love nfts and you're like cool don't buy my project very much please though and i don't want your angry dms there are others who will get it or if it was dms i wouldn't even mind is the fact that they're like rage tweeting in public [ __ ] uh in 2017 the way to make money in blockchain was to do an ico and we told everybody to go [ __ ] themselves and we made nfts we absolutely understood where the ball was where the ball was going and we said neither of those is right actually we're [ __ ] walking due west from here and a lot of other people thought they knew that and they tried to walk west and we don't hear their stories right you never hear the stories of all the microwaves that didn't make it at some point somebody invented a microwave and we're like oh that was kind of obvious but there's a thousand inventions like microwave that didn't [ __ ] make it the point is that we had to have vision around the 720 standard and around playfulness around true ownership and non-fungibility underlying all of that so now oni ronan is a new project from big club big club makes strange marvelous nfts that stand the test of time i say that all the time that is our motto it's on our website i find strange and marvelous nfts that stand the test of time that's it that's that's the magic and if we can deliver that then we'll be doing this for a very [ __ ] long time which seems like it's probably gonna work out but one of the things that we did is if you're watching on the video only running behind me uh we went and took okay so i have a book actually you probably see it right here oh okay it's hard with the i'm not japanese i'm getting word out of time japanese death poems yeah dropping his death phones so i started learning about japanese death phones and someone i would attempt to write a haiku as close as possible to his or her last breath the last moment that you were alive you try and write your death bone and the like the most hipster samurai points you can get is if you get it like you you you you finish the pen drops and you die if you could do that all in one smooth motion you're the best [ __ ] samurai definitely to live well gosh in that world morbid i dude i go on twitter and just read that death book people in twitter spaces sometimes for fun so those haiku were amazing some of them were written decades before people died like not everybody succeeded at nailing it but you're trying to write it right again okay so i love that essay um i was talking to a japanese friend of mine who gave me the nickname because it means big hands because he used to hang out with me at dapper when we were making all the stuff we'd go get drunk at the bar he's the old japanese guy that i met and we'd go get drunk at the bar and then we'll go back to the office and we'd do hogwarts lego because it axioms in dapper they always had lego for me because i liked lego a lot and so sam one of the co-founders he liked lego too he would buy fancy lego and would sit around do lego i mean that would me and my guy his name i don't use for certain reasons we got into it arguing getting along having so much fun building like a lego he gave me my japanese nickname and then i was talking to him about these death bones and samurai history and the nft thing became inevitable that we needed to make uh nfts to celebrate the haiku of the samurai death poem form and that's where ronin came about so in all of that we ended up creating these crazy things i called my old neighbor i was like man you want to make demon samurai art and he was like okay side note that guy was my neighbor for 15 years i lived in a one bedroom apartment with my wife and two kids for [ __ ] 12 years i didn't have kids for the whole 12 years but for 12 years i lived in a one bedroom apartment this guy was my neighbor right now he's buying an island nope he's buying a house he's buying a house on an island i have to go to canada because all the money i gave him for these [ __ ] ronin that he made for us like we change artists lives with this [ __ ] so i went to him and i was like we need samurai and me and my japanese friend did all the design on this we did all of the research to find these haiku and so in the background of that guy behind me you can see a real haiku written in smoke that is a real haiku that a man or woman summary class wrote in the last 800 years and when you take your oni ronin which i think have the best art in nfcs this year outside of maybe galaxy eggs because i really like the galaxy eggs as well uh in that world you can commit you run into the trial of ascension and then you can listen to the haiku for the first time we actually uh we got like this incredible narrator to narrate each of the 20 possible haiku that you can get it's one of the rare characteristics like everything else about the nft and then and then we deliver amazing art we deliver like historical context interesting audio the technology is rock solid we did this entire interesting like reserve phase to stop gas wars on the launch of the whole thing and now i'm getting to the point of this we reached out to a guy who teaches at concordia a big university in america he teaches about samurai history he also teaches the big head club about summer history the only way to get a class from that guy with small intimate group is to own one of these ronin nft he got a hold of me his name is dr bender and he said you know you could literally put together the best curriculum on samurai history in the english language if you hired five of my friends and i was like okay done like of course that's [ __ ] amazing we have haiku lessons we have calligraphy lessons we have flower arranging lessons and the only way to get access to any of this is to own an oni roman the idea that we can redefine education and community dr bender messaged me after first class we did our first class this week and i was so [ __ ] worried about how it go but my team is amazing i had nothing to do with it they just made it happen and i showed up and honestly me and my wife sat there and had this [ __ ] incredible hour of history lessons with japanese seriously so cool and he messaged me and he's like it's so nice to teach a group of people who want to be there and listen and learn and they're not doing this for credits they're doing this because they're like oh wow in the middle of a wednesday yes i want to learn from this this is an incredibly interesting idea around what nfts can be we have ridiculous fantasy like some of these [ __ ] things have got like hardcore death metal hands sticking out of their heads this is just weird ass art it's also historically accurate interesting context it's also incredible community we're doing [ __ ] zen meditation three times a week as a community if you want to join we unlock all that [ __ ] with these on your own and the idea that you can have community-powered education is really really interesting and i don't see anybody else talking about that and a bunch of the people that i've talked to are like i don't want that i want a companion drop that i can flip in three days yeah like cool do you do you still think about the floor price or are you like anybody's in the education program no no no no no you don't get to build an education program if you don't think about the solar price nobody's going to come to your [ __ ] education program then it doesn't matter yes i think about the floor price uh i do not nor will i ever use the word investment to describe what we do two reasons one the sec is real i'm in canada i still don't want to go to your american jail this is not an investment this is not financial advice this is not an investment do not buy a big england token as an investment the other reason is because i really like if you were buying this because you want to have the crypto punk experience that i had this is not for you i do believe that many of our nfps will in the future be able to be sold for lots of money i think if that's why you're here you're here for the wrong reasons and you are not bringing real value to my community my community started it's been a long six months it's been a long six months and we now have what is consistently one of the nicest kindest most thoughtful gentle communities in the world our discord is [ __ ] amazing our mods are amazing and people are warm and gentle and it's a little chaotic at best because there's 25 000 [ __ ] people in there and so sometimes it's a little mad but it is a beautiful amazing place where we are now treating each other respectfully we're learning about history we are shaping the future of art and if that sounds like a [ __ ] good idea then you should come get yourself a big head club token if you're like man i need 10x returns where's my yield and i need this on a timeline measured in hours and or days there's lots of cool projects for you like you should go do that you probably shouldn't go do that over here let's talk about some of the other big head club projects we've talked about oni ronin which is the latest drop very cool stoner cats was the first drop which made a bunch of noise uh how how did you get involved in stoner cats you know how did you end up on zoom calls with mila and ashton and the the crew uh the true answer to that story is and we don't talk about the fact that we've raised a bunch of money but we raised a bunch of money for big head club uh not a bunch of money especially not in [ __ ] 2021 in empty space we raised a little bit of money we raised a few crypto punks and uh exactly exactly we a lot money's cheap right now let me put it down yeah uh we raised a little bit of money and i got to this moment where like literally in three days of sort of calling a couple friends it was like okay we've raised as much money as we want to like it was soft committed but it was very easy i mean i'm the crypto kitty [ __ ] top shot dapper guy in the middle of an nfd renaissance obviously it was reasonably easy yeah it's who do you want money from not who yeah and that's an incredible privilege i would not don't let me betray like how lucky i feel about that and almost actually to your point i i got sort of closed the rounds air quotes in three days looked around and was like wow every single person at this table has a dick like every one of you has a penis and that's a problem because i am a 40 year old straight white man with more privilege than most people could ever even [ __ ] conceive of and i think it is in exactly this moment but i'm supposed to share that privilege this is exactly what i'm supposed to be like oh hold on like maybe there's another side of me that bought a wonder woman crypto punk steps up so something's gotta give yeah sometimes i gotta give him so i called all of my investors and i was like hey um i would like to meet some of your friends i would like to meet some amazing investors who are women i would like to bring some other perspectives to this table do you know anybody great that i should talk to and through that process i met a woman named maria and maria works at sound ventures and so i was talking to mari a bunch and she's become a very good friend of mine i hold mario in very high regard but during all of that um mario mario works with ashton and so maria is part of what we call 3050 gang who are behind summer cats and as her and i were talking about nfts and she's she's a full dj she [ __ ] loves these nfc she like can't not buy this [ __ ] and sell the [ __ ] and she's like so deep in the life it's amazing and so while we were we called each other regularly sending each other funny gifts and doctor with nfd's models and stuff and she was like hey my friend mila is like working on this project and we've got this amazing content and we're trying to figure out how nfts can work to like make this work and we just talked about a bunch of different ideas like being like that's a bad idea that's stupid why did you think it was stupid they just had some optimistic and totally unrealistic ideas about what entities could be or should be and to be honest i've forgotten what a lot of them were but it was weeks of me talking to mario regularly being like no that that's dumb like you're smart but that's dumb and then eventually she was like [ __ ] you come talk to milo and i was like oh okay talk to me okay and then we did and we yeah that's how i ended up following neil in ashland for the first time and then that just became a regular thing and they sort of became friends and and uh and eventually we came up with thundercats as as we defined it and that worked pretty goddamn well to be honest has there been anything that has surprised you about that project or that you've learned that was substantially different from dapper that that is a nine hour list and so we won't go into all of it um what have i learned i mean the cartoons are slower to make than you think i've certainly learned that i don't make cartoons but i partner with people that do and i've learned a lot about that process i've learned a lot about the time of that business uh i've learned a lot about doubts i didn't learn anything about dao's while at uh you and i have had a couple conversations about dows yeah the trials and tribulation of the dow life so much to learn um and to be honest like you know not being around the bush we learned about celebrity we we were excited about that project because we were bringing people and i honestly fought with the thought is a strong word i discussed loudly with them for weeks about what nfts mean and the value of nfps and all sorts of things and we were super psyched to do that project and then a bunch of these shitlords who think of themselves as the kings of nfts were like oh you brought cash grabbing celebrities to our ecosystem [ __ ] you first of all it's not your ecosystem second of all i spend more time in discord talking to my community helping them build up the data helping them figure out what's next trying to do cool stuff for that community then probably any project on earth i realize that's bold gary spends a lot of [ __ ] time in his disclosure i'm in gary's discord uh that guy's very good at what he does very smart guy uh so yeah we learned a lot about community building and i know i don't want to keep you for too long but what's what's your one big takeaway around community building that you got from stone or cats never stop never stop never like like remember that everybody could be having a bad day remember that everybody uh who's here cares for a reason you know i've had people even in cryptokitties on cryptokitties the price would go down i think they're good sometimes and i have people message me and be like i spent my rent money on cryptokitties and the price is going down you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] and on the one hand i would be like wow no actually you're the [ __ ] i'm just some dude on the internet trying to make things that are fun but on the other hand and like you're dumb [ __ ] clearly but you're dumb as [ __ ] and your rent is on the line yeah that sucks like that's a terrible place to be in and so community building like if you're serious about it you're you're there for people their bad days we have people who like snap in our discord and then i go dm then i'm like hey for months you've been really cool like really [ __ ] cool and you were just really mean to a bunch of people that you know and like why would you do that oh well my husband just walked out on me 48 hours ago i'm i'm reeling from that no [ __ ] yeah that really sucks now nobody saw that people just saw you being shitty on discord again or for the first time and if you're really serious about building community like all these anonymous [ __ ] animal profile communities that can often disappear in the middle of night they don't have to really worry about community my name is on the ship we're gonna be doing this for years and years and years i was gonna ask this do you think it's important that senior people on a project be the ones also in a discord versus just having call it a team of mods who are maybe intermediaries i don't think it has to be the senior people i think it has to be people who are empowered to serve that community and so if like i i'm very much a senior person i'm the ceo of the company uh i'm in discord because right now that's the right place for me to do that community is so valuable to us to create value for my companies to create value for that community those two things cannot be pulled apart there is a world in the future where i don't actually spend all that much time in discord um there's a lot of other things that could be doing do i hear uh wistfulness in your voice when i see the sunshine and i go outside and i feel the wind on my face there is nothing like the random dms from strangers in discord that are like i love what you're building here please never stop we get we get like heartwarming tear to your eye tight moments and discord in public in private all the time and it's [ __ ] beautiful and then other times those people just when next episode when floor moves 16 hours a day we're in here bleeding for you [ __ ] people we're working on it my friend so yes occasionally i wishly wishfully wistfully try and get out of the store occasionally all i want to do is pop in a discard our discord is such a nice place to do this it's incredible it's so like like i discord used to be taxing and discord is now honestly where i go for a bump it's like if i need to feel good i should just go say something funny and discord and people are like man we love you i'm like yeah thank you i'm gonna go to my next meeting now uh but but no you don't need senior people in the discord you need people who are empowered to serve the community in the district i want to get close to wrapping up i have so many more questions i could ask the first thing i want to shout out ghostbusters so yes that's your next launch is big head club you have like the the rights to the ghostbuster ip to make it an nft is that what's going on we do we have so this is an incredible project because sony is fully on board with this i talk to sony uh twice a week every week sony is super excited for this but sony is not leading this project jason reitman and gil keenan are leaving this project and they're the director and the writer director slash writer and writer of this movie so the guy who directed the first two ghostbuster movies his name ivan wrightman uh he's a legend in the filmmaking world his son is named jason his son made juno he made thank you for not smoking oh thank you for smoking and now he's doing the new ghostbusters movie so jason and gail fell in love with nfts jason and gill got a hold of me and were like hey we have this really cool concept for nfps can we do this and i was like yeah so long as it's not four stripe adidas [ __ ] like i can't go make off-brand ghostbuster [ __ ] interviews and they're like no no dude like [ __ ] you we are the director of the movie like my dad directed the original this is a family legacy for us but this is not sony's project this is our project with sony's blessing and and so then we're like oh well [ __ ] this is really cool and so yes ghostbuster nfc's ghostbusters afterlife movie dropping on november 19th we have a campaign called 12 days of afterlife i will let people decipher when that starts and we have some [ __ ] amazing nfts and a really neat sort of community experience built out around that coming soon any hints you can give on that uh i would tell you that i would tell you that at one point baby yoda took over the internet as the most interesting thing on the internet and that you should consider what creatures and characters might exist in the ghostbusters movie that people are calling the next baby yoda okay that gives me a lot to think about i will contemplate that one final two questions first one do you think nfts are mainstream right now uh yes i don't i i don't uh let's let's think about that um i don't think most people on earth have ever bought supreme brain clothing i don't think that my mother knows what supreme is i do think that supreme is mainstream i think of nft is the same way like is it walmart no but do most if you throw a rock and hit somebody they probably have an opinion on an nft they probably don't own one but they probably have an opinion on them how recently do you think that happened uh last six months that's it could have just been me but that skit on saturday night live at the beginning of the summer really felt like like a sort of a crescendo crescendo is the wrong word because we're not on the way down like you know i i really do think they're i don't i guess it depends what you mean by mainstream i like that thing i just said that everybody has an opinion very few people own them right like coinbase is coming twitter is coming facebook just sharing the name to meta real mainstream is still coming this is not walmart but you're not an interesting obscure person because you have a [ __ ] opinion on nfts anymore okay in 2018 you were asked in an interview what you think like make a prediction for the crypto art nft world in five years this is what you said where is it uh i think crypto collectibles are going to be a meaningful part of people's identities in five years not one but in five years will you will be able to point to your crypto collectible profile online and say these i own and they matter to me and you can understand me by understanding my crypto collectibles that struck me because it has been so on point we are already there within a certain part of the population i think over the next three years you still have three years left for this prediction to come true you'll increasingly see that be true like you kind of nailed it in a big way so of course my final question to you is what is your prediction for the next five years of nft's crypto collectibles um [Music] in the early days of facebook the like most interesting feature on facebook was the poke and it literally do you remember the pump yeah yeah and you have poke street it was like how many days have we been poking each other back and forth oh my god like he must like me he poked me you know 30 days in a row my favorite question was would you poke your boss on facebook and most people would be like no and it was like well why not like what is the what is the poke and so for anybody who wasn't paying attention to time the poke was a feature you could you could poke somebody but what that meant was never stated there was no consequence for that there was no output it was just this arbitrarily odd digital behavior that that was odd and still somehow acts as a kernel for the entire social experience this many years later it it's not hard to see how the facebook poke seed became our notification centric hyperware plugged in connected reality so one one thing that i either heard or said or somebody told me i don't know across the time an idea came up that what facebook did was make something that was uh until then organic which is relationships and friendships it made them digital and it made them explosive you had to outright say i send a friend request we have a transaction that indicates we've crossed some threshold like before we just used to get a ride home in the same person's car from the party three times but i was never like hey you're my car seat buddy and we're friends i'm like that's cool now now now we're sending friend requests and it became explicit in digital and i essentially feel like we are at that point with nfts i feel like things are like yes you can go look at your constellation and say value me because you were looking the world i described and where we're going to get with these twitter profiles and all these things in this like showtime and the sense that you should go to a specific place and in this digital and explicit way you should see me trying to peacock myself and represent myself with these entities and i think where we're getting to is just like where facebook is far more nuanced not just facebook but the social experience is not an explicit poke the social experience is i mean there are uh multitudes of interactions that we can have that add context and are subtle and they're more than that and less than that and they all feel very natural at this point that's where we're going with these energies we'll get to a point where i will look at your instagram profile or your tick tock not profile but just like your picture and your profiles and there'll be three nfts in your tic tac profile and nobody's gonna be like oh yeah look at my nfts you'd just be like oh that's cool they got the thing from ghostbusters yeah we know that you paid for it because of course you did because it's 2026 and people pay for digital things that matter to them because their identity matters to them and we will simply have um dissolved away all of the explicitness and all of the all of the like i have to poke you i have to you look at my nfts no it's just our identity it's just who we are that's what they love it i think you're going to end up in a place where like you're on dating apps and instead of it like you going to you're like more interested or maybe not more interested but you're equally interested in checking their co-apps and nfts and you know all of that stuff and it's more informative to you than their instagram or tech talk profile or it's all integrated into one four years ago i called the head of product at tinder who was a friend and i said you should allow us to use nfts as a way of representing yourself and it'd be super fun to put an experiment in tinder where like yeah you spent money on this nft that means you care about it that means it's a good representation itself [ __ ] the song i've listened to on spotify most this week like that's just whatever year where my head what matters to me is uh these mts that i bought like let's let's do a test let's do that tinder and the guy i think jim morris jmj is the angel guy on twitter uh he said for me to run an experiment i have to believe it can make me a hundred million dollars that is the scale of tinder and so what you're talking about makes a lot of sense he legit got anything you're selling cats [ __ ] i'm selling human
