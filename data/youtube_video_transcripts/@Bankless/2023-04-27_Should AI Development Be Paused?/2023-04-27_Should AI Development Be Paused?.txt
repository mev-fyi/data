there has been an open letter Elon Musk signed in Andrew Yang the open letter states that we should pause all AI development for six months have you signed this letter you think it's a good idea I didn't sign the letter the six-month pause does not actually help that much I think the main thing we need to do is get in a position where we are prepared to slow down based on risk and then be ready to slow down potentially much more than this potentially six months potentially like whatever it takes but I think slow AI development by years would probably come with a kind of tremendous human cost
