monolith.xyz bankless nation it is the first week of december it is friday morning it's time for your weekly roll up what are we gonna do today david we're rolling them up we are rolling them up we bring this to you every friday morning and this is our best attempt at taking everything that happened in crypto and consolidating this to about 25 30 minutes we do this in five sections we hit market we hit releases we hit news some hot takes and then we end with what we are both excited about this comes out as i said every friday morning on both the podcast and youtube so you can check it in both places david you ready to get started it's an ambitious endeavor to try and roll up the week of crypto and especially this week because so much happened but we are about to attempt just that so let's dive right into this okay we are enough nothing if not ambitious david hoffman so let's go bitcoin price we're talking markets what happened in bitcoin price from this week to last my friend from last week to this i should say so uh according to certain exchanges we've actually passed previous all-time highs however there hasn't really been that fanfare and from what i can gather from the bitcoin community they don't really count all-time highs until we break 20 000 so while some exchanges have recorded all-time highs i think everyone is holding off the big celebrations until 20k is breached and that's funny so that price was just like tempting us right i i saw some i think it's like maybe fortune or forbes i saw some mainstream media report the all-time high but i didn't yet see crypto twitter really celebrate it so that must be why right there yeah it didn't quite get there it just right it's just the tip just interesting feature of the crypto world that like you know each exchange has their own reporting of the bitcoin price therefore there's not one central place of what is the price of bitcoin and so there is no actual like truth of to what the bitcoin price is so we don't actually know what the all-time high is and so people are just using like all right we'll just call it twenty thousand dollars only a matter of time though when you're like we're just creeping right up there okay uh bitcoin on ethereum is that up or down that is down that is down a pretty big amount uh 3 300 btc left the ethereum ecosystem we are now at 140 and 400 of bitcoin people selling their bitcoin buying ether david what do you think well even if they did that it would still stay on ethereum that's true all right let's talk ether price i had a pretty ether had a pretty good week as well and um had a good week on the network side we're going to talk about that but from a price perspective we moved from about 500 something like the low 500s 504 on this missouri chart to 612 right now who knows what will be tomorrow morning but possibly in that area that's a big move yeah ether rejecting the 500 is pretty pretty hard but also not necessarily being accepted by the 600s ether price has been really really volatile it's gone from 620 down to 570 like three or four times lately and it's just bouncing around but like to me to me it looks like it's just a matter of time it could be any minute now but before like the low 600s finally give way and it's just clear skies ahead of us but what's going to happen is it going to follow bitcoin does it need to wait for bitcoin or is it off on its own crusade the second the second usually i wouldn't have such a clear answer but december is the best month for ether historically five out of five times ether pumps in december and it also pumps verse bitcoin in december uh and it is now december 4th uh you know sometimes that that historical price movements have started earlier in the last weeks of november sometimes it's actually been later into the first weeks of january but uh historically the last parts of the year are really really bullish for either all right you heard it here folks uh youth price going to launch in december or so david hoffman predicts it's not going to follow bitcoin it's going to forge its own territory this is such an interesting uh graph that i saw this week from um who is it i am cryptowolf i don't know who this anonymous account is he's a decently known crypto trader account yeah okay fantastic all right on the bottom is the bitcoin price from 2015 2014 to about 2017 into 2018 so like the last bull run and you can see kind of the the pattern that it makes like from a from a crash all the way back to recovery and then in the top you see ether and this is uh more recent this is from like the crash of 2018 2019 up to now and this looks like a very similar pattern right we've talked so much about crypto market cycles happening happening in these fractal patterns i guess the interesting question here is is ether bitcoin circa 2016 2015 2016 and is it going to repeat this kind of price move what's your take yeah i i've always been a fan of this theory it's uh people would say that maybe that's like overly simplistic or overly reductive but i think at the end of the day like there's a common denominator this industry moves in cycles ethereum uh has been one cycle behind bitcoin its entire lifespan well i do think ethereum moves at an accelerated rate compared to bitcoin simply because it's kind of drafting in bitcoin's wake i think it's totally valid to like kind of come compare bitcoins previous cycle to ethereum's uh current cycle which means that we are just like ready to lift off on east price but that also means because the numbers were similar of course market caps are different but the the actual unit numbers are similar i mean bitcoin went from like 200 to 20 000 right in the last bull run so i mean if we repeated that in ethereum right we'd be we'd be going from like 300 400 where we are now right to 20 000 possibly well yeah the dip the depths of this last bear market for ether was like 100-ish dollars right and so maybe maybe maybe you know that kind of plays into the 10k meme i think we're gonna blow past 10k and but maybe not for that long but yeah that puts us in the right range and if we want to compare cycle for cycle that is super uh bullish and that would also be very crazy these market caps are much higher but this is something i found interesting this is the new token uh terminal screen and if you sort by most people sort by market cap but i like this metric david which is price to sales metric and if you look at all of the crypto assets from a price to sales perspective this is almost similar to a p e ratio there's also price to sales ratio in stocks ether right now is about 86 86 x price to sales zoom i i was interesting like zoom stock we're using zoom right now to record this it's at about 90. so it's has a higher price to sales ratio than ether and then ethereum right now and by the way this means that um ethereum is like for your dollar invested in ethereum it is producing more fee revenue than zoom shares right now plus it has all of these other attributes like being an actual collateral money being like a global money system growing like crazy um it just still at this price point feels incredibly overvalued by these sorts of metrics what's your take yeah i mean undervalued undervalued under value yeah you heard it here from ryan like sell your zoom stock buy but yeah yeah that's what i'm saying exactly uh total lock value in d5 that had a bump last week right what what was the change yeah 600 14.1 billion to 14.7 billion in the last seven days meanwhile uh dpi uh also d5 pulses product has gone up from 100 108 dollars to 116.30 pretty impressive all right so d5 had a good week as well um how about let's see here should we talk about stable coins a little bit we've now got 20 billion we hit the 20 billion milestone in terms of the amount of stable coins in crypto the vast majority of that on ethereum right now that's a 300 year-to-date surge yeah the the best thing to take away from this is like this is stable coins the rise of stable coins on on ethereum and just using crypto payment rails is indicative of the value of the technology in its purest sense like people people that were like you know blockchain not bitcoin or like infrastructure not non-sovereign sovereign money i mean first off they were wrong but they were still right about the technology and the 20 billion dollars of stable coins using this technology is indicative of how incredibly valuable this is simply as like payments infrastructure let's just get dollars onto crypto payment rails and use them and then the the second to third fourth order consequences of this is just like more liquidity for ether more liquidity for bitcoin more tools in your financial tool belt bullish absolutely last thing that's bullish we got to move on um defy lending is at an all-time high as well in terms of loans originated in compound in ave from last month to this month there was an 88 month over month increase so d5 loans d5 protocols continuing to attract more capital and get larger and larger and larger david we spent a lot of time on market today let's let's breeze through releases what was the first release we should talk about i don't know did something happen this week i felt like i felt like something big happened this week yeah it was a big release um oh here's ethereum yeah there's ethereum right yeah the thing we're we've been waiting for for like the last five years actually shipped actually happened this is the first block that we're that we're showing you on screen what about this it's not quite as inspirational as the genesis block of bitcoin but certainly reflects the permissionless world of ethereum somebody in the genesis block wrote this mr f was here yeah so in each block in eth2 you as a validator have the ability to graffiti something so you get to write a short little snippet in the first block that was mined in ethereum 2.0 mr f was here was graffiti apparently this is a reference to queen mr fahrenheit is something that like vitalik signed a piece of paper for like forever ago i don't know the full story but yeah it's definitely already a meme and just i'm looking forward to this meme like growing and maturing not quite as inspirational as chancellor on the brink of a second bailout but here we have it we've launched ethereum it's what it is it is what it is okay let's talk about um ether capital and this is super cool i stumbled across this and actually david we're gonna have ether capital on the podcast i think we're recording next week so sometime december you guys will check this out but this is a publicly traded company that is primarily a holding company for ether so they're on the um toronto stock market exchange so basically it's a canadian pokey traded company and you can buy them and generally they're just holding ether on their balance statement they do a few other things but uh it's a way for investors to get exposure in their traditional legacy brokerage accounts to ether the asset just by buying this stock and they are raising another 125 million in common shares guess what they're gonna do with this david hoffman i think they might buy ether with it i think they might uh the last time they purchased um was i believe in like 2017 2018 they and they like bought at kind of a a different price range but they're gearing up to purchase and hold more eth what's really interesting about this report is they actually go through and and define what is value what is valuable about ether the asset and do you know what the core thesis is david tell me ryan it's triple point assets oh weird so we we see some of these ethereum narratives bleeding and making their way into institutional investment circles into publicly traded companies this is almost like the the micro strategy of of bitcoin right like i i don't know why this doesn't get reported but there's a publicly traded company that only has ether on their balance statement and they're creating more common stock to go buy more ether and they've got a great value proposition um like delineated out including like risks and upside and all of these things for investors in a public report i think that's pretty cool man that that is super cool and they cr hats off to these guys they've been around like they've they've went through the bear market with the rest of us uh relatively quietly i would say um i mean they're they're not really anyone yeah they helped um and yeah super looking forward to having them on the podcast there's about to be a ton of just overall bowl case for ethereum podcast episodes coming out so definitely get uh stay tuned for that one uh i've already sent this prospectus i think is what this is to a few people in my circles uh who just would appreciate specific content that kind of fits like the legacy mold of what a report looks like um this report plus the missouri report on ether like is really indicative of the different narratives and different just models of ether and ethereum that has really just come to be known as canon truth and that is something that i'm really really excited about yeah that's part one of the story part two of the stories are actually staking too so this is the first publicly traded company that is actually taking some of their eth and staking it the internet bond concept turning ether into a productive asset well these guys are doing it i don't think this will be the last publicly traded company to stake ether i think in the future there could be a time in the future where we see most financial fortune 500 companies and certainly tech companies with ether staking nodes like that is the future i would not be surprised in the office yes i would not be surprised to end the decade with that as an outcome um so i'm sure there'll be more there let's talk about some mistaking rewards so the exchanges are getting into the game we've got coinbase announcing the launch of ethereum two staking as well and finance of course they had to one-up coinbase and they're like yeah give give us your eth and we will double your rewards your staking rewards not quite sure how they're going to do that yeah but what's your take on this game i mean we knew this was coming centralized taking as a service provider like there's just too lucrative it's too easy to make money it's it's basically a free money service that like especially with things like coinbase and finances using infrastructure that they already have set up um it's this is like you know one part good for ethereum because this is just how ethereum becomes adopted right like we want ethereum to be easy to use it triggers my uh defensive reflexes you know if too many centralized taking as a service providers crop up and and start staking too much east that's not ideal um but for now like i'm i'm i'm happy to see like that this the staking of ether is becoming like industrialized and institutionalized this is still important in the long term for sure yeah absolutely as long as there is a healthy balance we will be monitoring that um speaking of health i guess this is the a metric metric for health of the network we've been talking a lot about ethereum's future scarcity engine eip1559 which improves the gas markets on ethereum both in eth2 and in eth1 but also burns eth as blocks are used it's going to be really cool mechanism there was a report put together a whole economic study on eip 1559 by somebody i believe uh maybe tim brunell okay tim rough garden from cornell anyway what's the tl dr of this report the report just came out it like we've been waiting for it for several months now what what's the conclusion yeah tim tim ruff garden is an expert in his field and so this has been a highly anticipated report that a lot of people that were putting on the breaks in eip155 were like waiting to see this report until they took off the brakes right like a lot of people who were like more cautious uh wanted to just like make uh eip1559 just go through a few more hoops this was one of the last hoops that they were waiting for so now that this is here uh that we have just a lot more confidence that you know eip1559 is going to do the things that we want it to and so you know it's just full steam ahead take off the brakes on eip1559 yeah the summary that tim came out with is basically yes it does what it um sets out to do and tends to do from my analysis uh and some prominent folks in the ethereum development community uh saw this report and uh are saying the same thing yes this is exactly what we needed full steam ahead it seems like with eip 1559. that is good news speaking of full steam ahead uh vitalik put together an updated version of an ethereum road map here and it's good to see a number of these things with progress bars this time in particular you might see sort of this this green circle here phase zero launch that has happened fully but you can get like a bird's eye view of all of the different work streams that are going on across ethereum and their progress toward completion the next really big um i think deliverable of course is going to be phase one but after that the one i'm most looking forward to is this eth one to eth2 merge but in addition to these major milestones all of this work activity is happening to continue to improve the ethereum network what's your take on this roadmap david yeah this is how you understand ethereum in all of its glory like every single component of ethereum that's being in development being worked on being integrated is here vitalik's made it for you check out the link in the show notes if you actually want to check it out it will be made available to you uh the inclusion of the progress bars is just a nice little thing for people who who don't understand all these things which like you know i don't understand like 50 of these things uh the progress bars is nice like no cool i actually know exactly how far along we are in these things at least according to vitalik's relatively unbiased head yeah it's it's also crazy the the construction process that you see here because we're literally building a trust computer and we're doing it across all sorts of time zones and teams and geographies in decentralized ways yeah it's just amazing how this thing is being built just uh a crazy cool a decentralized bizarre way that it's all coming together and i love it all right um speaking of releases david we should talk about the ave v2 on mainnet if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways but a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dytx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing we should talk about the ave v2 on mainnet so obvi has been an important lending borrowing protocol and they just went live on mainnet this team never stops shipping any highlights on v2 that you want to emphasize david yeah this is where the ave protocol goes from being you know kind of backstopped by a centralized team to really being back dropped by the community and specifically backstopped by the ave token and the most important thing i think about v2 is the inclusion of just like being able to stake your ave to bear the risk of the protocol but also receive extra rewards and so like that that's a good token model in my eyes tokens that have risk in them should also have rewards and that's how the ave token is changing in this particular v2 um that makes me excited about just like you know overall good mechanism design in the space yup big release from the ave team all right david we should conclude releases and jump over to news some big news this week too i'm the first is not the fact that ethereum 2 is launched but the fact that the ethereum to launch actually made mainstream media cnbc i've actually never seen a technical launch like this make mainstream media that wasn't like front page i you know i'm not sure that it was reported on tv or anything but this is some at least mild exposure to what's going on what's your take here yeah it's interesting they didn't include ethereum in the title the title of the piece is the world's second biggest cryptocurrency is getting a major upgrade here's what you need to know yeah but i mean headlines or headlines like you know you read that but you see ethereum yeah absolutely um i think the biggest news this week is this though david visa partners with this isn't forbes visa partners with ethereum digital dollar startup that raised 271 million dollars when you get into the body of this what this is actually saying is visa is partnering with circle to allow usdc circle stablecoin that is primarily uh settled on ethereum today they're connecting visas connecting its 60 million vendors giving them the ability to essentially settle payment uh settle receivable transactions using usdc as a stablecoin eventually maybe issuing visa cards against it as well this is a huge win for coins in general for usdc and circle specifically but all of this is going to be using ethereum as the final settlement layer because that's where usdc's liquidity lives which is super exciting because i think it's part of the trend that we're going to continue to see which is large payment processors and fintech companies are slowly migrating out existing banking infrastructure and swapping that out for crypto based infrastructure with uh ledgers like ethereum what's your take here yeah i don't i don't think that you when visa is running uscc through its credit cards that will be making a transaction on ethereum i think it's going to be like its own off chain like l2 but the ultimately at the end of the day the balance of usdc is held on ethereum right and so like maybe different claims about one particular balance of uscc on ethereum is being shuffled around in the visa network um and that doesn't make it to ethereum but like the overarching balance of usdc is still determined by ethereum so i i don't know if that's do you know what the actual nature of this is yeah so i mean basically they will continue to do a ton of usdc transactions on their own private ledgers right side chains like in their own databases but ultimately the usdc lives on ethereum right so if you ever want to settle between visa and someone else you might use something like ethereum or you could just bypass that and use you know trusted side chains if you will like coinbase like circle like usdc or like it's it's claims for usdc in a specific ethereum address exactly right so the primary the primary i think the cool thing about this is essentially it's it's a swapping out of um using existing financial banking infrastructure for assets that ultimately get settled on ethereum right and of course you could still do these in your own private ledger at a lot of that transact they're not not all of these transactions will happen on the ethereum network obviously that would totally bog down the network we don't want that um but ultimately they can settle on ethereum what this also does is it gets visa into the ethereum and crypto world so now that they can support near c20 like usdc what other erc20s can they support in the future what does this continue to unlock so it's a it's a baby step but i think it's a super important step that in 2017 i mean something like this would be like absolutely mind-blowing and now it's starting to happen and uh i don't think the world is yet noticed the other thing it did is it ethereum always wins this thumb war right like ethereum got put under visa right and what does that remind you of like that's the protocol sync thesis yes so you know ethereum visa is now built on ethereum congrats visa yeah well it's uh yeah absolutely and i think more and more that will that will be the case with some of these fintech companies david another exciting development i'm not sure if i have a link about it oh i well i've got my own tweet it's not self-serving all right uh smp the smp so standards and poor's um they have this s p 500 index and they also maintained the dow jones index well in 2021 they're actually going to launch a crypto specific index i think that's pretty big that is piercing into the mainstream financial indices of the world david it's an important signal that mainstream finance is starting to take notice of what's going on in crypto any thoughts here uh no i'm i'm bullish all right bullish uh we should talk about bad gov and good gov i feel like we have some things that the government is uh messing up or some actions that are maybe negative for crypto but also some things that are positive for crypto going on almost every time when we do these roll ups the first one this is probably a bad gov thing is we've got this uh stable act it's called legislation that's just a bill right now i'm not sure that it has a chance of passing but can you describe what this bill is this is a a us bill in congress right now yeah this bill the reason why it's bad is first off it fundamentally misunderstands how these systems work right and so like the the maximum extent of this bill would hold any node providers or validator nodes or anybody doing any mining of ethereum to be responsible for any sort of like uh you a stable coin financial activity that goes against uh laws right so if you if somebody makes a usdc transaction that quote unquote breaks the law like you as a node operator of the of the ethereum network in the in the most strict sense of this interpretation of this bill could be liable for processing that transaction so like what the like totally ridiculous like that doesn't make any sense uh and it's also totally arguable that like even with this legislation in place this doesn't actually do anything just a pure example of just bad regulation it like it's it's disruptive of innovation and doesn't actually do anything good yeah well i mean i i think the big thing is the whole notion of this bill is very couched in we we want to help um like those who are in lower socioeconomic classes because stable coins are predatory towards them and i'm not sure that that is really um like i'm not sure that anybody in like lower socioeconomic classes are actually using stable coins today i mean there are things like uh short-term loans and like you know payday lending that sort of thing there's like lottery systems that uh i think there's a strong argument that those things do predatory but not stable coins i mean stable coins are just being used by a bunch of crypto geeks today like us right yeah um so there there's that piece but the the other piece is in order to to help this uh group of people the legislation is actually saying that any stable coin issuer would have to register as a bank you have to get a bank charter so you have to essentially get the fed's permission so this includes protocols like maker dow which is also ridiculous absolutely and of course uh banks themselves have been known to restrict access to all sorts of of people in the united states and obviously across the world and discriminate against them actively and something like ethereum getting an etherdress all you need is a keyboard and an internet connection and there's no bias like it's completely incredibly neutral doesn't care how much money you have uh how much you make like what color your skin is anything and you can get a bankless bank account so i don't know david do they just not understand what's going on or is this like malicious this bill is not bankless that's not what that is all right well i don't want to do a quick show here of uh get coins round eight just started and yeah center which is the basically the protective shield of uh around the crypto industry from bad legislation like this they've already made a blog post about how terrible this bill is so go read that i'm also going to include that in the show notes and also consider donating to coin center's bitcoin fund yeah absolutely they're doing important work in dc let's talk good gov because you know we've often said almost every week we see a new central bank uh talking about going digital i think this is going to be a boon to crypto of course this is not the same thing as crypto but moving into the digital world is probably going to have a strong link with crypto the latest is the bank of canada that is accelerating its digital currency plans you know why they're accelerating david it's really because kovit so the pandemic has kind of accelerated plans for all central banks to become a bit more digital and that moves all central banking systems a bit more towards digital currency and ultimately towards cryptocurrency any takes here yeah uh no it's to be expected there's going to be a constant massive reorientation of the financial system over the next you know one two five ten years uh the i saw a meme recently uh i won't try and describe it but basically uh there is the central banks of the world are going to go and just route around the commercial banks of the world by issuing their central bank digital currencies and then the meme i saw was like well then the commercial banks are just going to adopt like cryptocurrencies right because they're allowed to do that and so like there's going to be just a massive reorientation and that's kind of the path that i see ahead of us yeah and it does feel like all of the institutions are scrambling to figure out where their new seat at the table is and some of them don't even realize there's a new table set up so i haven't even begun to scramble but they will find out soon okay last thing we should talk about is this um in china do you remember that yeah major crypto ponzi scheme called plus okay so the chinese police have seized 4.2 billion dollars this is all funds from the ponzi sc scheme uh plus token they cracked down they found the people behind it and now they've confiscated the funds how much bitcoin and ether is this david yeah the chinese government sees a hundred and ninety four thousand bitcoin and eight hundred and thirty three thousand ether that so like the majority of this value dollar wise is bitcoin like roughly 75 percent and then the remaining like there's like uh 20 of that is ether and then there's some like you know ghost ghost chain coins as well uh that's a lot of bitcoin that's also a ton of ether it's more ether than the ethereum foundation has that's that's crazy but where is it going that's this is the crazy part of the story where is it all going it's going to the balance sheets of the chinese government yeah it's going to their national treasury yeah it's like all right let's put put that one in the bank and like all right staking on these two right guys wow so now the chinese national treasury has more funds than the ethereum foundation i wonder how this all shakes out do they keep that do they sell it i want to know how privy are they to like the world of crypto like are they like all right cool let's  dump this and get our captain run or are they like sweet we own part of ethereum like what's their knowledge like there's probably a crazy story behind how they got the private keys too um don't want to know that one i don't want to know that one either anyway moving on okay that's news uh hot dates david what are you what are you thinking about this week yeah i i was kind of alluding to it just now with the chinese bank digital currency but like the world of crypto feels like this asteroid that's coming to the world of finance right and like everyone sees it the central banks see it uh the the commercial banks see it the payment processors see it the people see it and like we're all reacting differently it's like all right how are we about to like absorb this asteroid and i feel like for the people the easiest answer and the easiest option is like oh we just we just buy bitcoin we just buy ether like we just hop on board the asteroid like that's how we like absorb that shock uh central banks are trying to absorb that shock by pivoting to central bank digital currencies payment processors are trying to absorb the asteroid by like like using using crypto assets on their payment rails everyone's responding differently but like what we do know is that the entire financial world seems to be like bracing for impact for this massive just like collision of two worlds that everyone thinks is going to happen over the next like one to like four years so like that's that's my take so it's an asteroid for some is your take but it's not an asteroid for for everyone because it's not a destruction asteroid it's a just a big deal asteroid it's okay it's just going to shake things up and change everything it's going to be a reset in the way that the internet was a reset for a whole bunch of countries and nations and um that sort of thing okay gotcha yeah so i mean do you do you think all of them see it coming or some just like you know the dinosaurs they're just like walking around doing their thing and you know suddenly the sky's on fire and all your friends are dead yeah totally there's there's definitely going to be a spectrum of like institutions that are like doing a good job preparing for this or like totally naive and the ones that are naive about crypto at this late in the game like the ones that are just putting a blind eye like they're not gonna make it they're not they're not ready for this for what's coming yeah absolutely all right ryan what's your take okay so i um was struck this week by again by the inevitability of of crypto right there's obviously uh demographics in in favor like who under 35 do you know favors gold over over crypto right now like personal favorite like not a single person right so i mean there's just this inevitability about it but the pandemic that happened this year i feel like moved up the timeline by about three to five years on all of these things and someone asked me like i tweeted something like that out and someone asked me well like why what were the what were the factors and i think it comes down to four things probably for me the first is the pandemic caused everyone to go a bit more digitally native than they previously were like david we've talked about before you and i have never met in person ever never right like but we're able to accomplish everything we need to for bankless and for our work and for clients high functioning of individuals yes i mean but i i i spend more time on screens than i ever have so do so so does everyone i know basically like it's like we've we're all more plugged into the digital and so things that are digital will obviously benefit from that tech companies for sure but digital currencies and digital nations and digital worlds will will benefit from this metaverse that we are starting to plug ourselves into so that's number one the second is this decry decreased trust in institutions right um there's this overall perception that governments failed with covid right whether like to what degree that's true versus not there's still the perception that our institutions totally failed us right so we don't trust government any more and that was true before covet too true before covet but all of these things uh act as an acceleration right the digital was true before covet but we've probably moved up the timeline for crypto with three to five years because of the pandemic the third is this this illusion of money and that's all money is i'm reading that jacob goldstein book that you recommended to me david on money right yeah we're going to ask him to come onto the pod in the future oh he needs to man because his basic premise is from the very beginning he goes to the history of money he's like oh money is just a belief system right something we said often on bank bus and it is well what happened in covid is the illusion of money just became less real why because we're getting represented helicopter money like we're printing it we're getting checks and it's like oh this scarce asset that we thought you had to go work to earn well now the government is sending us checks for this money and they can just print it at a whim right and so we start to think of ourselves well maybe it's not that scarce and like why are we paying taxes and then we start to think too we start to think too much about money and when you start to think too much about an illusion it's like a magic trick right you start to think about that illusion you're like well you know it's gone it's not real like the magic leaves so there's an element of that the we're thinking more about money and so the illusion is sort of dissipating into this mirage and that's going to corrode the fiat system i think in favor of crypto and the last is this um an acceleration of central bank digital currency and the reason they're doing this of course is because modern monetary policy requires it right in order to get all the dials you need like negative interest rates or the ability to incent people to spend money or save money it's really valuable to have a um centralized bank digital currency where you can tweak those styles a little bit like we're at qe maximum we can't even like do any more qe so that as a monetary policy measure has kind of extended its life and the only thing we can do now is digitize all of our all of our fiat money and effectively play with more of the dials so that if you if you own central bank digital currency in your digital wallet let's say well this particular month the fed has dictated that we're actually going to like decrease rates by one percent and you're going to get negative yield and there's kind of nothing you could do about it the fed really needs these types of knobs to do what you know helicopter money to to change kind of yields in the way that they need to in the future so all of this david i feel like has totally hit the accelerator hit the gas pedal on the coming of crypto like without cove like without kovid and i'm not saying covets a good thing i'm just saying this is what's what's happening um crypto would probably take another three to five years to get to the place where i think it's going to be in the next couple of years right yeah no that makes sense to me and and i'm reminded of uh i'm reminded of our episode with ben hunt which we labeled like the people's narrative and that what he talks about with his newsletter epsilon theory is he talks about like the alpha and beta of markets which are like the fundamentals but the epsilon which is what he claims to be equally important as part of markets is like people's perceptions of what's valuable people's thoughts about what's valuable and i'm also reminded of a lot of the work that brandon quitting has been putting out lately called like bitcoin in the fourth turning fourth turning is this book about how like there's this time period called a circulum of 90 years long and it's basically one long life span and how there's always this turning of the wheel like roughly every 90 years there's this big just shift this cataclysmic change in perception usually correlated with some event but not always but it's a just a complete restructuring of how people think about the world and that's what i'm seeing with like money managers like paul tudor drones who are waking up to bitcoin that's people understanding that like ethereum is the last bastion of yield in the world uh and then exactly what you were talking about about like moving digitally like sooner faster quicker the world perception is reorienting now we're losing trust in institutions we're gaining trust in in cryptocurrencies uh and just all at once people's focus and attention if like you like we keep using that sauron image of like the eye of sauron if the eye of sauron is like one amalgamation of everyone in the world like it's redirecting focus into different places different solutions different financial systems different monies different different realms of existence in the metaverse in the digital world and it's all happening at once and so i'm i totally see it too paradigm shift all right david let's talk about what are you excited about these days in crypto yeah in the same vein of like things moving online i'm really excited for new friends to come into the world of ethereum over the next like one to two to three years like this is the time where people where ethereum as a community expands this is where we like welcome in new people into the world right and so i'm excited to see all the new people come i really want to i really want to meet them i want to see i want to see who they are why are they coming to ethereum now like what is their perception of ethereum like as a newbie you know crypto has a little bit of for everyone and like as covid rears its big ugly head like yet again in this big wave like we're all stuck at home now and like not only does like crypto provide you financial tools but it also does a lot of other stuff too there's a lot of positive second third fourth order consequences that are comes with like stuff on ethereum that's that's community that's like collaborative projects that's mutual endeavors that's and like it's doing it in an online like no contact environment so like as people are shut in like they're going to learn about ethereum and they're going to find their niche in ethereum they're going to join the community they're going to join the conversation our community is going to be richer as a result of that and i'm excited to just with open arms as everyone that comes in say hi that that's so cool david i mean it could be the case the smartest people in crypto haven't even joined crypto yet and they're coming like the next generation a bunch of interesting people are going to enter this space very exciting stuff yeah what are you excited about ryan all right i feel like i'm excited because we are so early the three most important events in my opinion crypto january 3rd 20 to 2009 the launch of bitcoin right july 30th 2015 the launch of ethereum and then just this week december 2nd 2020 the launch of eth2 and the ether bond and the last one at each of these events they were barely noticed by mainstream media including the last one right uh there's 5 000 people on the live streams that we did for the genesis block just 5 000 right i mean if people knew the significance of this it would be broadcast across cnbc and cnn and all major media and it wasn't which makes me all the more bullish because neither was the launch of ethereum neither was the satoshi white paper in the launch of bitcoin so number one we're early that's pretty exciting the second thing is the truth is now out there david we talked to missouri they got the narratives right mainstream crypto media is actually starting to get ethereum right and what do i mean by that well there's like they're starting to understand ether as an asset and i feel like that seed has been planted from the missouri report we did a state of the nation on it here's a quote it is very likely that once eath one merges with e2 ethereum will not only become the most secure blockchain but also the one with the most credibly low monetary policy right a scarce asset ethos money that's what we've been saying for the last two years and the narrative seed is now planted we don't even have to do anything that seed is planted it's just going to continue to grow and it's almost inevitable going back to that so we've launched we're early the seeds planted it's in i feel like the future is now inevitable it's just going to continue to grow um and i'm excited to be part of it along for the ride as they say we're gonna do our little part but um so much of this is just gonna grow just based on like that that wheel you're talking about like it's kind of unstoppable at this point yeah and and this is why community in crypto is so incredibly important like ryan you were beating the drum i was reading the drum anthony was beating the drum eric connor was beating the drum about like how how some of the economics of ethereum are going to turn it into the coolest blockchain ever basically and that is that is like the ethos money narrative the ethos bond like the security of the ethereum network all these things that we've been beating the drum for the last two years finally coming into reality as we said they would uh and now now that you like you like you said it's bubbling up to like places like missouri and so like we couldn't have done that without a community of people like all saying the same things like that's where that came from uh and so if you ever in the depths of the bear market said you know like ethan's money or any of the other things like a triple point asset like secure most secure blockchain reduce issuance proof of stake reduce issuance via eip1559 you had a part in that role as well absolutely all right david i think we went a little bit over but there's just so much happening this week you guys needed to know we roll it all up for you as we do friday mornings hope you're enjoying yourself and you enjoy the weekend this has been the weekly roll-up with david hoffman and ryan sean adams from bankless december is the best month for ether  candice
