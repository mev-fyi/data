Elon Musk is finally in charge of Twitter hey bankless Nation it is November 2022 already David Ryan it's the bankless Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere into the frontier of crypto nonetheless with what Ryan a cup of coffee the packing one do you have one yeah it's just something you say you're not taking your own advice David no I had I brewed one one pour over in my Chemex and I drank the whole thing and that's enough you gotta loot yourself I mean but like a few weeks ago you came in here with three you really yeah I I drank like two or three sips at the third and I had to pour it out because like this is gonna regret this to give me too much yeah yeah diminishing returns on the flavor the flavor it's yeah and it becomes not even about the flavor it becomes about the kind of the caffeine yeah and then you like you know you start to know you have a problem um and then you're just owned by the caffeine and you know on bankless run I'm just not about being owned the self-sovereign individual yeah right you don't want to be owned by caffeine Freedom Beyond by carbs you don't want to be owned by Banks oh my God what a freedom Maximus get these dopamine hits out of my face yeah well you didn't know you were signing up for an anti-coffee movement but I suppose you are even though David tells you to drink a cup of coffee with the weekly roll up David we got some exciting topics for the week first Elon Twitter takeover and what this means for crypto we're going to dive into that what else uh coming up after that meta and Instagram going full send into nfts what does that even mean and then of course Ryan we were talking about this before the show you and I both like Rick and Morty uh did you know the Rick and Morty Creator is in the world of nfts in a big way are cobblers it's called Art cobblers gobble gobble gobble that was big I feel like almost nfts are back we're gonna get into all of that guys yeah it's not your typical nft drop that's for sure it's not it's not um this is not your typical airdrop finder either want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at earnify there are some airdrop finders in the market but they surface a whole lot of spam what's an airdrop finder you plug in your eth address or your binance address or your Cosmos address any evm chain also Cosmos and it will automatically check to see if you are eligible for cool stuff like airdrops like nfts like poapps also provide you some alerting for things like ens this is the way to find your uncleaned airdrops David I've had a lot of success with earnify probably made me ten thousand dollars plus wow in perks wow what you can do David is you can put your wallets inside of the earnify tool and it will find you all sorts of airdrops that you can collect here's ensere drop than I picked up uh some po apps that I picked up as well oh did we did we miss uh an ens on the bankless multi-sig that's what it says oh did we really uh oh we should have signed up for earnify a little bit earlier oh man that's sad oh we lost 4 500 oh no see what happens when you don't use certain if I've been using unify when you made the multi-sig damn well how should folks get started with earnifies so they don't make the mistakes that bankless has made in the past yeah because as we clearly have uh we've already knew this but also just as a reminder airdrops also expire which is why you need an airdrop notification service to be the Sentry for all of your wallets and all of your airdrops so the link in the show notes earn I dot f I earn I dot f i to get started plug in your wallets uh sign up so you can get notified so you never miss an expiring airdrop like Ryan and I did on our bankless multi-stick whoops embarrassing that is embarrassing all right bitcoin price what are we looking at this week David Bitcoin start of the week at 20 600 down 1.7 ish percent to twenty thousand three hundred not that much not that much that's nice down a little bit how about eth flat start of the week at 15 50 ending the week at 15 50. 15 50. interesting line number 1550 and then so what does that mean for the ratio uh ratio is up 1.7 start uh starting the week at .075 ending that we get .076 probably noise I mean ratio is still climbing a little bit but like not much on the week uh does this mean anything to you um I mean we like that 0.75 and above number that's for sure how about uh total crypto market cap we above or below a trillion uh above a trillion 1.052 trillion up about one uh ten ten billion dollars versus last week the highest on that uh trillion is we got to 3 trillion last Market cycle wow 22 that was back in November 2021. do you know that was the top yeah I'm a reminder that Meme of Wolverine just like longingly looking at that picture yeah do you know are are you like so I wasn't really excited about that excited at the top no I I just felt like there was still like there was a lot of froth I mean yeah it felt good at the Algos it felt dirty it felt dirty just like the Ico Mania filter they felt mini it felt dirty in like late 2017 and it felt also dirty in like late 2021 like I was happy about some of the but but there's there's clearly so much that needed to be flushed out and uh so yeah once again this is kind of a healthy process let's talk about the FED it's what they're doing healthy I'm not so sure we'll see stocks tumble after fed signals rate hikes are here to stay so the FED of course announced that they are increasing rate hikes they're increasing interest rate by 75 basis points that was pretty much expected and just to go through a recap of History the 2022 hike so far March we went up 25 basis points of 0.25 percent in May 50 basis points then we had four straight uh basis point hikes of 0.75 75 basis points and so now the FED fund range is 3.75 to 4.0 percent that's where we are now at first stocks were excited about this and kind of happy David and then prices took a tumble up especially when particularly when Powell said we have a ways to go this is not quite a direct quote it's it's sort of a a summary he said it's premature to think about pausing rates the possibility of a soft Landing is narrowed because inflation has not come down with the rate hikes that is what we're looking at an analyst said there were no hints of dovishness to indicate that the FED may be poised to pause what do you think about this yeah I mean I think this is par for the course is more or less what we've been expecting there's nothing really new here I think the market is starting to get like fatigued about like asking the question pivot soon uh and like there's like there's two players in the market there's like ha like crypto prices went from 1300 to 1600 like we're off the floors like the bear Market rally and people are just like all being super naive that like the global macro economy still kind of go into uh and like that is a long process not a short process so we're like punctuated by this overall bear Market by like short-term blips of like liveliness in in markets but then when we zoom out we're like oh it's still bad still pretty bad well what do you think about our uh episode with macro elf earlier this week was that sort of um is that was that what you expected or was that more bearish than you expected yeah that's kind of where I started thinking about like ah like this there's if you zoom in on the charts things don't look so bad things look like kind of choppy with some ups and some things to be happy about but if he's the more you zoom out the more it looks like damn and we are in a downtrend and that downtrend has not been broken and macro Alpha and other people are like yeah guys the downtrend uh is going to continue being a downtrend yeah he's like it's part of the cycle and that's what 2023 is going to be is as well it's either flat or down we're not flat it sounds like 2023's flat is like best case scenario yes and then macro elf thinks that there could be a cyclical change you know starting around 2024 but we still have a ways to go is like the meme is like yes the pivot is coming but not yet if the pivot's coming when like Bitcoin is below ten thousand dollars who cares well you know that might Mark the floor here's a take from Pablo macro okay quickly on the FED no pause coming harder Landing is likely is what was said among many other things but what was unsaid here's what was unsaid Powell was asked about a plus 50 basis point in December and he dodged saying it's about the pace what level we got wait we get to and how long we stay there but he left it open but also he'll have to open 75 basis points and he implicitly left 100 basis points open in all caps here he does not know the road is wide open so the chairman is leaving all possibilities on the table no dovish talk um and he also talked about inflation is where it was a year ago if that is Powell he needs to go to eight percent three percent real inflation he will do it because he has an alphabet soup of programs he can use to pick up the pieces he would rather break stuff and then patch it back together because that is easier than letting it get entrenched so I think Apollo macro here is saying that the FED will like from everything that Powell is saying he is incredibly hawkish and he wants to break the back of inflation uh and he's not going to change course until he starts to see inflation uh recede and he'd rather get to the point of actually breaking things because it's easier to piece them back together uh than to cause kind of of you know the precipitous than to correct the precipitous problem of of inflation which we're plagued with so there's that take David I guess my only counter maybe to this take is just because Powell wants to break inflation and he wants to be hawkish doesn't mean he actually gets to do that so it's not like Central Banker Jerome Powell has infinite power and the ability to do exactly what he wants there are constraints and one of the chief constraints is political will so what happens if the politicians start to push him back try to rein him in we've seen reaction to the politics of of the scenario from Powell before and I think that could mean like just because Powell is saying these things just because this is his intent what he would do if he were Emperor God King he is not any of those things and has to respond to the political climate as well which might mean a pivot will come sooner than he would wish what's your thought yeah that was the other thing that stuck out to me about the macro Alf um uh episode that we did and it's just like so aligned with everyone who's in macro like dalio Lynn Alden all these people that are like long-term cycle focused people like there's this universe acceptance that like once you go above the Federal Reserve it's the people and it's the structures of power and it's like the people that are in power want to stay in power and the only reason that they stay in power is they make like the plebs of the world not upset which makes like Powell a beholden to the emotional like aggregate of the entire economy uh and so like the the riled upness of of the people of the world actually does matter is like part of like fundamentals it's like how riled up is the people well and that goes to kind of the next chart we wanted to show this is a chart showing the uh personal savings rate that's the blue line here that you see personal savings rate of citizens in the US and then the red line here is the Consumer loans rate so this is credit cards other revolving plans and look at this this is pro the past since um since the early 2000s I'll scroll this all the way to early 2000 uh and you see the Blue Line personal uh savings rate you know kind of like uh edging in between um five and let's call it ten percent or so and then during covid look what happens stimulus checks uh 2022. a personal savings rate of about like close to 35 percent at its peak and that was in March of of 2020 when Americans had a lot of money in the bank and plus you also they started to pay off their credit cards another debt you can see like as personal savings jumped up to like basically you know all-time highs since this chart shows it's the one time you actually see Consumer loans actually go down yeah so credit card debt is being paid off a little bit here but what you see from uh March of uh 2020 up to now is this not not so gradual I would say pretty steep decline in personal savings right all the way David to where we are now is uh we have less than five percent low since 2002. 3.1 percent personal savings rate so we meanwhile the Consumer loans line just skyrockets to all-time highs so now we're even in a worse place and to get a benchmark this is kind of like it's not necessarily all-time all-time lows but uh for the past 20 years yeah right we're we're at the chart lows and this is lower David than or about the same as 2008. okay which is pretty crazy to me so at the same personal savings rate right now as 2008 and do you remember what 2008 felt like I mean I was a naive little kid so it did not feel like Good Times yeah it did not feel like good times and so we're back there again so this is what um Powell I think has to has to balance fed actions and all politicians do is like uh Americans I think people around the world but this chart is um the US in particular there's a lot of pain right now people are out of savings look at this debt David this the Consumer Debt is at all-time highs as well if that that is the most aggressive line up and to the right on this whole chart and like the thing is like we're at this point now where we're like all time like chart highs on Consumer loans loans chart lows on personal savings rate and if it just like stays here if it stays flat that's like you know the like boiling the Frog like if it stays here it's bad like and it's and it's trending upwards I mean no wonder this is uh from our Ben Hunt episode no wonder everyone's at each other's throats yeah yeah I mean like we're not growing the pie we're dividing the pie we're not growing the pie we're absolutely dividing pie that's what's happening right now anyway that's the macro situation look at a bit Grim so let's talk about some brighter news on the uh the crypto side of things and what's this number we're looking at yeah this is pseudo Theos tweeting out the real flipping already happened layer twos now regularly execute more transactions than layer one ethereum the day has finally arrived we got more transactions on ethereum's layer twos than its own layer one arbitrum leading the way uh with I think of past a transactions per second 4.5 transactions per second versus ethereum's 11 basically 12. but that's because arboretum's not even congested I think the numbers for arbitrum is arbitrum has scale for up to seven ethereums 11 ethereums although uh the technical teams will say that that met that metaphor doesn't make any sense but it's still useful and so coming up after arbitrum's four and a half transactions per second we have immutables four transactions per second optimism three and a half dydx is 2.6 when you add all these things together ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem has been doing more transactions than the ethereum layer one cool and that's been the case uh since yeah wow that's been the case for a while yeah oh the reason why we know this is because layer 2B this website that we go to all the time layer 2b.com ship this new thing called activity in this new tab called activity so we actually get to like consume this data a lot easier so thank you layer 2B for shipping such a great feature yeah the red line is Layer Two transaction activity and the blue is ethereum and it's been higher than ethereum since um October since almost a month now click on arbitrum see if we can see the transaction activity address of arbitrum uh activity no activity oh yeah activity all right oh that is great oh these are some great charts uh so arbitrum activity looking like it's kind of coming to its bait yeah it's all-time highs hit Mac hit that Max just make sure Max number oh yeah oh that's a great looking chart nice job arbitrum look at that look at that activity that's awesome Harper trim is like uh 62 I think of all um all ethereum transactions right now um that's pretty impressive when you add it all together average transactions per second on layer twos are about 16 versus ethereum that's 11 so this is how ethereum is scaling right now it's it's really exciting to see layer two's uh catch on like this um also taking a look at total locked value did you know speaking of arbitrum arbitrum just surpassed Solana in terms of total locked value David do you see this chart what's interesting to you about this one uh let's see the interesting thing is that binance smart train and Tron are such a goddamn large person uh buying a smart chains okay Tron uh but Arbitron yeah coming in bigger than Solana there's a lot of uh old OG bankless Theses finally coming into fruition here yep so it's fall but I guess Layer Two summer is finally here question mark David um what do we got coming up next coming up next we got the Elon Twitter takeover and all the drama associated with that is Elon rumored Ryan or Elon is rumored to be be laying off 50 of the staff tomorrow our tomorrow listeners today uh so we'll see if you follow through

was going to be a bunch of drama over the next five days so we've decided to wait uh so uh Elon Musk coming in hot into Twitter firing people left and right pew pew pew he's fired agrawal the former CEO he's fired the previous Chief Financial officers he's fired the head of legal he's fired the general counsel he's fired so many more other people I saw my Twitter account right well he says he says he he was did say he's going to fire 75 he's paired that back to just 50 percent he's gonna fight of all Twitter staff he's gonna fire on Friday tomorrow our tomorrow listeners today uh so that's what he said did you see all of these memes about people like fake memes of people getting fired like leaving the building yeah so like apparently people like put up like they like um some people like showed up outside of Twitter headquarters with like boxes and they put like the office equipment but they actually weren't employees it is supposed and they got like mainstream media reports okay uh and then okay but in addition to that Elon Musk says uh has reportedly brought in over 50 Tesla Engineers really into Twitter to bring Tesla's Talent into Twitter talent and I think that what he's thinking is that like you know Elon Musk is just like if you work at Tesla like you perform like that is the that is the expectation same thing with SpaceX and that so I think the vibe is that like Elon thinks all the Twitter Engineers are just like lazy and they've just been like lazing around for the past like years and years and years so he wants to bring his like you know super military engine here's people he's like you're super this is what private Equity always does right they'll acquire and then they'll like fire all of management and bring in their people to run things he's kind of doing a private Equity play here right yeah it kind of sounds like that uh like I've heard that there's like certain features that he's put deadlines on and whoever doesn't like ship and get that deadline done is like fired so like yeah coming in coming in hot into Twitter he's also ending all remote work which is an interesting thing for a tech company to do requiring remaining employees to show up at their offices people are gonna hate that yeah people are not gonna like that anyways uh he tweets out uh the bird is freed and he's just been tweeting on Twitter which is now his company uh all about like oh freedom of speech we can talk about carbs now that's an inside joke if you saw that tweet but just like how like there's not going to be there's gonna be like less like content moderation but uh anyways there's a lot of chaos going on people don't really know exactly what the the net effect of all this is we're still kind of waiting and seeing it's still pretty early I mean first of all like I would say it's like Twitter is kind of like crypto's governance engine yes and it was so important this is where we have the public discussion but there are certain questions about what does this have to do with with uh with crypto and can crypto help solve some of the problems that uh that Twitter is facing right now maybe web3 identities uh maybe other things um but this was interesting this from binance what are we looking at here David yeah binance Twitter account says GM Twitter and then it's a picture of CZ buttoning up his suit uh and then a picture of Elon poking through a little Twitter Tweeter Twitter logo window the reason why this tweet exists is because binance put in 500 million dollars towards Elon Musk acquisition of Twitter so through Elon Twitter binance owns 500 million dollars of Twitter Equity wow that's a loss I heard this was um you know I guess Twitter the Twitter Elon and the Twitter deal took cz's money but didn't take spf's money that at least is is the rumor so SBS spf's money yeah but he took cz's money I wonder if there are strings attached to that but here's a headline from Bloomberg crypto exchange binance is creating a team that aims to help Twitter with things like bots so binance maybe CZ sending his army to go help Elon as well what do you think about that that makes sense um I don't know what to think about that Bots are definitely a problem it Bots are a huge problem does is that why binance is involved though because binance has like bought expertise I'm not not I'm not sure I don't know anything I say is speculation yeah for sure we'll have to see how it plays out but how about this tweet David I want to get your thoughts on this this is Elon Musk Twitter's current Lords and peasant system for who has or who doesn't have a blue check mark is power to the people blue for eight dollars a month blue check mark So for people who aren't into Twitter David what is the significance of a blue check mark what is kind of like the status quo of how you get a blue check mark and uh what is this eight dollars per month thing that Elon is talking about the blue check mark is a verified account and it's really been reserved for high profile accounts that we need to have this mechanism to easily verify that that is the authentic real account so that has been the purpose of a blue check mark uh I I think the main the main point is to like if you are a high profile account somebody will make like a replica accounts and like uh like impersonate that high profile account to do whatever influence scam fish like Ryan and I each have like hundreds of fake accounts that are impersonating us uh and so the idea of the blue check mark is just to make it easy to verify who is actually the real one and who's not the problem with that is that it doesn't really work like that because of how corrupted it is if you want a blue check mark you can buy one in like back alley Twitter Channels with Twitter employees for twenty five thousand dollars ish you know I don't know what market rate is uh but like oh God yeah you got some you got some bad ones bad impersonators um and so like the Twitter blue check mark thing has kind of turned into just like a celebrity like Chad thing but then you can buy your way into it's not really it's no longer working as more like a social signal it's a social signal yeah and also it's just like completely falling apart in the past like two months it's actually impossible to get I've tried like five times and I think like you and I many people in crypto have a valid case and that like there's going to be we have the most valid case we have the most impersonators there there are many impersonators and like these impersonators are causing harm to people or like fake Ryan Adams I don't know how many times I I a day literally I get to yesterday I probably I'm telling me hey there's a there's a fake Ryan out there and like he just dm'd me is this you and he's like ask them something about your trading your financial history trading strategy it's you know super lame like you know I I don't I wouldn't talk like that but also no that's not me uh but it's impossible to go through the process and get a blue check mark uh been denied like five times don't know why just goes into a black hole so what is the eight dollars a month where does that come in yeah we don't really know that's that this caused a bunch of consternation a bunch of confusion because the point of the check mark is that you can't get it you have to be like given a check mark by people that verified you and so like blue for eight dollars a month first there's this thing called Twitter blue which is the thing you pay for which I pay for which gives you some extra perks you can get your nft profile picture there you can like edit your tweets uh stuff like that um what Elon it seems to be implying is that for eight dollars a month you can get a blue check mark but then that kind of defeats the point of the blue check mark there's a lot of details that we need to figure out why do you think it defeats the point of the blue check mark I mean my take on it was um it costs money to do identity checks right for individuals right now it's just a black hole you try to go through a process you try to submit you never hear back you don't know why you've not been submitted and so for eight dollars a month you can go through the process and it can be funded to do the identity check and so it's just like they're creating a funding model for it and it's easier to go through that process now you know Skeptics would say well now rather than having a bunch of fake David Hoffman's you're gonna have a fake bunch of fake blue check mark David Hoffman's so what have you accomplished but I guess like one minor counter to that would be to say well are all of these Bots going to pay eight dollars a month for this so there is some like proof of stake uh skin in the game of like at least eight dollars a month and then Plus in order to get a blue check mark I assume you still have to go through some sort of like human slash algo verification check and presumably those other fake David Hoffman wouldn't be able to to meet that Mark that's at least how I interpreted this if yes if that is how it is then that is great I think there's a lot of like speculations as to what this will be if that's what if that is the net effect of that then I'm 100 it's better at least right it's not perfect but maybe it's better yeah well let's read out vitalik's take on this about the eight dollars yeah vitalik says how well this works depends on exactly how much due diligence is done to make sure blue checks are who they say they are yeah pay dollars eight eight dollars a month and call yourself whatever would damage the blue checks anti-scam roll but if there's more actual verification then the result is very different yeah that's what we were saying yeah pre-measured uh maybe I stole from Metallica right now so so this caused like a bunch of controversy everyone everyone's having has an opinion about it right uh and so Elon Musk says to all complainers please continue complaining but it will cost eight dollars so Elon just turns into like complete troll mode which she's fantastic at uh well what's interesting it's like why are people complaining do you think is it because they is it people who have a blue check mark are complaining because they don't want to pay and they just think it should be sort of a public good you know for like journalists and for um high profile people who need it are they mad that it's like previously been a social status thing and now that's getting rescinded and it's becoming more more common or do they just hate Elon Musk just they hate the guy I think there's a lot of that going around it's kind of like narcissistic billionaire trying to like promote free speech in quotes take over social media and it's kind of like a political left first right thing what's your take on that uh the answer is definitely yes yes people just want to complain that's what Twitter is it's the platform for complaining anyways here's Eric Voorhees take he goes remember that Elon Musk charging eight dollars for a premium Twitter experience means Twitter becomes the product again instead of you and if it eight dollars is too much you remain as the product which I think is a good take yes if we have to access Twitter with eight for eight dollars a month that makes us the the people that are important rather than the advertisers however a large part of Twitter is like let's make sure everyone has a voice here so like there's a there's an interesting line that needs to be locked between not being the product and creating a free and open platform well I mean that is the point how much how much are you paying monthly for your attention when you are the product like how much does Twitter Harvest for me in the same way meta does and other social media sites and that's Eric's Point here is there's less of an incentive to do that yeah this is uh David sacks from the all in podcast uh who's also pushing back on The Pusher backers and says the entitled Elite is not mad that they have to pay eight dollars a month they're mad that anyone can pay eight dollars a month uh yeah yeah look how many likes these things are getting like everyone well it's about Twitter right so like literally everyone on the platform is it's relevant towards AOC comes in uh to give her take and goes lemao at the billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that free speech is actually an eight dollars a month subscription plan to which Elon Musk replied your feedback is appreciated now pay eight dollars that's funny it looks easy weighing in here too freedom and free and price are different concepts you can choose not to pay and still use Twitter or not use it at all sometimes I wonder if part of the funding of Twitter was just like to be in the cool clubs the Cool Kids Club yeah right so now CZ definitely gets to weigh in on this as a matter of because he gets to ride on elon's like trolled coattails yeah yeah it's like you get to be in elon's like maybe a text list or something where you can just uh you know ping him pay for access my larger question is this David I want to get your take here is why is this so why is it so hard on Twitter to prove person why do we still have all of the the spam accounts like why haven't we solved the blue check mark thing before and like why haven't we solved digital identity centralized digital identity yet so why is proof of personhood and digital identity so hard the Bots are swarming us it's impossible to tell who's a human who's a robot we have no defense the world is begging for a solution I want to sign my tweets with private Keys what's taking so long I actually don't understand this I'm it's just like this is people are like oh this is Rich coming from from somebody who doesn't you know code and like you know build things and I get that perspective but also people are talking about digital identity decentralized identity for so long since before crypto right why isn't it here like how have we not solved this problem and especially in my opinion I think it's a National Defense imperative right if state-sponsored bot armies can sow division among our social networks democracies themselves become very fragile like even from like National Security they're talking about banning Tick Tock the US is talking about banning Tick Tock why not be proactive and start systems yeah and help make identity systems right like it seems to me that would be a solution to this problem of nation state-sponsored bot attacks what do you think about this I think that's right and my quick from the hip take is that like a lot of people don't know how to didn't know how to think in web 3 terms before web3 was was in existence right obviously it's an obvious statement like we had ideas around decentralized identity and identity System since before crypto but we have now uh like this whole crypto corner of the internet that is like this massive rabbit hole that's a huge nerd snipe and everyone kind of goes down the rabbit hole and they come out understanding what web3 values are and that can now be these lessons and memes that are now in these people's heads can now go back to web 2 and be like hey web2 you don't have to you don't have to build web3 but let's take some web 3 principles like Community governance and Community identity and apply that to our web 2 platforms and there were some takes I saw like out of Kobe right Kobe had this take where he was like um uh like a green check mark to Signal support for climate change or like an orange check mark to Signal your support for like you know Bitcoin and a you know certain colored kind of check mark to Signal your tribe be here make them all pay eight dollars a month or something but like have more Community aligned identity systems uh when that'll come to a take that I have later on in the show but uh I think because we now know what crypto is we can talk take some of that crypto philosophy and apply it to our web 2 apps but without having crypto I don't think there was enough people out there to really think in these web three ways it seems like the biggest problem that we're facing right now on the internet honestly in social media right I mean I feel like the first 10 years of crypto was about solving the whole money thing and like it's continuing to to do that but I'm hopeful this decade we can start to solve the digital identity thing like that being the next step decentralized money and then decentralized identity uh and I do think crypto will play a big role here um but getting into our next website web 2 app uh try to keep up Elon because meta particularly Instagram is now allowing mint and cell functionality for nfts right David a few weeks ago we displayed on meta on Instagram uh view functionality so you can view your nfts and this is the next step and this is a massive Next Step because it means every Instagram user can now become a creator of nfts using Instagram the ability to Mint and sell nfts on Instagram massive absolutely massive and uh this is being deployed right now on polygon it's not live yet but this is a tweet from meta do you want to read this out yeah meta says soon you'll be able to make and sell nfts on Instagram starting with polygon you can also connect to Solana and Phantom wallet and see more information about openc Collections and so some of the features that are coming out here they continue and say we are adding new ways for people to show appreciation for their favorite creators through expanded access to Instagram subscriptions gifting on Instagram reels and updates to Facebook Stars so not only is there just generalized nft integration with with polygon and Solana but also they're just doing a platform revamp to allow for Creator monetization Creator business opportunities and so in addition to that meta has also played pledged that neither creators nor collectors will have to pay for gas fees which just shows the importance of scale and they also they gave a step-by-step video to coindesk and coindesk reported that it appears that nft creators will be able to choose their royalty percentage between 5 and 25 percent creators can then link their bank accounts or PayPal accounts to get paid if they are still banked uh I wonder I'm hoping that they can also link their wallets and just get paid directly in crypto I'm assuming that's going to be obviously that's the next step and I do think that will be the case uh pretty amazing on on polygon as well did they mention that they were adding any sort of App Store type fee do you remember the news last week was Apple wants to charge its 30 tax on everything um I don't think meta is taking that approach details about that to see see Meta go after Apple should not pay that fee Facebook versus Apple over the 30 tax that would be awesome find it out I just want to say it Ryan like I'm going to plant this flag meta is now or at least Instagram is fully web3 well I mean maybe like fully they can't sign in with your ethereum address but minting and selling nfts natively in the application that's what we're hoping that's what web3 is yeah and and using okay and not using some meta proprietary Tech stack to do that but securing that with a property right system based on based on crypto yeah that's what's important here and I know you know polygon is some people say well it's proof of stake it's uh more side chain than it is Layer Two they have ambitious Layer Two plans let me tell you that's not that take's not going to last that take Is Not Gonna Last regardless of what you think about that but like rather than I mean there was a few years ago meta was talking about like we'll just create our own blockchain and then I guess the world will trust meta as the property rights layer of the internet no and what do we say it's like some people are like but met is bad David why are you support like meta's evil bankless what are you talking about like they're part of the surveillance capitalism they're they're preying on their users and okay sure yes I I agree with with many aspects of that but as we say so often I'm bankless if they adopt crypto protocols they adopt Chris crypto value right and now what we've done is we've gone underneath meta and sort of forced meta to build on top of a blockchain secure open permissionless Freedom technologies that is just such a massive Leap Forward and let me remind you meta has 2.5 billion users monthly active users is absolutely huge yeah I would like to do a dive into the actual smart contract that is the minting contract of these nfts and see like what kind of powers and features they have there not that I will be able to do that I'll need something more technical to do that if it's just a normal ERC 721 token like that is the new Power uh meta adhere so the ERC 721 token standard open free public permission list can go across chains can do whatever you want gives the power from meta to the Token owner I'm not going to say that this is the biggest thing that's happened this year but like it's a it's big it's funny that like this like doesn't really land first I don't know why both people outside of crypto people outside of crypto like great I don't care about nfts and people inside of crypto are like great I don't care about Instagram like there's there's no one in the middle who's like I'm so stoked for this yeah I think I think what will happen is it'll be kind of quiet launched you'll normally notice and then they'll start to to notice some sort of influence or some sort of Instagram account they follow doing this using it and it'll spread that way by the way everyone's also like well nfts aren't cool anymore nfts are so that's not going to last either I mean we'll see how well that ages so uh massively for it also our weave what's up are we are we up 50 because our weave it's like a a modular data storage blockchain solution so you can put a bunch of data there uh it's part of the integration of uh meta so they're putting nft data on our weave I mean I I would assume that's the actual like if it's uh like the image JPEG or if it's a movie that that part of the nft goes on our weave which like yo that's not like that's a big deal they're not Facebook isn't storing the data themselves about the nft they're putting the data of the nft on our weave a public and open system so it can truly escape from Facebook's clutches which is why this is such a huge step forward for Facebook from a web 2 app to a web 3 app that's huge oh by the way uh friend Anatoly at uh Solana wanted to emphasize too that uh there's it's also possible to view nfts using Solana this is not just a polygon story apparently although polygon is the only one with the the minting and selling functionality now you can also view where did he say that he wanted to have synthesis he was just like you you didn't say the s word happy to say the s word Solana Solana Solana exactly no if you don't say it then he pops it then he pops up yeah yeah uh all right tell me about art gobblers all right okay oh my God I'm a huge Rick and Morty fan yeah and I can't believe I missed this and this is what I feel like I've heard everyone saying like oh this was so obvious and I missed it because art gobblers were on our rampage this year and what is the project something to do with Rick and Morty yeah okay brand new nft project called Art gobblers from the Rick and Morty Creator Justin Roiland uh in in like a very strong partnership with Paradigm so this was like a joint project from the VC Paradigm the VC company specifically Dave White uh mechanism designer researcher at Paradigm uh so collaboration between Justin royland the artist and Paradigm the mechanism designers uh so yeah we're watching a movie but Rick and Morty fashion uh styled movie uh it's kind of like debuting what are our gobblers and there are these weird creatures and there's like this goo that is oozing out of like a hose there bleeding goo they're just like goo faucets and this like guy is like tied up by the art gobblers like it's giving the context or the lore or something um basically all right so so you're ready for me to go into the mechanism of how this works yeah let's uh well actually can we look at the art first a little bit more it says Rick and Morty art it's just even more just like weird and surreal wow yeah I do like this art style by the way you like first we'll talk about uh some of the analytics there's 2 000 art gobblers that were able to be minted in this first wave there's going to be ten thousand total eventually there's a little bit like a Bitcoin issuance curve uh high at the beginning slow it tapers off over time current floor price 15 ether 15 ether not a low floor price um currently 1887 gobblers are out there um uh every time there are 10 legendary gobblers that exist every time 581 goblers are minted a legendary goes up for sale uh but like the the sale price that there's been as high as 40 each sales uh the the volume on this thing is just like super crazy just like a ton of activity going on this is still permissioned so you needed to have signed up for to be on the mint list I don't know how you got there um uh but yeah just like it's taken part of the nft world definitely by storm but also just like this is a high effort nft project this is not just like an nft so like because there's mechanisms behind this this is not just just like buy your art gobbler this is not a collectible our gobblers do things they're actually productive assets wait you can draw you can draw stuff okay so in order to explain this we have to go through the mechanism design for how this whole thing works the Paradigm the big brain stuff yes okay so actually yeah let's scroll down because there's like a tweet that kind of shows everything so here's how this works art gobblers Ryan can gobble art and the art is called glaminated Pages uh and so once a glaminated page has been gobbled it is displayed on the art gobbler stomach forever and so the art gobbler is so like thing for the people that are listening think about like Dr Seuss's uh snooze what's the story of the Dr Seuss with the Stars on their belly uh Star Bellied Sneetches exactly that one I think it's like start with that with your mental model but like think Teletubby TV belly so like we got a TV belly on these like weirdly do I know a lot of space yeah care bear style and so once an art gobbler gobbles some art that art becomes displayed on its belly so an individual art gobbler Ryan is itself an art gallery and so since there's eventually going to be 10 000 of them the meme is that they are it's a decentralized network of art galleries each one is in art gallery uh and so the people who own these art gobblers can gobble art to curate their art gobble Gobbler's Gallery but the thing is Ryan there is this thing called goo there's an erc20 token called goo what and gobblers produced goo so uh probably on a recurring basis yeah it's like it's a productive answer so like not only is a art gobbler a gallery to display your art that they are gobble gobbles but they produce goo they have this little pipe this hose in the back of their backs that like put out puts out goo erc20 token so this thing like that it like uh ether staked ether mince ether and Gobbler's mint Goo uh same same exactly the same ultrasound ultrasound Goo uh and so you need to consume goo to make the art the art gobbles gobblers gobble uh and so there are these things called blank pages blank there and nft when you combine goo plus a blank page nft that is called uh glamination aka the minting of gobble art of a glaminated page uh and so you have these page nfts you spend the currency goo to to add art onto a page nft so it goes from a blank page to a glaminated page which is a gobble opple and then once there's art on the page uh it can be gobbled and anyone can draw anything there's like this like Windows paint kind of like Factory where you can like put in art and make make your art and then have that be gobbled by the iron combo and the page becomes a permanent part of the gobbler stomach so once a gobbler gobbles some art it it's one way it's permanent forever just like a tattoo just like it's a tattoo forever it's irreversible uh and the point of this is to make like you know people want to have intention about like what they put like we could buy an art gobbler for the low low price of 15 15th and then we could start to bake stuff bankless on it sure if we wanted the bank if we wanted to yeah that would add value maybe extract value so I think the idea is like a lot of these gobblers will start to like differentiate themselves as to like the art that they have in their belly so it's no longer about the properties like oh my nft has like a Golden Crown and it's shiny and but no it's about like all right like what are has your art gobble gobbled this is awesome like I I mean I look it's kind of a fun idea right but like you can see a lot of thought went into that this is not the type of project that we saw in the late stage nft Market no uh this is fresh this is new it's building something uh I don't know are nfts back David well remember remember my uh take a big takeaway out of Devcon is like gamification works yeah people are the reason why there's a 15th floor is because people want to play the art Gobbler game the art cop it's an economic game it's a social status game it's just a fun internet thing we would have previously have called it a futility token these goo is a utility token but it when you pair it with an nft it like works better who is money question mark for in the art gobbler ecosystem goo is money yes gobbler economy and the art gobbler metaverse goo is money this is hilariously fun and uh I do like the art if big brain's at Paradigm and maybe that's the team up artist plus big brain equals a really good project if you spend some time on it clear that they spent some time on this one yeah that's great all right David what do we got coming up next uh coming up next nothing nothing as cool as our accomplished I can tell you uh JP Morgan fulfilling the defy mullet prophecy they once hated us yet now they have a mullet we're going to talk about that uh the odd death of a maker Dow founder not Rune Christensen uh and GameStop launching something cool so all of this and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 Bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer to life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross train bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across his bridges are powered by uma's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across V2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher Capital efficiency layer 2 to layer 2 transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of a cross's story by joining their Discord and using a cross for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely Bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrum or Boba networks the brave wallet is your secure multi-train on-ramp into web 3 and is built directly into the brave privacy browser gone are the days of managing multiple wall extensions that put you at risk of fishing spoofs and tracking with the brave wallet you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains including ethereum layer 2's Solana and more all without downloading risky extensions the brave wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions it's lightweight but packed with great features like built-in token swaps buying and holding nfts with a gallery view and support for Hardware wallets but also much more than that because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make web3 easier to navigate for its over 55 million users while extensions are a thing of the past so get started with Brave's web 3 ready browser today an experience of decentralized web seamlessly without all the Clutter you can download the browser at brave.com banklist and click the wall icon to get started ZK sync just went to mainnet this is the first evm to mainnet so says ZK sync baby Alpha is here in the Tweet we are proud to announce that today we hit our baby Alpha Milestone we have begun the march to Fair onboarding Alpha and full launch Alpha three different Alphas there I counted David this is the roadmap that we're looking at uh what part in the process us of ZK sync going to mainnet are we in it still feels like early days I think like only a small permission team can actually access the alpha on mainnet so we're not at full launch on mainnet yet but this is an important Milestone what's your take here yeah so it is live on mainnet without access so that has caused some controversy because what does it mean to be live on mainnet if people can't touch it uh apparently the ZK mainnet is only touchable by the matter Labs team according to an optimism governance delegate so there's caused a little bit of controversy but that's because what dkasync has done is they've broken this apart into a number of like launches right so they have Fair onboarding full full launch Alpha like uh and then they have like disease the decentralization layer three so they have like they're rolling it out in stages which is why they're calling it baby Alpha uh so like they make sense like I see the stages that make sense but there's also so probably an element of uh then why'd you got here first yes got it like they were all like the brother like licks the piece of candy so this and so the uh so the sibling can't have it as a brother who's done that before I can I can relate yeah well that's what's happening but uh we should also mention we are advisors on ZK sync of course you'll find that out in our disclosures uh fan of the project uh as well um good to see some progress there Google is launching a cloud node engine for who for ethereum developers David I've been growingly impressed with this cohort of Google Engineers that are on the web3 crypto train uh particularly in their cloud services uh Division I believe but um what does this mean for developers I think it's mostly just a statement and we already knew this about Google but a statement from Google that they are here to support web3 like there was this other like I can't remember this other Cloud providers like herzl or something her Germany in Germany yeah that actually the the news that we actually didn't include this week is that they're like a bunch of Solana nodes went down because herzl just kicked them off or whatever well now we included now we included it yeah and so in stark contrast to other ngmi Cloud providers Google definitely GMI because they're supporting like notes uh and say they say officially officially called a blockchain node engine and Google's offering a fully managed service meaning customers won't have to hire their own teams to maintain or monitor their nodes instead Google says will actively monitor the nodes and restarts them if anything goes wrong so in stark contrast to the node operating company that I can't remember that is kicking off nodes it hurts something I don't know uh ngmi Cloud operator they are helping node operators operate their nodes so thank you Google thank you for your service that's cool um this is some sad news coming out of the the maker Community uh David we don't have a lot of details here but why don't you just read the headline uh Nikolai uh people just know him as Nikolai Nikolai mushigien died at 29 in Puerto Rico he was found just like washed up the current allegedly of the Puerto Rican current uh took him people are confused about this there's a bunch of conspiracy stuff not enough for us to really go into Nikolai has been around for a long time before maker Dao was a thing he was part of the bit shares Community same thing with roon Christensen um OG member of maker Dao sadly Ryan I was actually in um DMS with Nikolai in telegram a couple weeks ago about a potential layer zero with him looks like I was didn't do that fast enough so I'm bummed about that yeah um very sad and rest in peace Nikolai I I think the community will definitely miss you and your contributions to the space very sad story anytime I ever heard of like a maker Dow friend Mariano Conti so many others talk about Nikolai it was in just extremely high regard he was one of those guys that was you know considered a giga brain saw crypto before before anyone else uh saw what it could do committed to that ecosystem contributed not just to make her doubt also balancer I think he had a very very strong role in actually writing the balancer white paper along with um Fernando Fernando yeah he'd like donated a bunch of money to uh I can't remember uh some like Academia to like to do D5 research I think he I think he made the weft contract uh so he made weth which means like you've all touched you've all we've all been uh Touched By by Nikolai by if you've interacted with weth um so Nikolai um sorry brother rest in peace um JP Morgan trading on the public blockchain in this Monumental step I love that the headline has a picture of Jamie Diamond the CEO is famously called crypto and Bitcoin all of these things uh a scam and here they are using it David uh I think it might be helpful to kind of walk through what exactly is happening here details this is the print walk us through it yeah this is a tweet from mihilo from um from polygon by the way I had a big week with uh the The Meta nft minting stuff but JP Morgan executed the first live trade on public chain and it's on polygon they used Ave first ever tokenized deposit issued by a bank on chain verified with w3c's standard verifiable credentials we like the we like the VCS we like a pretty cool verify credentials that is this is uh Tai lopin who is a developer I think at JP Morgan saying they've executed their first live trade and public blockchain everything that Mahalo just said what they do here first they use polygon for the trade because they wanted to do it on ethereum they need cheap gas fees that's checking out so far second they used Ave so they could leverage their permissioned pools concept we deployed a modified version of Ave Arc so that's what they did a modified version of Ave so they could set certain parameters such as interest rate and FX rate third they issued a tokenized Singapore dollar deposit so this is a stable coin not of the US dollars but of Singapore dollars this is a deposit token which is a general liability of jpeg JP Morgan it's a native token giving stable on-chain value without the scalability issues of stable coins this is the first issuance of tokenized deposits by a bank in particular on a public chain you can click here on polyscon uh poly scan and see the tokenized deposit contract for Singapore dollars and then fourth and I think this is kind of cool they used a verifiable credentials it's the first time have seen VCS really out in the wild solving a big use case verifiable credentials Ty says give us much more fine-grained control than just allow listing addresses risk limits asset limits Etc is all possible and we built on chain verification of verifiable credentials he says verify credentials are huge brings composability to Identity you can have these little verifiers that know how to verify certain things and use them across dabs bringing further standardization and portability to identity by the way this might be a way Twitter gets out of its current setup of paying eight dollars a month for for blue check marks and moving something decentralized verifiable credentials are hugely bullish technology for that um he says we as a sidebar by the way if you're if you're like wanting to know why verifiable credentials why identity is so important because it's it's JP Morgan I mean they're a bank as a heavily regulated Bank he says we cannot enable money laundering must undertake kyc using verify I build credentials and allow us was crucial for enabler enabling us to use D5 pools with certainty on these points institutional defy exclamation point this is probably what it looks like when regulated Banks start using defy and I think that this is going to become a trend in the future and JP Morgan despite what Jamie Diamond is saying uh is doing big experiments in this world I think it's pretty bullish this is not the bankless future that we all like signed up for in the self-sovereign future of course but again I go back to kind of the meta thing when they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values also you can build a banked system on top of a bank list system of course so that's that's what we're doing here and like you said the word experiment this looks much more than an experiment you're right this is production level stuff this is yeah it means to an end they used Ave Arc and polygon and verifiable credentials to get something done and then they did it that's Enterprise blockchain Dance It's called polygon I mean but this is Enterprise blockchain this doing something for a bank like this is this makes total sense to me so I'm starting to see like these uh Enterprise blockchain use cases that I'm like okay fine we're getting there we're making some progress I would like to take a quick Victory lap for the world of uh verifiable credentials people think Soul bound tokens are super cool but a lot of the reasons why they think Soul bound tokens are super cool are actually like the domain of verifiable credentials uh it's it's a basically a soul bound token that's not on a blockchain uh and it can do so much more by not being fixed down to the blockchain if you listen to the uh our soul bound episode with fatal pewter and epic McMullen there's like there's like these two tribes there's like the soul bound token folk who like tokens there's a verifiable credentialed folk who like privacy uh I would look like can I be in both tribes uh okay well uh I am a into the a firm VC tribor and I'm taking a Victory lap all right well you take that a Victory lap and I will also join you in that because I'm part of that tribe but I'm also in the soul bound tribe I don't know if you can do that I think they're different for two different sets of use cases and I definitely think that yeah right and I 100 agree with that and I will say that the soul bound token tribe is putting too many use cases into Soul bound tokens in the same way that bitcoiners think that Bitcoin is going to solve like the food system even trying to get all tribal around identity already it's too early for the tribalism we at least need tokens to fight over okay um all right what else we got uh Robbie Ferguson tweets out thrilled to finally announce that GameStop nft Marketplace is officially live on immutable this is a huge step in making true ownership real for hundreds of millions of Gamers we knew this was coming uh GameStop first integrated Loop ring I believe is their first layer to you and now they're integrating immutable any thoughts on this uh nope uh we uh GameStop is very intentionally going after nfts in the same way meta is now uh I mean just add another one to the list of people that are doing nft stuff uh another thing to add to the list I think is uh Twitter doing nft stuff so gotta keep up with meta now testing nft tweet tiles this is a feature for Twitter David what are you looking at this is like a small update there's already nfts and Twitter right like our profile pictures uh but they are being given like a more of a First-Class citizen in tweet and embedded into tweets so if you post like uh an Instagram or a YouTube link or like they will treat links differently based off of what they are I'm sure like a preview right A specialized preview based off of like the URL so if it's a Youtube it'll give you a YouTube preview if it's an Instagram link it won't give you any preview because it doesn't want you to go there but they are giving special previews towards nfts that like so they manifest in a specific way and so the nft here is like rocket to the moon created by Twitter with a button to say see on Marketplace and I would imagine that that Marketplace button takes you to uh wearable magic Eden Dapper Labs drum trade nft wherever they have like these custom fit links so just nfts are being given first class treatment inside of Twitter I think what meta and Twitter are doing this is like the nft Space Race It's Beginning only dude this is the nft bear market and this is the build market for sure you have to they have all these social media uh apps have to keep up with this yeah um artifact digital luggage flies off the shelf did I say that right digital what is digital luggage fidgetal is this hybrid word between uh digital and physical oh I love it yes I think everyone hates this word but it's pretty damn sticky sadly uh so there is uh physical there are digital renderings of luggage Ryan luxury luggage uh that is cool and there are I think though 888 nfts that represent uh luggage these things uh yes dude luggage is boring like in real life why why are we like collecting it I don't know Ryan but the reason why we're talking about it on the weekly roll-up is because 1.7 million dollars worth of volume was exchanged on open C alone pushing it to the top of a 24-hour leaderboard uh yeah David this is not a bear Market if we could sell gee how much millions of dollars if we could sell millions of dollars worth of digital luggage pictures like look at these These are literally just images of look at this I mean it's like my carry-on people for some reason there is like this like luxury luggage like world out there I don't know is that is that like sneaker heads there's like Legends the most Niche Community we've ever talked about on the show I bet we offended a bunch of a bunch of luggage collectors right now um dozens of them all dozens of them but enough to like spur on a multi-million dollar market it doesn't feel like a bear Market but we're not done with nft yeah budverse nft.budwiser.com the bud versus nft collection is coming during the FIFA World Cup there is a mint Now button Budweiser like remember it was like a couple weeks ago maybe four or five weeks ago whereas like nfts won this week in the weekly roll up they won again and they won again again for nfts like Budweiser they were already in nfts I don't even know what this is but like digital Collectibles to go with the FIFA World Cup you can select your team you can mint some stuff do you know David minting is not enough me anymore I need to gobble I want mint and Gobble functionality all right I'm not buying it okay so here's what you get you can follow your team through the World Cup you select and represent your team in your specific Bud versus Fifa World Cup live scoreboard nft this is the first ever nft where you can see your team's progression to Greatness in real time uh your live scoreboard Mt will also get you exclusive Budweiser football merch cool access to holder only Discord channels for an always-on game time community and also access to the budverse penalty kick minigame may I just remind you and this was from our so uh server episode 2.5 billion people around the planet are going to be watching the World Cup if just .0001 of them pick up a Budweiser nft I'm not doing the math right now but that's a lot of people um what's Carl our friend Carly Riley she just released this documentary that she's been working on for a while about her experience in Puerto Rico in the art and nft Community what are we looking at here David there's been a bunch of controversy in Puerto Rico about all the crypto people that have like invaded the island uh but Carly wants to tell a different story because there's parts of Puerto Rico uh Puerto Rican locals who are using nfts inside of their Community to do stuff to do cool stuff uh and so Carly went to Puerto Rico boots on the ground to tell that story of how nfts are helping fix stuff in Puerto Rico and how different people are doing different things leveraging nfts to help the the island it's a very cool story very cool documentary out of college also like probably the most well produced um piece of video from a from a crypto content creator I've seen yeah like she really spent time talking to locals and like getting this right so fantastic video go and watch it it's 30 minutes uh yeah drop your Netflix show and watch that this weekend she's turning into the Anthony Bourdain of nfts yeah going around the world I think that's I think that's it she went to the rainforest too I think yeah she went to the Amazon to talk about nfts Harley incredible uh Bitcoin stuff all right David happy 14th anniversary happy 14th and we just say it we are huge Bitcoin fans like I'm saying that with no satire no disrespect Bitcoin got me into crypto I will forever be excited about Bitcoin I will forever hold some Bitcoin I'm like 14 years old that's what kick-started this entire Revolution incredible this is tweet from Edward Snowden with a screenshot of Bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system this is the original white paper from the great the mysterious Satoshi uh 14 years that's pretty crazy David yet he is still Anonymous Edward Snowden says remarkable yes it is indeed remarkable if staying Anonymous is a hard thing to do um Right comes in hot into uh into Edward snowden's replies and says I was never Anonymous you traitorous scum this is the a man who cleaned by the way if you're not familiar with this a man who's literally claiming he's uh Satoshi is obviously not it's obviously a fraud uh he's also claimed he's got like 14 degrees or something okay yeah what a waste uh anyway um chasing some clout for Bitcoins the second person to chase clout after a bitcoin's 14th birthday Gary Gensler Gary denzer says happy 14th birthday to Satoshi nakamoto's white paper not even to bitcoin it has led to Innovation and crypto asset investing let's make sure as crypto enters its 15th year that investors get proper protection absolutely F off Gary God damn it protection from what the three trillion well only one trillion the one trillion dollars give a charitable view of this maybe maybe Gary just wants to extend an olive branch to the Bitcoin community and just say happy anniversary happy birthday Bitcoin white paper he knows that this phrasing would tick off crypto enters its 15th year that investors get proper protection how about a Bitcoin ETF then that is spot traded on bitcoin miners things yeah uh blowing up simultaneously not great so bitcoin price is down that leads to minor blow-ups they become less profitable yeah what's happening here so this is not yet a blow up but the uh Dylan LeClaire who works at Bitcoin media says um Bitcoin miner Argo blockchain negative down 41 today at the open should Argo be unsuccessful in completing any further financing Argo would become cash flow negative in the near term and would need to curtail or cease operations this is what happens during bear markets we've seen this before the the less efficient miners get washed out because of competition for mining Bitcoin the more efficient miners can last through the bear market and so every single bear Market there's consolidation the least profitable most inefficient Bitcoin miners lose and the more efficient Bitcoin miners stick around when you say consolidation I hear centralization is that what's happening too are we doing this on bitcoin's birthday Ryan uh no happy birthday Bitcoin let's go Bitcoin all right let's get two releases David this is uh Nifty Apes pretty nifty project liquidity for your nfts what does this do just released yeah borrowing for your nfts so I loaded up my wallet and I got like three or four offers on different nfts that I own about like how much ether I could borrow over for what percentage over what period of time uh Nifty Apes Dot money if you would like to see the offers that the market might give you based off of your nfts uh it's a normal NFC borrowing and Lending Service yeah but be careful those could get liquidated and also disclaimer Ryan and I are Angel Investors in Nifty Apes um so that's our disclaimer go check it out this is cool Zora is launching nouns Builder so you're familiar with the nouns project and may be familiar with the Dow mechanism around nouns uh it looks like they built a tool so you could spin up noun style Dows uh one of the details behind this David nouns Builder yeah I think it's just a big aha moment with nouns it was first the mechanism itself was very cool but then realize people realized it has actually nothing to do with nouns themselves and it's more of a generalizable mechanical ISM so Zora has produced a build announced build a noun project and so you can kind of Tinker with the levers Tinker with the dials create your your art and build a nouns like Dao so it's like a Dao system down in a box uh with a nouns mechanism so the idea is that we can make a lot more noun like daos and have cool things David if I was a 14 year old kid like this would be a playground for like a god playground for me could you imagine like creating like like imagine all the time liabilities you'd be able to make oh shots stop at the taxes why am I the guy telling you to shut up about taxes I'm 14. I don't care about taxes I don't know they even exist so I'm playing with this tool and I'd like set this up for a clan or something like I would I mean it would be so much fun just have a disc create my own Dao I mean how incredible uh kids these days have a lot of opportunity in crypto report on some IRS suing some 12 year old kid no no one wants to hear about taxes David let's get to jobs all right because there's opportunities for you to get a job in crypto it's our weekly time to remind you that crypto is hiring and you should stop what you're doing you should take a look good job consider getting a job in crypto uh number one bankless script writer I'm gonna read a few of these out number two swell Network they need a senior smart contract engineer as well also needs a front

got takes of the week some more Twitter takes uh but also some legal takes as well some regulatory takes uh and then we got what we are bullish on and Ryan is bullish on something that perks my ears and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or lost money to a thief and a lot of that

takes of the week this is a tweet from Ron Hammond David this is based on our episode which I feel like was the episode watched around the world listened to around the world our debate on Bank lists between SBF and Eric Voorhees if you haven't caught that go listen to it podcast 60 000 people have watched that so far yeah and I think the where it's echoed and where it's influenced has also been pretty crazy this is a tweet from Ron Hammond about that episode this week in Congress and crypto it is not too often a podcast is the Talk of the Town in DC but the bankless debate between SBF and Voorhees was just that as a former Hill staffer who worked on crypto legislation in current lobbyists that's who the originator of the threat is Ron Hammond here are some thoughts he says number one there are a number of reasons why crypto policy realm is unique on Capitol Hill but one element that I can see time and time again is the pop culture and fast-paced nature of IT bankless team did a great job marketing this is the can't miss event and Feud did I agree everyone in crypto still all of a sudden now I mean all the settlers everyone was still hearing crypto watch that episode after chatting with a few staffers and DC policy folks over the weekend the general consensus was that at a high level both did a good job that's both SBF and for he's representing the two camps in crypto on the dccpa crypto regulation generally many found their views in the middle of the two that is interesting some things that resonated before he said if you aren't at the table you're on the menu actually I think you said that but that is largely true and the industry has recognized that since the infrastructure Bill the number of resources has tripled in a year crypto lobbying is a stronger Force love that SBF made a good point on lobbying efforts in the past like bit license most times a lawmaker will tell staff I want a bill that does XYZ and the staff engages with the industry and others to craft it policy folks work to improve the bill but rarely do they write it did you know that by the way I do not know that yeah the lawmaker just goes I want a bill that does XYZ and the staff is actually the one that writes it and they engage with industry in order to do that that's how bills actually get made in the trenches many in the industry tend to go straight to the lawmaker for tweaks to the bill but most times the member doesn't grasp everything because he she is extremely busy and it is a complex topic usually it is just one or two staffers in their 20s or 30s who hold the pen do you know that David is that comforting to you that's not comforting but maybe it is it it away right because like we have like a largely geriatric set of lawmakers and then we have those in their 20s and 30s who are holding the Millennials whispering in their ear I guess I mean these are Zoomers if you're in your early 20s some industry folks uh refuse to engage that's not comforting oh man there's some uh generational maximalism here uh some industry folks refuse to engage on any sort of crypto legislation that's potentially detrimental because it is easier to fight someone something than to work to improve it that is usually a bad tactic because the issue area is so tough many times there are unintended issues therefore while engaging with staff being respectful is important SBF harped this well I think that is one thing SPF emphasized David was he he kept saying Eric was about respect and Eric's like but you're compromising too early and he's like but you have to show respect you have to show that you're willing to compromise in order to get that seat and earn that seat at the table Ron says it may sound weird but the hill does have its own language similar to how crypto Twitter has its own language and culture did you know that it's an interesting point this thread was extremely informative education leads to good policy staffers has a lot of other issues in financial services alone to deal with um like fiscal policy budget Bank regulation to bring everyone up to speed in a week before a vote is tough so you got to educate early and often I think we are doing that finally there are a lot of conversations in DC regarding extremes staffers hear all the time if this bill is signed into law X disastrous thing will happen these arguments are always worst case scenario and after a while fall flat saying this will kill D5 won't help that's interesting because I do say that and Eric said that because I feel like that's a legit take but also if you get the point if a take is overused then it starts to fall because imagine a whole bunch of lobbyists from every industry saying anything that you propose will kill your industry right here the sky is falling exactly when staffers hear that kill D5 talking point they naturally go to what is defy I know that may sound trivial but for a committee that largely deals with rural development biotech and Forestry that's the AG Community Committee by the way this is where the dccpa bill originally is the AG committee agriculture uh defy isn't common that common of a topic uh anyway um this last this last tweet maybe was uh was the most fun of this thread is worth commending those involved with the podcast Bank list Etc uh for facilitating a great dialogue this is it weird to think that this podcast was a Hot Topic in DC this weekend but in the words of an overhearing staffer not sure what you all said but sounds cool now I want to work on crypto yes nice yes good memes good memes memes in the brain now I want to work on crypto welcome yeah vitalik had some takes about regulatory too do you want to yeah read out what he said yeah this was vitalik's kind of response to this like uh conversation about regulation and he goes should I publicly blab my opinions about crypto regulation more feels unfair to let other people get attacked by cryptotitter but never actually poke out my poke out my head uh and so everyone obviously wants fatalities we do want that um he's actually decently up to speed with like regulation and like legal Theory uh and so like Vitality can speak legally he's up to speed on almost everything this is true this is true do you want to read out his uh his takes here because he puts yeah sure I'll keep on going uh so first he says that he's already given out his take on mixers and privacy in a recent coinbase podcast two months ago around the block uh so there's that uh he goes another maybe controversial take of mine is I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional Capital at full speed I'm actually kind of happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed the ecosystem titanese time to mature before we get even more attention that's interesting what do you think about that he gave us that take on a recent podcast uh I think it's a fair take uh there's trade-offs there's trade-offs so canceller uh keep doing what you're doing man well no I don't want to say that um what's next basically especially at this time regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto Works internally yeah definitely agree with that the kyc on D5 front end idea does not seem very pointful to me it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the kyc that's already happening that is a great take that's a sensible that's a great very practical and pregnant kyc on front end only hurts the the least technical people of the world the most technical people who need an interface yes the people that need help the people that don't need help the people that have the capacity to do harm don't need the interface that's a great point so you're just blocking the people that need help it's it was not a point that explicitly before he's made but I think is a fantastic follow-up Point regulations on D5 front ends that could be more helpful may include limits on Leverage requiring transparency for what audits uh or other Security checks were done on contract code and usage gated by knowledge based tests instead of plutocratic net worth minimum rules I love this I love the idea of a totally permissionless fully on steroids Full Tilt defy app have a front-end gated where like this defy app will let you take a thousand X leg leverage but the front end only lets you take 3x and so like if you want to take a thousand X you have to go like actually get technical and go do it yourself I love that I love that idea yeah I think that makes more sense and then of course like you know the plutocratic net worth right accredited investors unless you're a credit investor in the US unless you have a million over a million dollars uh in net worth you can't get in a whole bunch of the deta the deals it's just a plutocratic gate why not make the gate more like education based right that's what you're saying here too yeah last take also I would love to see rules written in such a way that requirements can be satisfied by zero knowledge proofs as much as possible ZK proofs offer lots of opportunity to satisfy regulatory policy goals and preserve privacy at the same time we should take advantage of this oh that was such a soul bound token Mac taken oh gosh Come on these are great takes and you know uh vitalik is always as reasoned and measured and I would like to hear him publicly blab on his opinions about crypto regulation more so I'm glad you did I'll take I'll take any public metallic Labs uh what you got here David this is it right here here's a black from David and here's that here's my blab unrelated to legal stuff and I say the future of verified accounts this is going back to the Twitter check mark is not going to be a top-down centrally permissioned system The Times They Are a change in bottom up Community oriented mechanisms are in all right Bob Dylan Bob Dylan uh future of verified accounts let's go all right what are you uh what are you excited about this week David what do you bullish on uh I am bullish on Ryan the op stack because you know how ethereum is is going modular yes doing doing the whole modularity thing well so is all of ethereum player twos uh and the op stack right Optimus is like is what op stands for layer twos my idea my claim and what this is what I'm bullish on is that layer twos are also going modular and the op stack is one of the gonna be the great like motivators to get this done so layer twos are also going to be broken apart into their component parts and this is what the op stack is it's like the scaffolding for people who don't know op does stand for optimism yes yes it does yes it does OP stack the optimism op stack is this like scaffolding for modular layer twos uh and so the idea is like the secret sauce of all these layer twos are going to be broken into little modules like arbitrums fraud proofs optimism's fraud proofs ZK sinks prover uh where's the data held is it is it off chain on our weave is it on chain like a roll up and so the the all of the ingredients that make up a layer two are going to be broken apart into little modules L2 Legos L2 Legos L2 chain Legos and op the op stack is like the build a Build-A-Bear Workshop that build a layer two workshop for like stitching all of these Layer Two modules into each other and so so it's like this abstraction layer that allows the modules to interoperate with each other on like a seamless way and so what's happening here is we're breaking layer twos into their minimum viable component parts like tiny little jeans some genes and these genes are going to compete and so this is a reference to like Richard Dawkins selfish Gene like once we can break apart layer twos into their modules it's not the layer twos that fight anymore it's not these monolithic very like vertical layer twos that fight in these Layer Two Wars It's the modules that fight the little genes that fight and like these layer two teams are just competing to put out the best interests that's better because we get progress that much faster faster Evolution faster progress we get the it's the op stack is like the erc20 token standard of layer twos and so like I'm bullish on this Cambrian explosion of many different layer twos from all of these different permutations of modules that could be put together and that's what really just like gets my juices flowing Ryan is when I see like this is bio mimicry exactly biomimicry composability and competition in the market which is what Defy is it's like the biggest competition Marketplace of all time uh and it's the same thing as like the survival of the fittest but now we have like modular layer twos and the little modules can fight over each other you like little things fighting don't you like yeah yeah this is ethereum oh all you little D5 apps fight over my ears exactly why you're fighting my money anyways that's what I'm excited about what are you excited about Ryan music nfts David no way I'm excited about music fancies this week so David the uh the bankless team put together a newsletter issue titled A Bank listening issue title finding the x copy of Music nfts x copy of course is famous nft artist sells one of ones and the question is if like it's so early stage in music nfts can you find the next x copy oh by the way I watched this video too by the my friend David Hoffman also made me bullish on top of this but I watched that video after I read this post and made some purchases finding the x copy of music nfts and so I decided to do some exploration myself I went to sound I researched some of these artists and I found some things that I liked yeah yeah largely they were suggestions on this article okay so I'm still curating my own space all right so I'm apinging the taste of others as a first step but um it was really fun like the process of going to sound and open C and actually purchasing some nfts like here's kind of an nft wallet I have and a few you know collection that I'm starting to build uh it was fun it was easy when you pair that with what your video was saying what the Cooper was saying about like a stock market for uh music nfts and for artists another mechanism for compensation like I was researching these artists I mean these are not like the Taylor Swifts of the world these are kind of like small time artists with like fantastic music and what they can do is they can use web2 and Spotify as the distribution mechanism but use nfts as part of their monetization mechanism to find their true fans and I'm just repeating back what uh what you're saying to me I feel like and what Cooper is also saying but I guess there's a difference between hearing it and actually doing it and building a collection uh and um I don't know it just feels like one of those things that's um obvious and it's obvious because it was fun um I'm convicted there's a monetization mechanism I think this is going to be big and uh when that that tweet was uh put out I think Baker's put out the tweet and a bunch of people are like I don't think nfts are going to take off at all like um why because the only reason jpegs have taken off is because they're so easily shareable on like social media on Twitter and they're viral and sound requires like a music nft to you know it's a three minute song or whatever else like I've it just echoed of what I've heard in the past of like right all three years ago two years ago all the ten thousand reasons why jpegs would never take off in the nft the exact same sorts of arguments right uh and I don't know so I feel like it's super obvious I've I've switched on to bullish maybe because I've built my own uh starting to build my own collection um and it's just like a lot of fun honestly so um the most fun I've had in crypto in the last month I would say that's fine hey fun is a huge Alpha indicator so if you're having fun like that's how you know like I I was definitely one of those people that was like music nfts are just bearish in comparison to jpegs because jpegs you can see it all like that oh like instantaneously right a picture's worth a thousand words you see the picture and you like the picture but like for music nft you have to listen to it for three minutes to determine if you like the nft or not yeah it's too slow that's not viral I used to be one of those people but then like the response of like bro it's music like it when you and I are not in Zoom Ryan doing pinkless stuff there's music playing in my apartment oh yeah all of the time yeah and you're all attached to these artists too yes yes and so like is there any creator that you're more attached to any artist that you're more attached to then there's no visual artist that I'm more attached to than and like exactly my top 50 music artists totally it's not even like that's all that's all it takes so you want a piece of their Community you want to bet on these artists too like your tastes you're right like David has great taste in music right and so right he knows he does so now you can bet on it we'll see what the rest of the world thinks I think the rest of world likes the chief dogs so I have my nft frame and I have to go turn on my nft frame to to uh to go look at my my visual nfts yeah and like I mean I'll go do it I also have to go turn on like my speakers to listen to music but I turn on my speakers every single damn day yeah and so like again like don't overthink it it's music well there's a reason why we call it the Billboard top charts like the Billboard top charts is just like the precursor of the future stock market for music guess what I was doing in 2020 uh when we had those episodes and people are giving me the full case for nfts like before they were a thing before Jimmy Fallon or anyone in the world cared right uh I was overthinking jpegs yeah a lot yeah and I was like but right click save right you know and then I'm not gonna make the same mistake right like this is just easy it's fun right it's it's pretty easy it's gobbling goo is fun this is fun music nfts uh anyway bullish this week David should we be the first ones to make uh music goblers music gobblers music I don't have any music and this is not my talent but we'll do a podcast nft that can gobble other podcasts yeah yeah you do that uh I think we can all right it's me of the week time you've pretty bullish about what uh what is this from Jameson Lop the good old Jameson yeah this is the the Shrew Meme and it's the European Union is the European Union pointing to his poster saying Bitcoin is too volatile also saying next panel Bitcoin cannot be a currency the EU finishes the third panel saying our job is to maintain the value of the currency and then the fourth panel is a chart of the Euro to the dollar and it is down bad down real bad and it's probably more volatile than Bitcoin these days because Bitcoin is super steady we're not finding risk-free money anywhere these days this volatility all around uh all right risks and disclaimers guys end of the show thanks for hanging with us of course gotta let you know crypto is risky
