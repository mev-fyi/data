foreign [Music] what's up coordination how you doing on the Pod today we have John power of opolis and Eve Denver on this episode we talk about the employment Commons which is being built at opolis basically a way that you can Bridge your token income to the old world of insurance and regulated assets like how you would apply for a mortgage if you had only token based income so John's a bridge builder he's been building between the old world and the new world which I think is really cool at opolis the employment Commons but also he's the executive Steward of East Denver so we talk a lot about the growth of ethanver from 2018 out here in Colorado putting Denver on the map as a web 3 Innovation ecosystem and also the fact that East Denver has become a dow itself has become a investment ecosystem in itself and some of the sort of expansions of East Denver that have happened over the last couple years it's the Devcon of North America I've heard it called so a lot of interesting stuff happening out here in Colorado and John power is one of the forces behind it it's kind of got this energy G that builds in all directions at once which is quite intense but you see it at east Denver the amount of innovation that happens there and actually is baked into the experience like for example food trucks that accept blockchain based tokens nfts that were given out at the conference and this is all stuff that was done in 2018 before there was an nft boom or before things had really taken off in the way that they have over the last couple years so John is a Visionary in the areas of future of work public infrastructure building Colorado to be a community and we talk about all those things his work in the ecosystem has been a part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin has been a part of East Denver for the last five years and I think it's been a lot of fun to do this episode together to see Oculus grow and I can't wait to see how it grows in the future so without further Ado I'll give you John power of East Denver Annapolis enjoy working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many

I'm drinking a buff Agway IPA compliments Woods boss brewing and eat Denver 2022. delicious beautiful wood Woodsboro Brewing is a bar out here in Colorado and it seems like East Denver which you're the executive Steward of and you all have partnered to make a beer yeah we did we uh this is actually our third beer that we've done the this was the first one we did with Woods boss um was it first or the second no it's the second that we did with Woods boss and it was uh then before that we did with uh black shirt Brewing back in 2018 and 2019 so we did I guess it's four now we've done four so yeah the Buffalo IPA is a blood orange IPA with some uh special buff Agway spices that we put in make it uh extra extra rare beautiful well we did not have you on the Pod to talk about the Buffalo beer but we did come on to talk about this was I gotta be able to drink my beer while we're talking about it right yeah well it's a good it's a good segue into talking about East Denver which is the Innovation Festival that you're the executive Steward of and I think the Devcon of North America and it has attracted a lot of innovation and regen people to work on web3 within Colorado so let's talk about East Denver and its mascot the bufficorn yeah happy to talk about buffcorns all day so do you want a sneak peek into what's going to happen uh 2023 well well let's let's have a solid grounding for people who haven't been of what if Denver is and then let's get a sneak peek of 2023 yeah yeah so the history of eat Thunder was um there was sort of an OG tribe of us around the Meetup scene here that um you know we're kind of talking about like how do we take all these raw ingredients that we had I mean we had to meet up in Denver for ethereum of like 400 people in the spring of 2027 or 2017. but it was a lot of back slaps and beer and vision casting and just you know lots of Taki Taki Taki and not enough owaki awakio Waki as I say there there we go and hopefully that doesn't become a meme after this episode oh you know it's gonna dude if it's not somebody needs to meme that um that's a call to action folks somebody meme that tweeted at me I wanna I wanna see it add power John you could do it it would be great but um so there was a there was a hackathon that actually had happened in like May of 2017 in Denver it was like not very many people so the original uh founders of the Meetup you're like I don't know you know No One's Gonna Come and it's really hard to get people's attention and all this I'm like no I'm talking about like we get like everybody like vitalik and and all the people that are building this globally and will make Colorado a destination of choice for web 3 Innovation and yeah it was kind of crickets it's like yeah okay dude you know whatever yeah and so um yeah we just you know call it a YOLO you know I put up the the initial check to like you know seed it and then uh I got people like Joe Lubin and Dimitri buterin and a bunch of other projects the the OG's from lendroid Vignesh and Anand you know there's just a ton of people came in a lot more than we thought and um ended up being 1500 people from something like 40 countries I mean it was crazy uh Market timing was good I think the geolocation for Denver's good you know you can go here this is February 2018. is that right 15 was the first installation yeah so we grew pretty steadily by about 500 people a year for the first two two installations after that so 2019 and 2020 were 2 000 and 2500 people each and then virtual happened and then we had like 31 000 virtual participants in various capacities but it's it's sort of hard to quantify that because like it's not really a good way to measure all that but there's a ton of traffic and a ton of people around we had a augmented reality space and an nft scavenger hunt and all this stuff that we were doing online and it was very well received and then boy you know we were completely and totally unprepared for what happened this year which was 28 000 applications 13 000 attendees over a hundred countries two million dollars in bounties and prizes given out and it was crazy I mean it was uh fantastic in a lot of ways but you know for those of that were here and saw the long lines and the bad bathrooms and you know some of that it's pretty clear that we outgrew kind of what you know where we've come from so um yeah the thesis behind it is really three pillars it's Community um biddling and education so we don't have a barrier to entry we prefer to give people as much free education as possible and remove barriers not looking for extractive points and you know money making opportunities I mean those present themselves in in regen games a little differently than they do in Degen or extractive games so we we don't charge for entry and you know probably 40 of the people that show up if you're noobs they don't you know they're crypto curious they don't know much about crypto but they've kind of heard a little bit about it or smart contracts or green pilling or D5 or whatever it is you know they're coming to explore and we like that um you know compared to like most of the other ticketed events around the community even Devcon it's you know pretty steep price you know you gotta put up a bunch of money and most people that don't know about the ecosystem aren't going to do that so like we're trying to keep the on-ramp open and and wide so people can come and explore and learn and engage build and ultimately be a part of a community so it's it's been it's been an interesting ride now 2023 for context like what's coming we're moving venues so uh well Denver there's a complex called National Western which is where they do like a bunch of the big shows like they do the big dog show the gem show the RV show the stock show like I mean this is a huge complex so the building that we're taking up is 400 000 square feet of pure you know hacker Bliss you know it's it's got the Sports Castle Vibe so it's a little grimy a little rough around the edges got better bathrooms and there won't be lines so we took all the feedback to heart and trying to make sure that we created more cohesive environment and so yeah we're expecting a call of 15 to 25 000 people this coming year and and now we've actually got the infrastructure to support it and it's going to be fantastic I mean we're putting a a hostel inside the venue so like hackers coming from all over the world that don't have a hotel room or whatever stay at the venue you know you you'll be able to stay right there for our burner friends we're gonna let them use the parking lot to kind of you know burn out a little bit if they want you know so there'll be a flavor for everybody um but the whole Rhino District which is really kind of generally where the National Western is it's just north of there actually just north of rhino but like we're taking over that whole area so it's going to be fun man like you're getting in trouble I think what's really neat for me as someone who's been involved in East Denver since the beginning it is we're out you are oh gee the drink to that man little buff guy if I had a buff Agway then I would I would drink that um yeah I mean I guess I was just gonna comment on a couple things one is that uh if Denver has been leading and using the tech I think the food trucks using the Colorado coin was a big hit back in 2018. that was amazing dude it was fantastic feat of crypto theater in some ways but like the futuristic value of that was pretty on point dude that was an amazing experiment I was I was very happy to be a part of that yeah totally um and you know I I think that that's neat uh you and I you're for people who are watching on video you're also in in front of a piece of art that has these hexagonal plates called Kudos that are nfts and I know that in 2019 we gave out get coin Kudos which was our nft experiment at the time to 10 I think it was thousands of people earned nfts for visiting the sponsor booths and then attending events it was the first nft scavenger hunt that was the year that poapp was invented by Patricio at eat Denver so he got inspired by some of the things that we were doing with this sort of Engagement layer that you and I had built with uh the kudos and um he obviously poapp is a whole nother thing now but yeah I mean that's that's exactly right I mean so for those of you that don't know if you ever see me on a call this is all nfts here this is a collage of nfts that I've um that one of our long-time contributors uh Jonathan Palmer actually created this masterpiece of woodworking and um I bought it at the eat Denver 2019 nft R auction actually hmm nice so I mean I guess like the you know those are the experiments that I'm aware of but one of the things I've always liked about East Denver is it's tried to work in crypto stuff into its Community Austin Griffith is out here in the burner wallet I think it was Genesis in Colorado and I just think that that is a major point of legitimacy for me for East Denver yeah one of the things that we've always sort of been it's been a little curious to me is like why we don't see more Tech at these web three conferences and it's like isn't that the whole point uh so we took a very much an experiential approach so we're less confidence more experience which is why we call it a community Innovation Festival where when you come it doesn't have the traditional expo hall conferencing top-down sort of like you know you know VC vests and stuff going on like or the you know Wall Street suits you know we've got all varieties of people doing really incredible creative things artists makers hackers Builders Nomads you name it people are coming and doing stuff but as far as the event goes we try to give people a glimpse into the future and so having the crypto enabled food trucks and being able to pay with a native Community currency or you know doing a scavenger hunt for nfts and and sort of proving your attendance and earning deeper engagement into the community or it's you know quadratic voting in terms of the community voting and signal on the projects that are submitted to the hackathon or or whatever right I mean there's a whole bunch of stuff that we we've done and that we're going to continue to do and and look for new opportunities to give really that again Glimpse to the Future because you know we can sit around and talk about stuff all day but talking about something and experiencing something are two different things right yeah I mean I think it's it's really kind of neat how the frontier has been pushed out here in in the um in the web 3 space and and I think that's one neat thing but also just the breadth of what you're up to uh I'd love to talk about sporked out and Innovation jam and all the things that have kind of spun out of East Denver or you the different different different points of the spork so so can you pull that thread and tell us about those yeah so one of the things that I mean we we created a Dao out of E10 versus like I said this back on Main stage probably 2019 I think is when I said it we're going to turn eight Denver into a dow and everyone's like what how are you gonna do that now the downers are like yeah man that's gonna be awesome like but nobody had any idea exactly how we would do that I mean we're a geo-located event you can't just YOLO an event with liability concerns and you know there's a lot of things that could go wrong with you know just jumping in the pool into dawifying an event Community event and then figuring out how to tokenize it not you know violate any big laws or rules or anything like how do you do this so it took us a while but in May 2021 we moved everything to sportdow so sportdow is the the master Dao and then the meta Dows are eat Denver Colorado Jam and buffacorn Ventures so it's kind of the and then the the fourth sprawl the the fourth prong is the community right so there's these three sort of orgs inside the community and then the community itself is the fourth prong in terms of the value points for sporked out so the spork meme came from um we were messing around with like when they were talking about hard forks and soft Forks back in 2017 2018 and how people were making comparisons to the Bitcoin community and how they were hard forking all the time and it was not collaborative but all the the forks in ethereum were always very uh non-contentious right they're very friendly and so there was somebody I originally said you know it's like a soft fork and then I said I don't know kind of like a spork and they're like yeah so then we started we brought uh we actually bought a whole bunch of biodegradable sporks in 2019 and how to model all the food trucks so like the utensils they gave you instead of a fork was a spork so we started doing that and then like people really liked the meme and and then we just turned it into kind of the you know it's the preferred tool of choice for biddlers at East Denver is the sport I mean you could battle with it you could dig with it you could fiddle with it you can do all sorts of stuff so it's kind of it's this representation of this massively you know versatile tool and we just kind of ran with it so now it's like a thing so the community token is Spork and sporked out is the name and you know the game is about biddling which is sort of representative of the spork in itself so um the different activities in terms of creating uh regen games so like uh if they've ever run an event and Kevin you have um they're expensive yeah like brutally expensive and you know when you're trying to keep things free you know the temptation to charge for tickets is really big because you know how else are you going to create sustainability it's not even necessarily about making profits it's just like how do you keep the lights on so we've been very fortunate um that we've had enough sponsorship support from the community but then we thought like okay well how do we take this to the next level all these really cool projects come out of you Denver like poapp like pool together like one inch was on our stage in 2019. um winning a finalist prize like what if we had put a small investment as a community into these projects when they were small what would that have meant in terms of you know reciprocating value back so we create the stage in a place for them to kind of launch but then you know how do they give back well you know you're not going to go to one of these projects and say hey we helped you guys like back then do we get any Equity because they're gonna go like no but like how do we actually give them value in in a more sustainable way where then the reciprocation comes back so again about creating positive some regenerative games so we uh created buff corn Ventures to do just that so the community funds it uh we've got a whole new buff corn Ventures program coming out in the fall for this next cohort come up eat them or 2023 and it's really cool because the community is the one investing in these projects and then the way the tokenomics work is as these projects become profitable those profits come back to sport down above corn Ventures and then the sporkholders are the ones who received the patronage rewards for their contributions and consumption through the Dow so it's a really cool model and it's obviously a grand experiment but like all we got to do is hit a couple of big Investments and the top could blow off this thing in a way that none of us ever even anticipated so it's been a lot of fun it's a work in progress yeah I think that's really neat as someone who's also been building communities um I'm no longer involved in Bitcoin dial leadership but I know that get coin Dao has talked about uh what would it look like if there was some sort of token swap between git coin and some of the projects that have graduated from it and I know that Colonel which is another project in the get coin ecosystem has has looked at that model also and also Bitcoin hackathons games you know this is the the problem that I have with like you know I'm I'm really really really big on for-profit public utilities public goods that are open source that don't have business models I love them but I just worry that they don't have sustainability there's no there's no long-term survivability for a lot of this stuff it's like the question is how do you not under undermine the benevolence and the The Good Will that you're building through these projects I call this the structural benevolence component how do you not undermine that but also make it self-sustaining economically so Bitcoin good example like I mean my God look at the amount of money you guys have put out into the community for for Grants well how do you create regen out of that for git coin because like that's not an easy thing to to like figure out but I think there's definitely ways to do it and you know you and I have talked about some of those over the years but I think you're right um it's it's important that these communities are internally sustainable over time right otherwise I I really worry about them either becoming morphing into something they shouldn't be in terms of traditional for-profitness or they just go the foundation slash not for profit and there's no incentives to actually build it right you mean Bittle it yeah Bittle it the Diddle Diddle well uh you know I think we've talked uh for most of the episodes so far about East Denver and Spork Dao but uh for those of us who know you and and know your insane entrepreneurial energy would know that that's not even the the sort of whole elephant of of what you're working on right day job yeah yeah so youth Denver is actually a side project for you which I think is insane and um and and kind of inspiring and and uh you talked about a globally owned uh that's you didn't say globally uh a public utility um and I know that uh your day job is opolis which is a public utility for employment can you tell us about opolis yeah so in sort of the same vein and spirit of regen games you know one of the big elephant in the room in my opinion when it comes to realizing the self-sovereign future is our employment framework you know we do it because we think we have to and we willingly subjugate ourselves to corporate overlords and sometimes it's not so bad but like if you get to be a company of any sort of size you know there's a bureaucracy that sort of naturally sets in and that design that game design is extractive because typically C Corps unless they're a b Corp or something have a legal mandate to maximize profits and the shareholders of that entity are the ones who profit and those that are being employed by that company may get a little flick of the French fry off the table in terms of some options or something but it's a very zero-sum game it's a very scarcity based game so we decided to say okay there's a you know one how do we democratize employment how do we actually give the keys to employment to the individual you and I years and years and years ago we're talking about the unbundling right the great unbundling of employment where the work and then sort of the employment are separate and so you know I started working on this um in 2016 I mean I first said the words democratized employment in 2005 so I've been at this for 17 years but like and all of it was a culmination to really find this product Market fit which is really a public utility infrastructure and platform for employment that serves independent workers it's not about you know get coin or you know coinbase being the customer that are in crypto even a doubt like even a maker Dow like maker Dow is a coalition member of the of the employment Commons that's opolis uh build but it's not a customer it's a channel partner but it also benefits from its members using Obelisk so it's again it's a positive sum game so what we do is we're a giant bridge for people working ethereally to to gain legitimacy to get things like health care and compliance and payroll taxes being paid and W-2s and pay stubs to actually look like a normal person you can actually plug into opolis and get access to all of those things without giving up your Independence and then for those looking to get into web3 It's the Great Bridge you know it's it's wait I'm supposed to quit my job join a dow not have health care not have a retirement plan and get paid in crypto like how the hell am I supposed to pay for my rent like what do I even do so opolis is the tool and the community and the platform that basically does all that stuff for you so your experience of work is pretty much just like it is right now where you get a paycheck every two weeks and you get a W-2 at the end of the year and you got your group health care plan that's like really high quality and all of it works really well right so yeah but I would just interject that uh we have object level experience within the get coin dial community of this and that a lot of people are working for tokens in or around get coin Dao and they need a way to show their employment to a bank to I mean whoever would want to look at a pay stub and so you guys are kind of that bridge legitimacy around this right yeah um and so the bridge between the future world in which we're all working for Global decentralized ledgers decentralized organizations but the rest of the world hasn't caught up for that opolis seems like it's public infrastructure for that but I think what's really cool is that you're kind of Designing opolis around this work token thing and daoizing it yourself so there's like that second level of really eating your own dog food uh and I think that's neat also we don't think that having a centralized organization um even if you know there's some other players in the in the the space who are playing well we're not a doubt yet it's like okay good luck getting there like if you don't start it's like if you don't actually start with how do you actually build the framework to be able to maintain this benevolence and like give Community ownership of it then you're just building the old game it's an US versus them or a service provider in the consumer this is built by Independence for Independence and the work token is the unit of account of ownership in the community the patronage token we have a legal uh rapper of a Cooperative it's an LCA that gives when you become a member you become an owner it's like REI for employment so when there's profits the work token let's say I own one percent of the work tokens and we got a 10 million dollar dividend you know futuristically because we're not there yet but let's say we got a 10 million dollar distribution that we're going to put out for patronage profits to the community I get one percent of those profits as a member as a consumer right so I've earned these tokens through my consumption through my referrals through staking and so we're we're rewarding people for activities that are valuable to the community as patronage and then we're giving them the tokens so when the time comes that's their right to those distributions and they don't have to cash in their tokens to get it it's a perpetuity thing it's it's their um ability now and this goes on and on and on and on and so we have an inflation model that's about a nine to one ratio so like for every 10 percent in value accrual which we measure by payroll growth or if we grow by 10 we inflate the token Supply by about 1.2 percent so there's a nine to one accrual ratio there in terms of value to to inflation which actually creates continued scarcity and also drives the value of the the token potentially up so um not we're not involved in secondary markets right now if you go ahead and look at the work token it's like two cents we don't care and people are like well how do you get how do you get more demand for the token it's like I don't know why don't we just make it profitable like let's get to a place where the actual ecosystem is sustainable instead of playing ponsonomics and degenomics like why don't we just do what we've always done in terms of you know creating value which is let's let's actually make it more valuable than it costs and then when we distribute that the overage in terms of profits out to the community it's natural built in demand why wouldn't you wanna you know a yield that keeps paying because it's you know once you get to a certain level it's just sustainable it'll just go on its own I think what you're saying is absolutely heretically you're telling me web3 projects should be profitable John yeah look I I am I am a known skeptic of a lot of the you know cutesy Buck Rogers Technologies and tokenomic games that we play um I think that there's a little bit of a futuristic delusion that some of some folks in our space suffer from when it comes to like the sustainability of this you can't have staking rewards at three thousand percent per day and and and expect me to buy that there's any real value in that I mean it's a Ponzi scheme because the money coming in is paying out the rewards to those who are looking for it that's classic deal it's like somebody's gonna be hell you know it's like musical chairs When the Music Stops somebody's gonna be left out you know and it's not going to be a good thing when number goes up it's fine but look at Terra Luna in terms of algorithmic stable coins you know terminal flaw well who supports the value when things go down when it goes up it's easy when it goes down it's impossible so same kind of thing so I I'm a guy who sits on the fence a lot I build lots of bridges you know eat Denver's a giant bridge for normies to come and learn about web3 opolis is an opportunity for not just to legitimize those in the space we're not building employment for web three oppos doesn't have Dao in its name intentionally because five years from now we're not gonna be talking about Dows and stuff we're going to be talking about these work to earn play to earn contribute to earned models that are Next Generation platforms Public Utilities that are for-profit that are sustainable that have business models and are self-contained and the the Advent of the service Dow which we're actually a very early illustration of you know you could think of oculus as an employment Tower a serviced out for employment it's like yeah it's actually we're we're an infrastructure aggregator so a lot of the technology we use are Primitives and natives from around the space and some web 2 stuff to store your data because we can't put employment data on chain yet and the community owns it right so it's providing a service that's sustainable that people need it becomes very very profitable at scale and the incentives are to help grow it to consume and then to lock your tokens up so it creates a healthy monetary policy environment for the value to continue to rise the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer one for the

innovative thing that otherwise would have been classified in a in a tough tough category so uh opolis can you pull that thread of how Colorado's employment Co-op law has has allowed you to do some of this stuff yeah so Colorado cooperatives are incredibly interesting things so I happen to live here right so I I didn't know this back in like you know so when we first launched our research project on legal Frameworks that could sustain something like this we didn't even really know what we were looking for yet entirely we just knew that we had to Define it and we had to then kind of compare against different legal Frameworks so then we stumbled on co-ops and one of the things that really stood out to me was cooperative in Colorado have a Securities exemption for registration and I'm like hmm Interest really interesting and then you find out that they actually have an investor class as well a lot of Cooperative Frameworks nationally don't have an investor class then you find out that there's no industry limitations so lots of Co-op Frameworks in different states are limited to like agriculture or you know you know public like uh electricity or something like that like they have very limited scope on what you can use Colorado has no limits so it's like a blank slate like a giant blank canvas that you can like you can kind of frame what you want we just started yeah like I'm like gosh co-ops are a lot like Dallas and then one of the attorneys that we work with here shout out to Jason weiner uh and Jackie and yev who are fantastic attorneys here in Colorado um well Jackie's actually lives in the midwest but she she works a lot on a lot of Cooperative stuff all across the country she's fabulous um we we sort of started pulling on the strings and like I started designing like you know like how would this look and so we basically came up with a framework that you know like I said we're an employment Dow with the legal rapper of an LCA limited Cooperative Association um we invented the concept of the patronage token which is really just digitizing the already existing patronage mechanism which is the you know the shipping back of profits back to the community to The Cooperative members and then we had to Define some governance and some definitions around a bunch of things but then we we settled on a framework that we thought was really cool so now what's happened is um a whole bunch more people are using this framework as a means to legitimize doubts so there was a lot of talk about the Wyoming Dow framework but it's really sort of just the Next Generation LLC in some ways it's very good for an investment Club so if you want to like set up it like an investment vehicle for that that sort of operates like a dow I think it works well for that but it's not um very good for like a community-based out where you have like some other purpose Again The Cooperative framework seems to fit that really well so you know we've been talking with you know Folks at the state and we've been talking with you know Folks at the Regulatory Commission and just you know making sure that we're hey what we're doing is this is this okay you know because certainly we don't want to get in trouble with anything and we are again I'm on the BR I'm in the bridge right I'm trying to bridge between the worlds I'm not really just yoloing everything and because we're dealing with people's employment and compliance and taxes you know I I kind of felt like we're just not suited to YOLO any of this as it stands so yeah that's kind of where it came from and now you know so shout out to my my friend Jonathan Mann who just celebrated his 5 000th you know um song a day you know you know John Mann is is that using this too it is yes okay so a bunch a bunch of communities are using it I know of probably 30 or 40 that are in the works of using it and the idea is to try to you know really Gain real world use cases where it's it's provably not just fair but like it works right like we can enable communities to build their own micro economies and like build their own Frameworks that that work for them that are opt-in just like the concept of a Dao but actually having some legal tethering and legal legitimacy that already has established Frameworks around it so it's been really interesting so about five years of work on that front has turned into something pretty cool I think what you're saying is we should move to Colorado and start our dials here you know we can have a meme Kevin we should come up with something that like really promotes Colorado I got it chill Colorado I love it we'll add it to the pile of memes for those of you that don't know that's like totally like already a thing show Colorado's like Kevin came up with the meme originally and then we uh launched it into the ether space at eat Denver 2018. yeah along with what's the other meme that we launched in Denver 2018 you remember I think Bittle is is it there there's been a couple though I'm losing track because there's so many yeah and I have to say you know you're sort of the uh the spirit animal and meme Lord of some of this and then I just put it into the wild and and make it a thing and and then next thing you know it's like all over the place last I looked like millions of Biddle hashtags all over yeah and it's a it's a it's a good alt or a fork of huddle which is hold on for dear life uh build build for dear life one of the things that I think is cool about you John is that you you know you and I entered the space in the 2017 cycle uh similar time as each other and we we kind of you know git coin was a future of work play we pivoted sort towards grants a little bit since then andopolis is the future of work play and and I want to say that I respect the multi-cycle builders that have gone through the bull and the bear and saw things before anyone else back then future of work on blockchain was a really outside play and then also just the idea that Colorado was going to be one of the top scenes in the U.S you know on on par with New York and San Francisco was kind of crazy and and I think that seeing it develop over the last five years has been cool can't wait to have you uh well hopefully we'll have you back on the pod in another five years in 2027 and uh talk about the Colorado web 3 Metropolis that has been built out here yeah well that's that's the goal right is to make it really the destination of choice I mean it's a friendly place um if you haven't been to youth Denver you got to come and experience that I mean I'm talking to your audience of course right now but like for anybody listening if you haven't been it will blow your mind like the things if you you know forget crypto conferences and San Francisco Expo halls and stuff like that no no no no no like yeah yeah I haven't seen anything until you come to eat Denver and and the community Vibe is unmatched you know emcon does a really good job at man at managing a community Vibe but like they're they're going to keep it smaller and like intentionally I mean we do it at scale so it's gonna be freaking good time so um did you mind if I put out like a like a sort of call to action on the office runs so the first front is keep an eye open early Alpha League that applications free Denver are going to be launched right after Devcon so like in a few weeks other early Alpha hint you're gonna probably want to get a buff a corn if you don't have one already and that's the Buffalo corn Biddle Brigade on Open Sea it's already been minted out since before each Denver this past year and but you can still get them the floor price is still pretty good if you have one of those and if you have Spork if you've attended eat Denver previously you already have Spork or you should but if you don't um I'd pick some up somewhere you can find it um polygon and and well mostly on polygon I've seen it and uh you're going to want to have to you're going to stake some Spork and the reason for that is because we're giving priority um acceptance guaranteed acceptance and a bunch of different perks to those that staked different levels or have different kind of like profiles so we're we're trying to really hone in the signal on quality contributors and members of sportdow and and the Denver Community this year we had entirely a time-based application process so if I'm a you know crypto bro guy that applied in you know mid October he probably got in but then you know Kevin owaki applies you know two weeks before because he didn't need to know that he needed to and he gets put on a wait list because we got 28 000 applications so what we're doing is we're giving a path into the community that doesn't cost you anything if you have these assets but it's still free to attend free to apply you don't have to have any of this stuff but some early Alpha for those that actually want to get a head start on and collecting some of these assets to like get the uh premium access the buffcorn Biddle Brigade access um that's on the Denver front on the obless front so the question is if you're a solopreneur if you're an independent contractor digital Nomad Dow contributor or whatever you are okay if you're working independently what are you doing for Health Care next year now one of the core features of opolis is we can save you 20 to 40 percent off the state exchange rates and it's way better coverage for you and your family so even if it's just for that the cost benefit analysis is you can save a bunch of money at opolis even if you don't refer anybody and you don't do anything else come check it out okay opolis.com is the place to go and check it out you can also join our Discord and our Telegram we can probably put those um I could probably put those in the chat here but yeah put them in the chat they'll be in the in the episode notes if you do yeah I'll put them in the chat okay so I'm gonna multitask here and then the you know the last thing I wanted to ask you as you're putting those in the chat is um you know I think that you're legal and Regulatory game is one of the strongest that I've ever seen uh was just in a meeting with you and Jared Polis the governor of Colorado last week talking about how to make Colorado the first digital State could you talk a little bit about what you're doing at the Statewide of Colorado in order to help polis Advance innovation in Colorado but it seems like it's sort of reciprocal in that the web 3 ecosystem gets to grow in Colorado and I think it's it's really cool so can you tell us a little bit about that before we break yeah so again sitting on the fence and looking at the landscape of both of both lands here you know my conclusion is like look this isn't going to be a revolution where we just topple the government and say screw you guys and like I don't know I don't I don't know that the community really has an appetite for that so um we've always said like okay well how do we how do we how do we get the right people to see this Vision this this the vision of the digital Community for example like how do we actually like get there and so I started uh so Governor polis was um was inaugurated in I think it was January 2021 is that right now January 2020 is when he was inaugurated no January 19 2019 he was inaugurated so he didn't make it uh to to eat Denver 2018 or 2019 because he wasn't really in office yet I mean he kind of was in 2019 but he was really busy and I couldn't get him to come um but then he came in with force in 2020 2021 and 2022 so we've been building this this public-private partnership and one of his core beliefs is that like the wisdom of the crowd the community knows a lot more than we give him credit for so in in instilling and encouraging Innovation and really trying to find new ways of developing and and multiplying economic vibrancy for our communities is really the path forward because as his mandate as Governor is to make the community better like more vibrant more wealthy more sustainable and you know you could look at there's lots of ways to do that you could say well let's just encourage more corporations to come here and build here and invest here but then you've just got more of the same you've got top down economic but supply side economics you got Kensington economics you've got bad monetary policy you've got all sorts of things that are kind of coming to I think the later stages of their usefulness but then it's not about just you know running off a cliff and saying that capitalism sucks it's like I don't think Jared pulse thinks that at all I mean he self-made I mean he's two-time startup founder and exit remounting cards and I think it's is it 1-800 Flowers so I actually I I came to Colorado because of techstars which Jared Polis co-founded and he's a technology entrepreneur out here before he was a congressman and Governor so I think his Pro-Tech and pro Innovation agenda is quite inspiring and I'm an actual result of that I quit my my corporate job in order to go into startups because of polis and Tech Stars exactly so um yeah so he I think he he's a very rare politician because he's not he's not so dogmaticized by the party line you know he's Democrat but he's got hints of libertarianism and he's got hints of pro-business and he's got hints of um you know progressivism and and he's sort of a quasi technocrat in some ways like I mean there's a lot of Dimensions to him um I'm I'm sort of taking the liberty of describing him I'm not even sure what he would say but like I've watched you know enough to to see that he's pretty pragmatic on a lot of fronts and he wants the citizens of Colorado um to have really great egalitarian systems that allow them to kind of choose what's good for them you know like but then how do we solve you know public goods issues and public fundings and like these are all really important issues to him that I think fit with web three so like and sort of the our brand of it that we've built here in Colorado so um you know uh Russell castanero who was the um um Innovation director for the office of information and Technology the governor's office for information technology is now full-time in sporked out he's running our Ventures ecosystem and incubator he's you know very effective probably more effective on the outside of the government than he was on the inside but we have very strong Partnerships with governor's office with oh edit with owett um Department of Education and and it's growing right so you know we haven't just sort of thumbed our noses at these you know okay Boomer kind of folks because like you could do that but that's just not constructive it's like you know it we got to figure out how to create a narrative and a conversation that really works for everyone and that's how we get Mass adoption is it's kind of like what's the next Generation Choose Your Own Adventure platform that's positive some games in nature um permissionless to a large extent and and economically vibrant where it incentivizes the right kind of participation the right kind of outcomes and also has durability sustainability and benevolence built into the frame so everything that we've been doing trying to even this this uh Roundtable or I should have been called Square table right um the round table that we had with the governor also if it's going to be about blocks then yeah sure yeah it was a square table um even though they called it a round table like literally um you know it's about you know collaboration and you know that's what I've really always appreciated about Governor polis is he's he doesn't think that he has all the answers and he's been very open to like hearing our perspectives and and trying to you know understand how to really you know create this new paradigm that yeah you know isn't isn't so prevalent in in the mainstream conversation of politics I guess I should say yeah well I think what you did with getting two Governors on stage reading B is for buffer corn with the vitalik was pretty legendary so Kudos on that and hoping to come to a future East Denver in which you've got a president on stage not to set too high of a bar for you Jared Polis you know like I know he's got political aspirations we haven't you know talked about presidency directly but you know indirectly his team has sort of alluded to some things and um you know it would be good for America in web 3 in America if polish that's kind of my point is wouldn't it be cool instead of the the left and the right fighting over who's more evil and who's ugh you know wouldn't it be cool if we had a third dimension that was more about positive some outcomes less demonization more opportunity more permissionless but protections right the effective use of blockchain's identity reputation and actually created this next Generation world where we don't have to fight about scarcity we could get to a place of potentially infinite abundance creation through right design and smarter monetary policy and microeconomy monetary policy and you know digital co-ops and making that a not just a reality but like the common way of creating products and services I think it could be a fantastic start to a new human Paradigm but you know we got what's in front of us right now so we just you know hand me another brick let's build that's a great place to end well thanks so much for coming on the Pod John uh keep up the great work with East Denver's worked out opolis and looking forward to biddling with you in the future you got it man thanks gab good to see you brother likewise foreign [Music]
