solana just released a flagship android phone called um sega so far david sale's not looking too good you'd actually see this on chain pre-sales have been about 2.5 000 which kind of begs the question of like does a blockchain really need to have its own phone this would feel really weird if the ethereum foundation was like and now we have a phone the ethereal phone it feels very strange maybe there's a justification for this maybe i'm wrong i gotta be honest though i don't really get it it seems like a massive distraction to a blockchain network
