[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david brian armstrong on the podcast ceo co-founder of coinbase what an episode what a conversation what were some of your thoughts coming out of that i really liked the way that we actually structured the podcast i started talking about brian the human brian with the the person with the values and visions and then turn that right into how that turned into a company called coinbase you might have heard of it uh and then of course a number of the things that have gone around in the recent news cycle coinbase's fight with the regulators their new nft platform their new nba and wnba sponsorships a lot of things happening in the world of coinbase and also a lot of things happening around the world of coinbase including banks feeling scared mark zuckerberg turning facebook into meta and then of course we finished again with the conversation about brian armstrong towards the end as a crypto veteran of the 2010s what he thinks the 2020s will look like and why he seems to be immune from this cycle of founders that create something get wealthy and get lazy and then get disrupted he that doesn't that's not brian like he coinbase is yet to be disrupted so what keeps him going why why is he still here fighting this fight um and overall just a nice look into both of the person behind the the company and also the company itself yeah i love that and i love by the way you just patted ourselves on the back for a brilliantly structured podcast agenda it wasn't that david like i really do think that it was a it was a fantastic conversation got to know brian a bit more got to understand coinbase that's really what i was looking for out of this conversation is i sort of wanted to um not explicitly ask the question but i sort of wanted to find out like is coinbase going to be the d5 friendly exchange the d5 friendly crypto bank or should we wait for another that was kind of my question going into this and that that's very much why we started with with values and i feel like we've got a ton of values the bankless movement has a lot of values alignment with where brian was going to go and the thing that probably impressed me most was his answer when we asked him would you ask him the question of hey brian how can we make sure that coinbase doesn't just become one of the legacy banks that we all hate already right and his answer to that was exactly what i hoped he would say right um yeah you know maybe to his detriment i guess like to his own it was not the the rational self-interest it was more the the founder willing to take a risk like here's how i hope the world plays out sort of answer uh and i've got a lot of you know respect for for that type of an answer so overall this is very bullish i think on coinbase's dedication to the bankless ecosystem the d5 ecosystem open credibly neutral protocols the things that we care the most about on our program so yeah i think you guys will really enjoy this episode in unpacking all of these thoughts we also talked about you know nfts as well the new nft platform we touched upon the regulatory situation in the u.s and guys let's not forget brian has been here since the very early stages too okay before crypto was cool at all like it was not cool when brian ryan was trying to build coinbase at the very beginning it was not cool i mean and so brian is definitely uh you know some people have called you and i uh og's here recently i've seen that on twitter okay we are not oh geez okay brian armstrong is an og all right um this is somebody who's been in the space building from the very inception the thing the final thing i think i was left with is um this is not a trader okay this is not somebody who is in this for just the money okay this is somebody who is a builder in the space and cares about builder things it's a very long-term oriented sort of focus and i think that's pretty unique even if you compare you know coinbase to all of the other crypto banks in the world it's kind of unique and there's a lot of that dna in the company itself so anything more that you want to say david or should we get right to it yeah there's so much more i want to say especially exactly what what you're talking about with why brian was interested in making sure that he doesn't turn himself or coinbase into another bank but we'll have to save that for the debriefing yeah yeah you like that ryan and i spent 20 30 minutes just kind of debriefing unpacking the episode what we thought of it what we thought well our thoughts

you can go and sign up for the premium version of the bankless newsletter where you will get the private rss feed where you can hear our debriefs every single monday and with that i think we should go right into the conversation with brian armstrong but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for

super excited to introduce you to our next guest he needs no introduction though he's never been on the podcast but that does not mean he is an unknown figure in crypto this is brian armstrong he is the ceo and co-founder of coinbase brian it's fantastic to have you on bankless how you doing sir doing great thanks for having me guys i've been a listener for a while and just been very impressed with all the content you're putting out there so thanks for having me well that's awesome i guess i would say join the mutual admiration club because i've been a coinbase a customer for quite some time in fact i think a lot of people listening to this podcast um will probably recognize coinbase as maybe like the first place they actually got into crypto that was certainly my case my first bitcoin buy ever was on coinbase and i remember at the time um you i i didn't really know too much about crypto i was kind of sketched out by many of the other exchanges out there and coinbase really made the experience feel safe made it feel easy and it got me over the hump so i i guess i would start by saying brian thanks for building coinbase man love the product it's great love what you've done with it thank you i appreciate that yeah we've helped get hopefully millions more people into crypto which has helped the whole space and uh it's just the beginning so hopefully you know this space just has taken off in a crazy way in the last three four years since we helped people get a little bit of crypto and now our our next big challenge is how do we get people to actually go use that crypto and all kinds of all these all these novel ways and make that just as simple as it was the first time you wanted to buy it yeah that that's super cool we want to discuss a lot of that now you know maybe first let's take you uh down memory lane a little bit just to talk about how far you've come so coinbase as i understand it started in uh 2012 or so this is relevant news not the first time you guys have been top of the charts in terms of the app store but you top the charts last week coinbase sitting at number one in uh the iphone apple iphone charts um but i want to take you back to like maybe uh 2013. um my friend dan uh tweeted this out a while ago and i just remember reading this this is a picture of you at a coinbase booth and i think you were like single manning the booth maybe at a a um a conference maybe a consensus conference um you know i don't know nine years ago or so eight or nine years ago so um tell us about the journey right so like i feel like coinbase has had to get a lot of things right in order to get from this single person booth to number one on the app store so number one you have to be in the right place right like which is you know crypto so you have to be right on that you also had to uh have kind of the the timing right about things um and then you also had to to execute so take us from maybe all the way back here to to now where you are how did all of this happen brian yeah well first of all there so there was three of us there it was myself fred ursum and then olaf carlson we you can see on the left there in the gray t-shirt is that olaf right there yeah he later went on to found polychain and um so it was just us three that we were the only three employees of the company um those gray t-shirts we were giving away there you know was some kind of terrible uh design probably that i threw together at the last minute um got you know probably off 99 designs or something like that and if anybody still has one of those actually it'd be funny to post like on twitter they're probably collectors items now but um you know it was a very scrappy operation as you can see we had just a couple t-shirts in a little booth um most of the companies who were at that that original uh bitcoin conference you know don't exist anymore but people are still around in some way shape or form and so it was like it was it felt like um the chaos computer club if you think about the early days of like steve wozniak and steve jobs and anyway it had a very kind of um you know kind of altered vibe to it that was a little weird but it was very cool and so how did we get from there to here i mean so many steps along the way i mean basically we just we we were three people at that time just trying to make something that customers wanted and the original idea that i had for coinbase was when i first read the bitcoin white paper i was like hey this is this is about this is cool it's kind of like the internet it's a it's a new global decentralized protocol for moving information or not just removing information around but for moving value around and as somebody who had studied economics and computer science and was kind of excited about creating more freedom in the world that really caught my attention and so the first thing i could do i thought to do was the only thing i'd think of to do was all right well this technology is really cool but how do we make it easier to use so why don't i make a really simple hosted bitcoin wallet that was the very first idea i had and my analogy at that time was like kind of like github you know is a very simple way to use git or gmail is a simple way to use email it's all hosted it's in the cloud so you don't have to worry about security and backups and i had this thought like you know someone's probably gonna make a bitcoin company like that like the gmail for bitcoin and i started tinkering around with it on nights and weekends and applied to y combinator and so suddenly we had a little bit of seed funding we had two employees and here i was at this conference so you know right around that time uh we weren't we really didn't have any traction we had no users i called people who would sign up for the site you know i'd post a link on reddit or somewhere like that hey come check out this bitcoin wallet i'm making and some people would sign up but they would never really come back and use keep using the product and so i called a couple of the people who had signed up i actually just emailed them and said hey i built this app can you can i get on the phone with you and i remember asking them um you know why didn't you come back and people said well i love i thought it was pretty good but like i don't really have any bitcoin and so i didn't have any bitcoin to put to put in the wallet i remember asking them at one point a little light bulb went off and i was like well if we put a simple buy button in there with that which you have bought some and they're like yeah probably um because it's kind of hard to get and so that led us on a bit of a journey to go get a bank integration and figure out some compliance stuff and integrate with an exchange and eventually made a very simple buy button and from that moment coinbase started to really grow quickly and it actually got to a place where we were not pushing the boulder up the hill every day the boulder started to roll down the hill and we started to chase after it as fast as we could you know with customer support inquiries and keeping the website up and getting enough working capital into the business to keep it running so that was how it got started i'll pause there because there's a million other things to get to where we are today but um that was the beginning yeah i mean i i think we're going to talk about a lot of those those dots and like where we are today and also where you're going but like i'm also curious about this thread because this is also i think a conversation a little bit about about you brian like you know why you founded coinbase and and the reasons for it and the values your dna that's that's kind of imbued in the company one thing that's interesting about that story is so olaf was at the booth you know fred fred was at the booth they have both gone on to fund incredibly successful uh firms um like uh in the investing space like funds in and of themselves which is absolutely fantastic um you've stayed at coinbase though and you've continued to build so i guess my question is like why did you start the thing in the first place and what's made you stay yeah great question so i think the thing that made me start it in the first place was that i i read the bitcoin white paper in like december of 2010 and it it basically captured my attention in a really profound way it i remember having this thought like wow this might be the most important thing i've read in in five ten years and the reason that that happened was a few things one was that i was always very passionate about this concept of economic freedom you know i had i had studied a bit of economics i had read some iran you know i was like very passionate about this idea of like if we give people basic ability to keep the upsides of their of their labor and made the global financial system more efficient in terms of how people you know generate wealth keep wealth have a stable currency how do they participate in global trade property rights how can we make that and i was like that that seems like this kind of secret hiding in plain sight that like what if the world had just better financial infrastructure and property rights and we were able to somehow inject that into all these countries around the world so i hadn't quite phrased it like that in my head but that was sort of the inkling that i had at that time where i was really excited about it and then the other thing was that i had always felt like i had been born a little bit too late to really start a great internet company um because the internet was coming of age as i was in high school and whatnot and by the time i graduated there was like you know there was google and amazon and paypal and all these things and i it sounds very silly now to say but at the time i was like man maybe how often does an invention like the internet really come along i wish i had been there in the formative stages of the internet to start one of the early internet companies that would have been so cool and so when i saw the bitcoin white paper i was like this sound this is like maybe the next internet you know and i had always wanted to be an entrepreneur even high school i was starting little things with my friends um most of them were not very successful but the bitcoin white paper was this moment where i was like all right i might be crazy my friends all think this is kind of silly um but i want to start something that's impactful and has hasn't has an impact on the world and this feels like it might be the next big thing and it fits just it just aligns with my values like i want i want there to be more economic freedom in the world so this could be the kind of thing that i could get into for like 10 20 years or more so then you asked i guess why am i still here yeah um so it's fun i mean not every day is fun right there's parts of it that suck uh but um for the most part it's fun because it scratches an itch for me which is i like learning new things and being the ceo of a company is like always pushing you outside your comfort zone to some new challenge i also love building things with technology that's kind of one of my great passions in life as a you know i studied as a computer scientist or as a software engineer um and i just i just love building things with technology as a way to improve the world like that's even if um you know i retired or i was like stuck in a cabin by myself in the woods for like 10 years i probably would just try to build things that's like who i am and so it scratches that itch and it basically as coinbase grows we have more and more resources and people to try bigger and bigger things to try more ambitious things to try um more impactful things you know i i want us to eventually get to be having a billion people accessing this open financial system through our products every day and that's fun so as long as it's fun i don't see myself changing on that dimension um but i'm really happy also for a lot of the early people at coinbase including fred and olaf and and dozens of others who went on to start crypto investment funds other companies in the space like one of the things i'm really proud of is that coinbase has spawned a lot of startups in the crypto space and um that to me felt feels like okay we had this nexus of culture in the very very early days which helped educate a lot of people about this and then they went on to do even greater things and that's by the way that's still true today in an even bigger way we have so many people like coinbase ventures is our investment arm we made like 47 investments in the last quarter like in the last three months of people starting crypto companies and a lot of those were like connected to coinbase or former employees of coinbase so i feel like the ecosystem is just in the very early days it's just you know the coinbase mafia keeps growing out there yeah it definitely does i mean we've spoken to a number of members of the coinbase mafia i guess antonio the founder of dydx maybe most recently but uh you guys are definitely uh you know spreading um curious curious about values right so you mentioned sort of that the feel of like uh circa 2013 in crypto where it felt sort of homebrew compute club sort of felt like very you know chaotic and very interesting sorry homebrew that's that was the name of it the chaos is something else yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's like so i i i want to ask a question about like so i think people come to crypto for different reasons right in in like bank list we often class we there's tourists there's sort of mercenaries and then there's like settlers right and some people are here for the money some people are here for the tech hard problems that sort of thing some people are here for the values right and i i'm curious to hear because i i think you can really uh plot the trajectory of an individual based on the reason that they're actually here um i recall re reading a uh an interview i think this was forbes of uh an exchange founder this was a a recent forbes article in october uh and uh the interviewer i asked him the questions like hey if you if you could abandon crypto and just trade like uh orange juice futures you know would you do it uh and uh his answer was yes right like i'm kind of here for the money right now i want to give that money to philanthropic philanthropic uh causes i believe in altruism but i'm not actually here for crypto values so i'm curious when it comes to brian armstrong as like the reason you're in crypto and you had to rate money tech and values which comes first on your list yeah so i think it started with values for me um i love that i love the tech also i mean look money is money is great i think that it gets a bad name people think oh well it's just profit driven i you know i'm a capitalist at heart i think probably a contrarian view even in today's climate but i think capitalism is a force for good for the world and um if you accumulate capital you can do even better things to improve the world so i don't want to shy away from capital at all but the thing that that certainly got me excited about crypto in the first place was the values it was really this idea that um i it just never made sense to me like why does every country have some small number of people with their fingers on the dials manipulating the currency that seems like a huge conflict of interest especially since we got off the gold standard in the 1970s with nixon and all that and actually i spent a year living in buenos aires argentina in 2009 and i got to see firsthand what it looks like a country that had gone through hyperinflation where it was not just a little bit of an issue it was like it was a massive issue and inflation is like this really insidious thing because it actually erodes well from the poorest people in society like you know wealthy people can buy assets that adjust for inflation like real estate that's that's guaranteed scarcity or they can buy stocks or whatever but poor people are holding their money in cash and it's really like a tax on the poorest people in society so it's this completely unethical thing um it's hiding in plain sight like most people in the world don't really quite understand or appreciate what it is because they've never lived in a higher inflation country like outside the u.s um although frankly you know the u.s may be in danger of becoming a higher inflation country here which is something we could talk about too but um that was something you know i also i had worked at airbnb as an engineer and they were they were trying to move money into and out of 180 countries around the world uh for the for their business and i got to see just how inefficient it was and if you compare it to things that we know of and use in tech like email or whatsapp or web pages or whatever you know if you send a whatsapp message it goes anywhere in the world it doesn't care what country you're in um not every country is using their own proprietary messaging system you know that that would just be silly um there's not a tax at the border when it crosses and it arrives instantly right but money is not like that it's like every country of the world has their own proprietary system it's like not super interoperable with the other countries there's a high fee whenever you move the money there's also delays and so i just think of it as this huge unnecessary friction uh on the world economy which is how money moves and how everybody's on a proprietary system usually there's a couple oligopoly players in each market who um control payments into and out and it's a lot of corruption too it's just like in a lot of countries you know they they're not issuing bank licenses anymore like you need to be the cousin of the president or whatever or bribe somebody to actually get a bank license in a lot of countries and so this corruption basically just hurts the idea of good property rights and a well-functioning economy and it just i experienced that as an entrepreneur i experienced it at airbnb i experienced it while living in buenos aires argentina and so i had just like kind of felt it viscerally that this was unfair you know and so um that's what got me excited about crypto i was never really a trader or anything like that to be honest i was more of like a tech guy um i still to this day like we have we have a huge institutional business and i go to wall street and i talk to all these firms that are on boarding and now like big institutional traditional players are all moving a bunch of money into crypto and frankly it's they speak like a different language i'm still like trying to learn the language after you know many many many years and i have a bunch of amazing people on our team who come from that world and are able to grow that part of our business but um i yeah i i don't really actively trade crypto either i just i buy and hold um you know i'm in the camp of like i i never really want to sell big uh bitcoin or other crypto that i own like unless i need to buy something um specific so i i feel like this is the future of the financial system um i think in 20 years it'll be a substantial portion of global gdp and i'm just i'm in it to create more freedom that's that's what i'm all about so there's no brian armstrong meme coin uh portfolio dgen portfolio out there then you're a buy and hold guy uh no i mean look there's a lot actually one thing that kind of bugs me about the crypto industry at times is like i do think there's too much focus on like short term thinking and get rich quick and all that like the lambos and all that i think it's i think it's unhealthy um because first of all a lot of people are just going to get in for the wrong reasons and then something's going to crash and they're going to lose money and that's not good for any of us that's what really pisses off regulators and people like that as they come in hey this consumers aren't being protected right so i've always tried to think of this as long-term thinking how do we ensure that consumers have appropriate disclosures how are they making it you know well-informed choices like dollar cost in average in with a small amount of your net worth and hold for the long term and how do it's not really about the speculation too it's about how do we actually use this stuff for more and more parts of the economy because as we get more and more people actually using crypto everything else makes sense it's no longer it's no longer speculation and the good news is that's finally happening i can't i can't tell you how many years i would go to conferences and people would ask me these questions like so when are the use cases coming you know and like nobody asked me that question anymore tens of millions of people in the united states alone and not mention the world are using crypto for a lot of stuff now so i feel like that that ship has sailed which is really good brian one of the themes we like to explore the most on bankless is how the the values of the person impacts the things that they create whether that's networks or companies in your case so how have your values that you've learned throughout your your time in argentina and you know just being being a human in this world how has that come to impact the the drive and the vision of coinbase because coinbase is very famously a tunnel vision company as in they have the future of the world that they want to see manifest and then have that you know future version actually be manifested so how have your values come to become instantiated inside of coinbase and then what are coinbase's values if they at our i are different than yours yeah that's a great question so you know i think actually companies really demonstrate the values of the founders not all companies have founding ceos still because they they move on some sometimes but really especially in startups and any company that still has a founding ceo there's a there's a very direct link often to the values of that person i think that's true in our case as well so one of those examples of our of our values and by the way you can look up online we we used to distinguish these are our values these are this is our culture doc i eventually just combined those and so now we call it just our culture doc you could if you if you google coinbase culture you can find a list of them but some of the areas i'll just talk about how those manifest inside the company so one of them is this idea of long-term thinking and just not cutting corners so we really try to be the most trusted brand in the space that means focusing on cyber security it means focusing on um compliance proactively working with regulators it means not trying to like add every um coin under the sun we were very thoughtful about like doing rigorous analysis about securities laws and compliance and all this kind of stuff by the way to our own detriment there sometimes there was there was times where i would have said man can't we just make everything available and let the market decide and we'd have more innovation but you know we do want to create trust and so it's always i think you know taking the balance of those other stuff that came from me so i i love efficient execution i love it when um companies get rid of bureaucracy people get a lot of high quality work done quickly they do that in a bunch of ways they do it by not letting a bunch of tech debt accumulate they do it by having really clear communication like one thing you'll notice if you come to coinbase is almost everybody is a very clear and concise communicator i'm kind of obsessive about that i also love this idea of companies companies really are only as good as their products and the products come from the people that are there and so we try we have this idea of like championship team at coinbase we try to just only hire people where we're hell yes you know it's not like if you're not a hell yes you're no in terms of hiring i mean there's a bunch of others but one last one i'll mention is that i really love this idea of continuous repeatable innovation and so a lot of companies i think they they get one product to work and they have they're kind of a one hit wonder and they're like okay let's just scale that thing and i really wanted coinbase to be a multi-product company that kept building new stuff i was very inspired by like google and amazon in this regard and so what we do is um we take 10 of our resources and we put it towards venture bets or like moonshot type bets and so a lot of the a lot of things have come out of that like um coinbase wallet our self cus custodial wallet came out of that coinbase commerce we're launching our nft thing next and so i never want us to be a company that kind of gets complacent and rests on our laurels and says oh we're so great because this thing is growing around the world it's like no technology always moves faster and there's always going to be some new thing on the horizon that's going to come disrupt us so let's always be building the future you know with 10 of our resources while we're putting the rest towards more adjacent bets or the existing core infrastructure you don't want to neglect that either so those are some of the values that have crept in that it kind of came from from me and the early folks one of the hard things about coming to understand how this industry works and what it is for for people who are just learning about it is that the definitions and lines around crypto are very very blurred like is it a security is it a commodity uh and that's not just a conversation about the assets but also about the companies inside of the space as well uh and so uh i want to ask with the vision of coinbase now like kind of you know in the listener's head what does coinbase want to be when it when it grows up in the next five ten years because is it a bank is it is it a tech company like now you guys have this nft platform you would never see a bank have an nft platform uh and so like what is coinbase and what what is it trying to aspire to be when it is in its you know maximally successful version of itself yeah yeah so i think of it as a spectrum you know there's like there's financial service companies on the left like like banks and then there's tech companies to the right of that and then if you go even further there's crypto companies i think crypto companies are like the next evolution of tech companies and so we want to be a crypto company um i'd rather be a tech company than a financial service company but i'd rather be a crypto company than a tech company and i think the best tech companies are going to all become crypto companies so in your mind brian this is like an evolution right it's like bank tech company crypto is kind of a long an evolution you you don't see coin bases being somewhat in between a bank in a financial company you see it being sort of this this third thing this more evolved state is that right yes and that i should be clear that's aspirational right so i don't think we're fully there yet but that's where i want us to keep going i want us to keep decentralizing coinbase embracing decentralization like self-custody and defy and smart contracts and all this stuff now this is this gets complicated so i'll give you another layer on this right so our core business today which generates most of our revenue is a regulated financial service business so how can these things be compatible well the way i think of it is that um you know to get all the fiat money into in the world into crypto into this new crypto economy we have to build a reliable bridge between uh that finance 1.0 and finance 2.0 right so that mean that means we have to go work with regulators we have to go work with traditional bank partners um you know i i don't have any aspirations of coinbase ever becoming a bank but even let's just say someday hypothetically in the future you know we may even have to own a bank for some reason right because the regulatory environment sort of catches up and it decides that that's required and maybe we have some subsidiary that's a bank or something but we try to honestly we would even try to kind of cordon it off from a culture point of view because i don't want that type of thinking to permeate the entire organization and so even while we're helping build the bridge from finance 1.0 to 2.0 and get all the more and more fiat money into crypto we also want to be building the crypto economy and so that means embracing more of the decentralization piece and so like a very rough analogy i'll make is that you know google makes most of its revenue from ads right adwords but it's i don't really think of it as an ad company because they're making self-driving cars and android and google chrome and like so sometimes you have a really great business model that is difficult to do something and it generates a lot of revenue but i want to be a company that uses that revenue to help build the future and not get too caught up in being um in the old world if that makes sense yeah one of the uh things we want we want to learn from this is is with this crypto is evolving just as as fast as anything these days and so so do the companies that are inside of crypto need to keep up with the rate of crypto change in order to stay alive with with the industry so uh i want to hear about the product vision for coinbase as relates to so many different things uh about about crypto uh and so uh what what is coinbase's um product roadmap product vision you guys you guys are now uh you know going headfirst into nfts uh you recently had this lend product which we'll talk about later and during the regulatory section uh so the products that are coming online out of coinbase so what is the the theme of them and what's the vision behind that yeah so i'll break it down into three parts because we actually have three different customer segments now um as a multi-product company so the first customer segment is individual people retail investors if you will the second one is institutions or businesses that are companies the third one is developers which so let me let me just talk about each of those briefly so the first one on this retail side our product strategy is to be the primary financial account in the crypto economy so that means we're the primary place where you store your crypto but also increasingly you can connect more and more things into that primary financial account so you can do borrowing and lending or you can have coinbase card or coinbase earn and in the near future you can even connect third-party applications like any kind of defy app or whatever um into that primary financial account and it's it's like yeah it's the place where you store all your stuff but you can also use a lot of things through the primary financial account the second customer segment these institutions or businesses out there that are now increasingly getting into the crypto space um for most of them they have the you know we also want to be the primary financial account but it looks different it's we have to be a qualified custodian we need to be a prime brokerage they want to do massive like otc trades or have different kind of security audit requirements and so we're also the primary financial account for them but the products look very different in the third customer segment these developers this is where we want to be kind of more like aws for crypto so we're taking a lot of the services that we've built out internally at coinbase which power our products like how we talked all these different blockchains how we custody how we trade how we do staking and even identity and logins and stuff and we're exposing those through these services via coinbase cloud that's that's our product for developers and so what we hope is that that can be sort of a tool that you know thousands of other crypto companies or non-crypto companies can use to integrate um into the crypto economy and they don't have to store the crypto with us they could be doing a self custodial wallet built on top of that or they could be um building their own custody or it could be like you know reddit has like these kind of a wallet now with these different tokens and different subreddits so i think in the future most startups are going to use crypto in some way shape or form a lot of big companies like banks and whatnot are trying to figure out how to integrate crypto in their products and they don't all need to come directly to coinbase hopefully they can also use coinbase cloud to build a lot of that stuff so that's a that's a lot of the stuff on our roadmap um we're also doing a lot of international expansion by the way um so we're trying to get more and more global coverage um and we're trying to do this uh that 10 venture bets i mentioned with the repeatable innovation to build cool new stuff that it all plugs into the primary financial account that's so interesting so retail institutional and then developer and i wonder how that changes as you as you move from kind of a financial services type crypto company to a to a fully fledged crypto company i wonder if those segments change in the future but you could keep us updated i i think one of the reasons we wanted to have you on brian is um because coinbase has just a tremendous amount of influence in the space now and that's um you know hats off to you it's because of the fantastic product that you've built i think 60 million some accounts um so with that influence i think comes um some power some amount of leverage in the industry some amount of power and so one of the questions i think bankless listeners have is okay what's coinbase going to do next how do they see the world because they can not only partake in the ecosystem but they can actually influence it in different ways so i i want to understand a bit more how coinbase sees the world and i want to take this in like maybe three parts um first coinbase relationship with d5 and then talk talking about coinbase relationship with the existing banking system so legacy banks we might call them and then third coinbase's relationship to uh to the big tech companies of the world right so there's those three parts in your mind but let's start with defy okay so what's interesting about coinbase's vision and about d5's vision is um some of them are you know some of the visions are kind of complimentary right so you mentioned being able to do things in crypto like lending like staking like borrowing like trading right there are ways to do that inside of a coin base in maybe d5 advocates would say in a more centralized way there's also ways to do this inside of the default ecosystem and so some people ask the question okay are is defy in coinbase are they competing then are they competing for liquidity are they are they competing for customers um the bankless take on this by the way brian is actually these are just open protocols that the coinbases of the world can build on top of we have this thesis i don't know if you've heard of it's called the d5 mullet where we think like they'll be kind of banking in the front and then like d5 in the back for a lot of organizations but i want to hear how coinbase thinks about is defy a friend is it a competitor is it some mix of both what's your take yeah so i think d5 is unequivocally a friend um it's been i think it's been clear for a couple years now that d5 is something really important that a lot of customers want to use and so um it's certain i think it would be a huge mistake for us at coinbase to say well you know centralized is the only way built products built by coinbase or something you know that just wouldn't make sense we have to go where if customers are telling us they want to use this stuff then we've got to make it easy for them to do it otherwise we're just not relevant right and so yeah we're definitely on a path to um integrate some more of these d5 services so you know in coinbase the custodial app which is the main one that most people use today um we we are making more and more d5 services available there and i think your mullet is a good analogy like there could be a very simple interface that you know maybe the average person doesn't even know they're using d5 but behind the scenes it's using those protocols and that just gives them more you know more functionality more access to trade whatever it is now i think we also have coinbase wallet which is our self-custodial app which by the way has grown like something like 3x in the last year and so that's another option where we can have people access the whole world of d5 through an interface where they even have full control of the custody itself and there's there's a whole kind of i think healthy tension or something like that between uh the coinbase custodial app which um you know is regulated as a financial service business and the self-custodial wallet which is really regulated more like a software business because we're never taking possession of any customer funds we're not executing any trades and there's still a lot of um i would say legal precedent that needs to be worked out probably in the coming years about that but that's that's an interesting divergence that's happening and coinbase is really committed to serving both um so coinbase custodial self-custodial both are important parts of this primary financial account strategy and they're both going to have access to d5 so brian the the recent lend product which unfortunately got um got halted thanks to the sec uh was that a d5 mullet model was that a coin base in the front and defy in the back or where was the yield for that product going to come from no so that was a centralized model okay and um you know that was that was just a very interesting moment to touch on that briefly if you want i mean you know we we had reached out to the sec a number of times um as we were developing that product and some of our competitors in the market had kind of had a product like that for one or even two years live in the market and so we felt like you know we should be able to launch it too we didn't really hear any objections and then it came down to it really like just in the last couple weeks before we were about to launch the sec came back and said under no circumstances should you launch this in fact they even sent us a wells notice which is kind of an intention uh to sue over it and you know that didn't feel very good because i felt like we'd been pretty upfront with them about it and part of the mission of the sec is to create a fair market out there and it didn't seem very fair to me that other companies could do it in coinbase couldn't um and i you know i think there's a reasonable explanation for that which is basically that they have limited staff and they're just they can't possibly cover everything out there in the market so this coinbase is a public company we're a bigger company so when we when we went to go do it then they it kind of got increasing attention they're probably also doing things with other companies that just hadn't come out publicly yet so i don't fault them too much for it but it certainly didn't feel good it was really demoralizing for the team who i just spent all this time trying to create this product and i think it would have been really good for consumers too that everybody wants to earn yield on their assets like you the you know the interest you can earn at your bank right now is just kind of a pit a tiny amount so anyway that was a centralized product we ultimately decided not to launch it because the sec was telling us they were going to sue us which we always go talk to our lawyers when these things happen and they kind of told us you know it's like a 50 50. if this goes to court the law is pretty unclear um it's like you might 50 chance you win i'd rather take like an 80 20. if if we're going to go to court if you're going to sue your you know one of your regulators which i which i hate to do um so we ultimately decided not to launch it and i i really hope the sec kind of both makes these rules more clear because frankly the lawyers advising crypto companies are telling them it's a toss up 50 50. that's that's not helping anybody so we just want clear rules and for them to enforce it evenly with everybody which i think they'll eventually get to do um but yeah that's what happened in that situation yeah i feel this like the story is very much uh not not fully written i i think we'll uh be hearing more about that soon we've got a lot to cover about the sec when we get to regulatory but you know keeping i guess on this theme of um you said coinbase very much sees defy as a friend right so coinbase is kind of a a d5 friendly crypto company uh very much do you think this strategy is uh different than those that maybe uconn bases traditional competitors might be pursuing so i think of um somebody like a a binance for example right and so um cz has has coined this term cd5 right which is like centralized defy and binance has created this thing which is a you know fork of ethereum called the binance chain it has a very small set of validators mostly controlled by um binance and company right and so it's this centralized defy amalgamation ftx is a little bit different um it feels very much and these are not your words these are these are our words right it feels very much like they are pursuing a similar strategy of control as binance chain then maybe not as explicit through um maybe a chain like solana for example so maybe there's sort of this this veil of decentralization but maybe they have a bit more influence and control over something like solana than they would over uh something like uh ethereum and so we've got binance putting its stake in the ground this is how we're going to do d5 it's called binance chain right and like binance is sort of the center of the universe we've fdx doing maybe kind of this blend where it's playing in both camps but it also still really wants to control this d5 thing and now i almost feel like it's like it's like coinbase it's your move guys like what are you guys gonna do in this space and that's what i'm most curious about in this conversation is like what is coinbase's move going to be are you going to take a roll your own smart contract platform approach are you going to adopt a specific smart contract platform are you going to open are you going to pick the most open credibly neutral decentralized technologies how do you think about this and what's your strategy here yeah yeah great question so you know i haven't heard that term cd5 but it it kind of makes sense and by the way i think you know cz and sam are great entrepreneurs and nothing but good things to say about them so let me let me start with that um you know i had some conversations with cz about bnb and i think on the one hand it's really smart what they did to get more scalability out of it right um because scalability is one of the biggest things holding back the adoption of other chains i think like like ethereum and i know they're working on it with a lot of a lot of efforts but it's important to get more decentralization so that part i thought was smart but the the centralization of bnb with most of the b b being controlled by that one company and the validators as you mentioned that that makes me uncomfortable i think as a developer that's kind of risky to build your application on something that is controlled too much by by one company and so and solana might be somewhere in the middle i don't know the exact details right but yes i agree with you i think it makes me a little uncomfortable to have it be that that centralized um so i think what coinbase there by the way there was moments in the la like 2018 or around that time frame where there were some engineers at coinbase who came to me and said hey we should build coinbase chain and you know my reaction was you know on the one hand you could argue it was naive right because hey if we had made it maybe it would have been worth 50 billion or whatever it's great great market cap but on the other hand i'm kind of glad we didn't make it because i don't like the idea of there being a coin based chain i like their idea the idea of chains being much more decentralized than that now if we also thought about okay well could we help make a more decentralized chain that truly we didn't control and maybe we contribute engineers to it but whenever we kind of looked at that and we got a little closer to making something i kind of looked at i was like well that's kind of what the existing chains are doing i don't know if the world needs another chain at this point it probably needs one or two of them to just keep making progress on their developer roadmap and so what we did instead is we built a team of engineers internally we called the protocol team and we're still building it out it's still a little early but that's the team that is their job is basically to go out there and help scale blockchains not our blockchain any any of the existing blockchains so you know look you could argue that coinbase would have another 50 billion on the market cap or something if we had made our own chain but again i'm not in it for the just to like print a bunch of money or something i want this to be adopted globally and last you know hundreds of thousands of years as the future of money and so i don't want us to get too into the centralization of any one chain so brian this this protocol team as well it almost sounds like um that this team is going to be um you know pouring into you and pushing out some some public goods of course in like bitcoin and ethereum and the ecosystem there are all sorts of public goods that don't clearly have a monetization mechanism but that the entire community relies on is that what this protocol team is is effectively doing contributing to open source public goods yes that's correct it's fantastic it's yeah and it's a little bit like you know google once they reached a certain size they had a team working on things like open ssl and like these these protocols that the whole internet was built on and they had benefited enormously from that as a company so it was kind of a way for them to give back um so anyway that's what we're trying to do with that team i i do think scalability of these blockchains is a huge unlock for the next you know 100 million slash billion people who will come into crypto if we can get another couple orders of magnitude of scalability with layer 2 or lightning or any of these things then um the future is going to be very very very good for all crypto i'm just curious like you personally do you have not an official coinbase position i i suspect coinbase's position is like somewhat chain agnostic somewhat you know you know kind of neutral right um but but you definitely support open source and decentralized chains but you personally brian do you care which chain wins here like is there a difference in your mind between an xrp and a bitcoin or a binance chain and ethereum gaining traction what's uh what's your take on that yeah so i mean we're trained agnostic as a company as you said um i you know i hate just i hate to get too involved in these because i do think there's a lot of like holy wars in the crypto world as you all know so i mean i would rather we all were just a little more cooperative here and just try to help get the whole thing going everyone is sort of like shilling their own book a little too much um so but do i care i mean i care i care that the platform that most crypto gets built on is it is decentralized it's developer friendly it's gonna help it's gonna scale um you know i care about stuff like that i think it just will make the whole industry more successful but i also think that you know even though coinbase is kind of a big company crypto it's not like i have i don't i don't think i have the hubris to say i could sway it one way or the other like the the market is going to tell us what it wants to use and i think developers are smart for by and large developers are building on top of the systems that have the right properties and so that's that's where the market's going to go and i think we're we're going to be followers there not really um helping shape it too much you and brian sometimes i for yeah i think people forget that um developers are economic players as well right you talk about this kind of like economic freedom well developers choosing on what platform to develop on that is a massive vote of confidence right they're basically deciding here's where i'm going to live and like open up my shop and that is a huge vote of confidence for any any chain or any ecosystem they choose to build on yeah i mean that's going back to the internet that's why developers got so excited about the internet was like why would you want to build your app on some proprietary system where it could just get taken away people were tired of like if you built a microsoft windows app and it got really successful microsoft would just clone it right or actually microsoft people forget the history of this but on our board you know is mark andreessen who built the first web browser and he tells us all these funny stories him and ben horowitz about like in the early days of the internet microsoft actually tried to create their own proprietary internet it was called i think microsoft network and um you know developers just didn't want to build on it because they're like microsoft's just going to steal my app if it gets too big and so i'm going to build on the open internet even though the open internet was like a little bit rougher around the edges and it was like kind of really chaos how the protocol got upgraded and everything just like in crypto today so anyway history is kind of repeating in a funny yeah i totally remember that times like as an elder millennial probably probably david does not remember these times but like bill gates used to talk about the information super highway and he would never talk about like the actual internet and like you know um tcp and some of those protocols it was always this like microsoft type thing uh and then eventually they capitulated in a big way right on the complete other side of the same spectrum uh we have crypto networks on one side and then banks on the other where one's maximally decentralized and one's maximally centralized uh and we want bankless wants coinbase to eat all the banks um i want to be able to deposit my checks into coinbase i want direct deposit routing numbers account numbers uh and that's that's hopefully what we see in the i don't know if that's actually like you know an explicit vision of coinbase but that's my vision of coinbase uh and so at the same time i also don't want coinbase to just become another bank uh and so brian can you ease our minds about like if and when coinbase does eat all the banks uh why why why should we still be optimistic that coinbase doesn't turn into the thing that it ate yeah so i mean this is a really interesting trend just in history where um if you look at the history of all networks by the way there's a great book on this called master switch um it talks about like the you know television networks and radio and the telegraph and like it goes back through all the history of these different networks and the history of it is basically when something starts off it's very fragmented there's a lot of upstarts you know the the people operating on this new network like the incumbents kind of laugh at them because it's so unreliable and quirky and then eventually the new network you know is the next s-curve and it basically starts to consolidate as it gets bigger and there's becomes monopolistic players then they turn evil and then the next network has to come along with a new entrance to come disrupt it right so how by the way every every day every week at coinbase i flip between worrying about oh my god we're like we're so slow and big and there's some new startups that's just gonna come eat all of our lunch and then the next week i'm like okay we're gonna become too big in crypto and then how do i make sure that somehow it doesn't turn evil like somewhere in the world you do that too yes exactly so and there's a funny thing that happens by the way if you ever you know once you found a company that gets beyond you know say like three or four hundred people like dunbar's number is 150 people so you can imagine once you hit 500 there's people that you've never met inside the company right and so occasionally as a ceo you you know we're about three thousand people today you you encounter something in your own company where you're like how could that have ever happened inside the company i found it like that right so sometimes david and i meet people and we forget they've been on our podcast eventually you know okay so yeah exactly so um anyway there's a whole that's how once you get bigger you have to kind of really put down in writing and like articulate what are the values in the culture and then find ways to communicate throughout larger orgs so it's anyway it doesn't work for you to meet everybody individually anymore but um okay so getting back to the your main question so yes i mean i do think that coinbase is we're already seeing people start to use their coinbase account as an alternative to a bank account um you know we have coinbase card so you can spend at merchants we just launched um this uh feature we put out an announcement about coinbase payroll and direct deposit everything which is coming soon so there'll be a way to do that um but i think the real answer to your question is that more and more of crypto is going to go to self-custody i actually think that self-custody is probably um the future longer term um it might be you know some of some institutions and people are probably going to think that's crazy because like they're just getting into crypto into the centralized way which is where they're most comfortable and that'll have a major tailwind behind it for decades to come but i think at the the way that you know self-custody as it gets safer and safer to store your crypto there without some accident accidental loss of your coins uh maybe there's like social recovery or there's um multi-multi-party computation type solutions you know basically the apps need to get better easier to use safer and then that's the real um safeguard against you know coinbase ever becoming some giant company that starts to look more and more like the banks that it sought to uh improve upon and the other the other thing is having a founder ceo really helps right so um you know i i'm not good at everything in the world but one thing i can do at coinbase is i can help sort of say hey this is why i started the company and so i can speak with a certain moral authority it's like we're not going to do that why not because that's not why i started the company i don't have to give any other justification right whereas you can imagine like a professional ceo who comes in who's like accountable to wall street quarterly earnings and above you know they may start to think about the company differently now that's great i'm not planning to go anywhere i want to be with coinbase a long long time eventually founders do pass away right and it's an interesting it's an interesting question to think about how do you build a company culture that survives um a second and a third founding right like apple after steve jobs or um you know amazon after bezos or whatever and i don't know if anybody has solved that problem perfectly but what a lot of people do is they try to like write a book and really write down their philosophy and their articulation and then you have to kind of pass the baton to somebody and try to create good long-term incentives for them to actually take risks and try something new and ambitious um you know this might be getting this is rambling a little bit but i'll give you one final thought on this which is one of the most scarce things in companies today is is actually today is actually risk tolerance right so why you know why did tesla launch kind of they're self-driving cars and waymo under google didn't right and you know google was probably ahead on self-driving and they had more money into it and they had every advantage in every reason but they don't still have their self-driving cars really on the road whereas tesla has partial self-driving it's collecting all this information and the reason is that there was a founder ceo who basically said at a certain point i care enough about the mission that i think we're ready and we're going to go for it and i guarantee you there was some lawyer or somebody at that moment who was probably telling him don't do it it's not ready if somebody dies in the first week the company's over you know and it's and it's scary and so if you're a professional ceo you know you're thinking about well what is my career trajectory and my next job and all these things but if you're a founder ceo you're thinking if we don't accomplish the mission what's what's the point why did i do all this work like that's the only reason i don't care about my next job i just want to accomplish the mission so risk tolerance in a weird way is is a very valuable thing um and i think about that as a founder ceo hopefully that can help us make the right calls as we get bigger and avoid becoming becoming like the thing that we've sought to improve on but ultimately we're going to have to decentralize so that you know can't be evil is better than don't be evil i'm actually so uh just a quick reaction on a lot of things you said that it's like i'm actually blown away by something you said there brian because like so getting back to the last point a founder ceo is more more risk tolerant i suppose because something you said in there is pretty risky for coinbase's core business model which is you guys custody a heck of a lot of assets and you said that you see crypto moving to a world that is more self-custody in bankless terms we would call that less banked and more bankless that is the world that's the mission that that we're on as like a you know crypto thesis driven media organization that's the world we want to to see um but isn't that against your interests like isn't that against coinbase's interest to see a world that graduates to self-custody can you square that for me i'm glad you said it but i'm wondering why yeah aren't you just teaching your consumers how to not need you well so i think it you could argue that it works against our interest short term or maybe even medium term but it's definitely within our interest long term and the reason is that companies have to evolve continually be evolving to serve their customers and if you're not serving your customers then you're just on a slow path to irrelevance and death right and so we always kind of need to meet people where they are so there's there's still a huge number of people in the world who are like i don't even know about crypto like i barely understand it i think it's some internet money or whatever and for them a centralized solution is the thing and that's going to be true for by the way a decade or two or more it may be forever for some of these people but you you two are living in the future right and i'm kind of with you i'm also thinking about the future and there's a huge segment today already but it's going to grow i think even bigger who want to be self-custodial they want to be self-sovereign they want to be able to access more and more stuff that that allows um and they basically want to live this ethos of like don't tell me what to do with my own money you know it's my money i should be able to i should be able to do whatever i want so um yeah we it's we're able to hold both of these ideas on our head at the same time basically build for the future and start to build products for that customer segment while also building these products for probably the majority of the world still which they're not quite that far in their thinking they're still getting bought into crypto to start with so we need to make products for both of those markets the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com well let's talk about this future and kind of the the third piece here which is the section of coinbase versus uh facebook aka meta aka big tech right right so the way you've described coinbase so far actually makes a lot of sense to me in that coinbase's act one is really the bridge and that's what you guys have excelled on so you're in this bridge from old world legacy finance to new world new finance and it's not just new finance that we're building over here because if you take the the long-term view of what crypto actually is it's a property rights system it's about economic freedom so we're actually building this thing and i feel like maybe crypto started it first this thing called the metaverse all right um mark zuckerberg and i think some of the big tech companies want to do something in the metaverse too i think mark is is is a very bright individual okay he sees a lot of things before um you know everyone else does and so he sees this thing called the metaverse and he wants to build that too um i'm curious about your take on facebook's announcement of basically pivoting the entire company to be a metaverse company and your take on does coinbase actually have a role in building out the metaverse as this sort of this third evolution that this crypto company what do you think all of this means for coinbase and your strategy moving forward yeah yeah so i think i think zuck is it was a brilliant move from him for a number of reasons and you're correct that the metaverse is something that people have been talking about for a while and crypto has made a lot of great progress with that you know decentraland and all these things um nfts it's not a coincidence i think going back to our my prior comment about founder ceos of the fang companies the big four or five big tech companies facebook is the only one majorly doing something in crypto right now you know both with dm which you could argue is like a little maybe it was the right thing the wrong thing but now with the metaverse they're thinking about crypto you saw probably in his announcement he referenced nftas and things i think it's not a coincidence he's also the only founder ceo left at the fang companies which is um which is an interesting thing but i give him a lot of credit for making this move i think that you know people probably have concerns about facebook being big brother or something and like the privacy concerns and i think mark smart he gets that you know you saw he mentioned in his talk that for instance you know they're making it so you don't need to sign into oculus with your facebook account and and that kind of stuff but the reason why i think it's smart is that number one of course facebook because it's a social media company and it's disrupted so many business models and you know it's a mirror of society of both the good and the bad and so you know they have all this pressure about d platforming and people think they messed up the elections and so they're basically their brand has just been getting so much hate that it's people forget um just it's kind of like basic psychology once you have a label for something you think of it as something in your mind so he's kind of now saying hey facebook is not just the blue app whatever that you hate it's also whatsapp it's also oculus it's also you know instagram and these other things and so i think it's a great move for him just to rebrand and say that the parent company is now about something bigger to get rid of the hate i also think it's a it's a brilliant move because vr and ar i think is the future of computing you know um when we went from mainframes to desktops to laptops to mobile and by the way a bunch of companies like microsoft kind of missed the move to mobile i think that you know apple and google are now sort of missing the move to arvr um which is funny because they're the ones you'd think they saw how important the transition to mobile was but now they're missing the next one so i think it's incredibly ambitious and bold that suck is they're basically i think they're losing over a billion dollars a year on their on their uh vr ar oculus stuff right now and he's he can see that that's where the future of computing is going so i think that's all brilliant so what so what role could coinbase play in this and not just with facebook but all every version of the metaverse you know again we want to be the primary financial account right so we want to be the the place that people store their their their digital goods and their their currencies and so we need to make it easy for people to connect their coinbase account into any version of the metaverse that's out there and so that's that's what we're going to do i don't i don't think we would actually go build um you know like a game or a ui or something like that but we do want to make it easier people to store all their stuff in self-custody and coinbase custody if they want that yeah we're going to get to nfts which is maybe a step for coinbase into the metaverse in in just a second but you know one other um thought i had for you and i wanted to get your take on is so some in crypto see mark as you know mark zuckerberg entering the metaverse and you see that as an attempt to kind of co-opt what crypto is doing basically centralized and control and you know um you know become panopticon the you know the surveillance engine um my take is a little bit different i actually think because of the credible neutrality of the underlying base layer protocols like bitcoin ethereum that we've built mark will actually whether he wants to or not be forced to build on top of it in the same way facebook was forced to build on top of tcp and all of the open internet protocols so and what what will he build on top of the property right system that crypto offers so i personally see this move as incredibly bullish for crypto this is basically and we've seen moves with twitter we've seen it with tick tock is like incorporating an ft's this is basically web 2 poking their head up and especially you know mark saying oh my god we need to get in on this crypto thing what's your take do you think this is overall bullish or bearish on our industry is this a you know control type play or do you think this is going to he's going to be forced to build on crypto whether he likes it or not i generally am more in the camp that you're in as well i think it's i think it's very bullish for crypto to see facebook making such a big bet in metaverse and i think you're right for them to get user adoption they're going to have to build on top of the open standards and let people have interoperability of their of their digital goods throughout that world and and use the native payment layers right now if there is you know there may be a temptation for them um to sort of centralize in some ways right and so to the extent that that happens i would certainly love to see other metaverse companies being built and you know maybe we can all collectively as an industry just make sure that there's interoperability between them because it would it would really be a bad outcome to have go back to like look at just like microsoft windows had over like 95 market share or something and it started to act much more monopolistic whereas with mobile we have android and ios and it's like there's still some bad behavior but it's less because there's at least two of them so two is a lot better than one three is better than two you know you kind of go down the line so i would love to see other companies step up and help make other metaverses and the crypto community can totally do that we've seen some of those great companies already like like decentraland and others um so i hope they do that but it's funny you mentioned twitter they're doing a lot with crypto too another founder ceo still in the job so anyway well something that i think will really accelerate the development of the metaverse is coinbase's new nft platform so we want to get some details on that brian i think uh you i think the nft platform was surprised when how much actually uh how many people actually signed up for the thing i think something like 2 million came within just the first few days maybe you could give us an update on the numbers there um so i want the other details that i'm looking for as well are uh well when's it going to launch and also is it going to be an open system or a closed system when it comes to just users in that you know having you know self-sovereignty and ownership over their nfts uh can they withdraw the nfts where will the images be stored can you just give us the details on the nft platform yeah sure so um yeah i think there was maybe like 3.5 million in the first couple three three days or something i actually don't know the latest numbers it kept going up but um yeah so i mean we're definitely gonna be interoperable uh people can connect self-custodial wallets into coinbase and nft you can store it um using metamask or or coinbase wallet in the future we'll probably make it possible so you can just connect your coinbase custodial wallet as well if for all the you know 68 million verified users who who have that um so our overall goal is just how do we make everything in crypto just trusted and easy to use right so for a lot of people right now nfts are getting tons of traction but it's still relatively hard for the average person to do it they have to install a chrome extension maybe buy some crypto somewhere like coinbase but then they have to transfer it to another wallet um you know there's there's things like signatures that pop up and and all that you can't even like let's say you don't have any crypto but you want to buy nfts because it's nfts are bringing in a lot of people who have no experience with crypto whatsoever you know it'd be great if they could just put in a credit card right it'd be great if they had more social features to it um so hopefully we can provide a lot of that with with coinbase nft and um yeah just make it easier for the next 100 million of people or something to come in and use nfts one thing about the platform that i noticed in the mock-ups was these social media elements to it there were like handles there were followers and following and likes is this also a social media play as well yeah it definitely it definitely borrows elements of that right i think that um you could imagine variations of different apps in the nft space so there could be things like um like open c which is awesome you know and it's it's kind of like a marketplace um sort of like airbnb or ebay or something like that but i think people are really loved and are familiar with social aspects as well so if there was a version that was kind of like instagram that you could see people's profiles what they own you could follow them you could even have like a feed of like the most interesting stuff by the people you follow but also buy and sell them that would be pretty cool so you know by the way i think there's a lot of other features too like i would love to be able to um put out like a bounty and have people commission nfts for like or make memes or whatever like around a certain trend that you want to put out there in the world and um there's a lot of really cool stuff that we could do so those are all just kind of scratching the surface part of the cool thing about nfc is uh the story of nfts has been basically mainstream adoption and mainstream interest and it's just like this whole other cohort whose eyes when you go to talk to them about crypto like at a party or like they just glaze over when you start using finance terms you're just like let me tell you about the history of of money and right why we have gold right like their eyes glaze over but you show them an nft right and you know their favorite crypto celebrity uh has a or their favorite celebrity has an nft totally changes the game on this i wanted to talk a bit about uh maybe mainstreamness of krypto because i think that's what nfts really bring us and you guys have done something pretty damn mainstream which is you just became the official crypto platform of the nba and the wnba uh which sounds huge can you tell us a bit about that like why why this what is this partnership going to do and then like why is this partnership attractive to both sides yeah for sure um so i think for a long time by the way coinbase never really did very much traditional marketing um i would i never really had a marketing background frankly i didn't really understand a lot of marketing um and our occasionally we'd have board members who'd come to be like brian when are you going to think about marketing and i'd be like well we're doing like these referral programs i i was always into like the traditional growth stuff that tech tech companies would do so that's why you never sponsored the podcast yeah yeah we should probably we should probably sponsor it um but uh you know once we became public the public company i was like all right let's this is now the time to really go into this in a big way because it's no longer some niche thing like it's it's mainstream enough where we can start to do brand advertising and like more things where enough people in the audience who see it will know and care about crypto that it's actually worth it um there's always this risk in marketing that like especially not like um paid paid marketing or performance marketing but like brand marketing that's broad like a tv ad or something that's it's really hard to measure the roi of it and so i wanted to wait until we got big enough um i'll give by the way sam banquet free from ftx a lot of credit here he he went hard into it early he's doing arenas now in miami isn't he yeah tom brady yeah so he's he's kind of like been lining up all these celebrities and stuff and i you know mad respect and props to him for doing that um i always try to think about like what is the most i a lot of a lot of marketing just comes across like inauthentic to me um and i'm still trying to learn about it by the way we have a great chief marketing officer we hired and all these things we're doing now we're doing tons of experiments but you know it's always this balance like you want to take not not just be preaching to the choir of crypto people right who are already super into it you know they already know what coinbase is but you want to go kind of what's the rung outside of that like gamers or the wrong outside of that like artists you know doing nfts or maybe the nba and people who are into culture and like music and just how do you go one one layer out but i also feel like a lot of um marketing that's out there that i see for other brands is just it's kind of inauthentic like it never really made sense to me just because some famous person is using this thing like why should i use it i want to use it because it's like a good product or it's innovative or something um i never know if i'm like just weird in that regard or if that if marketing comes across inauthentic to most people like i i don't actually know so anyway we're trying a bunch of experiments we're doing it hopefully in a way that's that's really authentic to who we are um you know we're branching into areas that are outside of the core demographic to get more and more people into it i think by the way this super bowl you're going to see a bunch of crypto ads in this upcoming super bowl it's almost going to be like the crypt the crypto bowl or something of yours which is which is sort of a sign of the times um but yeah crypto's going mainstream so we're going to get all kinds of marketing stuff that's amazing that's great very cool brian coinbase's uh external brand and reputation is off the charts just everyone everyone associates like almost crypto and coinbase is almost the same thing before they really know what crypto is they're like oh crypto is that the coinbase thing internal to crypto the brand is a little bit different and it's it's crypto moves very very fast and coinbase being the largest company inside of crypto just doesn't really move as as fast as crypto does so the internal to crypto branding is not not as stellar as the external to crypto branding and brian and this is where we go from us asking you questions to us making an ask of you and i think the number one thing that coinbase can do to just completely like accelerate adoption for all of the space do good for everyone including their customers including the the internal to crypto branding is to allow users to withdraw their assets onto layer twos these will because the layer ones is really it's especially with a theorem with the amount of congestion it's like dropping people off like in the basement of a skyscraper so it's just a bad user experience especially when the layer ones are just not meant to be for humans it's like forward it's like dropping them in the middle of manhattan with no money to like flag a taxi right right and so uh i want to ask is there uh what is the the rollout plan if there is one for allowing users to withdraw and deposit assets onto like polygon onto arbitrarium optimism all these layer twos that are actually supposed to be the nice friendly environments for users to actually begin doing stuff yeah so a thousand percent agree thank you for the feedback by the way um i don't i don't have anything that i want to announce publicly like today but just suffice to say um the team is thinking exactly how you are and um they've been i've been seeing some really cool stuff internally but um hopefully hopefully i can share more soon it's a great point let's talk about um regulation for for a minute right so um you know i i think when when crypto people talk about regulation they're like oh i thought i thought in crypto you guys were making this thing that that couldn't be stopped why are you so worried about regulation and my reply is always like i'm not worried that bad u.s regulation will kill crypto i'm worried that bad u.s regulation will kill the us like actually harm the us okay it'll put this country behind and as a citizen of this this country and a resident you know i i care that um the us does not fall behind uh can you give us like a state of us regulation from from your perspective how worried are you about it right now and like either bad regulation coming down the pike or just this lack of regulatory clarity like how we doing what's the report card in the u.s yeah well by the way i love that phrasing of it i think you're right it's it's it's not a risk that it harms crypto it's a risk that harms the u.s and as a u.s citizen i agree i'd love to see the u.s not only remain a financial hub but actually remain on the forefront of all kinds of innovation that's what's kind of made us strong as a country so you know embracing the internet like all kinds of things as opposed to sort of uh clamping down on it which is what we saw happen in china and all kinds of things like that so what's the current state i mean look there's there's a pretty big gap in understanding between um folks that i chat with like you and when i go to dc or even wall street and things like that there's it's kind of remarkable to me like we're all one country but you know culture and innovation starts in certain pockets and it takes a while to trickle down to frankly the east coast and then it takes a while to trickle down to europe and you know into emerging markets so the world is getting more and more connected but it doesn't there's still a big gap in understanding it's also people who just grew up their whole career like as in wall street for instance or in dc it's it's hard wired into their firmware to use like a tech analogy um that it's like well the dollar is the currency of the world you know how dare you uh even challenge that and it must be a scam if anybody does try to challenge it right look at like you know warren buffett or the or these jamie diamond or whatever it has some comments out there which it's once you reach a certain age i think you know human brains become sort of ossified and it's like it's hard to accept new ideas but for people who grow up in tech it's kind of natural we're more like digital natives you know and of course you know the world doesn't need like thousands of currencies that's another misconception that i see out there people are like well why would there be thousands of private currencies like this sounds like it's just everyone's going to lose their money and it's a terrible idea and i have to kind of explain to them okay crypto is money you know and bitcoin is kind of this new form of money maybe there'll be a couple other forms of money like we have you know yen and the euro and stuff but there's not going to be thousands of kinds of money people are using crypto for all kinds of new things like the metaverse and artwork and like new kinds of financial services and tokenizing people's time and it's it's a hard thing to get the first time you hear it right it's like why would people want to tokenize their own time you know it doesn't make sense to me right and so a lot of i have to sort of balance the amount of time that we spend at coinbase part i feel like half my brain half my job is like to go to dc to go talk with you know traditional finance 1.0 players and just explain and be patient and also understand all their concerns because they have many concerns about ransomware and national security and all kind you know the saying to the safety of the financial system and how we're going to cause runs on the bank and like it's amazing like the kind of different theories and fears that come out of these other worlds and then the other half of my time is trying to hang out with people on the cutting edge of crypto where people like like you and people on on the team at coinbase who are honestly like way far they're ahead on this than i am and i'm trying to understand and stay on the forefront so we can just keep building the future faster and faster and faster so there's this kind of dynamic where i feel like the regulators are always trying to fight the last war they're trying they're still thinking about crypto how we were thinking about it in 2015 or something and they're trying to figure out what to do about that meanwhile crypto just needs to keep innovating faster and faster and faster so that we keep building more and more great stuff and help bring those along that aren't quite there yet and somehow this will all get work out it's it's going to be messy but i'm i'm very optimistic that the u.s is not going to like throw the baby out with the bath water you know there's going to be a lot of fears and consternation about you know oh are we losing power in the government and all these things but i i'm an optimist at heart it's going to keep getting built and freedom is on the frontier you know it's interesting again as you describe that and 50 of your time by the way you're saying having those types of conversations once again this is coinbase serving that bridge right between these two worlds between this 1.0 world and this 2.0 world and i've got to say um crypto needs this so much like i feel like particularly you know people in the us maybe this year we started to wake up to the political power that that crypto as a cohort might have like oh there's a lot of us oh we have some capital oh there's this thing called lobbying that we could do but we still need some like representatives from the industry the a16 z's of the world the coin bases of the world to actually advocate on our behalf and bridge these gaps between like defy crypto natives and and dc is that something you feel coinbase and you yourself have been called upon to do like you guys put out this uh this framework which asks for a single cryptozar right so a single regulator um a distinct framework so we're not using the howie test we actually have a framework that applies to crypto digital nations something that empowers holders in fair competition is that your purpose in building out the uh regulatory framework and are you going to do you plan to continue serving in that role for the crypto natives in uh in dc and the other regulatory bodies yes absolutely i mean so if you think about how do we ensure that this industry gets to the next 10x or 100x and just keeps helping people all over the world how do we get the next billion people access to this technology so they can benefit from it you know we have to work on blockchain scalability and all these things but one of the biggest ones if not the biggest one is how do we explain this in a way to the current establishment regulators and everybody banks and associated with them that this this stuff is here to stay yes there are some risks but it is a huge net positive for the world and just patiently explain that in terms that they can understand it there needs to be these translators if you will so coinbase is playing a big role in that uh we hired our chief policy officer who who used to run that for goldman sachs we've built out a big team of policy efforts or policy folks that who are going and engaging a16z is doing an amazing job here my hat is off to them they've built a huge policy team put together tons of material hosted conferences they're writing you know legal law review papers that judges read um katie han who's on our board is a former doj prosecutor she's just a force of nature and she and i have had great trips around dc uh coinbase is also funding um along with a number of other companies uh this group called the crypto council for innovation and it's uh crypto for innovation.org it's essentially an advocacy group or think tank that is um gonna you know do more of this work but it can do do it as at least a one layer removed from the companies themselves um can go engage with dc and policymakers around the whole world on these issues so i think that you know we're gonna have to add another zero to everything that we're doing here because there's just so many people in so many countries around the world who have start who are starting to think about this and they just don't have all the information in front of them and so we can help move the needle on some of these people who are on the borderline some people are just going to hate crypto whether they're on the left or the right it seems to be a pretty um bipartisan thing it's not really a left or right thing but some of them just really hate it aren't we're not going to change their mind for some reason others are on the borderline and we can move their move their minds and then other there's a ton of big crypto advocates as well in dc and in washington and we need to uh hug them tight brian while the sec was coming after the the lend product and sent you guys that that letter that basically informed them that informed you that if you release the lend product they the sec intended to sue you uh me and ryan on the weekly roll up we were we were all gung-ho for coinbase going toe-to-toe with the sec um and for a number of reasons one like we don't want the sec to bully us around but also as an industry we're well there's crypto's very tribal we're also a complete family right so like if the sec goes after coinbase like they're going after us they're going after all of us and so maybe it puts coinbase into an unfortunate position as like they are like the representatives of the crypto industry to to maybe a little bit too much but we wanted we wanted to see somebody take on the sec because if it's not coinbase then who and you talked earlier about like it was a coin flip between 50 50 of whether you guys were going to win that battle uh and maybe that's not maybe that's not the greatest odds especially when it comes to you know injecting financial capital into paying for these legal bills but also at the same time like if it's not coinbase the next best biggest company that can take on the sec are not going to have the same odds as coinbase is that a responsibility that coinbase even wants to have and is that something that a fight that you guys are willing to fight yeah so i mean i don't think we want that responsibility but we do have it and yes i agree with you i think that it would not surprise me if in the coming year or two that it does come to some kind of litigation with the sec you know that's not by the way that's not the end of the world right if if they are if they're unwilling to um put out just clear rules that everybody can follow um or if we just fundamentally disagree with the rules that they put out they haven't really put out any clarity any clarity like that i've seen then it is going to ultimately come down to the courts to decide and that's basically regulation through enforcement which i think is bad policy um and it's not good for america but if that's how it's going to end up then yes we will engage in litigation um i'd rather pick an 80 20 and i think there's a number of things like that um i think that you know we've talked with people like you know you know i talked with the ceo of the new york stock exchange they sued the sec five times and won five times um so there's many situations where regulators i think overall are good folks that are just trying to do the right thing and they're trying to protect people and i i really respect what they do but there's other times where it becomes political they're overly ambitious um you know they're they're just trying to grab turf or they just they're not interpreting what the actual law says fairly and we have to go to the courts and so uh we're not opposed to doing that when necessary the thing the thing is i think as we've always said on bankless this is ultimately a battle for hearts and minds isn't it brian and so like we're at the point in the u.s where we have 10 to 15 of the population who owns a crypto asset right what happens when that gets to 20 25 30 40 right is congress really going to debate whether a pudgy penguin is a security or not or they're just going to let us have our pudgy penguins do you know what i mean so i i do think that is our ultimate protection is just onboarding the world that's something that the you know coinbase is obviously doing as well i i couldn't agree with you more i mean that's one of the biggest things i think that folks in dc right now are just not quite getting is that tens of millions of americans soon to be 50 or 100 million americans want to use this stuff and it's going to be incredibly politically unpopular to go to the anti-crypto i think event in the next i don't know three years something like that someone's going to lose an election over this and then they're really going to realize it they're like oh don't touch that that's that's political suicide and it's really ironic that you know some of these regulators are sort of saying oh well we're here to protect we're here to protect the retail investor the retail investors are like go away very very patronizing yes it's incredibly patronizing i mean and frankly like i think that the securities laws were created for the right reasons and had good intentions like we wanted to protect people but it's made me question more and more whether like are the securities laws still should they still be there today you know like if if we had really been following this um like are we actually precluding a whole bunch of wealth creation because if crypto today was able to create two trillion dollars of wealth creation and what would it have been if the security laws had been more permissive and like why is it that if you're you can only invest in private companies if you're a credit investor you're already a rich person i never understood that it's like it's literally preventing you from getting rich investing in private companies unless you're already rich it's it's a regressive tax on poor people so there's so many things about um the securities laws that i think are just broken and not relevant today and so it may be time to just rethink them um and that's that's a policy or a concept that probably nobody on the east coast is thinking about yet um but the the average u.s citizen is starting to wonder if these laws still make sense my brilliant co-host likes to say you know sometimes when they say investor protection what they really mean is incumbent protection and i think that's what's happening yes exactly let's let's not forget where a lot of there's a revolving door between big banks and a lot of uh financial service regulators and so whether consciously or not there is an incentive for them to kind of protect uh the traditional players and that's that's not american i think that's um that's quasi-nationalizing private companies and then in embedding them you know with these certain protections from competition that's un-american and i think it's it's bad for uh consumers as well so people are smart the average citizen is starting to realize this and that's why we want coinbase to eat all the banks yes it is and uh as we draw to a close brian this has been a just a fantastic discussion i feel like i see coinbase's um strategy much more clearly in your place in the world that's really what we are looking uh to understand i think many in the crypto community we're looking to understand you've articulated it very well uh but but now maybe we're kind of coming you know full circle right because we started this with a shot of you in in 2012 and you were at this booth with uh you know uh two others from from coinbase uh when this was just a cottage industry this was tiny uh now 10 years later almost 10 years later this is not a cottage industry coinbase top of the app store crypto is big i mean we just passed 2 trillion not that long ago i wouldn't be surprised if we hit 10 trillion in this next cycle like that would not surprise me in the least um so the first decade of crypto was all about birth okay but now we're in a new decade this is the 2020s and i i'm wondering if you have any thoughts on what we you expect to see in crypto for this next decade you're a long-term thinker so tell us about the 2020s what is going to be the theme of the 2020s and do you have any advice for us for this next decade as we prepare yeah well i think if the first decade of crypto was about birth and then people basically trading it speculating it um speculating on it by trading i think the next decade of crypto is going to be about people using crypto and so that's actually even more exciting to me because i'm not really a trader at heart i think that's a good business model and it got a bunch of fiat money into crypto but we're already seeing it happen with um nfts and d5 and the metaverse and all the voting and a decentralized identity and you know social media stuff bitcloud and all this stuff so i'm i'm super bullish on the next decade in crypto i think is going to be people actually using it and uh it's just going to get bigger from there brian one of the patterns i see in this industry and one of the reasons why there's so much innovation is is that somebody comes into the world of crypto they build something really really cool it gains traction and gains success that builder that founder becomes wealthy and rich and then they become complacent and lazy and then somebody else builds something new and the creative destruction process happens and the cycle iterates forwards you seem to be immune from that you've been here since 2013. is there a time in this next decade or a time at all where you consider yourself like oh like i did it like i'm done and i'm going to tap are you going to retire brian yeah when you're going to retire well first of all thank you for saying that i mean i um this is a great note to wrap on actually because i you know i don't have any desire to retire um one of my biggest fears actually is that you know i had sort of an early insight into crypto and i was like excited about it um and that as coinbase becomes bigger and i become older that i just start to lose touch with the latest cool things that are happening and i eventually become this you know i i would hate to be the the jamie diamond you know of 10 years or 20 years from now where somebody comes into my office is like all right there's this new thing you know ai friends or whatever you know some crazy idea and i'm just like no that'll that'll never work um you know we don't we don't do that here at coinbase you know and i always think about this story you know so steve wozniak when he built the first prototype of an apple computer well he was an employee at hp and he actually went to his boss at hp and he was like i think hp should build personal computers and his his boss ran it up the chain and people said no and so he left to found apple and that's one of my biggest fears is at coinbase is like some some engineer on the team will come in and tell me some idea and i'm like ah that doesn't make any sense to me and so one of the things i've done with this project 10 i told you about where 10 of our resources goes to new initiatives i've made it so there's a panel of people and if you get any one of those people to say yes and champion the project we will fund it and by the way so in other words there's projects where i have voted no somebody else on the team some of them are pretty junior people at coinbase too like just very crypto forward engineers and stuff one of them will say yes and we'll fund it anyway and so um that's where i'm trying to protect the company from myself if i'm becoming too too like you know lofty in my thinking or just out of touch that we will still try new things and i think that's that's the key to innovation but if if we fail to do it then it's the next generation of startups job to come in and disrupt us and so that's the paranoia we always got to think about brian this has been absolutely fantastic we will close it there thank you so
