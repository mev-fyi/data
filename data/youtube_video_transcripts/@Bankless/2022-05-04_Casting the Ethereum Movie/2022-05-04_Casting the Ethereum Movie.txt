wanted to help you out a little bit cause i know you're gonna have a lot of decisions to make with respect to the heroes the villains who plays what role i don't know if you've considered some of the cast of characters and who could play what but we have put together a little thread okay so first of all hudson jameson he's an ethereum former ethereum core developer i don't actually know if he's in the infinite machine but maybe he makes a cameo and our pick for hudson jameson was hailey joel osment alex vandesant as a young steve buscemi paul giamatti uh gosh i'm i'm to show my characters as not being from hollywood but uh one of the co-founders taylor gehring we got nicholas braun who i don't know who that actor is as tim baco but that's this is great yeah and then martin starr as vlad zamfir vlad was really hard to find someone for this but but the martin star works out very very well of course we if we can go all the way down to vitalik perfectly cast as jason moma i think i think it's quite appropriate tom brady is another good one for vitalik
