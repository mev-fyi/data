actual people doing the work often know best the value of that work and so so that's what the inspiration for you know the drove coordinate was [Music] hey hey welcome to green pilled i have a banger of an episode for you today with trake the founder of coordinate trach has been around since the start of wi-fi the primordial soup of wi-fi and it created coordinate which is an intersubjection inter-subjective consensus coordination tool that hundreds of dows are using in order to do decentralized worker compensation trek inspires me on so many different levels as a successful entrepreneur that has launched a product that many people in dalles are using in order to solve workers compensation and doing it in a very sovereign way but also just as his the amount of a priority knowledge he has is just incredible driving driving insights from theoretical thinkers from historians from scientists and from from many many other smart people in order to create a theory of fractal sovereignty and that's what this episode is all about it's about fractal sovereignty and the decentralized future of work it's about moving from command and control structures to sense and respond structures which i think are just such a key part of this new regenerative cryptoeconomic structure that we're building to fund public goods and to make a better world for people out there in the in the world and i think that trek articulates in this episode a theory of human coordination that transcends the industrial age companies in 40 hour work weeks that we've inherited from the legacy generations and one that is truly oriented in not only the future and in tech but in humanism in fractal sovereignty so without further ado i give you trek from coordinate i hope you enjoy this episode bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an

your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] i'm here with trachei opteryx from yearn and wi-fi what's up trek what's up man all right first question how do i pronounce your handle and what is a trache or x it's the um uh best spelled uh name on twitter that no one can pronounce it's it's tracheopteryx but trach for short is fine um it's as you know as must be obvious it's a combination of a trachea and the archaeopteryx the the archaeopteryx is is the first feathered dinosaur um which you know was resonant to me because it's kind of moment of transition um and then the trachea is the kind of organ of human song and speech so it's kind of a artistic pastiche of uh concepts got it and so uh the first feathered dinosaur wow so that's a moment of change and uh like what's our swank song about the uh moment of change that we're in right now yeah it's the tracheopteran epic i think yeah it's the uh the sound of um dinosaur birds that's so that was the main moment of great phase change in evolution uh and in the planet and we're in a moment of phase change in human coordination and you are on the cusp of that with yearn and coordinate can you tell us about that oh i see what you mean yeah yeah so right back then there was a period of you know when when these giant reptiles transitioned into other types of animals that could you know survive in different ways like birds and um i think we're in this period of phase change in the collective space where uh our our collective structures are no longer serving us the nations and corporations and now we're transitioning to something new and we call those things dows but you know what we call a dow is like you know the tip of the little piece of ice sticking out of the ocean when there's a gigantic thing underneath yeah totally i feel like it's the like talking about dallas is the wrong aperture for me because it's like it's like talking about all companies how are you going to talk about all dials that's the wrong aperture what if we could focus on what's actually working and then double down on that um and i feel like urine is is really working well and coordinate is what y'all in like 45 dollars at this point so that's working really well you you kind of have a front row seat to all this yeah which has been a real joy and super grateful for like um i kind of got pulled into urine in d5 summer and have been just you know on the on the ground figuring out how to make you know a very active dow work for a long time and say and coordinate was a direct result of tensions within there so so just want to interject uh defy summer was the summer of 2020 uh and i think it was marked by the emergence of urine and the fair launch there compounds yield farming kind of turned into a whole thing um yam finance i mean remember being in d5 summers is it just for the listeners who weren't around in 2020 defy summer was the summer of 2020. is that more or less right yeah absolutely okay got it so you've been up to this for about two years and have seen a lot of stuff like take us through the broad strokes or the highlights yeah i'm a newbie in a lot of ways i mean i um i got i've been tracking crypto since 2010 but i never really got got deep into it um until until d5 summer and you know what pulled me in was the emergence of real doubts you know that there were actually you know large volumes of financial movement happening with groups of strangers wearing anime avatars you know around the world and using our arcane coin baiting voting techniques to come to consensus in these bizarre ways and i was like wow i gotta i gotta get me some of this and just kind of dropped everything i was doing and went full steam ahead into the urine forums and then eventually as like a core contributor to urine yeah so what was that thread that you were pulling what was so interesting about it to you well i had run a bunch of businesses before you know i'd been a business owner i had hired many many people i'd run large teams and i was always so unhappy with how that works you know yeah like you kind of can't get away from it being at the you you know all the decisions flow up to you and then you have to tell people what to do and it's just like i never liked that um and i tried to do it differently you know like i tried to implement holacracy at one company i i you know kind of half-assed didn't really work very well um and i tried to you know give ownership of one of my companies to other people in the company that didn't go super well either but you know so i i really was drawn to this idea that maybe there's a better way um yeah this reminds me of uh so you were in denver at shelling point and eath denver which i was also at um and you gave this really amazing talk about fractal fractal sovereignty uh the emerging structure of decentralized work and one of the things the analogies that you made that was really neat for me was that like your dao was like a slime mold so basically it's just like bottoms up emergent network of sense making nodes that all together are creating a brain uh you know i think you said it more elegantly than me but uh so if a company is a top-down robot was the analogy you used in your talk which like has very defined input and output paths and like a central processing unit a dow is more like a slime mold where there's there's decentralized coordination so that's where my mind goes when you kind of talk about the transition from companies to dao's be you're sort of curious how you how you'd pull that thread yeah i want to go a little weird on it um like this thread goes back to yeah i know the thread goes back i love uh the i i always often mention yuval harare's um you know formulation he talks about fiction as being the thing that binds us you know it's the the stories that are tribe family religion these are stories that connect human beings and allow us to align our efforts together and like there's one lens on this which is that before agriculture you know we were if you think about it from the collective quadrant you know think about you know the collective life form not you know the individual um the individuals that make it up it's like there is this like you know collective human species that was rolling around right and it kind of got infected by cordyceps something like cordyceps cordyceps is a is a fungus that that ants can can get and then it creates these like mushrooms that it makes them takes over their nervous system and makes them crawl up grass and then so that the fungus can sprout from their head and get better um light and then cows come and eat it and then it gestates in the cow's belly and then comes back it's a crazy mind control thing but it's kind of like we got we got incepted by our own cordyceps which was the notion of property and money and and what that did was it took this human organism and it took over its mind and it made it spread out through the entire world because money as a coordination tool has turned everything into money it's the pay-per-click maximizer but it's been going for hundreds of years right thousands of years and now the whole world is wired right and so um the role of the corporation was basically like the ultimate form of it was like the super saiyan of of money and um and that has done its job very well but now we need to transition to a new way of being a new way of relating amazing um i love that you went weird real fast real hard that's the speed that i want to go on but just for the benefit of the listeners out there who aren't familiar with urine and coordinate i want to ground it with the what you do and then we'll get back we'll we'll we'll lift off back into the um into the theory and what i love about you is that you have such a deep practice and a deep theory we can go empirical and we can go a priori in this conversation so yearn uh is one of the most successful yield aggregators in the world started by andre andre and um who then kind of left did a fair launch and then a dow formed around him and he said i don't want to be the leader of this and so other leaders have emerged um and you're in the middle of that and you developed this tool called coordinate without which i would call a tool for gathering inter-subjective consensus of who is contributing uh in which your peers decide who's contributing and who's not and then you can like people can drop tokens on on top of that so that's my sort of like tl dr of york like where you've been in dallas i'd be curious sort of how you would pull that thread all the way from uh holy andre young and i went in on this to founding coordinate and making it one of the most successful coordination tools can you just kind of take us through that yeah that linear progression for sure so yeah i was writing a science fiction novel here in the middle of nowhere and um a friend sent me a text by wifey wifi and i was like let me take a look at this and i found this was like in the last day of the wifey farming and i found the whole story that so many of us know you know andre cronier this uh idiosyncratic you know principled crazy dev like gave away his entire multi-million dollar project to the community through minting wifey token and gave it away in the first fair launch and what that did to me i was that was like this kind of singularity moment it was this big bang of like generosity and you know inspiration that kind of echoed out through the through the astral plane and it called people like me in and many others that were like wow i see this cool thing i want to do this i want to be a part of this i want to be somebody that has principles before money you know and is trying to create something new and open up the financial system for equal access and all this stuff it's very much kind of very high minded endeavor and um so i just wanted to be part of that and i i came in and there was no organization it was a pure it was like the most chaotic thing ever just like the kind of dark ages dark period after the inflaton field expanded the you know the known universe and um i was gonna say primary primordial soup is the analogy that comes to mind for me yeah that's what it was it was all these people bumping around all these you know just molecules and ions you know bumping into each other and some kind of superheated gas and and all this money flowing in which is really important because there's been a lot of cases like this throughout history where like collective workers collectives things like this doing a lot of the same stuff but they didn't have the same foundation of value capture right and with that money that's like real blood flow it allows for a totally different level of activity and energy and so so i saw that and i was captivated and i just had to be part of it and we worked together in this decentralized way to create the structure that you know created the real dow that urine is and you know urine has taken its own direction there's a lot of ways you can think about daos one important difference i'll say a lot of times people criticize urine for having a multi-sig not being fully unchained that there is a difference in its governance i mean there is a difference between governing an immutable smart contract with you know five function calls um and governing a incredibly chaotic group of 200 contributors that can do anything right yeah those really require different governance architectures so we've designed the latter and um that brings me to coordinate which um you know so we had to figure out we weren't larping you know we weren't trying to create governance because it's some cool idea it's like we had a persistent problem of all these people trying to do something well and also money coming in right as soon as there's money coming in and it's a hefty flow then people fight about it there's rivalries there's coalitions and you've got real tangible governance to solve there yeah exactly so it's been tension driven you know practical operational needs from the beginning and which is a blessing like that is what you want to design the system and that's kind of that's that's great so so we designed a whole new system of architecture of governance there through multiple phases the most of all version of it we call constrained delegation or governance 2 which i designed with gabe shapiro and um it's a kind of delegated governance where instead of delegating your voting power you vote to delegate decision-making power to autonomous teams that can act on behalf of the dao cool and that's yeah there's a lot more to do there but you know going to coordinate one of the and feel free to ask any questions about that but coordinate one of the one of the real persistent challenges in decentralized work is how do you handle compensation and right you know most of the time you know you've got grant mechanisms you've got uh old ideas like salary investing equity but we need something new we need something that's like dow native and this is the fascinating or you know whatever native we are and so how do you actually create like just fair asymmetric value allocation between groups of uh decentralized workers without a top-down you know right process and that's right so i guess i get why it has to be just and fair but why does it have to be a asymmetric what does that mean because the reality of the market some skill sets are more valuable than others oh i see okay right you could say you could say everybody shares equally and we all get you know 50 yeah a year you know um so proportionality basically to value creation well it has to be competitive with other systems right so like if another system of of compensation is going to have is is going to attract more people and if that's a top-down rigid hierarchical system but it rewards people better that's going to win in the near term um so we have to compete with that for talent yeah okay so um how does coordinate work and how did it solve that that sort of problem at urine yeah so in the early days at urine we had a small group of we call it recurring grants people that were you know pretty much full-time working on urine and so those compensation streams were settled but then there was a lot of other people that were contributing a lot in a part-time way and so we created this grants we had this well it was very emergent we just basically it started as gifts we just thought we've got money we had this we had the operational power through a proposal to give away some money and so we were just like every month we'd say hey who's been doing cool stuff and we say oh she has and he has and they have and we say 3 000 for her 2 000 for him and we just give money away it was gifts it was not pro quo um and it was great it was really powerful but what we found pretty quickly after a few months is that it took a lot of work and like we didn't feel like we were particularly good at it you know we weren't seeing a lot of stuff and if you look at the theories of work and and people that have looked deeply at this generally the wisdom is at the edges of these types of networks like it's a lot harder to create a fair allocation from the center or the top or or the bottom but it's better to do it from the edges the actual people doing the work often know best the value of that work and so so that's what the inspiration for you know the drove coordinate was allowed them to make the decisions got it so um the way i understand uh coordinate is that you're sort of in like a gifting circle is that the right the right framing for it well you know it's evolved but it was inspired by the idea of gift economies you know from you know tribal society where pay it forward ideas and and open transactions that are not exactly equal and a lot of that inspires it and it's also a compensation system too you know that needs to function in that way and it's not clear i think people get a little confused and coordinated thinking that the money is the gift it's not the money is the is the um symbolic bracelet the gift is the work the work that people give to the community yeah okay got it so um [Music] can you just like take us through what a coordinate ceremony is the cool thing about the gift circle is it's really really can be totally decentralized so first we have to talk about membership of the circle so that can be determined in a decentralized way too so you could say that any three people need to agree to add a new member right and then that's how the circle grows and you could have the reverse too that any seven people need to agree to eject a member um okay or or any other method you want you can you know plug in different things and then you have the circle of people and every month you go through this gift ceremony where every member of the circle is it receives a hundred give tokens and these are not erc 20 tokens these are more these are just a kind of database artifact like a poker chip um right and and you're not allowed to keep them you have to give them and they only only have value if you give them away and this also references back to tribal communities where notion of wealth was reversed the people that gave the most were considered the most wealthy [Music] and so you give away your hundred poker chips give tokens and the idea that the ask is who have you directly seen create value in this community give them a give them a you know symbol of your appreciation through these uh these give tokens and then once you add that all you look and you see all the received give across all the different people from everybody participating in this gifting ceremony or giving ceremony then you just divide whatever budget goes to that group by that amount and that's your asymmetric you know allocation so i've been really like kind of tickled by this idea of um inter-subjective consensus for measuring who's doing what work and and you know i'm coming from this place of bitcoin's mission of gro is growing and sustaining open source and for like 2017 2018 uh maybe 2019 people were trying to build these like page rank networked graphs where you could like look at people's commits and how many comments were on them and how many hearts they got um and you were trying to build this like objective measure of like which commits had value which is you know only inclusive of coders uh which is one problem but another problem is that when a measure becomes a measure it ceases to become a good measure i think i'm butchering that quote but that's like the basic idea and and if you move from trying to like objectively measure these things and into an inter-subjective consensus of the participants that are deeply doing the work it becomes much harder to gain so you don't have that constraint of only code and then you also have this ability that um it's hard to game the perception of your peers of your work and so um i just think it's really intersubjective consensus is is a really elegant way of doing distributed resource allocation yeah i totally agree and it's it's good heart's law you know when a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure and um all these basically any any metric you use an algorithmic system it will be gamed and then what you're creating is a is a environment of adversarial gaming where people are incentivized to take advantage of the system um and now adversarial techniques are important because there are adversaries out there right there are people that are going to act like that and you need to have something robust against that but what we found is in trusted uh creative groups that's the wrong mental model you know what you want to do is incentivize more trust and incentivize more safety and support and independence and sovereignty and so you that's coordinate comes from that perspective um which is what intersubjective consensus basically the belief that the people in the community are good and are you know not the naive belief but the uh the starting point that people are good and trustworthy right yeah yeah i think it's like really interesting that you sort of framed like there's adversarial environments where you need to take one approach and then there's environments where you've got more of like kind of like a curated list of people that was seated with a trusted seed and then you can kind of do different things with those different trust environments maybe um and what i think is cool is how replicable the coordinate model has been you started in urine and now you all are when i talk to y'all uh like maybe six or nine months ago it was like 45 different dials so you found that it's coordinate has has this model has replicated to many other dials and um congrats on your all of your success with that and i just think that uh you know i said at the start of the episode that you're this is amazing a priority thinker but you have all this empirical data and experience too and the intersection of that is is where really cool insights happen and thinking evolves because you can make a come up with a theory and and you can have the data to to validate whether or not it's a thing so um anything you want to say about the expansion from urine into all these other dials using coordinate well it's just been really exciting to see how many uh yeah i mean there was 45 back then there's hundreds now i think i don't know how many of them are super active we don't have great data but um but yeah it's been a tremendous amount of pick up trend amount of growth and the coordinate team is really doing some amazing stuff a lot of partnerships a lot of new ideas new designs coming coming soon so that's pretty exciting cool yeah all right i feel like we've done our duty and we've we've done the through the through fair of uh of your experience into the space and the wi-fi into coordinates so should we get back to the to the weird to the theories let's go weird so uh you have a really grand view of dowels and of data that's really based in a lot of empiricism but now i want to get it more into theory so what are the most interesting sort of theories that you've been developing and knowledge threads that you've been pulling drake yeah thanks i mean i think there's there's so many um you know i i usually use the lens of kind of development to think about a lot of this stuff and that's and you can look at kind of echoes of different developmental paths across all these different realms of experience you can look at it in the kind of corporate organizational realm or you can look at it in the individual development realm or the development of physics and the cosmos and you can see these really interesting um [Music] similarities between them so like in the talk i gave a shelling point there is this diagram of these three pyramids and you can see that like basically the idea at the top of each pyramid there's the corporation the dao and then the person and the corporation is a kind of entity or organism that arises on top of you know a foundation of nation-state governance and then jurisprudence on top of that and notions of finance and property and then the corporation can emerge atop and it's like that's a kind of shaky foundation that requires a bunch of like text documents and trusted intermediaries and um also not a fit for a networked world where like you and i are in different countries right now and we're coordinating yeah yeah it's not it you know it's served us well for a while but we've kind of outgrown that that skin and so dows are similar to corporations but they rest on like a much stronger foundation of like digital computation which is you know kind of global and generalizable by nature and then blockchains which allow which i think of blockchains in this context kind of like the difference between rna and dna like you know rna is able to to a allow for things like viruses and other small kind of biological machines but it's it's pretty volatile and it doesn't store information very long it can break down but then dna you know super robust and it can last for thousands of years and it it can allow for much more complicated organisms so like the difference between like a bank's ledger and the public blockchain ledger is kind of the same it's way more robust um and from that you have things like d5 and nft is and then on top of that dowse but then if you keep pushing it into the future it's the person right the corporation is a person is this a kind of funny legal thing but in a way it's really true because it is a individual entity in the collective frame just as a dao is and just as a person is because a person is a is a collection of different cells and organs as well and you can go down in the stack so it depends on the aperture you're kind of looking at there yeah yeah and the person has an even more robust foundation of chemistry right and and dna and then blood and body and then the person on top so that kind of thinks about the trajectory that we're on developmentally got it so um dowser built on blockchains which is built on digital computation corporations are built on finance and property law on nation states and people are built on like blood and body and dna and chemistry i have a bunch of a chem or bio bone in my body so this is where it sort of loses me but i think it's interesting to think of those apertures of being built on these foundations and kind of like standing on the shoulders of giants there and just comparing and contrasting those those those structures so what does that sort of lead you once once you've kind of got that frame well i think it it's kind of important for human beings to kind of step back and be like wow this is a lot bigger than i thought you know like you can be working in a corporation or a dow or something like that and think that you understand what's going on you know but it's actually part of a cosmic process of development right and from different frames it's completely different and it helps i think it helps me to let go and let the emergent you know energies move through the system which are often much wiser than my small brain is right right well how do we design emergent systems that are wiser than a than a centralized brain and and by the way i'm sort of looking at your shelling point talk right now and and the sort of you know the the idea that you gave us at that talk which is the structure of an organization affects its abilities for its contributors to perceive and have autonomy and thus an organization's capability are relative to its structure so you know i guess not all structures are are the same in their ability to sense make and to to compete in the world like do you have trach's magic formula for for for what works in the in the new world i don't i definitely don't have a magic recipe but i i think i have some ideas of some pieces you know okay um and it kind of starts with um this kind of transition moment that we're in again right like the cordyceps has done its job we've spread computation in humans all over the world and and money and now we need to shift gears we've been in this um period of conquest really right of command and control uh which is how corporations and nations have worked and it's been violent and abusive and um and it has done its job of spreading this organism around in this crazy way now we're at the edge of the petri dish right like there's not enough um jelly left for us to all eat and just keep ex expanding we have to switch gears to a new metabolism and that's sense and respond um which is interesting from a kind of another kind of spiritual or tantric lens where command and control are both very masculine very much emissive like controlling ideas whereas sense and respond is more listening it's kind of it's more feminine um and in the notion of the divine feminine i don't mean like female or male sex and it it has more of a balance to it listen and and speak listen and speak rather than then go and go and that's the notion you know charles eisenstein talks about this that we're the period of our life where we have where we're growing up we have to go from the idea of mother earth you know this place that we can infinitely take from to love our earth which is a partner in a balance in dialogue which is where we are now right all right sounds like you've been green-pilled i don't even have to try to green teal you on this oh yeah so so how do like how do we do that like how how do we have the internet of money we've got mother earth how how love earth like how do we how do we build a more regenerative crypto economic system how do we uh evolve into this next phase and um avoid it avoid the mistakes that that we might be headed towards yeah i mean it's all happening all at once right now and i think um it's like how does the caterpillar know to turn into a cellular slurry and like grow wings like from one level it's like far beyond any one of our ideas and i think from another level we can say it's fractal it's this idea of fractal sovereignty right so like if we want to create organ organizations that can live in balance with each other in the world we have to start by being able to live and balance with each other in the world so develop there's personal development and collective development that are happening in synchrony and importantly we have to build on solid ground just like the difference between building on blockchain versus building on a public like a bank's ledger book um one is more solid than the other and as a human being i have to i have to grow on solid foundations of you know clearing up the traumas from my childhood and you know learning how to relate to other people and doing the work to become a more vibrant and sovereign being not because of some woo-woo thing but because that makes me like a healthier part of this organism we're in and so there's that piece and then the organisms themselves the organizations they need to grow on solid foundations and this is like you know another idea that i just have been trying like it's been melting my brain from your talk is this idea of dallas having process fidelity which is basically like if i'm a node in a network i have to trust that the network's gonna follow the process operational access which i think is access to the information uh that you need to do your job and to be involved in the network topology which is being able to navigate where in the network you are um but those that's my interpretation but like i think it's really interesting that you came up with like i'm really bad at being concise and these are like six words for like how to design your doubt process fidelity operational access and network topology sorry topography um anything to say about that yeah that's a better answer to your question than the previous one i gave so let me speak about that that's thank you for that prompt um yeah so how do we make daos that are not going to just be a corporation on the blockchain how are we going to work together in a way that allows us to uh handle the wicked challenges in the world and you know and and live in balance with the earth and with each other and i think uh it's it's these are three axes that uh i've kind of identified that help you see that you know to make more downness and less corporateness and go more in the direction of sense and respond and less in the direction of command and control and so process fidelity is like probably the most important one which is the um which is based on blockchain like how much can you trust this system and not just how much can i trust that my bitcoin is going to be there tomorrow but how much can i trust that this organization or this dow you know is going to reward me for my work or that if i put effort into this thing it's going to go in somewhere well or like that this per this anonymous dev online is like somebody good to work with like these are all big challenges like um but that's key the more that's the key a key foundational layer um which is very different than you know in comparison to corporate process fidelity if you look at like private corporations versus public corporations versus governments like they used to have different terrible layers of this yeah um and then the next one operational access like you said it's like uh you know how accessible is it how legible is it how transparent is it for a new person starting can they um you know can a 13 year old from gambia come in who's a genius and can she uh you know be able to weigh in on a major topic within this organization and have the best insight that then that organization can take and use and harvest to go to farther heights than it could before that's hard to do and the last one is the network topography and you know i kind of think of these as like car driver and road like the process fidelity is your car how much can you trust the vehicle the operational access is the driver who's able to drive it and the network to progress is the road like where can you go like you know corporations have a kind of fab artificial distended topography this um hierarchical tree structure of centralization which allow for the distortions of you know command and control where one person on top can push a button and then other people go and launch a bomb and kill people like nobody wants to do that you know you have to create these these artificial relationships with humans to to subvert their own natural senses so if you have a topography which is really open it allows for one to many connections in all different ways um it changed the entire kind of uh surface tension of the of the of the creature of the cell you know and and that's where we see these different shapes of of creatures emerging now yeah and i i think that in your talk you displayed that just reminds me of uh in your talk you displayed uh uh what i would describe as a sea urchin but i think you called it a saphen of four which is a complex aggregate quality of uh [Music] it's just like can you tell us more about your analogy of of like the organisms that are starting to emerge in this space yeah right because i love this i found this i think it was dystopia breaker on twitter that posted this like that was really more like saphonophores which are these like colonial organisms so basically it looks like one animal but it's a bunch of different animals each with specialized skills um that work in like total harmony with each other um which is super cool to me and it makes me think of like yearn urine is a lot like that because you know we've got wifey holders that do voting and we've got y teams which are these empowered teams by that can do something differently and then we've got the multisig which like is our interface with ethereum and phantom and other chains and uh yeah it's cool yeah it's it's interesting to think about uh a lot of this stuff in evolutionary terms i kind of think of the different layers of progress in blockchain as opening up these new design spaces where it's it's not natural selection because this isn't nature but it's kind of like mimetic selection um so we went from bitcoin to ethereum to the design space of ethereum and the dow happened and then it imploded and like you know all everyone's scattered from there and then you have defy summer which was an explosion of of all this talent coming into the space and building stuff then the not implosion but kind of like back burner-ness of that and then you had nfts and then you have dowels and it just feels like this infinite garden of all these fauna sort of growing on top of each other and so i think it's interesting to think about those apertures of the individuals becoming a collective in like one organism but also having the sovereignty of of the individual in there as well so i don't know if you have anything to say about ecosystems and like the evolutional metaphor there but that's where my mind goes well i think that's the right way to to think about it because you know we have to i think there's been this idea an old idea that you know that i can figure it all out that i can if only i could solve if i could have at it i could solve this problem and it's like no no no one being can do that like like the challenges are far beyond us so uh it takes an ecosystem like the like who was it was um it was um mark weezer who was the head of xerox park who invented ubiquitous computing and he said that um you know why is it that when i take a walk into the forest it feels calm but when i use a computing system it's chaotic when the amount of data in the forest is you know orders of magnitude more than the computer it's like nature has a magical power to do things and the computational throughput of a cell you know versus a you know a processor and the heat dissipation you know it's instead of electrical pathways it's using protocol pathways right proton um based power transfer rather than electron based and it's totally different way of looking so we need to we need to take from biology and like allow that to help guide our decisions like instead of making robots you know which come from this very simplistic view of of okay this guy makes all the decisions and then this guy goes and does things it's like no we're like inside the cellular uh the cytoplasm we are we are the mrna and the trna and the proteins and amino acids and the ribosomes all bouncing around we need to create the minimal viable structure that allows for each sovereign human to be able to do what they see in front of them and add that to this like laser of human productivity we the mechanisms we design are not to control people right there to allow is to allow it's the party bike allow people to harvest their energy and contribute their energy in a way that's meaningful it's like where that puts me is is like how do we get them to harm like harness their energy in useful ways and of course that's an overloaded question because um usefulness is in the eye of the beholder but like i just can't help but like you know the nature metaphor comes back for me we're in this cambrian explosion of possibility there's many design opportunities you can get away right now with like low-hanging fruit stuff like simple strategies like um basically just like simple stuff but also adversarial stuff so like taking advantage of people like rug pulls are basically like viruses in this metaphor and like derivative fork vegetable coins are like cancer it's just like growth at all costs until like there's no more hosts to consume and then it dies so how do we speedrun the evolution of all this stuff to get to like the crypto equivalent of mammals or mycelial networks or like dolphins um and of course uh evolution is an omni omnidirectional so like we're not just going towards one one apex but um and also evolution doesn't stop like things will evolve past humans from here but you know how do we get to the advanced strategies that are symbiotic um and and fair and like create a world that we want to that we want to live in do you have any sort of sort of thoughts on that yeah it's a it's a big question it's like a lot of things come to mind and the first thing that comes to mind is that there's all different types of people on this planet right like there are people that think the best thing to do is go and kill somebody else there are people that want to give all of their stuff away to help others like there's everything and there's children too there's every different level of development all happening all at the same time and it's like if you want to have a good time at this party with your kid like you got to have some weird thing for the kid to play with too you know that's useful for them and so that you can do something also and so we need to design systems not from an ideological perspective of like this is the best way to do it everybody needs to do it but like kind of coming from the open perspective that everybody actually does have something useful to contribute um and actually there's a frame where you can think every action is actually valuable no matter how crazy it is um but because from that person's perspective we are all trying to actually do something good even if we think that even if we're so distorted that's killing somebody we still think it's something good and so we need to design systems that allow for all the different spectrum of humans to work in different ways that has to be embedded in this structure living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use d5 and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrage if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitron many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrum.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrary using bridge.arbitrom.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free all right so uh what didn't what didn't i ask you they that you want to that that you want to tell us like i just feel like you have this breadth of knowledge and i don't even know where where to start with a question so totally open-ended where should we go from here drake man i think the the thing that i think about for so many of us that are you know we're out here we're trying to figure out what to do um moving i think moving from command and control to sense and respond you know it is a personal it is personal development you know and we can get caught up with all the things that we need to fix and all the things that are wrong and you know who's doing what and who rugged who and i said okay we can get into that drama um yeah or we can fall back to something a little a different way of thinking and just just instead of like for me one of the guiding principles that's helped me in my life is like when i'm trying to think about what i want to do i just think about what my desire what do i want you know what's most interesting to me and then i do that and i think this is what we need to do endows and we need to do in this new in in regenerative communities is it's not about telling others what to do anymore it's about finding out what i want to do and yeah reminds me of that this reminds me of a part of your talk where you have this really amazing venn diagram with four overlapping circles and uh this is a talk called fractal sovereignty and and one of the beautiful things i think i see here is do what you love and what you're best at and what you can be paid for and what the dow needs in the intersection of those things is is what you can do i think it can be very overwhelming when we think about all the crises in the world and all of the things that we need to fix and often is at you know the psychology of of of humans is one that often projects and and we take our fear and we project it on the world we take our pain we project on others and then that makes it feel like it's easier to fix if i go and change this then i'll be okay and that little trick is actually kind of the root of all of our suffering that's moloch's work right there and um if we can reclaim that stuff and and and think about that diagram of ikeguy the dao guy right and and reclaim the power and see what what do i want to do how can i be of service now it's not on me it's not my responsibility over all these other people to fix them or fix everything first take responsibility for my own actions and my own needs and uh you don't even you know if we're all doing that it doesn't really even matter what technology we have so i think that that's the i blow that down in my head too and i just wrote it down the note how can i be of service now this is the question that dao contributors can can ask yeah amazing um and that requires so many things that requires sense and respond that requires sensing what the dial needs um and looking at yourself and what you love what you're best at it and asking that question of what can it be paid for and then you know does it sort of your talk title is called fractal sovereignty the emerging structure of decentralized work so does it just fractal from there you have fractal sovereignty and fractal coordination when you start thinking about how i can be of service servicenow i think so i mean it goes all the way down like there's this notion of cellular psychology that you know that we have this feeling of like oh i don't feel good something's wrong but actually that's like it's not even at the level of the human it's actually an emergent property of all these different cells having different feelings and then we're feeling their feelings and and then it goes up to the doubt too like if all the different contributors in the dao you know or one way this is the idea of fractal sovereignty like for the doubt to be most effective and most efficient mind all of its constituent parts need to also be that way and sovereignty is the lens i use to look at it and this word is actually kind of triggering in some ways because it can mean a king in which it has dominion but just like in all things there's developmental lenses so like as a child maybe sovereignty is having control of your limbs you know and then you can think of it as being like a king but then at a higher level it's really having responsibility for my own actions needs feelings you know an impact in the world without outsourcing that to other people or projecting it onto other people and endow full of that type of fractal sovereignty both healthy bodies you know and minds um yeah that's the thing i want to be a part of so what is the world in which coordinate is maximally successful look like coordinate or maybe your ideas which coordinate is a manifestation of just like the tip of the iceberg of oh man i mean it's it transcends all of the horrible history of labor in this world right like like in the beginning of the factory you know period of our of our lives like people were out in the fields and they didn't want to go to the factory work people they would be chained to the to the to the lines and they would go and put clocks in every town and train systems to force people to come and work but they wanted to do their own thing and they would break the clocks and but you know this logic of money has kind of pushed that forward and now we believe that work that we you have to have a work ethic you know and and that's good and you you need to go and do this thing that you don't want to do for the benefit of others this is all brainwashing um so the future of coordinate is one where that's all been broken down we don't have to have golden handcuffs you know to keep us interested in something we don't need to be peer pressured into work and have all these carrots and sticks in our lives but instead we can sense into what our calling is in the world what our gifts are and we can offer those to the community and then we can get rewarded by our peers and if i want to go take a month in patagonia you know i just need to talk to the people i'm doing things with and i can go and i don't have to worry about the money like whatever salary structures or compensation structures will just slowly wither like synapses losing activation in the brain and they can regrow so i imagine this kind of nomad worker where you don't have to have any contracts with anybody you can work as much or as little as you want and when you put work out into this system and you need the technology and the substrates that can hold and present that work in a way that is legible and useful for others then you can get rewarded through overlapping gift circles from different communities by your peers and admirers and colleagues and um and and then do the same so you can work for five dollars at once one dow like you can stop you can do as much as you want or as little as you want right one of the things that i think is really challenging is as we move from this industrial age to the information age a lot of times it feels like we know what we're leaving we know the institutions that were we've inherited from the baby boomers are not working and the industrial age is not working but we don't know what's next like we haven't grabbed that next monkey bar and but we've let go kind of of the last one and and one of the things i think is really cool is that a lot of our motives around work like companies are around the 40-hour workweek which is something we inherited from the industrial age in factories and cubicles are inherited from the industrial age and and and it just feels like we've kind of like i think that you just kind of articulated the next monkey bar from the 40-hour work week which has just been prolific and and is really a relic of the industrial age so um you know continuing this metaphor of the next monkey bar you know what does work look like in in in this new world is there anything more to say about uh about how people join dallas and join these network sense and respond systems like if if i'm out there and i want to get into what i wanted to get in dallas and i started want to start working this this way where where do i start yeah well to go backwards like yeah the place to start is to whatever communications environment you're in if it's twitter or some other group and seeing what's interesting and i really advocate for a more shamanic uh approach to this don't try and solve it like an equation like feel where you're drawn to like and what feel the attraction and aversion in the environment and and let that guide you so get out of your head and into your body get in your body into your spirit and feel what project resonates with you what people what messages what memes and pull those threads there's not a linear onboarding like i can't just go to monster.com and apply to an impact out like i need to start showing up in these spaces okay which is different than how we're used to and and we're because we're we're kind of trained to not waste effort and make sure that we're going to get rewarded and not just kind of follow our hearts and see where it leads but when you do do that you know your heart will get broken sometimes right and that's you have to be okay with that too um yeah so risk management you know i hear david and and and ryan talk about risk management on the main pod with your finances but with your career you've got limited time you've got limited gumption and anytime you go down a path you're kind of wondering is this the right path for me and it's it's kind of i've found it's it's useful to cast a wide net like when i started getting bitcoin bitcoin was actually my sixth or seventh like side project of which four of those projects were blockchain projects so i was just kind of like testing systematically where the opportunities were for me in frontier tech um and and it seems like i actually did have my heart broken once or twice very couple projects but uh it seems like you kind of have to be willing to do that dance with the universe as you enter the space yeah at least at this time maybe someone will build an onboarding tool that's a little bit more systematic down the line yeah i think that's right and you know they'll be you know we also have to realize that we're fairly privileged to be able to be in this space not everybody has the free time and the educational background to like make sense of this stuff it does take a lot of work or the safety net there to you know help pick you up if you do find something doesn't work um that that will change and it kind of goes from top and bottom like each of us like finding more space in our own lives to explore and for our own curiosity through whatever work we need to do and then the the community creating better and better on-ramps and and signposts for us to follow to find the connection that's actually going to serve us great so a call to action to people who are working in the space on this is create those signposts help contributors pay it forward to the the person who's working the nine to five or doesn't feel super engaged with their work and create the signpost so that they can come into web 3 and create their fractal sovereignty yeah absolutely all right well we're out of time uh i'm deeply enjoying our discussion i'm going to have you back hopefully in like a year or so to to continue pulling this thread thank you so much for being on greenfield i uh want to ask where can people find you online where can people find your work online if they want to learn more yeah twitter is the place uh tracheopterix it's easy to spell it's obvious how to spell it of course we'll have it in the show notes uh for those who can't spell it uh and then also for the podcast host that can't can't pronounce it uh that'll that'll be helpful okay um trey i admire you so much uh coordinate is a inspiration and just learning about all the theory and deep thought you've put into this really inspires me a lot so thanks so much for being on a green pill oh man right back at you i i you've been such an inspiration to me um ever since i came to this space as a real role model somebody to to look to is doing this right and i just i'm such a it's such a delight to get to know you man thank you it's nice to hear yeah it's fun to compare and contrast what i know about get coin with what you know about urine um yeah i want to get to that point where we're not centralized that's like my big thing right now so studying people who are actually doing it from the start is cool but but again thank you for being on the show thank you so much thanks for having me [Music] you
