[Music] foreign [Music] happy fourth Friday of October this is the Friday before Halloween what time is it oh Ryan it's the bank List Friday weekly roll-up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet this week while we're persevering into the frontier we're doing it in spooky fashion in spooky fashion this is this is as is tradition on Bank list least uh we did this last year neither David nor myself have seen each other's costumes yet yeah we dressed up in costume for this roll-up now I have not seen what this man looks like he has not seen what I look like he says his costume is kind of uh dressed up but in a few minutes a few moments rather we're gonna do the reveal we're gonna turn the camera on and uh see how spooky you really are David can you tell me about your costume like so yeah so I'll I'll tease a little bit right now uh you Ryan actually actually are not going to see my costume what yeah okay so that will be obviously turn on my camera what's your costume inspired by oh it's an nft it's my favorite nft it's your favorite nft yeah uh you're not a dick bud are you let's start with crypto that'd be so weird dude all right I'm glad I'm not having to see that if that's what you are so my costume was inspired by some recent events that's all I'll say um oh I know I know you don't I know you're ready let's pray start video one two three it's me oh my your favorite crypto YouTube influencer this looks like some kind of uh like bondage thing we're about to do here no I I've got one of these weird like green spandex suits on but yeah what you're not seeing is I am a green screen and so Luke is gonna put my crypto dick butt over me no he's not yes that's so you actually can't see my costume because you just see the green screen oh my god dude this is weird this is weird I'm proud of you for figuring out your background this background oh wait you just put that into Zoom yeah let's just continue it's easy okay it's easy screenshot of bit boy done oh my God excuse me I revealed inspired by a crypto influencer that's all I'll say yeah this is not about an individual at all but uh notice I'm not wearing glasses you are not wearing glasses glasses are absent no glasses no glasses dude well should we do this I have no idea how Luke is going to layer on my crypto dick butt onto my green screen spandex suit I actually have no idea um how you're supposed to see like are those like yeah I had to I had to cut out little eye holes for be able to to do this let me tell you I'm going to be extremely frustrated like one hour into this weekly off it's gonna be super hot sweaty the grossest role of ever um I can't smile by the way because every time I do it like it Chase my uh my beard yeah yeah this is why you don't have a beard IRL B somber no yeah that's the reason that's the reason why that's the reason okay topics of the week David let's give the people what they really want they're not here for the costumes they're here for the content all right they're here for the not Financial advice part of bankless number one we got to talk about eth being almost deflationary this is so weird I can't see your facial reactions I'm just going with it uh number two apple is being real sketchy with nfts David it seems like they want to sterilize them it's kind of weird and what else we got David and Lord of the Rings nfts uh hmm we're gonna see how that lands with the community uh do you think Ryan Lord of the Rings fans are also nft enjoyers uh I think there's a high overlap there but uh I almost want to buy one but I'm not going to and uh we'll talk about why when we get to that section yeah but before we get in gotta talk about our super serious friends and sponsors this is a serious tool that you want to use it is called the push application so what this does is it reads your on chain it reads on-chain data and alerts you to events so there's all sorts of things if you're a crypto native that you have to like remember to do right uh when does your your collateral go underwater for instance or is your bicep for a specific price point or is your ens name about to renew rather than having to like write these in a calendar or something you need to be alerted for these on-chain events and that is exactly what push does what are we looking at on screen here oh we're just looking at all the various notifications that you could be notified by so snapshot votes of course maker doubt governance decisions wrecked the dark web of D5 journalism whenever they release an article but you could imagine so much more as the world of the metaverse gets built out that you might need to be notified about what's going on in the metaverse part of the metaverse is that it is persistent as in it goes on whether you are in it or not and so push can notify you by sending push another applications right to where you see them which is your phone and so you can either sign up for push as a push notification receiver or as a push notification Pusher regardless of whether you're on the receiving or giving end of push so check out the link in the show notes all right guys yeah Ryan you just are cracking up this whole entire time no I can't I just can't have the smile off your face just subscribing all right uh I've just subscribed to all these opt-ins things and push right now David you know your voice sounds a little muffled and if it does bankless listeners that's because David is literally wearing a Spandex mask over his mouth there's no body there's no body I have to also move the microphone so it's not in front of my body so that the green screen huh all right let's get to the markets David it was a good week it was a good week yeah what what uh is bitcoin price looking at right now Bitcoin start of the week at 19 250 it went up seven percent to twenty thousand six hundred dollars very impressive seven percent well done Bitcoin we love it we love it that's super impressive and we're gonna talk about why maybe in a in a minute how about eth what's that doing for us uh eth went up 19.2 what 19.2 percent you don't get those very often start of the week at thirteen hundred dollars ending the week where we are right now at 15 50. fifteen hundred and fifty dollars so fantastic week almost a 20 up week that's a big big big uh and I'm wondering if this is kind of the the like less Supply on the market you know taking shape and that it's like when it goes up it just it shows up and I agree that was my take as well I don't know if we're ever gonna be able to say that this is because of the burn like with a hundred the percent level of confidence here but we've we were saying it before that when ether does go up it's going to go up more aggressively because of the supply restriction out of EIP 1559 and the proof of stake merge yeah all we need all we need is a crypto YouTuber confidence that's all we need so yeah 100 percent 10 000 because because we are fighting for you okay this is not about us we are fighting for you I hope you guys understand this uh that's not about the money from me let's talk about the single largest liquidation event in FTX history and the runner-up isn't even close that happened last week a 600 million dollar liquidation event that's because people weren't ready for this big leg up what are we looking at here David yeah we're looking we're looking at the crypto prices um we're also uh looking at on the bottom here the aggregation liquidations of all the global average of liquidations and yes there is just this massive green candle implying massive liquidations uh and so a lot of bears were shorting crypto shorting ether shorting Bitcoin uh and when it when when those prices went up a little bit we saw a cascading liquidation to the upside the the way that we like it to go uh and so there was a short squeeze so big short squeeze to the tune of 600 million dollars of shorts liquidated and that's why crypto prices moved so violently too many people were bearish can you tell me why you would like you're you're a brave you're a brave man you're a brave individual David but like would you ever have the balls to like short crypto I never I would never ever short anything even like even Tara Luna while it was going down I was like I could shark this thing's gonna collapse but like no like there's like crypto is so irrational it doesn't make any sense to Short well I think some Traders learned that and uh it wasn't just the 600 million on FTX it was crypto Traders hit by 1.2 billion worth of short liquidations uh and that was earlier this week uh so a pretty harsh lesson this is the reason you don't go margin and you never short crypto of course not Financial advice life advice eth Bitcoin on the ratio that's gotta have a good week what are we looking at here yeah eth is up 11 and a half percent versus Bitcoin we are coming into the tune of 0.0753 how's your how's your ratio bet holding up David uh well it was read before this week and now it's green huh nice it's good to be great I definitely could have opened that trade at a more opportune opportunity um but over the long term I just don't care it's kind of funny you kind of look like a big green candle right now if you just like tuck your arms in hold your arms in David is a big green candle right now they can't see that they just use dick but oh man well I'll have to screenshot this for uh for everyone else it looks like some charts though uh a few coins of note this week um the first is oh actually first let's get a crypto market cap they're way above a trillion we are yeah we are above a trillion one point zero four trillion dollars we are now once again measuring the total crypto market cap with a t instead of a b which makes me feel good we love the t's all right some charts let's look at Aptos why do you want to show us Aptos today David uh cause it's on the menu it's on the list it's on coin gecko Aptos is there uh trading at uh one point something billion dollars all right with a fully diluted valuation of 9.2 billion dollars so Ryan are you kidding me it's almost for 10 billion dollars it's almost with 10 billion so you wonder why there's like all of these VCS are always doing these like all layer one like ethereum killers and now Aptos is like the Solana killer and maybe eventually there'll be the Aptos killer it comes it's because these things keep on coming to Market at billions of dollars so it doesn't matter that they're doing like these 300 million dollar seed rounds the VCS have to do it because it works it works every time every time it's almost like it works in like it seems like a one out of ten layer one bets I don't know I just pulled that number out of nowhere but like it works a lot of things yeah it works too much of it such that you're if you're a rational VC you almost have to take these bets yeah um Dutch coin What's Done Dogecoin is up 30 on the week I think it's actually the winner of the week over the seven day period why that's I'm so glad you asked Ryan uh it's because Elon Musk bought Twitter that deal is going through yeah and so Elon Musk the the pumper of Doge uh is now the CEO leader of Twitter and so as a result Doge goes from sixth sense to where it is now at a little over seven and a half cents so did you see that something percent did you see that um picture of him like walking to the Twitter offices yeah I think a kitchen sink why was he doing that I think it was some joke of like um you know I threw in everything but the even the kitchen sink something like this and so you showed up with a sink you know for the memes [Music] yeah the number one uh biggest increase in total crypto market cap came from East uh so over the uh over the seven day period like we said up almost 20 percent I'm just looking at the charts and looking at these lows when we were down in the 900s that was uh back in June so a few months ago now I'm gonna once again Flex my bottom tick by of 897 which is doesn't even show up as a low on the coin gecko chart like you just have to take the dub on that one you know what I'm gonna let you Flex that because uh I respect that I respect that David that was a that was definitely a good buy um I think it could hold up but there's a big question we're gonna get to is have we seen the bottom yet but before we do let's talk about meta has medicine in the bottom David meta had an absolutely this is of course Facebook uh formerly Facebook now called meta we don't talk about stocks often but this is notable if if you bought ten thousand dollars worth of meta seven years ago you would now have nine thousand five hundred and forty six for these student listeners that is less than ten thousand dollars ten year seven year period of time um pretty uh pretty big Miss pretty rough and earnings came out yesterday I don't know if you caught some of that but um basically the tldr is like all of this investment in the metaverse not yet paying off yeah there are other contributing factors to poor earnings but like big losses not paying off yet you have any other takes here no that sounds about right but I think if you'd expect like hey if you're gonna invest in the metaverse when we literally invented this metaverse word like a year ago into in terms of like investability and infrastructure like you'd expect to take losses early in order to be able to profit and harvest later so like that shouldn't come as a big surprise dude if it goes down another 25 this street is saying uh it will be less than the Marquee cap of ethereum so ethereum will flip in meta yeah meta right now is worth less than Home Depot ow really yeah yep yikes yeah uh well which kind of makes sense in like this whole era of the macro economy like Commodities real world stuff like building actual housing makes sense that Home Depot would have like a good valuation versus metaverse right now yeah I can't take advice uh looking at you right now for from the suit but um big boy bro I can't take advice from you I'm a generic crypto influencer and by the way thousands of people take advice from crypto influencers Millions might I add I should see my follower accounts um the big question though David I think that people want to know is have we bottomed yet um this is a article from Zero Hedge from drucken Miller uh Stanley drucken Miller a decade of no returns he says uh is the title of this and uh this is based on drucky Miller's recent comments here's one quote from him there's a high probability in my mind that the market at best is gonna be kind of flat for 10 years sort of like 1966 to 82 time period this is sort of a not just druckenmiller saying this but a lot of macro uh thought leaders saying this as well that basically we could be in for a flat decade a flat or maybe a down decade and primarily they're talking about like you know bonds of course but uh but also equities and so there's that idea uh what do you think of of that idea generally and then we can give kind of the Counterpoint to this when we talked to Lynn Alden and we try and get hey Will and Alden we're confused and scared will you help us like tell a story about the history of stuff and she like pulls in like well this part of this macro world looks like this decade this part of the macro world looks like that decade I think that's what Stanley druckenmiller is doing is saying like hey like inflation let's go backwards a few decades and say hey let's go you know look at the last time there was inflation and like the stock market didn't move for over a decade I think that's what he's doing um and I think just the broader question is does history rhyme and to and to what degree I think the other more relevant question is does how much does crypto get caught up in that yeah yeah uh and like we're definitely coupled to macro now but like we were also a couple to macro people don't really talk about this often but we were also crippled to macro in 2018 when crypto prices crashed like interest rates were going up in 2018. um and then over time we had the bear Market we had the crypto bear Market the also called the build market and eventually what happened was that we built so much that we just forced our own decoupling during defy summer I guess it wasn't really decoupling because that's also when like stimichucks were going out um but like it did the crypto did decouple and like move away from the stock market so at some point like building crypto will just take over and there's no way that crypto can have like a 10-year flat Market because we build too fast like stuff happens too quickly so there's uh I think two questions here so you know one question is is drucken Miller right about this being the decade of no returns and the second question is how could that affect crypto if he is right this is a Vance Spencer's take from framework what if the doomers are wrong what if the macro podcasters are just relishing in their 50 minutes of fame run for your life Anon I think the take here is like uh good new or bad news tends to kind of spread virally and crowd out good news and sometimes you can be seen as more of an expert if you're predicting um you know chaos and and negative things than in predicting bullishness and Vance is just like saying what if ever everyone's wrong about this it's almost like drucken Miller has kind of become a consensus view there's a question of what if macro is is wrong but then there's also a question of like macro drucken Miller could be right on macro Vance could be right on macro but like how do you prepare for either case and uh crypto podcast we are crypto bullish obviously but like you know it seems pretty compelling is the asset class of crypto because it is different than equities it is also different of course than Bonds in that it is a type of commodity money whose issuance is decreasing over time it's actually deflating and so as long as digital like block space demand increases on something like ethereum and Supply goes down I think it stands in contrast to other assets even even equities in the market and so I I do really am very optimistic that even if drunken Miller is right I think we will see a decoupling of macro from crypto at some point uh during this decade that could be an absolutely massive decoupling event too so I'm still super bullish on the uh we call the crypto barbell strategy where you have like your crypto and that's a large majority of your Investments and then you have super safe assets like dollars for instance like stable coins yeah and then like nothing in the middle um that's my favorite way to approach these markets of course not Financial advice but we'll see what happens next David um B USD the stabilization it's not a terror What's Happening Here uh the just the total Supply is going up it's crossed 20 billion dollars this month for the first time ever and now owns more than 15 percent of all stable coin market share and according to some data out of the block here busd accounts for 22 percent of stablecoin trading pair volume so binance USD getting uh planting a flag it's here to stay it's interesting to see who it's taking away from a little bit of usdc it looks like it's taking away from that's the pink here you see and then the bottom uh this sort of purple blue is US DT so it's taking a little bit from usdc and a little bit from tether in order to carve out that market share well that makes sense we'll do the two other big ones Wall Street Journal this is a headline and Jason Horowitz a16c went all in on crypto at the worst possible time what do you make of this headline and uh what's the Articles say yeah it's basically just kind of a recap of the state of a16z's crypto fund thus far a16c of course raised 4.5 billion dollars the largest ever fund to raise anything for crypto ever uh and then it's uh but the the line here is that the crypto fund has shed 40 percent four zero percent of its value in the first half of this year uh according to people familiar with the matter says the article basically they deployed a lot of capital at the top uh and they says despite they still have a ton of cash and they say despite the record cash pile a16z Andresen has dramatically slowed the pace of its crypto Investments this year mainly I think what we're really seeing is we're just seeing like uh Trad media reporting that a16z cryptos down bad um but I think I think there's no way that all of 816z was allocating during 2021 where valuations were extremely overpriced and without knowing that it's not like oh like uh pitch deck for a 100 million dollar valuation like they're smart people at a16c they kind of know that they were allocating at the top and I think they they're ready to take that oh what's funny to me is it's down 40 in crypto I'm like I consider that a win well done Bitcoin you're down like 85 at the bottom right yeah yeah it's funny how these headlines come out or maybe 70 at these times um all right guys we got a lot coming up next David what is happening next in the roll-up uh ether almost ultra sound maybe ultrasound by the time you are listening to this we're going to continue a little bit of the conversation of inflation versus deflation when it comes to Ether and also talk about the security spend over the last 30 or 40 days because those numbers get me real excited uh and then also as well Apple wants to sterilize your nfts what the hell does that mean and PayPal continuing to be Shady uh so we'll get to all these conversations and more Ryan do you know why uh you know why it's a lot last year I had my pain painted my crypto Punk onto my face yeah and like and I wore the hat and I actually was my crypto Punk yeah you know I had to do the green screen thing this year because why because my crypto dick butt's naked you weren't willing to do that oh it's not really well what would I do I have my crypto dick but uh here I am without a shirt no I couldn't do that I don't know whatever it takes for the views that's what a crypto influencer would do if you're a real YouTuber it's all about those views David all right guys we'll be right back with more first for any of these sponsors arbitrim1 is

the stats what are we waiting for we're of course looking at our favorite website ultrasound Dot money we're not there yet but we're so close the trajectory looks really strong uh ether since the merge 42 days ago has issued .009 inflation that is a total supply of new net new Total supply of 1200 I actually saw it down to as low as 950 ether since the merge yesterday uh so for over 42 days about a thousand ether has been issued to pay for ethereum security just one thousand ether less than .01 so we are so close when's it gonna ultrasound look it's kind of like uh you know going up and down on the bottom here when's it gonna happen it's real it's real teasing us I put out a tweet yesterday saying today's the day but like the the gas feeds are just only barely uh above the threshold so we were burning just a little bit so this could carry on a little bit but I mean the trajectory is so good right but is this a new uh glasses emoji on the current Supply I think that is wait what do you know nothing triggers me more than glasses David that guy wearing his goddamn glasses the Curt supplies because of the the shenanigans what happens in a second I have no idea it's just glasses so triggering kind of elite Banker money uh what you tweeted something about this let me read your Tweet ethereum has spent just 2.3 million on security the last 40 days because of how efficient proof of stake is that 2.3 million of costs produced 13.5 billion of security so that's a pretty good Roi what are we talking about here yeah so that number is actually lower now because we burnt more ether since that time we were actually at 1.8 million dollars spent on security over the last 42 days and that produced 13.5 billion dollars of security uh that 13.5 billion dollars for the security of course is the amount of ether that is staked to the ethereum network that you would have to slash so that is actually only 66 of the value of all staked ether because if you want to go backwards on ethereum if you want to do a 51 attack basically you have to slash two-thirds of all ether this is a crazy stat man 13.5 billion dollars is two-thirds of the amount of The Ether staked to ethereum and we are incentivizing that 13 that that which is actually so like total 20 billion dollars of of ether is being staked ish give or take now 20 billion dollars of Security is coming just from 1.8 million dollars of issuance over 42 days you want to uh you want to see something easy Ryan yeah scroll down and just read the comments on this well okay that's Victor bunin that's like the one positive comment uh if you scroll down I got into uh I got into triggered some bitcoiners and so the bitcoiners just brigaded this tweet thread and now they're all just making fun of me uh ultrasound gloss nearly 33 million in exploits in the last 30 days that's apples to oranges the theory that's not even relevant uh yeah so this tweet just got like absolutely brigaded by by Bitcoin Max because it did not like this at all effing Bethune oh yeah I agree with that one dude any comments on ofat compliance a monetary policy that can change on a whim is definitely not ultra sound money educate yourself oh well uh I guess some people will see over time and so here's my take about this so we were talking we've been talking about the global macro like world right now we've been calling it one more time economies right uh wartime economies is where the United States is going to inflate the dollar in order to pay for the assurances that Ukraine win the war in Russia we are inflating the dollar we're going to pay uh we're going to subsidize uh energy in Europe so that Europe doesn't have to pay Russia money to heat Europe so we're going to inflate the dollar as a result of that which what wartime's economies means to me Ryan is that we have these worrying Nations that are throwing their Fiat currencies at each other trying to win an economic war against each other and that comes at the loss of the value of the currency they are trying to out expend their economic opponents Europe is trying to secure the European economy the United States is trying to secure the American economy we're trying to end the war we're trying to end the war in Ukraine by just spending more than Russia and we're trying to do that so we don't have to use we don't have to engage with the Russian economy and so we're just throwing our currencies at each other that's what wartime occurrencies are Wars are expensive and the result is a currency inflation and a tax on Savers the people that are basically footing the bill for these wartime economies are bondholders in stark contrast to Ether and the eth stake rate ethereum has no Wars we don't have we have very minimal expenditures and we only have savings and so these things cannot be Polar Opposites of each other ethereum does one thing and secure the ethereum economy the United States Nation does many many things and it does those things as a loss for the value of the dollar because we're trying to secure more than just the United States economy and so like the contrast here I think could not be stronger well this is why like I think the uh ether is an internet bond is going to kind of take off as a verse is sovereign debt like sovereign debt is bonds the debt of Nations right and that's what's kind of spiraling out of control but when you can instead of buying a sovereign debt buy an internet Bond non-sovereign debt right or crypto Network secured debt essentially that's an entire entirely new asset class and that's what I mean when we're talking about uh drucken Miller kind of like the flat decade this is this is where crypto I think could really start to outpace all of the other assets equities that are kind of based on on nation-state economies and then bonds themselves which of course are totally tied into nation state economies and then here's a new internet native Network State economy like ethereum and it has completely different economics it's just going to out-compete them as an asset class that's at least I think a possible prediction for for how this turns out David we got some weird news coming out of apple uh here's the headline Apple refuses to exempt nfts from the app store's 30 percent V so dealing with another gatekeeper not the banks this time but a big Tech gatekeeper the app Apple platform of course takes a 30 cut on all app store related fees so any app that generates a fee Apple gets their 30 and they say hey crypto should be the exact same what's going on with this story yeah there's just a number of rules that Apple has placed so Apple apps excuse me apps may use in-app purchase to sell and sell and sell Services related to non-fungible tokens such as minting listing and transferring Okay cool so we can sell nfts inside of the App Store great except for we have to pay them 30 uh apps may allow viewers to view their own nfts provided that nft ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app okay so if you're and if he does something it better not do that thing inside of the app store and then lastly apps may allow users to browse NFC collections owned by others provided that the apps may not include buttons external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the in-app purchase this is like nation state capital controls except it's the Apple ecosystem Monopoly basically it's a monopoly it's a monopoly and and they're they're saying like hey all your taxes belong to us uh no Commerce shall happen on an Apple device that apple does not receive a tax on and that tax is 30 percent what's interesting here is like the posture is like we're not going to ban nfts guys this is we're not going to ban nfts all right all we're doing is imposing our regular 30 tax on nfts oh and by the way they can't actually do anything so they can't unlock they can't have any utility inside of the application it just has to be a JPEG like a pretty picture or something like this a collectible of some sort and then we'll allow you to uh do that right it's completely view them yeah it feels very much like um do you know how Josh Rosenthal in the crypto Renaissance podcast um you talked about how we are like from a digital perspective living in almost futile times right it's like we don't own any of our own property we haven't asked permission to live yeah big Silicon Valley Tech companies are the landlords right we are the plebs we are the serfs that work their land and we just accept it you just accept it just take it like this does not work and I'm I'm so hopeful that web3 and crypto will disrupt this Monopoly um yeah the pushback on this was really really strong uh and so this is a tweet that with a screenshot says with Apple's new rules social networking apps like Facebook Instagram Twitter a lot of that allow companies to buy boosts for social media posts must use in-app purchases for these transactions this means when an Advertiser wants to boost a post on a social network like Facebook or Twitter using an iOS device Facebook will be required to give Apple a 30 cut of the proceeds so this is not only like Apple going off off to the users and say hey users pay a 30 but also going off to Zuckerberg and say Zuckerberg you pay Apple 30 to access anyone that has an iPhone wow so uh the feudal Lords battling the other feudal Lords there as well uh what's the suite from Tim Sweeney Tim Sweeney yeah to cryptocurrency enthusiasts this means apple is now adding a 30 tax on your so-called true ownership of digital Goods to cryptocurrency distractors detractors this shows Apple's motivations are only money for digital items they don't support nfts they tax they ban entities they don't tax yeah so how do we get out of this David does crypto need to build its own phones we need our own app store do we need to force yeah that's right do you know the Solana phone the Solana people were all up in our arms this is one gigantic advertisement to the whole Solana phone Solana I like his operating system concept yeah and kind of like why they said that with justification as to why they need to do this in the first place so like you gotta hand it to them this this is exactly what they were talking about when they made that whole Solana phone to begin with I feel like um a forked version of Android maybe is is another path to take um but ultimately I think competitive forces will require that Apple reverse courses reverse course here but uh we'll see how that plays it basically goes against the entire nft industry it does um let's talk about PayPal this is uh do you remember there's a few Roll-Ups ago remember that thing where PayPal updated their terms of service so they could steal like 2500 from your account if you have a PayPal account uh they updated their terms of service to say that if you said something they don't like for example for any reason verbalize anything that violates their terms of service exactly um and then uh people got really upset on on Twitter about this and kind of media and they called uh PayPal offer and PayPal I was like no no just that was a mistake just kidding uh we didn't actually add that to the terms that was a mistake don't know how that got out and they removed it from their terms well last week they just added this language back in like when with no change the world was Zero change I guess everyone is obsessed with Kanye and like no one was looking and then this so this is the the terms that they added the promotion of hate violence racial or other forms of intolerance that is discriminatory gives them essentially the ability to uh withdraw 2500 from your bank account here's the thing it's like how crazy is this like we have to I mean how often have you read your bank's terms of services right or PayPal's terms of services or do you keep up with every update when they release a new terms of service absolutely not no one does it's impossible that would be a drowning in that would be that would be if I did that if I if you read every single terms of service that would be like a mental disorder and you need to get help for sure and like also it'd be like a full-time like you don't there's not even like it would suck up your entire life that's how broken it is I I loved a tweet from um one commenter who said where are the immutable terms of service we can't stay up to date with all the terms of service of the millions of services we use daily yeah particularly Banks where are the immutable terms of services David that's what crypto is is that what a smart contract is that's what a smart contract is it's an immutable terms of terms of service where no one can go back and reverse things on you or while you're not looking change the rules to withdraw 2500 from your eat the dress when you're not looking that that's impossible we have immutable terms of service this is why we go bankless and whether PayPal plays the game of removing it again and it was like just kidding or like it's not really what we meant how can we trust them right like how can we trust any banks not to slip these sorts of things in when the opportunity arises uh this is why we go bankless yeah and in contrast to terms of service which is like you know 10 000 pages of mostly legal speak a smart contract even though like I can't read a smart contract I don't read code at least a smart contract is like the minimum viable lines of code needed to do something so at least they're not adding in and layering and fluff on fluff it's very precise right it's extremely precise not subjective it can't be settled in courts and we know any smart contract unless it's programmed to explicitly withdraw money from your account it's not going to it can't it doesn't have the ability to nor to update I would imagine our social media editors Ryan or like might cut this clip particularly just like in just with the line This is why you go Bank this about what we're talking about yeah and then our costumes are just on Twitter while we're talking about this with no context absolutely zero context the crazy people in costumes yeah if you're like wait who the hell are these people I didn't know follow this Twitter it's a serious podcast all right once a year we do this only once a year it's not costumes every week this is your first bank list we do not uh dress like this every single week but David what do we have coming up next some super serious topics what are they maker Dao had a vote to go either with roon christensen's end game or go against it uh Mad King roon is back or is there broad Community Support we'll have to figure that one out also Lord of the Rings nfts exciting or duh we'll see what uh Lord of the Rings and and Warner Brothers is doing in web 3 and also FTX stablecoin what do you think the FTX stable coin ticker would be

experience if you want to catch up on Devcon and feel like you didn't miss a beat all of my Devcon videos are interviews with vitalik dankrad Justin Drake Kevin owaki IMI Gucci Peter from Geth the first interview I've ever seen this is the protocol devs yeah these are the protocol devs all of these interviews they're between 10 to 20 minutes long uh just bite size and abuse to catch you up with what happened at Devcon so don't miss out on Devcon a bunch of cool stuff happened that's on YouTube it's awesome RSS feed though right it's also on the RSS feed so either way wherever you're listening to this uh they are where you are listening to this I listen to the vitalik one I can't wait to listen to others Defcon 6 right because this is revenue yes I messed up my Roman numerals yeah it's been a while who knows who uses Roman numerals anyway yeah through the fake number system okay uh maker Dao uh they just yeah this is the maker Down News we were we were talking about just before the break in two parts so the first part is the community has approved coinbase's proposal to custody up to 1.6 billion dollars of usdc with coinbase prime the reason they're doing that is to get a little bit of return on that money it's interesting that that is all being custody but I guess it also doesn't matter because it's usdc anyway so it's all coinbase money at the end of the day that's one part of the maker news what's the other part here yeah the other part is the broad maker Dow member support of ruined christensen's end game plan to break up uh maker Dow into many many many meta Dows smaller Dows this is an effort to make maker Dow more censorship resistant more decentralized uh and definitely prior part of the reaction to tornado cash and some other just regulatory uh influences but this has been of course controversial because while there has been above about 80 percent in support versus 20 uh to against 70 34 was roon Christensen and all delegates delegates to ruined Christensen so uh it's a little a little bit that like Rune it's kind of ruins way or the highway with how much well you have like voter apathy like if people wanted to vote something else then just vote something else it's not like he has all of that economic interest I wouldn't necessarily call it voter apathy because if it was a bigger deal then there'd be less apathy I think people are kind of just trusting with their who they're delegating to uh but uh there's been some some uh controversy so just it's really hard to outvote roon it's really really hard to have vote around hazu who is probably the leader of the uh no side of the end game plan tweets out the end game plan is an exceptionally bad proposal and it's really sad for maker that it passed the signal shoved through by Rune single-handedly in the face of strong and Justified criticism how much of it will actually be implemented remains to be seen and so this is uh not and this is controversial I would say there's not unanimous support by the maker community on the end game plan yet it went through anyways Dows are messy is that the takeaway here especially maker down this is especially yeah I don't know like what side I'd fall on because it's like it's honestly it's gone beyond me in terms of the intricate details here so uh I can't even give you a take here other than Dallas are kind of messy we got to fix governance we got to figure that out um Layer Two Community grants from the ethereum foundation they are now open what does this mean David yeah the ethereum foundation launching a grants initiative to encourage research and development around the layer 2 applications education and ecosystem that includes stuff like block explorers compression technology and just broad education and so the grant round has a core three quarters of one million dollars 750 000 in total grants available proposals are due in six weeks starting from a few days ago so that will take us into December and so if you are have some sort of project and you want to make a proposal about it no matter what phase of that project in whether it's just an idea proof of concept work in progress or fleshed out doesn't matter you can submit your pro your project to the ef's grant system for 2022 layer twos a lot of great projects out here in the grants comes to mind uniswap of course meanwhile in the nft world nfts Reddit nfts that is are picking up steam and it is definitely showing in the numbers David this is a tweet called the flipping and we're seeing seeing what king Reddit alien at the number one spot above crypto punks is that what just happened yeah yeah this is volume numbers of eth traded for the Reddit avatars uh coming in at 503 ether volume I think over what must be a seven day period maybe a one day period uh versus cryptoponics coming in number two at 378 ether Traders this is honest I actually kind of didn't this is actually completely unexpected to me because I kind of thought that if you are collecting uh like Reddit digital collectibles on like uh polygon I don't didn't think that you would be trading these things for a bunch of ether uh and not only that but like a spooky season Reddit collectible avatars coming in at number one another Reddit collectible is coming at number four at 183 and so these are actually themselves right into the defy nft ecosystem on polygon this is a I mean Hollow from polygon says Reddit nfts are an amazing example and a huge win for all of web 3 3 million wallets 99 unique users 100 million dollar market cap and a native Reddit Community uh organic no crypto Twitter noise and no price pumping true and all of this stuff is just hey yeah that's a good point um and it's all on polygon so congrats to polygon that's huge win I always thought Reddit was going to be on arbitrum any trust uh what the hell happened there yeah I don't know uh but I can I can say as a crypto YouTube influencer I'm pretty upset I didn't get to pump this to these these nfts myself couldn't dump on your positions that that is upsetting because that is your business model you know um William peaster wrote a fantastic article if you're looking to find out more if you're a crypto native you're not in the Reddit nft scene this is almost like We're translating uh you know Normie nft is for crypto users and uh this is you could see it on Dune analytics David look at this graph Reddit nft that's up into the usage up and to the right uh anyway go check it out if you want to read more about the Reddit collectible avatars but it's really showing up in the numbers and uh it's really cool that eth is kind of the the money for all of these systems as well um yeah that's nuts yeah piercing into Normie space speaking of which Lord of the Rings haven't you always wanted an nft for Lord of the Rings I actually haven't asked myself without that question I I I mean look uh I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fans did you watch any of the Rings of power stuff uh yeah yeah they didn't capture my attention but I watched a few episodes yeah same here it's not not quite the same level this is the OG the original Lord of the Rings and this looks like Warner Brothers is introducing a whole um Movie experience a set of nfts a collection of nfts I think there's about 11 000 nfts here as part of their web 3 movie Push what's this about David yeah the if you go back to the to the first tweet they are really leaning into the whole web three thing so the Tweet reads introducing a hashtag web3 Movie experience and like in the little promo trailer like under the Warner Brothers logo they have web3 in the actual animation uh and it was kind of confusing as to what that means but it does look like some sort of immersive experience where you get to explore parts of the Lord of the Rings world I don't know how you would do that uh I guess with your like your TV remote you would navigate it on your TV it reminds me of those old weird like uh DVD games that you would play yeah DVD menus yeah yeah um but I mean they're leaning into it and there are collectible things I don't even know what you collect but uh there are uh things you come in there are nfts that you can mint like what they actually are minting I don't really know but the point is that they unlock things uh so I'll read from the Articles here users can pick from two options for the Lord of the Rings nfts there are the mystery conditions when users can randomly mint a common uncommon or rare nft respectively based on the Shire Rivendell and mines of Moria locations in the film mentioning one of these nfts also gives users access to the extended 4K version of the film eight hours of special features in commentary as well as location specific images in AR Collectibles this option contains 10 000 nfts costing thirty dollars each so you get the movies too it's like you get eight hours of content so this is this is a this is an nft access thing uh that gives you stuff a new way to buy the DVD sort of thing exactly exactly the second option is an epic Edition costing 100 for 999 nfts include image Galleries and AR Collectibles of the Shire Rivendell and mines of Moria in addition to the the extended 4K film in 8 hours of special features so like this is again this is what nfcs are for these are for the super fans maybe you're like watching this and like I don't really come confused but the super fans are watching this thing be like I'm totally buying those I don't care what they are uh and so that's what's going on here all they need is 10 999 people to buy one of these things and you know there's definitely a lot of Lord of the Rings fans out there who are probably super excited stoked to buy one of these yeah also in crypto right the Venn diagrams got to be uh like pretty pretty close there Ryan might be one of these people yeah I might be one of these maybe I've been called a fan but you know I almost bought one of these or I almost like investigated it but um I have no idea what chain it's on what's it using is something I've never heard of called aloof.io the content blockchain so yes I don't know very much about this and like unless an nft is somehow secured the website is kind of 2017 by a little strange a little sketch it's a little I only got a white paper though and they got a white paper too white paper yeah the the the kind of thing doesn't really work click the blockchain tab on the top right there yeah uh token model like our blockchain technology background like is it I don't know it's like playing this is the thing like what's the what what is an nft if you don't have um is the kind of settlement guarantees or if you don't know what the settlement guarantees are no it's like a Top Shot kind of thing where like they don't really care about the settlement guards I guess well you know but like a brand new blood the problem the problem like settlement guarantees is one thing if you want to give up settlement guarantees fine but like you got to hook yourself into the rest of the ecosystem like there's Network effects to ethereum yeah for sure oh God this website's soaked the content blockchain look it's a start though and I had never heard of this thing no I've never heard of this thing either it's it's a start though and you know there are more experiments coming down the pike including this one from Will Wright did you ever play uh games like the Sims or SimCity or anything oh totally oh Sim Tower remember okay I I did The Sims I did SimCity uh did you play The Sims or were you just like me and you just made the houses over and over to make the houses and then you make the pool and then you like put the Sims in the pool and then you remove the ladder that was my favorite thing to do wow that's pretty massive yeah uh real David it says the AI uh one of my friends would uh put them into a room with a toilet and a computer and make them write books to make money and that's the only thing that they can do how many people just to do like weird dark things like torture their sins yeah anyway anyways beside the point well right the uh the great um leader Behind The Sims all of the you know SimCity all those games he's now making a blockchain game um he is excited about including nfts but is also kind of down on nfts I think there's a quote here where he says I don't really want to be in the business of selling nfts so that's off the table Will Wright says emphasizing his interest is in blockchain's ability to allow for secure transactions between players um yeah pretty cool though makes sense have a Legendary game developer starting to uh do things on chain as well yeah I would imagine just like we we talk about how stable coins are just way better than like Bank transfers PayPal venmo the ux of stable coins is just way better and I think that's what he's leaning into here he's like he can just make transactions happen between players without having to sign up for some third-party intermediaries no banks just like you know change like users and transactions matches imagine like a Sim economy that'd be pretty badass oh my God it's like you have cities you have metaverse economy yeah I mean you have this whole simulated economy but it's actually real like it actually has some kind of like real economic ties I bet someone like will Ray could do that sounds like a metaverse bro Bitcoin salvadorians they are have been surveyed recently of course uh Salvador El Salvador uh and uh the leader of El Salvador recently adopted and legalized Bitcoin as legal tender in fact kind of made it mandatory in sort of a weird authoritarian move but actually 77 percent of salidorians surveyed think the government should stop spending public money on bitcoin what's your take on this yeah I feel like it shouldn't come as a surprise when El Salvador which you know has a lot of room for improvement I'm assuming uh as a country where and like all the citizens are like hey uh instead of buying Bitcoin can you invest in public infrastructure I mean I feel like that's a pretty simple take to have as a citizen of a country yeah I mean what is bitcoin actually doing to help the lives of el salvadorians right that'd be the question right I would be asking as a citizen obviously and uh Kelly just seems to be about talking about how great Bitcoin is and like popping the prize being part of that kind of the in-group of Bitcoin uh yeah well he took his laser eyes off a couple months ago so maybe that's diminishing bear Market does that it removes laser eyes yeah um FDX they could launch their own stable coin maybe via partnership says Sam bankman freed it doesn't surprised me David he saw beating the USD in the market section gaining on usdc every major crypto bank has got to have a stable coin don't they to enter this world 100 and like FTX is so big that like it doesn't they don't even have to try super hard to make their stable coin competitive right they'll just Brute Force what does that mean which is fine we're gonna just have tons of uh crypto bank backed Staples yeah I think every single crypto bank will have its unstable I mean which is which follows the history of banks right like that's kind of how Banks started is that before there was like Universal unit of accounts like there were individual banknotes yeah and that's what yeah USC is the banknote of coinbase busd is the banknote of binance FTX needs this is by the way uh you know people say bankless hates regulation or D5 people hate no this is a great spot for regulation we should have some uh regulation around centralized custodian stable coins like this to make sure that they are fully backed make sure that they are audited to make sure that you know kind of the rules do apply because where there is centralization there needs to be some regulation sand Bank freed said this he's kind of hinting at it we certainly could we know how to do it but I think you'll be hearing from something from us on that topic in the not too distant future so uh yeah it's definitely coming definitely happening what else might be coming his Twitter working on a wallet prototype that supports crypto deposit and withdrawal definitely a far deviation away from you know 240 characters but who do I know what do I need yeah I think this would be amazing I think uh it'd be really cool to see Twitter what would you do though uh I would deposit and withdrawal I don't know [Laughter] move for Twitter right Elon is um I I think it's completely official now I saw a picture of him entering Twitter headquarters with a kitchen sink and um I think uh the kitchen sink by the way just means I think he's just saying um you know I'll throw in the kitchen sink at this deal the deal seems to be done and Elon is uh crypto very crypto pilled he's a little strangely Doge killed I guess failed yeah but like he's very cryptopilled might be a little joke yeah me that is generous what do you think Elon thinks about crypto I don't know we should get him on Elon don't don't play this clip in the ass so you get him on he'll never come on it's just looking like this this is interesting David uh Elizabeth Warren others are mad that crypto is hiring a whole bunch of former government employees there's been I believe that our fault 200 government officials have left their Public Service posts to move into senior positions at crypto stock startups the lawmakers say so wow Senator sounds like some Senator Warren AOC and others append a slew of letters on October 24th to a number of U.S financial uh Watchdogs about this um here's what's interesting okay I think there's like I think there's one take which is like oh this is another industry buying Regulators right we've seen this before we're gonna see it again revolving door bad thing right that's one take and there might be some truth to that I'm sure like their their paychecks are better in crypto right and some people are leaving for the money that's for sure the other side of it and this is the side that goes often goes unacknowledged I think by those in government who are very anti-crypto is like maybe just maybe the good people are leaving because they're sick of the incumbent protection racket that many regulate regulatory agencies are running and they want to find a better way to serve the public because crypto is a public good as well do you know it's like I think there's this hubris among some in government not all in government that the only public good that can be created must come from Regulators government and government itself right and that could not be further from the truth yeah it sounds like coercion so I don't know I don't know what the take is here it's like um but I think a lot of people are are like look if I was if I was working in SEC and I saw this sort of thing um Gary Gensler was doing which is like outside of mission I would say it's not being Financial you know transparency it's not protecting the interests of of retail investors I'd be frustrated by that and I'd like want to go back to the mission I feel like part of that mission is fulfilled with open finance right it's like transparent on-chain fully auditable completely permissionless uh this is a way to to protect the people and uh disrupt the banks right there's so many wins I think for a lot of these lawmakers and Regulators in crypto if they could just see it but uh that that is another take on what's going on what do you think my take here is now you care about the revolving door what about the revolving door for like the banking industry like the that's the bigger deal that where like that's where the corruption happens crypto is literally the uncomfortable side anyways I'm like that's my take uh now now yeah also you're just jealous that we're having fun yeah well um I mean this this podcast has been fun so far David it's really it's been really fun you remember uh Kyle Roche Ryan remember that guy uh is that the sketchy crypto lawyer dude that's the guy yeah the guy with the who denied the claims that he had a formal relationship with Avalanche laps Ava labs to basically Sue and kneecap all their competition anyways uh he is starting a new law firm uh and so uh the claim here is that he's starting it because he kind of has to because his like name has been so incredibly tainted that he had to start a new law firm because his old Law Firm was like named Roche in Partners or whatever anyways um starting a new law firm that's great I mean I could use a lawyer but probably not probably not Kyle sounds like the right lawyer for Bitcoin excuse me you yeah for me I'm uh you know as a YouTube influencer I'm pretty excited about lawsuits generally um all right on the releases side of things sound Market is releasing I believe their first maybe secondary market for buying their music secondary Market yeah okay what's this what are we looking at oh that's what it is yeah we're looking at the first the first first ever secondary market for music entities with a zero percent listing fee so congrats to sound have you bought one yet I have not bought a music because I I don't I don't I don't want to I'm not like here to like speculate on music nfts as soon as my favorite bands start listing music nfts I will start by I think I want it but that's that's the point I think I want to do one just to test though if anyone has any good artist recommendations for like a first a test just like not you know maybe not an artist I'm super serious about but just like to test I'd like to uh see what it's like see what the experience is like sure I I think you're supposed to find an artist that you like the music that's a lot of work and I'm I'm gonna make a hot take Ryan that the uh music that you like and the people musicians that are minting music nfts those Venn diagrams might not overlap a lot I can't should I be offended by that it's a bankless nation I'm also speaking from personal experience like my my Boomer taste and music where like I listen to uh you know the greatest The Sheepdogs Bruce Springsteen and The Sheepdogs The Sheepdogs which 99.9 of listeners are not familiar with but they are like a perfect intersection of The Black Keys and the Grateful Dead and they're from Canada and they wear Canadian uh they wear uh Canadian tuxedos at the time they will not be inventing music and if he's any time he's got some rocker rocker music tastes uh it's pretty good uh socket scan what are they up to socket scan this is Socket dot Tech uh formerly known as mover uh have introduced socket scan.io the first multi-chain explorer uh and so I think we've talked about socket a few times but if you have asset a on chain a and you want asset B on chain B socket scan will obfuscate every single possible route to get that trade and hop done and just make it super easy for you and so they've released socket scan to see all the various ways that you can go across the multi-chain ecosystem um pretty cool uh full disclosure both David and I are Angel Investors on that one you can see disclosures in the show notes as always uh David it's jobs time this is our jobs opportunity to tell you on a weekly basis we're not going to stop doing this you need to get a job in crypto so think about your job right now is it in crypto if the answer to that question is No it should be that's something to change yeah and you got to go to bank I know we have a special job actually I would like to highlight Ryan so if you can go ahead and click that first drop script right here scriptwriter at bank so this person this uh job is going to work very closely with yours truly uh and if you think that you can write the easiest and most digestible explanations of what is ethereum what is defy what are nfts what are smart contracts uh anyone Ryan can explain these things using 90-minute podcasts that's easy uh it's harder it's harder to do it in 5 to 15 minutes in just a thousand to two thousand words so you know the meme is like it's actually hard to write to communicate in less words and this is what we are looking for so if you think that you can explain in uh what is defy in a short way as possible in a way that you would see me expressing this on our new YouTube channel uh write a script I write for your preferred what is blank about crypto and send it over and if it's a good script if I like it we might hire you as a formal scriptwriter to start banging these things out these are going to be the videos that the world sees because Bankers can explain things better than anyone that's what we do and the idea of these is what is ethereum doesn't get the the you know 10 15 20 000 views but gets 200 000 plus views on YouTube and becomes the canonical videos for how to explain ethereum crypto nfts D5 smart contracts to the world so that's my challenging call to action if you guys want to work with me writing scripts uh write a script send my help and if I like it we'll help us help onboard the world guys we also got some things from a swell Network a senior smart contract engineer another senior front and this dancing is different in agreements it's way better uh senior back-end engineer swell again uniswap Labs director of product management for platform uniswap Labs developer relations lead unit swap Labs as well senior front end engineer open hedge needs an engineer optimism ahead of security optimism and infrastructure engineer for devops rabbit hole coin shift I could go on all of the listings are there for you on bagless.palot.com jobs you can find all of those things guys we got a lot more coming up David what's happening next uh what's coming up next we've got some questions from the nation which I think are pretty good this week and also some hot takes from crypto Twitter and Beyond so make sure to like And subscribe to these videos wherever you are listening to them and we will get to all of these hot questions and cool takes from crypto Twitter as soon as we get back from some of these fantastic messages from these fantastic sponsors sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for your users sequence is a smart wallet and it's the easiest most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the web 3 world multi-chain support nft display and users can buy sfts nfts and crypto directly with a credit or debit card for developers sequence is the Plug and Play platform for web 3 games and apps their apis let you bring nfts sfts and tokens into your game or application in a sequence relayer enables gasless transactions for your users sequins already power some of the best web3 games like skyweaver nft projects like cool cats and marketplaces like Nifty Swap and sequence is compatible with all the evm chains including ethereum polygon binance smart chain arbitrum optimism and Avalanche so go to sequence.xyz banklist to start building or speak with a sequence team today if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web for your world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network all right guys last part of the roll up Dave's getting real real sweaty in that green uh spandex he's wearing um these are the questions from the nation if you have a question for the nation make sure you send that in Via Twitter the ask goes out every Wednesday you could reply get your question into the show this question from claudia.eth claudia.eth you often mentioned that you participate as advisors at certain projects would love to know how this cooperation actually works in your case and with what aspects do you usually help these projects Dave do you want to take that yeah sure so we're advisors for three main projects uh optimism ZK sync and mycelium uh it's different for every single team um and our I mean our main skill I would say is just narrative and storytelling and getting the teams to get what they are building into kind of what I was saying with these the the scriptwriter into as few words as possible that are Punchy and like can stick inside of people's brains I think we're really good at memes uh and so what optimism is doing when optimism explains what they're what they're doing they'll take like you know a very technical route that takes a lot of time and then Ryan and I kind of understand it at a much higher level that I think is more understandable by a broader set of people and so we'll help them kind of craft and just storytell what they're doing so it's more digestible and more receptive to a wider audience which helps on a number of fronts you know broad just understanding but also it attracts more talents tracks more developers so I'd say that's one of the main skills that we do but then also just General connections advice just like lessons from the history of crypto that we've been to sometimes company a wants to be connected to Company B and we know both of these companies so that's just super easy for us um but it's it's also just Case by case so every single team that we advise has their own needs and Ryan and I are generally scaled a wide variety of skills and so we just help them out anything you would add to that I would not add anything else to that David uh other than I'm also an advisor for polygon too just for sake of completion oh yeah yeah uh here's a question could a group of ultra wealthy people Bezos musk Etc team up and buy a bunch of eth stake it and take over the network how safe is the ethereum network from China if China makes Quantum Computing work could they attack Bitcoin so a lot of questions about like yeah three questions what if uh safety security yeah what if crypto really gets attacked by either super wealthy people or by nation state level actors what is ethereum's defense mechanism for these types of attacks right uh okay so let's start with the first question could a group of ultra wealthy people Bezos musk Etc team up and buy a bunch of each stake it and take over the network it's really that last part take over the network that is like doing a lot of work here what does that mean are they staking buying their ease staking it and they have like over 66 of all eat staked well if they just do that that's fine uh because they are not like doing anything malicious uh what I think we're concerned about is if they like start doing malicious things uh maybe they if they have 66 percent they can do crazy stuff they can Mint new ether they can censor certain people certain contracts they basically can dictate things well that's where we go into a user activated soft work uh and so this is this is kind of like the nuclear threat but if you're telling me that ultra wealthy people are going to buy 66 of all ether not all ether but all staked ether uh and then stake it to the network to influence it this is when we would the cool thing about proof of stake is you can actually identify these people and their influence over ethereum and so you can say hey this ethereum address is doing things that are misaligned with the community and we are going to the first thing we would do is we would probably just kick them out of the validator pool say hey get out of here stop staking uh and if they come back into the validator pool and start taking again then we would probably do a user activated soft Fork where we actually uh social slash their ether this is the the nuclear threat the the idea is to never do this but if somebody or a group of people have such a high amount of ether this is kind of our only choice as a community and this is why it does not matter who owns what percentage of ether at the end of the day there's always the nuclear option of the user activated soft Fork the social slashing event to take over any power which is why ethereum Always is ultimately settled by layer Zero by the people uh and so if if Chads if like super wealthy people are doing things that the community doesn't like the community always has the final say and that is because of user activated soft work and I would say that also answers the second question how safe is ethereum network from China uh and if China makes Quantum Computing work could they attack Bitcoin generally like the whole threat is that Quantum Computing is coming it's going to threaten Bitcoin it's going to threaten externally owned addresses on ethereum Quantum Computing is generally a threat to the current state of crypto and this is why we in the ethereum world we are going to be pivoting away from uh these e d s c a signature schemes that are externally owned accounts we're going to have to create smart contract wallets that don't do these things we already have the solution for this in ethereum land Bitcoin I don't think has a solution towards the quantum Computing threat and that's been one of the big concerns behind Bitcoin uh and so if China does make a Computing Network work could they attack Bitcoin what they would do is they would be be able to break the signature schemes of like super old wallets right like wallets that mined Bitcoin in 29 2009 2010 2011. they could they could break a wallet basically they could brute force their way into finding the private keys for our wallets uh this is also the same threat for ethereum but we have a solution for this in theory and Bitcoin doesn't need to do a hard Fork to prevent this from happening and I don't know how I see that happening um uh watch the moon math episode with Justin Drake our first ever episode just with Justin Drake to learn more about this I think one other practical um picture is like if you're trying to if you have to buy 66 of staked eth it's going to cost a lot of money uh and it's gonna make The Ether price it's going to make the ether price go up I mean if you're buying that much eth I mean expect to be buying at the end of that I don't know eat that like thirty thousand dollars or more yeah because it's good it's gonna shoot up that high there's not that much Supply in the market to make this kind of a purchase so you'd have to covertly do it that's the cool thing is like if you want to attack ethereum what you you have to do is you have to make all current ether holders extremely well yeah that's like one of the big difference I think they're way better honestly if we got into nation state attacks episode they're a way better nation state attacks in my opinion like to be much more subversive that's how they'd actually attack uh attack it like something like stuxnet you know behind the scenes get something in the code somehow start contributing the project it'd be like that not not this kind of Economics also jailing a lot maybe uh what what is this question will Ryan grow of voluminous Stash from movember I personally believe this might end the bear Market at least we should try I think he's on to something unfortunately David uh the mustache is not in the future it's never been nothing voluminous it would just be something that is just like you know kind of prepubescent I think almost in terms of its thickness have you ever tried I have it's just it's not something that anyone really wants to see to be honest I just don't have the I I disagree I think she needs to see it well this is a taste of it what are you looking at today one more of this that is like a Gandalf here bro yeah it could be shaved it could be taken in David should we get to some of the takes some takes some takes you want to read this take from Jake yep take from Jake contrary to widespread belief traditional Finance is not safe for consumers or investors sure it's dressed up to look that way but it's neat and tidy image is a thin veil for institutionalized discrimination exclusion and exploitation crypto offers a different approach traditional Finance is just institutionalized discrimination exclusion and exploitation because it's been institutionalized we think it's normal that is the take from Jake and uh crypto is definitely a different approach to this much more credibly neutral system without that exclusion exploitation and discrimination if we get it right what are your thoughts on this yeah I think one of the reasons why crypto gets so much Flack is that all of our like mistakes and errors and hacks are out in the open yeah like we don't have the luxury of being a centralized company with like walls around it to hide all of our decisions backroom deals are harder to like there's really no back room on chain exactly yeah which is which is good which is good uh what's this take this is a this is a um poll that you put up and this is yeah tweeting out who pays for security in Bitcoin he has three options here miners number one transactors number two and holders number three and the percentages from this poll came in very interestingly um yeah so I before we read out the percentages and also the right answer I want I want listeners to take a moment and reflect on who they think there's a correct answer here who pays for security in Bitcoin where does Bitcoin get its security from miners transactors are you asking 100 of the security are you asking for like the vast majority of the security those are different yeah yeah the vast majority yeah there's one answer that it really sticks above that there's an answer David really wants well it's pretty Justified miners trans actors or holders where does Bitcoin get its security from okay so my my gut would be Mike my default answer to this would be holders of course but I'd also probably put an asterisk there around some of these other things maybe maybe miners would have an Asterix for me and I could explain why but what is the correct answer the correct answer is where does Bitcoin Source its energy is from holders from hold Source it's energy not an opinion this is a hundred percent fat Source its energy do you mean like it's economic energy you're talking about it's like it's actual um it's actual security defense is not energy I mean we say that as a shortcut but it's actual security defenses is also Capital it's just like pure money right to overcome it's an economic security that's what you mean when you say power these are crypto economic systems they are secured through economics so people that answered minors okay so the the numbers for who answered this poll also stuck out to me so who pays for security in Bitcoin 21 of people said miners 25 said transactors and 33 said holders and so while the majority the biggest one was the correct answer holders it's not that these numbers are way too close so who pays for security in Bitcoin miners do not pay for security they are the people that you pay for security they are the people being paid for security they are profiting off of the people that pay for security that's why they exist why would minors pay for security it's their business model to supply security that Bitcoin purchases from the miners so that that we can cross that off and 21 of people said miners which means 21 got the opposite of the answer the inverse answer the other the other both transactors and holders are technically correct because the transaction fee when you pay a transaction fee for Bitcoin that goes to the miners and so that is a transfer from transactors to minors uh and 25 of people said transactors but we'll pull off some stats here in a second but the real answer Ryan is holders coming in at 33 which was the biggest answer but it's the between the two Miners and transactors the the more people got this answer wrong than correct and so what we are looking at here on coinmetrics are the two sources of money that is being paid towards miners for minors to protect Bitcoin and we are looking at 29 or 19.5 million dollars in Daily issuance that got paid to bitcoin miners that is minted versus 275 000 of total transaction fees from transactors paid to minors so that is 19 and a half million dollars of new issuance versus 275 000 of fees from like 95 or something uh that is 98 90.7 of Bitcoin security came from issues which is inflation which means that holders are the people who are being diluted who are being inflated are the people that are bearing the costs of Bitcoin security and so this is why the answer is unequivocally well excuse me not unequivocally the the answer is 98.7 correct that Bitcoin holders are the people that pay that subsidize for Bitcoin security holders pay for security and the ratio of transaction fees to issuance is one point three percent so Bitcoin is 1.3 paid uh Securities paid for by transact okay so so a couple things so one thing to to think about is the analogy of kind of the nation state right it's like who pays for the security of America and the answers are like military or taxpayers right income taxpayers excise taxpayers that's kind of the breakdown and of course the answer is not the military because they don't need to pay for security the answer always is who pays for security for America it's the taxpayers the taxpayers are always paying it's taxpayers and bonds and bondholders anybody who's holding the money is essentially paying an inflation tax but let me ask you Dave like so why are you so passionate about this technicality here like why does it matter so much are you is it just because like there's such a delta in terms of like uh people don't know what the right answer is and you're sort of disturbed by that or you think that a lot more education needs to be done this is a lack of Education as to how these systems the economics of them the economics of it right and and so like last weekend I put out some tweets that uh the bitcoiners really didn't like I said like the Bitcoin BTC the asset does not have a relationship with energy Bitcoin does but BTC the asset does not and like just some tweets that would really go against Bitcoin or narratives and like I was received tons of like hate from Bitcoin to the Bitcoin Maxes which is normal for me but like even like other people are like uh why can't you know Bitcoin and ethereum just get along and like the reason why I feel compelled to do like do this is because the Bitcoin maximless narratives are wrong about Bitcoin they are telling a story of about Bitcoin that is not what Bitcoin is and uh like Bitcoin is great it is fantastic it is truly a Marvel to this universe The Narrative that Bitcoin Maximus say about Bitcoin is completely Divergent from that and so when people say like oh Bitcoin ethereum why can't we just get along I would love to get along with people that tell the true story about what Bitcoin is but the Bitcoin maximalist narratives are not that are not what's being told and that is what grinds my gears Ryan and why I feel compelled to again this is about education about who pays for security in Bitcoin it is holders it is issuance it is inflation and that is a truth that we have to swallow as bitcoiners maxless you just got clapped back by a dick butt and I don't know how that feels but uh that's what just happened in case you were wondering uh here's a good take included this last moving really important one I think really interesting one from Giancarlo Elon is pushing Twitter towards crypto Zuck is pushing meta towards crypto Reddit is going all in on crypto you're seeing these things collectively that's billions of users it's just hard to overstate how much of the internet is about to change in the next few years that my friends is a bullish tweet and I think the bull case for for uh crypto web2 is coming on board maybe not Apple but all of these social media platforms know that they have to support a digital property rights system inside of their platforms and that digital property rights system is crypto it's effectively it's ethereum it's Bitcoin these types of blockchain networks super bullish man anything to add to that um I'm I'm on board you know what I'm on board too and I gotta ask you what you are excited about what are you bullish on this week David man I think I think you can guess what's coming I already gave a little bit of a pitch for crypto think butts but what I'm bullish on Ryan are crypto tick bites uh and one of the reasons why is because crypto dick butts first were a meme before and so this is like the nft of the meme the meme has already been around and so the nft version of the meme is also going to be around uh so that's my first bullish crypto dick by thing it's like it's all like dick butts have been a meme not just on the internet like dick butts were drawn as cave paintings back in like thousands and thousands of years ago and so the nft version of like what is a very it's in crypto dick butts man are in our DNA I swear to God yeah yeah this is this is right uh and so of course the nft crypto dickbots is also going to be around for a very long time the other cool thing about crypto dick bus is the lore behind them every good Community every good cult needs a little more and the lore about like how dick crypto dick Bots are just like searching for their long-lost home uh around the planet and they need to find out their home which is uh the island of Gooch Island and so I am bullish Ryan on crypto dick butts because I am one wow that was uh that was a heck of a shout out for uh this community how many how many do you own David I own two crypto tickets okay so here's here's your challenge they are in my disclaimers and disclosures get get me to buy one What's it gonna take to get me bullish on these things because right now I am not bullish at all on these things do you want one with or without glasses wait are you in character out no I'm sorry I'm I'm me I'm just me David I'm I'm really excited about glasses right now it's just something something about last week just switched me onto the glasses thing uh yeah I'll find you yourself though that could be nothing it's just like it's strange man I don't know like they all come around strange okay well David David's into this that's exciting I'm excited that you're excited I'm not quite there yet I'm excited Ryan what are you excited about that uh you know what I'm excited about is um bankless Brazil all right so dude you and I were on a podcast with the bankless Brazil earlier this week and um this is a community that started from the original Bakers podcast and the newsletter in Brazil and there's a Portuguese version of Bank listen podcast forum and newsletter Forum you can see all the details they have Discord everything else uh they have um they have merch and we're talking to the bankless Brazil folks uh and it just struck me how Global the crypto movement is and and how Global the the bankless movement is right so they've been experiencing like 20 to 30 percent monthly growth not annualized growth monthly growth grow growth in their community and it's because they were saying is Brazil the people of Brazil are hungry for crypto right now I mean we think inflation is bad in the US it's like what eight percent or something do you know the Brazilian uh currency the real has lost 90 of its value relative to the dollar not relative to CPI this is relative to the dollar so you got to stack the Dollar on top of 90 right inflation inflation on inflation it's stacking and so this community has built kind of uh from the ground up public goods funded they're doing like local community uh meetups they're talking about how like the crypto economy has allowed them essentially to um a shelter uh some of their wealth and some of their economic opportunities the ability to log in from the internet from anywhere in Brazil and work for a crypto company a web 3 company get paid in stable coins get paid in you know assets like eth um this is so transformational I think and it's not just happening in Brazil did you know um eight million people in Turkey are using crypto right now and so all of this you know struck me as sometimes we're in the US we get stuck in kind of the the US bubble regulatory battle against the banks it's a battle battle uh against Wall Street that sort of thing you know where I think some of this could come from the Revel solution of crypto is emerging countries and Emerging Markets where they just straight like leapfrog over Wall Street it's like we don't need Wall Street we don't need U.S European Banks right we have ethereum we have a bankless money system and we could build our financial infrastructure on that so I'm really excited to see where crypto goes and develops in Emerging Markets um I think sometimes in the U.S when we hear about crypto and going bankless we just like we get complacent about it it's like my bank's good enough like it kind of works it works okay this is not the case in places in in South America and in places like turkey where inflation's ravaging you and then after inflations Capital controls you can't get your money in the banking system none of this is is a very digital uh and so the need in emerging countries is uh is very strong and I'm just bullish about the worldwide bankless community that podcast made me so yeah the uh the the lesson I think I really took away from the podcast with them is that um the sense of urgency uh out of Brazil uh and I I think that's probably also accurate there was that a report Out of Africa not too long ago from the chain Alice's Africa report saying like crypto just has unprecedented levels of adoption in Africa from payments and just like access to Dollars um I I think like like we definitely have like this U.S privilege where eight percent inflation's bad and that's causing a lot of just like you know bad times like hard times for a lot of uh Americans but I I it's uh it's on it's just different versus the sense of urgency that's coming out of places like Brazil where it bad is an understatement uh and the the amount of urgency of getting off of the dollar system and getting on to something that can actually not uh destroy Capital along the way for people's lives uh is is much more than we experience here in the United States and so the the idea that crypto adoption like base principles crypto adoption of going back to our roots of store of value and payments is still like still huge for most of the world and we forget about that here in America while we talk about things like crypto difference Ryan comes in and saying well what about Bank of Brazil and I'm like well you know well I think this listeners uh you know tick tick bites had their place too you know like fun games as well but yeah this is all part of a a very important Mission and it gave me that that worldwide scope I mean the bankless Brazil folks were just like hey for people in America crypto scene is an investment I feel like for here it's like a way out it's like a necessary it's not an investment we need this it's a tool it's a life in order to in order to live and survive in our economy and that that just struck me uh so man you're making bit boy look rude it's just a generic crypto influencer David there's no there's no I don't know who bit away is um all right so we get to uh what's up the name of the week uh you know I I stumbled across this this is floating around do we need a meme of the week this week I'm a dick butt you're a crypto influencer well let's do this then it's uh AI tweet generator so uh this is an AI it's a tweet Hunter dot IO that will generate tweets from from any uh popular Twitter account that you want so uh do you want a AI to generate a pop tweet let's see what it looks like uh I ran a trial uh we can't but I got the AI earlier to generate a vitalik tweet um do you want to read this vitalik.eath kind of says to anyone who's working on an ethereum 2.0 project one your goal should be create a protocol that is as safe as possible and maximally open to your hard Fork strategy should be no hard Forks uh that's a good take wait your hard Fork strategy should be no hard for because that's not something metallic would say David well okay so this is an age so this isn't actually metallic but I'll go ahead and try and interpret this the the the goal should be to answer and align with your community in a way that doesn't incentivize that works and by the way it incentivize do you know he does the asterisks thing where he like puts like the Bold it's kind of like the emphasis yeah I also do that too because because the AI caught that I agree with Goal number one that that makes sense I could see him saying this but and working on an ethereum 2.0 project he doesn't say ethereum yeah right that doesn't say that and then the second one is your hard for our strategy should be no hard forks no you would never say that yeah I I don't even know if that makes sense anyways I think we got one this is uh this is one that it generated from this one made me laugh so so this is the Ryan Sean Adams AI otherwise uh the Tweet reads eth is 50 down not because eth is a bad asset not because eth is a bad store of value not because he's the best or about it not because Heath is a bachelor of value not because eth is a bachelor of value not because he says a bad sword value not okay this is uh this is weird because I can see myself writing this shy was gonna go on saying not because it's a bad sore value as long as the Twitter tweet should I just like feed this into you like my uh my Twitter like just these are your tweets right not my tweets these are actually your tweets I would not eat this more than 50 down okay I could see that I would say myself saying some of these lines you would absolutely structure see how it goes we all start using these Outsource all right that's it man we I think we have a Moment of Zen this week should you tee that up so you're gonna hear a Moment of Zen right after you also hear Ryan give his regular risks of course risks and disclaimers crypto all of it is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot it's for the people trying to tell you this is about money for me it's me I'm here fighting [Music] [Music] [Music] who does [Music]
