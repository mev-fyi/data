foreign [Music] ation how you doing on the Pod today we have stani from Ave and lens protocol talking about web3 social so basically Sunny is the founder of lens protocol which is a composable and decentralized social graph it lets creators take their content with them wherever they want to go in the digital Garden of the decentralized internet lens is a protocol that allows you to have a permissionless non-custodial social media profile and with lens protocol the idea is that you're in control you own your profile where you use it how you use it even how you monetize it so um that means you have the power over your content it's all right there as an nft in your wallet and this is kind of a reaction to web 2 and the idea is the digital identity and your content should be yours not Facebook's not twitters not my spaces um what would be true if you owned your own content owned your own social graph owned your own data the idea behind this episode and the really I think interesting and beautiful conversation with with stani is the big implications of this is that it allows us to bootstrap identity in web 3 uh allows us to create Financial assets out of our posts and things that we're primarily thought of as social in the web 2 boom it's easier to build applications the network effect of Facebook is not massive everyone uses Facebook because everyone else uses Facebook and it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy what would it what would have to be true for web 3 projects to build a network effect together where everyone uses lens protocol and so therefore everyone uses lens protocol and anyone can build on top of that if you're a builder in web 2 starting a social network you have to start at zero and compete with Facebook which has billions of users but on lens protocol in web 3 you could start with the entire lens social graph as something that you could build on top of and I think that's pretty profound found if you've studied how Network affects her foundational to building applications in the network page and how web3 social could bring new users to the space so I think the big implications here are identity bootstrapping financializing assets making it easier to build things by starting with a network effect and bringing new users to the space for web 3 social vitalik himself has identified web 3 social as a thing that exists in web3pat over past defy at his 2021 etcc talk and lens protocol it seems like it's the biggest project that's making it happen right now or at least one of the biggest projects that's making it happen so we talk about the implications of that we talk about Sony's world view we talk about uh all all of the things to do with web3 social and in a world in which all of human attention is aggregated on these social networks or at least a lot of the digital attention that people have I think lens protocol has a ton of upside so I'm really excited to talk about it and sunny is the the ultimate guy to talk to you about this stuff so I think it was a really good episode and I think that you'll enjoy this podcast episode with stani of Ave and lens protocol enjoy coordination the world

excited to talk about lens protocol so tell us why you've been working on lens protocol tell us what lens protocol is tell us why you're excited about lens protocol yeah um a lot of interesting questions and I think um giving some background story so with um for the past years we've been creating a lot of accessibility with the other protocol mainly access to uh Fair financial markets that are globally working and transparent and um I think that's what is has been the benefit of defy that you can access from anywhere and you don't have that kind of a limitation into something where everyone is part of in a permissionless fashion with lens protocol we are looking to actually give access to your own um social presence social identity and your own social network so effectively that's whatever you um create um in in Social presence should belong to you your profile and it shouldn't be locked in a particular platform but everything you do in any Social Capital you create on a platform or actually protocol you should always own that and be able to carry whatever applications you're using and that is kind of like the the vision that lens is trying to solve got it it kind of feels from the outside like like your second act like you kind of accomplished what you came to do with Ave and now web3 social is the New Frontier uh so it's it's neat to see you to carry that momentum and and skills into web3 social which I think vitalik identified at ECC 2021 is one of the next big opportunities in web 3 Beyond defy so that literally traces your career Arc yeah I mean it's I I think with the work with Ava we haven't been uh we haven't finished where uh decentralized Finance uh should be or where the other protocol should be but it's in a healthy position where the protocol itself is governed by the community and not only there's uh decentralized governance but there's multiple Community contributors actually um contributing to build the protocol as well um so it's it's kind of like an interesting moment to take some of the resources and actually build something which brings uh more users into the web trade space yeah well I think the you know the the the problems with web 2 social media are kind of well stated in many other places but I'm wondering if we can just talk really quickly about what you see as the problem with web 2 social and how web3 social can solve some of that stuff yeah I think most importantly uh uh when we look into the history of how uh social media was born is that you know we got this very big accessibility uh through internet so I was um you know born and raised um with the technology and with the internet you know playing games um online such as Counter-Strike um just reading information across globally by someone else that has created uh that content in what uh web 2 social media um actually did it made it very easy to anyone to to create content and to distribute and connect across the globe and what happened in later in this part is that because of the efficiencies many of these platforms became uh very centralized um and meaning that effectively we created networks uh which upon we're relying uh for at the moment and with web 360 social what happens is that actually you really aren't creating uh the benefit only for uh for these applications but uh the whole identity is built um upon uh your own social graph and just taking an example when anyone is creating content let's say in tiktok or uh you're tweeting on in in Twitter um the the biggest benefit is that you know Twitter gets content liquidity and at the same time uh uses this as a network effect to then data points to know what they can actually sell or advertise to the user so the users are the product in web 3 social what we're trying to solve is that um you know actually whatever you create you should be able to affect for example and and have the control over your social presence so for example you are not locked into one particular platform but you can actually have portability in changing the Dynamics in a way where uh first time ever it's the applications and the algorithms that need to work uh for your benefit and and actually compete for your attention and making better uh outcomes because otherwise you would choose an algorithm that is uh aligned with your principles and what you're looking for and that's hard to do in web 2 social because you're logged in for example in Twitter's user experience their algorithm um and also their policies so it's about actually making that accessibility and freedom for the users and also freedom for the developers to come and contribute and build those experiences um so it seems like there's a network effect where the with these web3 social networks where all of my friends are on Twitter and so I use Twitter and so all my friends are on Twitter and it's this kind of infinite Loop that's the network effect of these profiles of these of of these networks and one of the things that's really exciting to me to me is that with lens protocol it feels like if I'm building a web 3 Social Network I can just tap into the lens protocol social network and I can start on first second or third base depending on how much of my network is already on on lens protocol and that's kind of a powerful thing that takes away the vendor lock-in that a web 2 social network would have I mean you know and lens is kind of taking on the burden of of bootstrapping its own network effect so that I as someone who's building in web3 Social don't have to and I think that that's a really powerful shelling point I think it's very drum break breaking because you can have one let's say uh profile but actually these different applications that are uh building experiences they can curate uh the the content and and affect the way that content is submitted uh into the protocol and how peers are finding each other um and connecting so for example you could use the same um the same handle uh with uh one application that is focusing on let's say um microboking and you find most interesting things there uh but with the same actual profile you could use another application that actually is um curating you the music that you might like and focusing on audio uh content and actually cross using those different data points for your behalf and you as a user can choose what you want to use so it's it's really uh it removes just is that the fact that it removes the vendor locking it just brings a lot of opportunities like what you can actually build and what the users can have because it's not any more about these platforms it's about like what opportunities we now have and what we could actually build that couldn't be done before um activities the two platforms they can keep they can be open right so let's say Twitter could have an open API but the risk is always that um you know there's applications that become bigger and might not be aligned with their business model that's why it's important to build uh social media upon open source and and open protocols like lens protocol hmm you know I forget where I heard this but I had heard that Jack dorsey's vision for Twitter was to make it into a protocol but by the time they got around to making that pivot they were already a public corporation that had all these reporting requirements that had to do for their fiduciary duty what was best for investors and when they did the analysis it wasn't best for investors for Twitter to become a decentralized protocol because they got so much ads out of having the centralized protocol and so it's interesting that there's a certain lock-in for a web 2 company when you get to a certain scale and so the innovation of building a web 3 protocol almost by definition would have to come from someone who's more web 3 native than Jack Dorsey um or at least the Jack Dorsey that was the CEO of the public corporation of Twitter so um this is I think it's it's it's cool and I'll just put a point on it by saying that you're kind of front-running Jack Dorsey on his own Vision with leads here yeah I think also like it's also it's not only me building because like the power of open protocols is that you actually have a large group of people that are contributing actively with with IPS uh with with content and and making sure that uh the the protocol is something that is aligned with the Community Values and where they want to see the web tree social going towards and I think that's a key difference between a business where you know you have uh investor pressure and you have to basically make profit at some point versus you know you're building a public good that uh the end goal is actually creating something that is scalable usable unopened opinion unopinionated um and valuable for uh the whole community so I think that's um a very big difference and and power that you get from uh these networks but also like I've I've been looking into um the the the idea of um Elon Musk playing Twitter also there was uh mentions about potential using blockchain as a way of uh empowering um the application as well and I think something that we haven't I would say maybe like mainstream doesn't see is that like how we're going towards scalability at the moment so um obviously recently with the ethereum having merged that uh affected quite a lot um in the technical perspective but there's a lot of innovation happening at the moment on layer twos which allows actually a very interesting scalability which is quite interesting for non-financial applications so I think when people are looking from more of a corporate perspective into the blockchain and how to utilize it they really are looking for the old stuff and they don't really see that we're actually working our way towards uh scaling as a whole uh community so I think that's like a kind of like a big observation I made recently hmm yeah it's interesting I mean the upside for this is quite High uh a lot of humanity spends a lot of their time on and attention on social networks and you think if you think about what is their value of that routing algorithm on social media is it is the optimization function just sell them or ads get them to buy more stuff um or could the optimization function in their feeds be forked and be used for any number of means whether it's selling more stuff or maybe using crypto to be good for the world maybe creating more public good for the world and so I just see a ton of upside as you're starting to think about scale for what lens protocol could be to the world because so much of Humanity's attention is routed in social media and I think that that number is really increasing and I think um the social media itself um being able to connect with your peers um is is very valuable for for the network itself right so that you have a means to distribute content and make the platform uh exciting place to spend time uh sharing ideas um or look for entertainment but also I think what's valuable um is actually then being able to use this uh data and and this particular building block in other parts of our lives so for example um Finance is a good example because we we've always been talking about under collateralized loans and you know how we keep working on on China environment um and something that is interesting in real world is that when you move from one country to another you really don't Port your credit ratings with you or your credit history uh but using something like the uh data that you have on chain so so the power of the blockchain is that we have verified data uh verified actions so what what it means is that you can actually prove going from one place to another that you have certain data sets that are verified and that's very valuable um utility for using um something like a social graph um as a means of other use cases than social itself and I think that's where the bigger impact comes I I believe that there's going to be like you know there's there's billions of users in Social at the moment and I think uh that's the way to get more users into web3 uh through this non-financial applications but the bigger impact is that with D5 we created Global liquidity markets and with social we can create this kind of like a more Global uh data market and and use it for the users yeah I mean you know the second season of the Greenfield podcast is all about digital identity and reputation and that's because uh you know the internet of Finance is all about transacting with counterparties and in the real world when we transact with counterparties a lot of that depends on reputation you know when I get an Uber I only want to go with an Uber driver who's doesn't have a reputation for being dangerous who isn't creepy and will get me from A to B relatively quickly and um you know so uh if we can build this network effect of reputation in web 3 and it allows us to decide a little bit more freely who we transact with then it just opens up a whole lot more use cases for web 3 and I think what's cool about lens protocol is it can be this this kind of light in the darkness that is spinning off reputational data about its its users hopefully in a privacy preserving way um and in the intersection of social media and finance I think becomes really exciting at that point because the um there's a lot of things that you can do when you combine those things I think that in web 2 those things aren't combined so there's a lot of upside there yeah I think also that um the the beauty of the lens protocol is it's that you know once you create your profile um you have a lot of choices right so you could uh effectively reflect content through your own chain transaction store it on ipfs RV or store it completely privately in cloud or you can just like create a profile have that social graph but all content happens completely off chain so like it gives gives that flexibility um for the users and developers to decide how much of data for example they want to have on on chain what kind of data points might be valuable for you and the Uber example is very cool because normally when you look at human ratings you know you have like you might have drivers with um a few thousand of stars you know but it really doesn't tell you anything uh knowing that your friend used something or their friend use a service tells you my much more than than large quantity of of rating data points and there is a kind of like an interesting study that we all humans are connected between six degrees or less meaning that for example Kevin if I if I'm your friend I follow you um and and you um for example follow um uh someone else let's say Scott and Scott doesn't follow me we're still connected with Scott for example and it's a way also to you know think about like um creating like a strong social graph that could be used in in civil resistance um and a bunch of other interesting use cases yeah I think what's interesting is that through that six degrees of relationships that you can almost view that as a a a trust Network that's growing out when you have one degree of connection with someone you have more trust than if you have two than if you have three and what are the implications of that I think you gave the example of civil resistance which obviously matters a lot for quadratic funding and the work that I've done at Bitcoin but you know we also talked about under collateralized loans earlier maybe I'd be more willing to take a risk on a loan if it's someone that I have a one degree connection with and a really close relationship with on lens protocol or lenster uh and so I think that the the possibilities of that degree of connection in that relationship kind of become very very interesting yeah exactly it's it's it's really valuable because we're able to do that um and start to use it very first time and lens protocol is just one part of identity and social graph also whatever you do and donate in git coin that's one part of the uh identity it's also a social graph what you are doing in the Dao ecosystem which tells your participating that kind of like own chain data is is part of your identity data points and then you obviously you have um uh off-chain data or or completely private data that you might have but you don't want to reveal but you want to prove which can be achieved with uh Z case so I really uh think it's it's it's more about um creating creating interesting data points um and letting the user users to choose how much they actually want to reveal and and what's valuable for them to keep publicly yeah what I love about the example that you just gave of your lens profile and your git coin uh grants contributions and it it everything informing this this this profile that that could be created of you is the plurality of the base layer of that no longer is it just your Facebook data informing your Facebook profile and identity and and in that plurality the base layer I think is is how you can come up with a diversity of lenses pun intended for how you view someone but also the fact that you can take it from site to site that this is all just available on a blockchain and anyone can access it and build a way to transport it there's no Walled Garden where where they they try to keep you in your social graph in one place and I think that the possibilities of this are it would be easy to understate them and I don't think we know exactly what the where this is all snowballing towards but it feels like it's something that's really important given how big web 2 social has got gotten to be um you know if we can all climb this network effect of building web3 social together then there's there's just going to be this beautiful blossoming of use cases in the next Market cycle that that come out of that and I'm really excited for I'm just here for it I also think about the whole kind of like the two web three social concept and I I believe what we have here is that a lot of the users are actually creating a lot of Social Capital um into the bigger platforms and whenever you're locked in your your Capital has some value obviously like you can monetize already um from that value so let's say that if you have um you know 100 000 followers in in Twitter or somewhere else you can capitalize that traffic one way or another um you can do collaborations um and and so forth indirectly but you can't actually like fake that value uh with you because it's it's part of your Social Capital and your prisons and what we want to do is that we want to actually change the idea of that that actually the social capital is is part of you and you should be able to have full control over it and according to also to the um including the monetization so for example that you should be able to decide what you can share to your audience and and monetize it directly um and and having that kind of like a direct relationship with your audience so in lens protocol what's fascinating is that all the content that you actually create the user generated content can be an asset class so for example that if I really like a post from let's say Kevin your profile let's say you have an interesting idea of refi and and basically how to make D5 more Greener for example I can collect that of course because it's culturally relevant to me or it can be some art for example or music or or whatever is the the content type and I can take it and I can collect it as an nft either as a free or you can set a fee for the collection so it's a way to directly to monetize and using user generated assets user generated content as an asset class on on lens right uh well since you used me as an example I've got to show my lens profile so follow me milwaukee.lens um and then uh yeah I mean you're kind of breaking my brain in which you talk about content as an asset class I know that you come from Ave uh and you know the language of capital it feels like in the language of information and objects you're kind of blending here and it's it's breaking my brains my brain in a couple ways and I'm not sure the exact implications of it but um the ability to monetize posts and monetize your work your your Social Capital um feels like something that follows naturally in a way in web in web 3 just given the open source Financial nature of it and given how much value Facebook captures from all of our this is like ten dollars per active user per quarter or something like that what would it look like if the users were routed that that capital and what would be possible there um and I'll also connect this with this idea from as you know I I found a git coin which is built on bitcoin grants which is built on quadratic funding it's one of Glenn Wiles ideas and um another idea in radical Market that Glenn Weil put out was uh data as labor so this idea that um you know as we're trying to figure out how to fund a uh a more digital economy and if AI is replacing work what if we viewed everyone's data emissions online as their labor and started monetizing that work and it to me that connects back to what you said about nfts and um and and monetizing your content is that is that there's maybe an opportunity to provide an income for people through the thing the things that they do in their web 3 their web3 social so that that gets really exciting for me and it's it's neat that um you know if that happens then I think that we'll be in the same sister portfolio of Glenn Weil ideas uh of of helping the world out in green pilling the world just from different angles I definitely think because like the um you know the the current state is in social media that we produce a lot of data we produce a lot of content uh which is value it might be informative educative it might be entertaining there's some sort of a Content that we're producing uh on a daily uh basis and it's it's it's extremely actually like it's relatively hard to monetize it because you know you're not really uh paid for the data that you provide um in social media platforms so the idea of we never when we were building lens protocol we never kind of like um like monetization wasn't our like one of the main things we're trying to solve so monetization is something that we started to think about like what if we actually created a couple of ways to monetize for the for the users um and the creators directly on the protocol level and that's where we added the idea of what if everything you produce today as content um can be an nft for example and and users can collect it and why it's uh interesting is that today what what nft is proved is that creators especially digital artists they have direct uh way to go to their communities with nfts and to their audiences and and create create a community around their work and now the same is happening a bit with music and fds um that you see music NXT is being collected and for me this isn't that new idea because I collect vinyls so I collect physical copies of music that I can hear pretty much anywhere where I you know want so like I'm actually when it comes to Art music um or even expanding the idea to content I'm not actually paying for the the digital good I'm actually paying to support the artist to ensure that the artists can continue creating things um and also a reward for that creativity that that affects my mind and I think that's where the groundbreaking uh thinking happens that you know maybe we don't need IP anymore maybe we actually have on-chain verified data on-chain commercial rights a new ways to to create monetization and Empower these um creators and not just only musicians but anyone who creates even memes um could monetize and we already have examples where retroactively we as a community have both um the Dodge Coin the Dodge uh dog meme uh the Nyan cat meme um and the Dodge was I think was traded at for uh nellian so we went retroactively and rewarded those creators and tokenized those memes but imagine if you can do that on spot um right there as you create that content and it can be traded back and forth between the community members and and the economy it could actually create um on top of it that could be very exciting hmm yeah the implications of this are are really quite vast and you know I I'm wondering if there's any other sort of non-obvious things you know as someone who's been thinking about this for for it seems like six months or or a year maybe more um what are the other non-obvious uh things that are implied from from web3 social you know if you if you take lenses current growth and you you sort of uh look at what it looks like when it's 10 or 100x bigger than it than it is what are the other kind of Behavioral phenomena or societal phenomena that we're gonna see when web3 social starts taking off I think I think like basically uh well the identity concept is something that um it becomes a stronger signal where when you have a verified social graph that's that's one of the uh ideas but basically to think about like how we get to a point where we scale is that it's because we actually it's relatively easy to to come and build applications because you don't as a developer you don't need to focus on on creating that uh social network and network effect because that kind of already exists um in every single application that is building on top of the same uh social graph they're actually growth hacking together uh more users into the social graph and it's it's the same as git coin is bringing new users D5 is bringing the users um nfts are bringing new users and people who were excited about nfts there are a lot of folks that are excited about D5 and and vice versa so it's just kind of like shows that web tree is about more of um not about creating a fascinating invite system and how you get people into your product early I don't think it's all about that it's about you know how you create a network effect where you have a ecosystem poll um for for what you're doing and how you can travel Leverage The composibility between all the different things that exist in Victory and and actually work and build together so when you have a developer who's who is building a new experience on an algorithm you already have an existing user base and you can actually help the existing user base and and the applications as well so it really becomes this um like an ecosystem Network effect than than like a application Network effect and I think that's where we will that that's the reason why we will see a lot of new things being built because you can experiment relatively easily just building a one algorithm that just focuses on Discovery um or maybe one algorithm that helps to use that data somewhere else and I think that's why we'll see a lot of interesting things Goldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's Capital to the world's growth Goldfinch focuses on real yields from real companies so you can stop worrying about the latest crypto Ponzi and start lending your usdc

powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work

just so just to summarize the implications of owning your own content owning your own social graph and owning your own data um I think the big implications of this that I've got from the conversation is that we're a bootstrapping identity in web 3 um creating sort of a bridge between financialized assets like nft and content from web 2 which has lots of implications for data as labor and monetizing content it makes it easier to build applications a network effect um where any new developer in the space can build on top of a social graph that over time will approach the size of hopefully Facebooks or twitters and that enables a lot more Innovation from the edges in web3 Social and I think that some result of all these things is bringing new users to the space and especially new users that aren't just like rich people but you know like the same thing where like Bitcoin grants has utility for you if you could only give a couple dollars lens protocol has utility for you if you just have a social life um so identity bootstrapping Financial assets Network effects climbing together and bringing new users to the space is how I would summarize kind of the last 20 minutes of our conversation is that too reductionist do you think that I got close at all yeah I think uh end of the day it's uh user acquisition into web tree the more users we have in in um on ethereum and across all the um relevant networks and Liberties what what's going to happen is that you know the the more the technology will help so it's servicing us um that have been in the space the the people are coming into this space we're still relatively small community um and I mean Defcon is drawing um every single time um and and you see like the the whole crypto Twitter expanding but it's really really small still so there is a lot of work to actually getting a lot of this um infrastructure applications use cases into the mainstream and I think that's very valuable and non-financial uh applications are in a good spot because you don't really need a balance sheet to interact with lens protocol um and in fact many of the applications in the lens there's um they they implemented optimistic UI so you know when you post content or comment it happens instantly and all the blockchain logic happens in the back end you don't sign minimize transactions you don't pay gas that's all has been delegated and paid by the dispatcher that is running in the middleware so you can and some of these experiences like the the orb app favor a couple of new ones are building mobile first experiences so we're very closer and closer to getting people who do not have an ethereum address to actually come on board and start using non-financial applications and once they grow their roots in web tree then they can actually start using other of the infrastructure git coin the other protocol um you know buying nfts like you your first nft might be completely free and it might be just the content on lens protocol saying GM like it can be that simple yeah I think that you know there's this sort of straw man argument that ethereum doesn't scale and then it costs five to fifty dollars to send a transaction and I think that one of the problems in these debates on crypto Twitter is that people just don't see the L2 architecture and the capacity for off-chain data that is created by this decentralized network of wallets all that have public private I mean just the fact that more people have public private key you know like pairs on other computers is is huge for um for scaling the way Humanity coordinates with each other but but you know I think that you all are doing some really interesting stuff with the dispatcher so I can post on lens without paying gas um it feels like a meta transaction I think it may actually be a meta transaction and and yeah go check out Leinster if if don't take my word for it go to lens Leinster uh lenster.xyz and connect your wallet and you can post without gas I think that that's really cool and one even more colored thing is that lindser is just Community build up Community build front end um and anyone can actually go and contribute to that front end so it's and you can even Fork it and and make a better one and it's basically kind of like a uni swap style of front-end that we'll probably see a little bit um use quite a lot so um but I'm very optimistic on the infrastructure because uh especially with the layer juice you can do a lot of things um and and scale quite well um and and I think it's just like when we started to build the actual uh infrastructure beyond the smart contract we realized and we started to map out what kind of things we actually need for normal users to come and use the Gap getting rid of the gas cost getting rid of the um uh assigning and and this is something I think many of the non-financial applications should do anyways in the ecosystem optimistic uis um like abstracting the blockchain stuff um into the uh background and then being able to easily generate a wallet so and and start interacting so it's just uh we can't do this if if we really want to it's just kind of like we we have to work on some of the stuff and I also interestingly there's going to be better improvements in the infrastructure so account abstraction will help quite a lot social recovery there are sort of interesting things happening in the future in the ethereum ecosystem that makes um makes it more friendly for mainstream I want to pause on something that you said there Stoney and I just want to call it out because I think it's so cool we can we can build this if we all come together and build it you see I'm paraphrasing what you said but this is big like we go to the Moon because it's hard energy that I feel coming out of youstani um I've been in the game of of web 2 and web free entrepreneurship for almost 15 years and no one challenges Facebook or Twitter because it's just a Death Wish because their Network effect is so big because they're so massive um and and you know when vitalik gave the ECC talk what's in um in in web 3 after D5 and he said social networks and public goods I remember thinking like oh that's like that's cool and like kind of cute but like I don't know social networks like are we gonna get all the attention off of Twitter and like I see these people rallying around you and I see you making this play and taking the momentum from Ave and in creating this like kind of shelling point for people to actually try and this nascent uh Community with lens and I think that you're bringing this big like we go to the Moon because it's hard energy um we are the ones we are waiting for energy and I see people rallying around you and so I hope that momentum just continues and I want to say kudos for dreaming that big stani I I really think that you're providing a lot of Hope to a lot of Builders out there yeah I mean it's it's some of this some of the stuff we're doing is is definitely really hard it's probably the most hardest um exercise we've we've had for a while I I think building Defy is difficult in the sense that you know you have a lot of value to stake so like it's hard to say but now it's when you know you have billions uh billions in for the value in the smartphone checks but here is like here the kind of like a challenge if that what if you don't get you know the the people you want or the developers you want and and yeah what if what if you you take the wrong strategy so it really is the hardest game I ever played uh but it the the interesting part is that it feels different when there's a community it feels different when you're not really doing it by yourself and there's so many people um helping and I think um I I think we don't need to beat Facebook and Twitter I think we need to build new venues and new interest graphs and and basically new experiences where people want to go that's the only way to you know take the traction out of centralized uh social media platforms because those networks are the hardest to compete not only because of the ban awareness but because of the fact that the users can't take their existing Social Capital out of there so you need to actually you know build for new audiences and new experiences and and and combine those together and have that Network effect uh and doing it together with all these applications it's actually very cool to see like those applications that are built on top of lens they interact with each other ongoing bases and we share resources how to build and it's really Let's Build Together uh momentum that is taking it uh further now yeah yeah I feel that um and it's really neat to see um I I think you're humble to say that we want to build a Facebook or a Twitter killer but but I'll say it I that I hope that the lens Community gets there and I know that that's an intent that a lot of people have out there um uh I think that we have we have uh about 10 10 more minutes left on the episode how should we spend it Sonny [Music] talk about maybe more of public goods and and that perspective as well sure um and maybe how the space has evolved and then ended like for where it's going towards well I mean I have I I have a sort of prompt on public goods that's maybe a blending of get coin and lens that it might be interesting uh thread to pull um and that's the uh so so git coin is known for Bitcoin grants which is built on this thing called quadratic funding basically a matching campaign that that funds grants according to their crowdfunding results but it funds grants that have a broader base of support as opposed to one-to-one matching so Sani if you have a grant that has ten dollars from 10 contributors and I have a grant that has ten dollars from one contributor then you'll get like 90 of the matching pool and so one of the things that I've just experimented with through with my experience of doing quadratic funding on bitcoin is that Bitcoin has a news feed basically Bitcoin became a social network during the grants rounds when all this activity is happening and people are showing each other uh grants to each other and one of the things we experimented was was ex was replacing the like button which everyone's familiar with on Twitter and on Facebook with a micro tip button where stani if you do something that I think is great I can send you 30 cents and and you know what happened was no one really used it because who cares about 30 cents but what we did was we took the quadratic funding matching engine that we were using on bitcoin grants and we pointed it at the news feed and ran a I think it was a 200 quad funding matching round every week on the I called it mini quadratic funding and what that meant was that uh the same logic that applies to get coin grants applied to the Social Network on git coin and uh I could send you 30 cents and you would actually get nine dollars because of the quadratic matching that would come and what this did was I saw the behavior shift on bitcoin from people liking stuff which is just like oh this elicits a dopamine response from me to if the news feed was based off of how many micro tips you got it almost shifts the the this the data generation goes from um does this elicit a dopamine response in me to uh is this person actually helpful or me because I'm spending you know likes are like the ultimate coin there's infinite of them but I can only give a certain amount of of money to you and so we built this quadratic funding social network but um and and and sent I I think on the order of thousands of micro tips using it and it was also a way of me speedrunning like finding civil attackers on the get coin thing and um anyway eventually gas prices went up and I got too busy with Bitcoin other Bitcoin stuff and this experiment fell by the wayside but if anyone is out there uh that is interested in rebuilding this with me please get in touch I would love to Fork Leinster and build a quadratic lenser that is a combination of Bitcoin grants's quadratic matching engine and the lenser UI and I think that there's maybe an interesting signal generation mechanism that's a combination public goods and people helping each other out and web3 social that that we can put in the pot and stir it so uh yeah I'm curious what your reaction is is to that I I I I think that that is exactly where like the nobility is and and The Innovation and using something like that has been like that's an experience that is very exciting and you know it it creates this interesting fairness and also balance with the uh donations and the in the funding so what's interesting for me is from the lens perspective going back to the idea of you know you know all the people in the world by six degrees taking a lens social graph and and actually pointing to two two degrees so let's say that um because I follow you you follow um uh someone else you know that someone else can actually uh vote on that quadratic funding and we we ensure that there is more civil resistance uh there and you can actually like you can you can make it even further like it can be three degrees so if I follow you you follow Scott and Scott follows let's say um David Hoffman and and and and and basically David Hoffman can actually then vote to you can like the tools are there today to actually make it more civil resistant by using your social graph and and this kind of like a degree of separation we are using it in commenting so you know in typically in Twitter you see uh the the fake scammy unit swap comments whenever you post you know that's hard to do when you select this module on Lancer for example because it basically removes the idea reduces the boats uh pretty much to the minimum because someone needs to actually follow that boat in your social network that being able to comment and I think putting these two things together you actually create a use case for social graph outside the social media and you make that quadratic funding possible on a scale and that's a big game changer and for sure this is something that we would love to give a grant if someone wants to build and all the guidance I think this is powerful use cases and Kevin this is what I was talking about why it doesn't make sense to go after Twitter and Facebook it's way more actually fun easier uh productive to build those novel use cases that are actually helping um and one simple example there is there there is um one project built um by Newt Newt is an experiment and experimentational unit and other that basically has free hands to build anything so they decided to build a meme mixer on top of the lens protocol so you can create a completely new Meme and someone else can come and remix it and then you share the the collect fees that you're generating with the original Trader and whoever remix it remixes the chain um so it's basically taking something that exists and it just improving it and I think novel use cases and solving new problems is the way way to actually win Netflix it's beautiful I mean you know it reminds me of being a web 2 entrepreneur and there was this big there's this kind of meme back then where it was like the developing world is not gonna come on to desktop computers they're gonna LeapFrog that by doing everything mobile first um and as a result there was a huge freaking market for mobile uh apps that was powered by the development developing world and I almost see a symmetry here with web 2 social where you're not trying to go to where Facebook and Twitter are you're kind of building something new that leapfrog's what web2 social is with web3 and you know users won't switch for 10 more utility but they'll switch for 10x more utility and when those 10x use cases start appearing then I think that that's when it gets really cool and you know for a lot of people maybe maybe earning from your data if you can earn 10 to 50 per day from posting on lens and building your social network that's the equivalent of a job uh like you're you're 10x better than Facebook at that point yeah and and so I'm really really curious to see uh where this is all going as the momentum continues to build yeah definitely I mean there's 80 000 profiles at the moment in in lens protocol it's still um closed beta so it's the the white listing goes if you donate it to to git coin crons or let's say you are part of a developer Dao or or um boys clubs or any any of the kind of like a white listed dials um which is kind of like an experimentational way of using web3 footprint in uh getting folks into the social graph and curating it a bit um what I think is that um over time what happens now for example now per single profile is earning roughly two two and a half uh dollars per profile obviously the more the social graph grows it the number goes lower yeah but there there's already creators that are posting content with um piece like uh one two dollars Alpha Matic 0.1 Matic and like small amounts and just like small content um and over a long period of time like it might make a difference but we will probably see there's going to be a range for that and this is just monetization models we built based on nfts you can add various kind of uh monetization mechanisms that that could be very cool um yeah this is the part of building web3 um way where you don't try to solve everything just focusing on one particular building block and let the rest of the community to to figure out the the rest of the pieces yeah you know what I think is cool here is the super modularity of this in which you've got profiles and you've got follows and you've got likes and um and within within um lens and there's this idea of super modularity where like the sum is greater than the whole of its parts like it's literally super modular um in which the just salt of all these things together uh all these little modules that do one thing and do them well uh together sort of exponentially grows into something that's really big and powerful and I not only see that within lens but also within your work uh stani because I know that you're associated with Ave and I have taken that momentum to lens and then there's Rave like this party that you all host every every event and it's like it's almost like you have this like ecosystem of modules and sort of projects that kind of share Social Capital um and in the momentum the energy scaffolds between them and I just think it's really cool to see the momentum I can't wait to see uh how big the the Ave Empire is by by 2025 or the lens protocol is by then because it all seems like it's growing together yeah I mean hopefully it creates new new opportunities for Builders to to to build fascinating pro products and onboard more Talent into the space so um I'm super super um optimistic in the state of um uh web3 at the moment and ethereum so um excited to excited about everything at the moment so feeling happy we're in I feel the same way well uh our our time is up so I guess my last final question will be where do people find you and where do people find lens protocol online yeah if you go to Leinster uh my handle is study.lens uh so you can find me um obviously I'm also on Twitter um and yeah I I I post quite regularly about web3 D5 and and all things um pretty much it I don't know I don't have limitations but I don't post but um yeah follow me if you want to uh see more of my content great and also throw out leinster.xyz is one of the great ways to check out the lens protocol and lens.xyz is where you can actually go out and check out the dev docs of the protocol and the final call to action that I'll give to the audience is that if you want to build quadratic lens stir please reach out to me or sunny we've got Capital available in guidance and then I know that lens is growing in many different directions and you can check out linster.xyz if you want to see those developer docs or or build on top of lens and also uh and also if you really want to explore Leinster and get a handle and a profile uh DM me on Twitter and I will help you out beautiful stani thanks so much for joining thank you for supporting public goods on gitcoin and thank you for everything you're building thank you Kevin thanks for having me here [Music]
