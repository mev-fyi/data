foreign welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless Antonio Garcia Martinez is on the podcast and this guy has been around the block Facebook Twitter Apple he's seen it all he knows the internet we talk about his journey why the internet's boring and why it's broken and how to fix it a few things to look for in today's episode number one he actually defines what an internet ad is it was surprisingly useful to me a unit of your attention sold at the highest bidder we get into that definition what it means he also says for the good and the bad advertisers were the ones who paid for the internet we talk about the flaws and also the benefits we also talk about why Antonio thinks nft drops are actually ads lastly we talk about attribution and how attribution on web3 can help us win again big Silicon Valley and the big Banks David uh Antonio's just a lot of fun to talk to he's kind of a a straight shooter tells it like it is uh yeah what were your takes going into this episode yeah Antonio I think he's going to be able to tell the story of the complete trajectory hopefully of uh the ad-based models of web 2 as it goes into web 3 and of course how hopefully again web3 doesn't just take the same same uh ad models of web 2 but it gives it its own native spin right like how the ad based model of web 2 is going to change yet still achieve some of the same goals that ads do in web3 and I think rather than just like poo pooing on ads in general Antonio and in this podcast really gives a pretty uh clear uh and clear and sober idea of what an ad is why ads are actually good the take that ads actually paved the way for the internet to be adopted I thought was a pretty good one uh and and then also then later it comes to become extractive and bad and evil and and then he of course is uh starting this company called spindle which he thinks can help create the ad model of web3 that is hopefully a way that's non-extractive that is enabling of users um but his uh his history is insane Ryan as you know uh worked on Facebook before the Facebook ad exchange uh was in existence helped build the Facebook ad exchange and so he saw the before and after of what we now know of modern Facebook uh he also started an ad company sold it to Twitter he's been around Silicon Valley uh and so I think uh in the future as this web 3 world gets built out Antonio himself will have seen the complete like trajectory of ads on the internet and I think this is really just going to be the lesson that bankless listeners take away today is the ad model is going to still exist in web3 and it's going to be different and hopefully better if we do it right one one thing we also talk about is privacy if you're curious about that and back and forth on that um he has some interesting opinions on that so uh look out for that and by the way David when you were talking about that I noticed it's about four or five times you said the word hopefully I want to talk about you more about that word hopefully but we'll save that for the debrief the debrief of course is the episode that David and I record right after the episode so literally what we're about to go do where we

tell us what it's been like to be in the belly of the Beast what he's learned and why he is in crypto as a result Antonio welcome bankless it's great to have you thanks Ryan thanks David uh how are you doing man you just came back from Miami I think little trip out there um I'm a little tanned yeah yeah I hope you enjoyed yourselves because uh you know you've had um an exciting life I would say as we look through this bio and David why don't you just tee up Antonio's bio for uh bankless listeners who haven't run across uh who Antonio is yeah and uh Antonio I think you're going to fit in very well in this podcast because of you are very extremely multi-disciplinary so uh started at Goldman Sachs pre-2008 uh moved into a y combinator startup ad grok which you sold to Twitter in 2011. uh then you started working at Facebook in that same year uh director of Facebook's ad exchange which is a point in this podcast that we are going to dive into definitely uh left Facebook in 2013 to write a book uh you wrote this book called chaos monkeys obscene fortune and random failure in Silicon Valley talking about a lot of your experiences uh and then you also uh had a brief stint at Apple in 2021 and you're now at spindle which is a web 3 attestation platform which I believe takes a lot of your the lessons that you've learned in in Silicon Valley working on the Facebook ad exchange but now now that we have this new blockchain platform uh taking a web 3 stance towards some of the lessons that you've learned uh in Silicon Valley Antonio how do you like that for a description of uh all the places that you've been in the world uh you included all the good stuff and excluded all the bad stuff um which is great or you did include some good stuff too there's there are some weird detours in there including living in an off-grid yurt and uh you know moving to Europe and a few other things but uh yeah you mostly you got the trajectory right yes thanks so Antonio uh it's it's a hard question to ask because you've been to so many places I this this podcast I think we're going to talk a lot about Facebook and the Facebook ad exchange because I think that is uh your time at Facebook straddled that uh so you were at Facebook pre-add exchange and post ad exchange and so we want to talk about how did that era of Facebook which you had involvement in change the direction of the company and but also change the direction of the internet and the you know this place that we go to the Internet how did that change wow and then and then we also want to pick your brain about out perhaps what you see as a trajectory learning what you've learned at Facebook and Twitter and just being Silicon Valley uh how that's going to go forward if with blockchain and how the whole blockchain uh role uh changes the game of the internet does that sound good yeah definitely did thanks for pumping me up I I should mention it was a group effort at Facebook but it's true that I was there at the formative time where the four the five or six products that made Facebook were shipped so that was a fascinating thing to see but yeah so let's start this story at adbrock can you talk about the inspiration for agrock and where that came from and what agrock did yeah it's funny I mean this is like total Deja Vu so I'm right now in in San Francisco across from South Park address office was like two blocks that way right and I remember living like the web 2 boom which like this used to be the pulsing heart of like consumer internet web 2 10 years ago now it's pretty empty um there's a reason why I couldn't afford this office um but yeah adbrock was basically so one step in there I went from Goldman which is basically pricing and trading credit derivatives that whole blow up in 2008. I joined an ad tech company that was my first exposure to ad tech company run by sociopath it wasn't amazing they had they had very good recruiting so I met two co-founders and like literally the last day of the deadline we applied to YC back when YC was still kind of somewhat somewhat of a niche thing um in the sense that um you know it was only 35 companies Paul still ran the show Etc and we managed to get in we oddly managed to get in with basically no product um and the idea there one of the great unsolved problems at the time and again this is ancient history but it sounds like you want to stroll down memory lane so let's do it um you know Google AdWords right the little ads that you see on the right like when you in case you don't know and there's a whole Riff on this in chaos monkeys like if you enter a query that unleashes a whole wave of computation to match a set of ads that targeted that query right and those queries literally have prices to them so for a while for a while there's there's this form of lung cancer called mesothelioma that asbestos workers got after the 40s that I think now you can no longer bid on it because it's a little bit squeezy but back in the day you clicked on anything with mesothelioma somebody paid 100 bucks for that click right and yeah yeah and well like some kind of a an attorney or something yeah yeah yeah this is personal injury attorneys who are in class action suits against whoever or had the asbestos my ambulance Chaser type you know exactly exactly exactly um but the cool thing is that you've got like a piece of human thought and attention which is oh do I have mesothelioma that gets auctioned and sold off like a can of tomatoes or like a a share of Google right in an open market and then it all happens billions of times a day right so the Google thing was one of the first examples of her going at internet history and this is way before my time in the ad Tech space wait wait that's an interesting model like a piece of human attention yeah it's auctioned and sold off to the highest bidder that is wild I've never thought about it in those terms but that's exactly what it is a Quantum of human attention is being sold and that that's it's not just on search every literally every every app you open every time you load Facebook ever like in the case of of programmatic exchanges literally requests go out and say Obviously pseudonymously but this human is here what do you know about them all these databases spit into gear machine learning models all the rest of it they return with a bid and a piece of AD creative somebody wins the auction and boom and then it happens billions and billions times a day and the winner doesn't actually care necessarily about the well-being of the human who's behind the attention that it's receiving it just cares about the ROI and so am I going to make more money on this human's attention than it cost me to purchase it yes I mean this is not a Utopia The Advertiser is not trying to improve your mental health um but the reason why advertising exists right advertising is a weird thing right it's not like I make a thing and then sell it it's like this weird triangle trade right advertising exists when some other party is willing to pay more money to the provider of the service then I'm willing to pay for the service right if that inequality holds someone's willing to pay to reach me through that service more than I'm willing to pay for the service then some form of advertising must exist which is why I think it will end up existing in web 3 as well but this is why like you know the sort of cynical statement that ad tech people say after the fifth drink at the conference is well you know we pay for the internet which is true they paid for much of web 2 which doesn't mean it's not to say that it has to be that way going forward I think web3 is going to have way more interesting monetization models but if you if you if you expand the definition of ads widely enough you're already seeing it happen in web3 an nft drop is an ad basically right it's a piece of targeted media that's where having user action we're skipping ahead I don't want to get too off the topic David well I I love the the deconstruction that you just did and I want to just emphasize that a little bit advertising happens when somebody it's more economically viable for somebody to access the attention of the user than the user is willing to pay for the service that they are entering that's that's pretty cool uh that is an I love that definition I feel like that's pretty close to the medal of what a definition for advertising is um uh and then and then the other the other calculator the other thing that you said is that that um advertisers paid for the internet can you just unpack that a little bit elaborate on that just Riff on that for a little bit I mean so let's think about it I mean I'm not even a Facebook user anymore but how much how much money does Facebook make off the average user that metrics what's known as arpu average revenue per user it doesn't get used in web 3 at all it should it should get used more part of spindle's point is helping you calculate that thing but basically what it means is how how much money am I making off that user um over some set period of time that our poo for Facebook I haven't looked at the numbers recently but it's north of 100 bucks right like ask yourselves this would you pay 100 bucks for Instagram or would you pay 100 bucks for WhatsApp you probably extract more than 100 of value but would you necessarily pay for it eh probably not like like per year internet yeah yeah per year yeah exactly I mean we probably would because we're in media like I paid more than 100 bucks like if anything the Eight dollar blue check from Elon is like cheap compared to its actual value right but for for the average user for the three plus billion people that use Facebook it's a lot of money right they're not going to pay it and and note also that a network obviously has Network effects right Facebook is worth something because there's three billion people on it right if it had half as many people it's not worth half as much it's worth a quarter as much right this is known as metcal's law that the value of a network was roughly as the square of the number of people in it I mean it's a rule of thumb it's not exact obviously but in in a state where you have Network effects and you have a mass consumer product advertising almost has to play a role because the what you'd lose in growth if you actually put up a paywall in front of Facebook um would be extraordinarily expensive if every marginal user is is actually you know exponentially important that's interesting because it's it's a double-edged sword advertisers paid for the internet is interesting because for for the good and the bad right but a tremendous amount of good has been created yeah and and now not just a first order of like oh look we have Instagram we wouldn't have otherwise there's also second order effects like look at it's funny that um I did some pieces back in the early days of wired I'm not the only one to observe it um this period this like 80 to 90 year period of like somewhat objective both sides journalism where there's fact check talking like I mean now I think things are getting more partisan but at least in theory unlike much of Europe or other parts of the world a newspaper kind of tries to get it right and show both sides in the United States why was that I mean it was partially for ideological reasons right but if you go back and read The Works of uh Walter Lipman he was an early intellectual that founded the first adjournalism schools he wrote a book called public opinion it was partially ideological because the Press had gotten World War One very wrong right but it was partially also a commercial decision Macy's basically needed the most reach possible to run its ads right and so the New York Times of the world New York Times actually started as an as a as a publication that was not overtly partisan right a newspaper in the 19th century was like the Press Democrat it was literally the Democratic paper like the Democratic party's paper in that town and if you remember that party you subscribed to that paper and if you're part of the GOP you you read something else altogether right and that's just the way journalism worked until about the beginning of the 20th century and so journalism gave us this sort of golden period of relatively somewhat objective and nonpartisan media and so if you switch to a subscription model which everything is going to by the way whether it be safe stack or the New York Times now makes an enormous amount of money from its digital subscriptions right well at the end of the day the customer gets what it wants and the customer used to want non-partisan agreeable media and now the customer wants its own views reflected back at them because the customer is the reader and again like that's not necessarily an unalloyed good that suddenly readers are getting what they want all the time right um so there's like a second order effect here as well which is advertising supported media has to be within certain rules because at some point advertisers will bail right if the media is too extreme they're just going to walk away right um so yeah the the to lean into the whole advertisers paid for the internet I I want to unpack keep on going down that that rabbit hole because that's fascinating uh and and I want to just like illustrate this I think in this way where like imagine all of the the apps that we use on the internet that got us on the internet like it was Facebook for me back when I was in like Middle School uh perhaps also read it uh imagine if we had to pay as a user to access all of those things how much less would the internet be adopted if that was the case like orders of magnitude like the internet would like the advertising model probably was a lubricant for the adoption of the internet I think that's what you really mean when you say yeah advertisers paid for the growth of the internet one of the one a theme in previous Bank was podcast Antonio that we talked about with um uh Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon and a few others is that the fact that native payments in the internet wasn't uh a thing until crypto uh was one of the main reasons why the current business models of the internet is what it is we're advertising is the only way to do it because that's how it paid for but I I think with what you're saying that actually kind of argues against that where uh no like just if we had native money in the internet even before the advertising model we probably still would have had the advertising model because because of the free lubricant that is the onboarding of everyone because everyone's free I feel like that's a fair take yeah yeah I mean I I agree with Chris Dixon and Mark about like 99 of reality so I don't want to like overtly contradict them but I do think and I do think the fact that there's like magic internet money that's programmable money and that web3 can Financial can financialize itself is very interesting and unique that said I don't totally buy the story that now because we we have native internet money so there's subscription models that are available that weren't before I have been hearing about micropayments solving the publisher problem for like 15 years right we've had micro payments before we've had startups that do this before it's not about even though obviously stuff on chain is better than some of the Fiat stuff it's it's really it's the emotional decision cost of like do I want to pay 25 cents for this article all the time people just don't think about it that way it's like it's like a mental toll even if you made it like a one-click thing humans just don't think about media that way and I that that said I do think the blockchain makes other business models viable that weren't viable before but I don't think just making subscriptions easier is kind of good enough to change the dominant business model the internet no sure so Antonio that's a little bit about ad grok and I I want to bring kind of the the next place that you visited in your in your journey which is uh Facebook into the story because for all of the good and I think for the first like uh I don't know the birth of of web one and web 2 um all of this advertisers paying for the internet thing we only saw the upside right we only saw the benefit it we only saw more and more people getting connected and I remember back in the day when Facebook was like a Beacon of Hope it's the social graph it's how we bring world peace and connect everyone together it's not like you worked at Facebook okay but like I heard it and like I believed a portion of it I remember kind of my first time logging into Facebook and it was just a magical experience because everyone is here like isn't this amazing this is what the internet can do that wasn't even that wasn't possible in web web one so that's all of the good but um as we said it's also a double-edged sword so advertisers paid for the internet but also advertisers paid for the internet right like there's another there's a problem with that and we started to see I think the the negative effects of that over maybe the last 10 years but but tell us about how your experience with with Facebook fed into that story kind of what you saw and maybe some of the the negative side of this attention-based economy that we created on the internet yeah yeah I mean yeah so that we should distinguish those different types of advertising right the rise of what I think broadly you'd call programmatic advertising was something that changed the course of human history I think I can I can get out and it's and it's a bigger story than just Facebook I mean it had impacted Facebook because I was one of the people that helped bring it to Facebook but it's a bigger story what do I mean by that so again let's let's go back into the midst of time a lot of internet monetization or the ad system was was very skeuomorphic to use acrystics in term of what the newspaper business was like you know if you look at you know display ad on the right hand side of an online publication it looks like a newspaper ad that that's intentional because that's what it was modeling in fact literally the first display ad was in a in a what was then called hotwired now called Wired Magazine and it was built out as if it was a print ad because they had no other model that and you still have terminologies like insertion order that comes from the printage because they would insert an ad into the the print of a thing that's still refer the i o is still how you buy an ad um in any case so that was the ad World in which you had the New York Times or wired with the sales force go to an Advertiser and say hey we don't have much tracking or attribution like we don't know how well the ads going to perform but we're just going to charge you for the medium by the way we own the audience right if you want to address techies in the mid-auts right you basically have to buy an ad and wired.com there's nowhere else to actually Target those users so what did programmatic advertising do and this is where I wish I could take the camera to our whiteboard wall because I would walk you through schematics but basically how it worked is rather than wired or New York Times saying here we have a captive audience like pay up right pay us 30 per thousand ads which is kind of a lot of money um you had somebody like Facebook or somebody like the Google display Market you know uh you know ad exchange saying you know what how about we actually track individual users when they come to your website right so if if you're an e-commerce guy a user is going to come to you you're going to cookie the user you're going to fire a bunch of pixels to a bunch of other sites and then you can actually Target that user in all sorts of different places right if you're if you've got a techie user that comes to your blog or comes to your Gadget store I can Target them anywhere I don't have to pay 30 per thousand ads at wired I can Target them anywhere throughout the internet right and so what you've done is you've unbundled the audience from the publisher and the publisher here is just the person who produces the media whether it's wired.com Facebook wherever they're all Publishers in the ad Tech sort of imagining of this right decoupling the audience from and breaking it out of the publisher is what basically wrecked the mainstream media right that's why New York Times has managed to transition to subscriptions but local news is basically dead because all they would do is sell ads against what was a captive audience which was the local market but again if that audience has been decoupled like you the publisher no longer owned this actually the ad exchange and ultimately the first party data The Advertiser has owns it then that just changes the whole Dynamics never mind that Facebook is actually upstreamed to use a Larry David term the actual media right because a lot of the inbound that went to a New York Times or whatever else actually came from Facebook so you could run the ad Au rip out the audience like the New York Times audience is no longer magical I can find them on Facebook too and by the way they're actually they spend more time on face with the new on the New York Times right that was the death blow of like conventional ad Service Media um and so that that programmatic ads technology changed everything right really and that is fascinating and like I think I think a lot of people would say wrecked it in a good way because now now it now it allows it maybe that's another double-edged sword but now it allows anybody body to kind of create a platform and it disrupts the gatekeeping media that sort of were The Gatekeepers of of Truth and The Gatekeepers on what you see and what you hear and all of these things and it opens this out it it democratizes the internet this is very much the web 2 Vision still and still feels like it's a good thing I mean I think so I agree with you but depends how you feel about the New York Times there's there are some who still yearn for the days of of your in which you had a human editor deciding what Americans read every day not everyone looks uh well upon the you know the algorithm as if that's a problem or whatever I I it depends how you look at it um but yeah I mean the problem I think with the Facebook model right is that is again what Chris Dixon calls the take rate the problem with Facebook like yes you've democratized things you can run a Facebook page that would have a level of reach that it wouldn't before but Facebook sits there and takes all the cash off the table right Facebook kind of does sit there and intermediate the ad spend in a huge way and you know if web3 has any promise it's pushing the value to the edges to the users to the brands to the creators it's not having some like vampire squid sitting in the middle of it right hoovering up 70 cents of every dollar that goes through the system which is more or less how it works now so that that that's the yeah that's a bigger downside I would say so Facebook as as the intermediary between uh users and advertisers there I would assume that when we talk about their take rate uh that they are approaching as much they're trying to capture as much value as possible because they're a business that's what they do uh and so basically they're eking out all the value that advertisers are getting from reaching Their audience they're paying there's some like profitability there but then Facebook is probably collapsing that profitability up to approach like zero percent of like a value to advertisers because is that is that a fair take or is that not right well let's get a little technical you're not talking attack until you have a bunch of three letter acronyms in the mix so let's include some three letter acronyms which might be educational um so there's some key Concepts when it comes to advertising and they're not even that complicated but things like customer acquisition costs right so CAC or like lifetime value LTV and CAC is like what does it cost me to get that user to come in the door and become a paid user it can be it could be an ad or it could be by the way running a Discord Community like Zynga back in the battle days of Farmville used to run communities as well right that's a form of marketing you don't pay for it as paid media but it's it costs you something because you have a community manager so how much does it cost you to bring a user door and then you know to be blunt how well can you monetize them going forward what is their LT because somebody they're going to churn out so how much money do they spend over what time period right so if you're a business and you're advertising trying to have growth your LTV has to be higher than your CAC right if that is if that ratio is above one you're happy if it's below it isn't um and that that like looking at it from very mercenary point of view every company is a marketing company that has a side hustle which is how they drive usage on the funnel but for example Uber was profitable I think for the first quarter this year their LTV was not better than their CAC for 15 years right that number was less than one and that and that that's what basically you know and of course they had to tie that over with speculative Capital don't even ask me what that ratio looks like in web 3 right there but of course if money is free cracks are zero who cares right I can just invent this this token and give it to users to use my product of course I think those days are over um and I think people have to start looking very seriously at what their caps are um but it's not quite true that Facebook can just squeeze the market right because if if if my acquisition costs get too high I have to either pass the savings on to the user right but maybe there's an open market in which I don't have pricing power and then Facebook gets screwed I just stopped spending money on Facebook Facebook has competition by the way I can also spend on Google Now I can spend on Apple there's the open web right Facebook isn't the only game in town anymore and so they can't quite do it arbitrarily right you said um every company is a marketing company that has a side gig yeah I love how meta that is basically what you're saying is like uh Uber's Uber's side gig is moving people around uh you know Apple side gig is making iPhones why is why is an advertising uh why is every company an advertising company can you unpack that a little bit because if because if you sit there and talk to their marketing teams that's how that's how they view the world right what's called the marketing funnel right like oh the user comes in here season ad sees a tweet installs the app goes into the app spends money and then churns out that's like that's what's that's the central metaphor of marketing right that is what determines the success or failure of your business and if you talk to the marketing teams like I used to talk to the gaming marketing teams at face stuff back in the day they've tried out the PM they talked to the at the quarterly Business Review they knew their customer acquisition costs out to four decimals right like Zynga back in the day it all it was was a quantitative exercise in funnel Dynamics and then it would just have Studios pumping out games for the sake of running and and to be honest every web 2 game basically followed that model and and and web 3 games if they're going to be successful we'll need growth teams whose mentality is that right yeah that's absolutely fascinating uh Antonio can you um take the listeners and me and Ryan into your shoes during your time at Facebook Okay ad exchange during ad exchange post ad exchange like what was the culture of Facebook like did they underst did Facebook as a company understand the trajectory of where they were going when they were making yeah can you just like tell that story a little bit yeah sure um yeah it's from what I understand I still have friends there it's it's a very different company than it is now um I joined I guess it was Employee 2000 or so um and then in terms of actual engineer it's probably eight or nine hundred they only had 25 product managers for the entire company we would fill like a small conference room I was a product manager officially and I was the first product manager on the on the ads targeting product they never had like a formal roadmap the engineers would just ship whatever random thing ads was kind of a ghetto like you know zuckin is S1 which is the IPO document said you know we don't build services to make money we make money to build services and that was kind of true ads has never really been a Focus right it was this necessary evil we were in like a crappy part of the building our desks were shitty the carpets were stained we were not in the nice part of the building or any of that stuff and the ad system to be blunt didn't work I remember the first thing I did is I logged into the main dashboard that only we could see because it was pre-ipo and you know the cpms were like 17 cents CPM again another acronym cost per Mill it's cost per thousand Impressions especially the cost per square foot of media inventory it's how every publisher thinks of itself like every time I have a thousand experiences how much money do I make right that's that's that is like the basic number that every publisher needs to know if they don't know it they need to get an attribution system and figure it out because they're not they're not you know playing you know a real monetization game so I you know logged in at 17 cents and it's just like my boss has like come up with a targeting roadmap we've never had one best of luck and um you know we tried basically using there's so many things kind of wrong with the way I think the public receives Facebook so I might attack them one after another in a very MythBusters fashion one is that like your Facebook data is so valuable it is in in some very high level and second order ways but in the very simplistic way of oh they're going to Target the thing I did on Facebook no it is not right uh the persistent rumor that Zuck is listening to me through my phone okay even assuming that's true which by the way you would see on the network bandwidth because you'd have this constant call going to suck like it's impossible they're not listening to you all the time but leaving that aside how often do you actually say oh by the way I'm in market for a flight to Boston leaving February 3rd and coming back February 6th and I don't want to pay more than 600 when the [ __ ] do you ever say that you never say it right and you and and this whole business oh I talked about the cat with my girlfriend and I saw cat food ads yeah because you looked up cat food literally an hour before that that's why right or or your girlfriend did and here's where your data does get used a little bit there's a product called look-alike audiences which doesn't get talked about much it's one of the most successful products that Facebook ever launched I wasn't involved with it but I was there when it when it was started and what that means is you two guys are probably very similar to each other you're probably like a high coefficient Edge on whatever social graph you're a part of if David does the thing then we might show Ryan an ad for the same thing and it won't be as good as showing it to The Davids of the world right cause maybe you're not exactly like David but it's definitely way better than random chance right and that's one of the biggest problems advertisers have is like here's my Milli to use web3 language here's my nft whales right and this is I'm sure a problem that like openc has and is trying to address here's my nft whales like I know how to sort of address them right when they come on site or send them nfts but give me like another million like them right so let's create a similarity metric in order to do that so so your data gets used to do that basically to a large extent but again the things you do like we literally spend a year trying to input I actually called it project Jody so after Spanish Classics we were literally feeding into the sausage grinder of like literally everything you posted everything everything we could legally use right would it actually improve like the interest targeting system that we had and it didn't it didn't move the needle at all and the key unlock and again it's not like some brilliant Insight right because I I knew about the ad Tech World a little bit but most of Facebook at the time did not I mean now they're pros of course but at the time almost nobody in Facebook ads had worked in ads right so I'm like hey dude like there's this whole outside world of program advertising I know you guys don't know about but I I come with good news right what we should do is actually join to the outside world of data and rather trying to use the fact that you liked Starbucks a year ago and sell you coffee which is stupid because it isn't it's not a signal to anything we should use the fact that you put a 300 tenant REI in your shopping cart and abandoned it an hour ago and we should show you an ad for that tint for the next two days and see if you convert and see if the click-through rates go up at all which of course they did right not only did the ad bid come for it because it's a 300 10 they're going to make 20 margins up they're only paying 60 bucks a pop to get you to buy the damn tent right so they're willing to bid a lot for it and secondly the actual click through rate right I mean this is all experience you've all had you go browse the internet you see an ad for your favorite beard oil or whatever the hell it is in Instagram and you click on it one in 20 times five percent CTR great that's orders of magnitude higher than the click-through rates were when I joined Facebook right and that's the power of data not that it's magical I can't turn you into a zombie I can't force you to vote for Trump I can't the ads don't work that well but as a statistical phenomenon can you make it go from a one percent click-through rate to a two percent click-through rate thereby doubling your traffic right like that's a big jump yes you can that said 98 of people are still going to completely ignore the ad because it's just Mis targeted and whatever like ads are still a statistical fluke but you can make them be less fluky with data right and so that was the key unlocked for Facebook that's like you know we're not going to be a Walled Garden in some way or another we're going to take first party data which is the valuable data and then use that to inform ads on Facebook that that was the that was one of many things that happened by the way that wasn't the only thing on Facebook that that's what made Facebook into the Behemoth that it is today I mean but that's crazy what what that is this is just like a massive professionalization a massive like you just scienced the hell out of it basically well we copied Google to be clear I literally the fbx actual integration docs I literally had Google's docs open it was basically writing like a simplified version of it but yeah but whatever yeah sure I mean right and so um I I guess well one thing I just want to clear out in that whole story is because there is this sort of persistent thing I've heard so many you know people in my life friends and such tell me that Facebook or Twitter or someone is listening to them can you click can you clear that up clearly there you've been in the belly of the Beast so that doesn't you're telling us that doesn't happen no no in fact I wrote an entire wired piece about it and in fact I went on um one of the NPR podcasts the the money show whatever it's called they didn't yeah Planet Money and which I came on and gave my Spiel um at this point I've just given up but they actually interviewed a set of people all of them had the same like cat food with the girlfriend story or whatever and they basically like interviewed like grilled them for minutes and figured out what it actually was how it was they actually got and there was always some mechanism they had actually Google search for it or the girlfriend had looked it up or they had to use a loyalty card at Petco or something which by the way can be joined to your online experience so there was some more conventional means of targeting that they just weren't familiar with that was correlated with yes talking about cat food but no there no I mean think about it right like imagine you would have to have basically like the phones aren't good enough to do the ML on your phone so you'd basically have to feed the audio like like like a Siri speaker to like Facebook you'd see it in your network like it's impossible it's just not possible so the punch line here is that uh with the claim is that our our my phone which is sitting on my desk is listening to me and it's going to interpret what I'm saying out loud in this room and it's going to find me a product to sell me as a result of that data yeah what you're actually saying is that no I'm actually feeding it data directly correct through my internet path and it's just using the data that I'm already sending outbound correct we don't need that that was the theme of my wired piece it's like Facebook doesn't need to listen to your phone you're doing it you're doing the stuff on the website already right yeah yeah oh okay so when you when you first joined Facebook back in 2011 right there was just like just a field of opportunity here just more things to science you just had basically nothing at Facebook and you kind of like can can turn that and create metrics and quantify it and just continue to turn through it I'm just curious you're perspected I was like are we at the end of that have we squeezed all of the juice out of the tension and like there's nothing left to squeeze like how much more efficient and can this form of advertising that that the social media behemoths have uh just discovered and implemented how much more efficient can we get yeah you know I mean we're at the we're at the end of a long Saga I mean that's part of the reason why I've I've made various jumps in my career um let me just rattle through some of the list of things that Facebook shipped that like completed the picture so one is obviously much better targeting that was part of it two better ad units Facebook ads used to be these little stupid postage stamps on the right hand side right now you have these much more compelling in feed or even on Instagram beautiful you know things that look like organic posts you had what's called attribution right so back in the day when I joined Facebook you'd click on a Facebook ad you'd go off Facebook Facebook had no idea what's going on they have no idea if you bought the thing like no idea whatsoever what attribution is is basically it's it's it's closing the causal Loop of like oh did they buy the thing and let's use that to inform whatever the media experiences that we're trying to optimize right they didn't have that um and then you know they just got smarter about mobile a bunch of stuff happened right but a lot of yeah but a lot of those adaptations have gotten to the point where there's not that much Alpha left in ad Tech as a thing like VCS aren't funding web 2 ad Tech anymore there's one last thing I want to mention you you skipped a couple steps in my in my directory a little bit I worked at one company not to plug them or anything I no longer hold chairs but a company called branchmetrics which is an attribution company web 2 it's one of the biggest independent attribution companies that has competitors of course apps flyer adjust Etc but basically what they do is what you need in web 2 right like you need a data Switzerland like say You're The Advertiser David right like you don't like speaking of trustlessness the ad Tech world is completely trustless before that term was invented you don't trust Google and Facebook right and so you want somebody to grade their homework and tell you like yeah okay Facebook says they showed all these ads but how many of them actually bought the thing so tell me how many of them bought the thing and how much I spent on Facebook to get them to buy those things and how much are those things worth and should I spend more money on Facebook or not right so you will have a relationship to an attribution system like Branch or appfly or adjust or whatever that tells you that and and half their value is the fact that they're not Google and Facebook right that they're checking that other person's homework right um and like editors of sorts effectively and you know we're jumping ahead a little bit but if you know when I get asked like how did you come up with a spindle idea it's so weird you web2 web3 blockchain's like dude I just asked myself the question like what in web 2 should be rebuilt along blockchain lines like what is basically trustless basically permissionless requires system-wide consensus and is responsible for large sums of money moving around and establishing like a ground truth attribution is that's what right so the branches of the world should probably live on as blockchains if they were being designed from the ground up now and we're going to spend some more time on attribution but just to Define that a little bit more like did they buy attribution is just did they buy the thing why is completing the circuit and did they buy the thing actually important when you're kind of sciencing uh the heck out of like your your ad spend because the ex because if you look at the entire media funnel right that the human internet experience is varied and chaotic and frantic and all over the place right like you you watch a Joe Rogan video you engage with a tweet you watch a YouTube video you scroll your Instagram feed then you buy a thing right and so then like times arrow goes forward but attribution goes backwards so you bought the thing what led to it was it the incremental value of Joe Rogan mentioning the thing was it the Brand's Channel and the YouTube video you saw was it just the tweet and the offer of a 10 off code what was it like what was the cut like without it you you're just in a world of chaos of data of of Randomness without it you don't have enough to you know information to even make your decisions as to you know what's effective and what's not you're basically fine blind you have you have no idea what to do you have you don't even if you have leverage to pull you don't know which one to pull without it so when we asked Antonio about like kind of what's the Double H edge sword of like you know Facebook social media the negative side of things right um you set the take rate you said they've become a monopoly and they're extracting too much and the rent's too high and all of these things right and that's what Dixon says that's what like uh I think we hear that right there are some other things that people point to as problems with with uh big social media though let's you know talk about maybe two of them um you know the second is uh you introduced earlier in this episode the concept that was new at the time in kind of web web 2 which is the concept of a cookie the concept of us being able to us being kind of the app or the service or whatever track what you do not just across our app but across other apps on the internet and this has been pointed to as another problem another I I guess external finality of the web 2 internet and web one internet is these things called cookies and nobody has privacy on the internet anymore what's your take on that how would you respond to that is that a problem yeah privacy privacy is a complicated issue there's a lot you can say about it um it's a relatively it's a relatively novel invention um didn't appear in the dictionary in our modern sense until the 19th century most of the case laws actually from the 20th century um it's not mentioned the Constitution even once um although of course it's implicit in the Fourth Amendment um you know it the Privacy was wasn't it the right to live as a stranger among strangers right was a very obvious reaction to the urbanization of life right the fact that we left traditional small villages and suddenly we're living among strangers and we've we felt we needed some redoubt against that you know if you ever live in a small village and one of the one of the chapters you skipped over in my bio I once lived on a small island Northwest of Seattle off-grid and a yurt I literally bought a piece of land and lived like a Hermit on this thing if you live in a small community nobody has privacy right and not not only that it's not considered a social good if you live like a recluse if I have lived like a true recluse and had told nobody anything about me didn't establish relationships yeah it wouldn't be a good thing you'd be like a weirdo right there's no gdpr on Orcas Island right Northwest of Seattle right everyone is kind of in your business but of course the break on that is like well it's a community right you can't be nasty to people because you have to see them in the checkout line the next day right and this is just how human life works but these unfortunately these are the things that we don't have online which is why media drives us completely crazy which I think it does right um so yeah so privacy has to exist in a very real way but I think the way that the Privacy discourse goes particularly from people who tend to Advocate like privacy Maxes and the revealed preferences of actual users I think tend to diverge right um yes there are people who want to remain forever anonymous online for for reasons that they want but that's not how most people want to live most people like cookies because they don't want to log into every site they go to they want to remember that oh yeah this there's no state in HTTP right remember the cookie was a hack because an HTTP you know protocol there was no ID being passed so they had to write a file to the browser so it's a very early hack to make identity to happen because you don't want to log into your bank literally every single time you go right so most users do not delete their cookies every day although they could because it just degrades the experience in a big way and that's the reality of it privacy I mean you talk about it as it's absolute right because that's how you posture online but the reality is it's more of a commodity that you trade for something else right you trade a little bit of privacy for convenience like I let Amazon see all of my credit card transactions because I don't want to enter the damn credit card every time I buy a thing right and I even use Amazon pay on other sites which means they get that data they know other places that I'm buying as well but you know what I hate entering my credit cards I'm just going to do it right all right and also curation right like if if we give them a bunch of data they can curate like I want Spotify to have all of my music data because I want Spotify to give me the best artists that I don't know and I totally give up that privacy for better music right and I want to sync it to my device and my Tesla and this computer and like I don't care that you know that I owe three devices like I'm happy to not log in all the time and have all my music stored there or you traded for a community right like you know I you guys probably found me on Twitter right this relationship would not exist if I didn't expose my life on Twitter in some way and that's often bad I get into I get dog piled or whatever but net it's pretty good like I haven't stopped using I did not go to Mastodon because Elon bought it right and I don't think anyone actually did everyone's back right but that's the thing right and so it's not this absolute thing like oh we have to design for like the Edward Snowden use case so Like An Enemy of the State who's fleeing three different intelligence agencies we must design the internet around that it's like I mean you can do that right like we had pgp pretty good privacy back in day probably before your time but there was this whole cryptography craze in like email and I doubt that ever got used by anybody at any scale because most people don't actually want to live their lives that way and so I'm not saying I mean again some measure of privacy obviously is good I'm just saying it's you know it's it's a spectrum it's not a binary and there's no Solutions there's trade-offs so what is the trade-off that we're doing with privacy I think that's interesting I I think like that's a really good perspective um I I do think that that like the problem with um privacy comes in and a lack of privacy among the public is sort of related to uh to centralization it's when you have aggregators that can use all of that data to um do something repressive against a certain segment of the population and this was like I know you said that there was not privacy in the you know the Constitution except for maybe like the fourth amendment and this is about unreasonable search and seizures right this is about the state having the ability to just look at your stuff and take it whenever they want right and that is some of the worry with mega corporate entities that you know Facebook has what like 2.5 billion people on it something like that's a massive data repository and it has information about it if you're in a year in a community and everybody in the community knows your business uh who cares I mean they're like that's a that's a community of a thousand but if you're if you're part of a population of 2.5 billion and subject to a repressive State regime and something you post online gets routed to you and then you get disconnected from your economy as a result your bank account gets Frozen that's where we start to get into dystopia and that's yeah I'm just wondering your reaction on that I mean like you probably agree like like us that that would be a pretty bad state to to get into but do you have any takes on that yeah I mean again privacy is weird and you can get into like I did a sub stack post on like the difference between web 2 and web3 privacy right there's there's this notion of what's called contextual privacy right privacy exists this is due to a Stanford academic who's published a lot about it um privacy exists within a certain context so like take for example what's considered private and web3 which is very strange web 2 right like imagine Amazon published to a public Ledger everything you bought on Amazon right you would have a total freak out and yet that's how that's how web3 works by default right but everyone's like oh well but it's pseudonymous so it's fine I mean it's sort of pseudonymous right if I want to make the FBI show up at my door I'll touch an ofac wallet and they'll show up way faster than anything else I can do in the conventional traditional so it's not even that private actually being on chain but yet somehow people mentally say well you know what I can always just get another wallet ID but everything about that wallet is known online right which I would never do on web 2. and so I think it's just it's a question of how you approach it right if you violate what is the context of that privacy you feel violated but as long as you play roughly along the rules it's kind of okay um and but yeah getting back to your question of like what if like you're An Enemy of the State and they try to crush you and like take away your Banks and all the rest of it it it's it's possible yeah I mean you definitely saw it in terms of like how deep in the stack does it go does cloudflare pull your blog offline like all these debates have been had like I think they were hosting Like A Nazi site or something at one point and you know uh the cloud for a wonder do I pull the plug on the Nazi side or not it's a good question it's a big debate I don't claim to know the answers but I I would say I think your right to distinguish between this one didn't have a government as an enemy like they like men with guns show up and stick you in jail versus Facebook trying to help you know REI sell you a sweater right that is just a different scale of threat and it's hard to imagine cases where literally all of American capitalism conspires to ruin you right so the last the last piece I just wanted to hear about so we talked about kind of the take rate being a negative of uh you know the Facebook social media um Monopoly and then loss of privacy the the other piece that's kind of circulated more recently is kind of this um the social media platforms becoming the new arbitrators of Truth oh God yeah don't get me started I did a whole post about it today I got so pissed off yeah yeah okay tell us about that is that another negative byproduct here do you see this if this is Rogan like the guy would be pulling up the Tweet right now um it's a one it's the one that I posted this morning I only I only tweeted like one thing this morning um it was it was it was me being kind of a dick and saying you know haha I was right so I I've been very consistently skeptical of the what we now call the content moderation regime right the thought that platform should be Arbiters of truth I have I've always been very skeptical of to be clear I am not a free speech you know absolutist I think they should be able to ban porn or hyper violent content I certainly think they should ban any sort of uh csam or you know child abuse material like that should obviously be crushed and and you know by all means possible but you know we're we're talking outside of porn and violence and obviously illegal activity right that's that's really the realm of debate the rest of it nobody really Hussein debates right um I've always been skeptical of it for two reasons one as someone who's been inside the machine and opened dashboards in which the numbers are all in the billions I just felt it was Impractical you just wouldn't be able to do it at scale in every country in the world it just wouldn't be possible right and then secondly even assuming you had some regime that sort of did it at some point it would be ideologically captured by one side or the other I'm not necessarily pointing figures to one side of the political Spectrum but there would be a contingent that says you know what this is actually good speech this is bad speech and it would be difficult to apply anything like an objective standard to it and that frankly in my opinion is what's happened right like ask yourselves this do you feel safer now like is is are politics less polarized now that you know Facebook is the Arbiter of Truth and actually has like an oversight board that sits in a closed conference meeting and like reviews decisions do you feel better now that like the Supreme Court of free speech is now sitting inside a conference room a Twitter or Facebook right it sucks and and I I've been calling this since 2017. it's a terrible idea actually and it's not good and it's not successful it's been a complete mess the question you talk to these people like oh well real content moderation hasn't been tried you need to hire more people do more things do this and that it's a joke what's the answer for that you just don't don't have the governance boards you just like it's just basic you know uh the First Amendment kind of Rights it's Freedom yeah yeah which which before like the reply guy chimes in like I understand Facebook doesn't have to abide by the First Amendment but if if you're arguing that they don't have to follow it you're basically saying what are my most valuable valued principles some big Corporation doesn't have to follow right broadly speaking a person of good faith who believes in the First Amendment wants more entities following it rather than fewer in society but doesn't that the algo itself also have to be some sort of moderator truth because it's going to surface what makes people more engaged because again the unit of currency is attention and I can get more blocks of human time to sell to the highest bidder if I can get that human being to spend more time on my app and so I'm going to program my lgos for engagement and for rage and things that maybe don't help the human being or the society in general like what about this line of criticism so two comments on that um one is I think you're right to hide the difference between freedom of speech and then reach those are different things um and I think there's a whole debate to be had there the second thing I would say is there's a lot of focus on the algorithm like humans always have a fascination with like the robots getting out of control like in mythologies of the gollum and you could so except there's some Fascination we have with we created a thing and it turned against us yeah like look right right and again I'm dating myself I don't even engage in these debates anymore because it just pisses me off as you can tell but I I also have a piece going back to 2017 just to cite the record by the way in which I said you know what if you think the algo is so important then explain WhatsApp right WhatsApp is just a messaging app there's no feed there's no algorithm it's end-to-end encrypted in theory like Facebook does nothing to affect what you see and yet if you use WhatsApp in a country where it's popular it's as crazy and ridiculous and [ __ ] posters and groups it's caused violence in Brazil and Indian elections like it's been a force for kind of negative things in the world there's no algorithm right here's the problem humans have decided to refract their entire existence through this and now everyone has one everyone literally already everyone has one that is for podcast listeners Antonio's holding up his phone I'm holding up my phone this is the problem this little black mirror is the problem we've wired everyone's brain to everyone else's right the algorithm might make it a little bit better or worse at the margin right but broadly speaking I don't think that's the challenge well we're not going back from that though right right who's willing to give away their little black device right I mean ludism right the butlerian Jihad which is like this thing this artifice in the Dune Universe in which oh they supposedly gave up machine learning because it was apocalyptic which is why you have these exciting knife fight scenes in Dune it was obviously a fictional artifice it's it's never happening right here's the real problem there's a truism in startups that like everyone thinks that what's broken in the startup is like a technical problem because that's what's easy to fix it's almost always a human problem right there's like that guy's an [ __ ] or that guy's a bad manager or the product roadmap is wrong there's always a human problem and here's the problem there is no technical solution we're not going to have more and better content moderation is going to fix Facebook we're going to fix the algorithm that is all [ __ ] I'm like I'm willing to make a bet I'll bet anybody tenith that that like five years from now you will not agree that things are better now because we have better content moderation as in fact you wouldn't agree that things are better now than they were four years ago when we started on this road right and that's a big bet because 10 years five years from now 10 East is going to be worth a lot right David a heck of a lot Advocate about moderation content modification uh where like okay there uh there's no such thing as like good content moderation it's always like a trap but if we just don't do content moderation and we just let like Twitter Facebook be a complete Public Square uh and let the participants just say whatever they they want to say uh then you get uh spam attacked you get bot attacked you get uh there are external third parties that will come in and manipulate the platform using whatever powers that they have whatever technologies that they have and then they become the content moderators because they they silence dissident uh they spin up puppet accounts and so if you do not engage in content moderation you just kind of enable some other third party to leverage your platform and then they become the content moderators well so now to be clear so content moderation remember I included things like you know nuisance accounts pornography violence like a lot of things I I'm for I'm not anti-content motivation more broadly I'm anti like disinformation or misinformation policing the thought that in a developing situation like covid or a war or whatever that you're going to be able to discern a true God's Own truth online I think is as ridiculous as a premise so I agree with you bot traffic is super annoying I have all these cryptobots following me on Twitter like those should just be wrecked but I I but I think this this like what is the standard right now in the united the United States of America at least it's what's the Brandenburg via Ohio standard which basically if you actually are inciting violence like physical violence like let's go kick that guy's ass right now illegal pulled off the stage gone right which I'm absolutely happy with if you incite violence online you're out of here right um so I again I'm not a free speech absolutist if you have a canonical version of events of you know various political stories or the origin of a certain disease or whatever it might be I just don't think you can actually arrive to truth Galileo would have been content moderated right just decided to read clear historical exam Martin Luther would have been booted off Twitter Ben Franklin would have been booted off Twitter and he was he was in a non-ship poster who wrote under 20 different names right he would have been better it off Twitter as well right what what content moderation regime are you going to accept that would get you know get that would Ben Franklin and Galileo would get caught in that's the problem right if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to

polygon arbitrum or Boba networks how many total air drops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn a I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop to plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and Tony I want to come out of this rabbit hole and go down a different one sure and this is where we can start to get into the blockchain web3 side of things uh you uh I'll be less agitated I'm sure it's just one of these things that I like I have [ __ ] PTSD about this is why I went back to Tech because I got tired of fighting about it online sorry go ahead I'm normally not like this listeners by the way I'm normally a very agreeable person just don't mention constantly experience myself okay I want to pick up the thread that we were talking about about how uh Amazon knows all of our consumer history knows what products we bought and if they publish that information we would be like upset you would see all the the crazy things that I've purchased that I don't want the bankless nation to know that what are this David just for the record yeah instead I'll show you my nft wallet and you can see all the nfts that I bought uh and wait those are got to be way more embarrassing I know what nfts you own my friend and so that's really the point right Amazon has all my data keeps it private I trust Amazon to keep it private um uh the blockchain uh is all my consumer uh stuff is completely public and you wrote this post called the right to never be forgotten uh and and so I want to go down that rabbit hole can you talk about just like the inversed nature between consumer data and identity in web 2 versus web3 yeah let me just explain the title for a second because some people might not get the reference so under gdpr which is the the reigning European Union law there's What's called the right to be forgotten and the idea like if I were to summarize gdpr and lawyers will freak out but basically two things who owns the data about you and who can you delete it those are basically the two questions and deletability is a big deal in gdpr and so the blockchain given that the data is typically spread over thousands possibly of nodes all over the world and nothing is really deletable in the real sense it's completely flies in the face of gdpr there's no way you can actually comply with gdpr if you had personal data on the blockchain and so that's a little bit of a snarky reference in the title and then yeah the inverted nature of it is I think we hinted at earlier in the podcast which is web 2 is mostly real identity right in private centralized databases in which what you do online and your financial Holdings are private right like that's that's a duality web3 is the inverse it is not the real you and that I don't know unless you attach it to your ens you know domain I don't necessarily know who David what David Hoffman's wallet ID is but assuming I figured out the wallet ID I have literally every embarrassing thing you've ever done at least without wallet right and somehow and so just to unpack that a little bit more uh davidhoffman.eath unequivocally my address yeah my other address is I actually am the only person that knows that so uh and so that so that's the pseudonymous right and so what you're saying is like this the status quo for an ethereum address Bitcoin address is that you actually don't know the identity of the owner uh but that is not true in web 2 because Amazon does know who exactly you are Facebook does know exactly who you are right right and and it it right in many ways web 2 and web 3 are analogous to each other and in some ways it's like the exact inverse and this is one of those cases where it's the exact Universe yep yep and can you just unpack the the significance of that like why is that a big deal well I mean if you're trying to comply with gdpr on chain which we are and it gets a little it gets a little squirrely um you know again how do you if you've got stuff that you've got on chain that you want to get rid like let's say you you applied the web 2 mentality to David Hoffman's public wallet because you like the wallet there's no way that you'd be able to delete those transactions that you ever owned some nft that you're not found embarrassing and the web 2 model you would be able to delete that right um and yeah so clear to the conception of what privacy means on the web 3 side is going to be weird and then the other where this really gets weird is that what are my theories and you know I'm curious what you guys think about it is that web 2 and web 3 are going to coexist for a long time right we're not going to have pure web 3 and pure web 2. if you look at examples like reddit's n of t uh Avatar thing like the user doesn't even really know they have a wallet like it's cool they can buy the thing they can actually sell it on open C like they have full web through functionality but by default it just kind of seamlessly works and it's obviously non-custodial um you know how do you square the two versions of privacy because like reddit's gonna know who you are with that wallet right they're going to know your cookie ID your login and so you've merged the streams right and any system of analytics attribution similar to spindle that spans the Two Worlds will also be able to have to join those things to make sense of it right if you ask the question how many guys came from Twitter or people came from Twitter and bought my nft well you've you've got to lose some some of the pseudonymity on the web 3 site to answer that question right and so how do you manage that that's the that's the question I think the part of this article that really stood out to me is like there's going to be some institutions out there that you are going to give your identity towards many like crypto exchanges have our government ID unequivocally they they know who we are through and through uh and then coinbase Gemini whatever your exchange is you send um money outbound uh from your account to an ethereum wallet which no one in the world knows whose ex that ethereum wallet is Bitcoin wallet um except for you and now coinbase because you just provided that information and so if we're taking like a gdpr perspective all of a sudden coinbase is now able to map your nation state identity to ethereum addresses and that if we go want to go back into the web 2 advertising model uh to unpack that like well now coinbase can look at your consumer behavior on chain and it's got to be really valuable probably pretty valuable consumer behavior all of this identity especially as the world of the metaverse bit gets built out Beyond Financial use cases all of a sudden we're talking about cultural use cases and now coinbase is the owner of so much data uh about you and and consumer data and Maps right back to what we were talking about with the Facebook ad exchange how how is this going to play out because this is like Harry and delicate yeah yeah and you know I'm not a big believer in applying cryptographic match oh we're going to ZK this and that it's like no there's a basic problem here which is you have like a physical driver's license that's associated to wallet ID right um yeah I can tell you how I think it's gonna go down and the approach spindle is taking because it's a problem that we face because again we're you know we launched with polygon they had an end of teammate for the World Cup and like they want to know like how well did this tweet do on a conversion basis so we have to kind of join that a little bit um the attitude we're taking is that and again we're going to be totally compliant with gdpr all the rest of it although I think we're gonna have to have new regulation because gdpr kind of doesn't apply to web3 basically we just delete the connection so like if you say you know what like I want out right like I just don't want to be tracked or you know if if polygon whoever offered the opt-out which by the way they're gonna have to like web3 hasn't gotten the memo on privacy yet like if you're if and it's like nobody's in compliance it's really weird because I'm like you know at some point the EU Regulators are going to show up um but if you want if you want out of it we just delete the match like wait that's it like liked it we're going to disassociate like the browser cookie or whatever it is with wallet ID and it's as if it's as if this match never happened like that's done you're as Anonymous and pseudonymous in line as you were before mind you it kind of sucks for polygon or if we eventually we work with magic Eden or openc or whatever because they're not going to be able to tell where you came from and again kind of Target things towards you and offers it maybe you want but yeah if you really want to be you know then you can do that right we Empower users to do that yeah I I don't know how that's all going to resolved it's very interesting like one thing that we know we need on the bait because you know Dave and I we talk a lot about base protocols on the base protocol we do need a privacy option you know the internet has HTTP it has https it has unencrypted things it has encrypted things that is clearly not going to be a you know privacy layer on on ethereum for example but there will be like specialized layer twos like Aztec that are complete privacy and no one can see in them it's kind of like you know a black box and you don't you're not leaking all this public data but but I'm curious Antonio I'm sorry just but out of curiosity how is adoption going for the Privacy chains I mean not so well yet right I I think I think that this will also happen like it could also be a niche right so like there's um there's there's certain protocols that I think are very important uh in that they um are useful if things go really bad for example right right like um I mean the original framers put this second Amendment rights if your government goes evil and you need to take up arms and fight the government then you have that right to do that right um privacy could be one of those things where we sort of don't need it unless things go bad and a whole group of whole population feels like opting out and then we have other Alternatives but if things are going well if our governments aren't evil uh if companies aren't preying on us then maybe people don't opt into that they don't need to opt into that so much it's kind of how I view it but it's also yeah really and look I I get the message and you know I I may or may not have an AR-15 in my closet as well to invoke the Second Amendment option but here's the reality and I'm saying this completely descriptively not normatively not taking an opinion at all but like this is the view from a web 2 boomer who's been like 10 years in this world privacy is never actually a product right um that anyone actually kind of pays for except for in extreme cases or when it comes to things like Financial stuff it's very hard to sell privacy as as a thing in and of itself it typically has to be coupled to some other value creation that people are willing to pay for I I think I think we agree with that I think like we've seen like Z cash and these attempts haven't gotten much adoption um but having that option is important Beyond privacy though can you tell us a bit more about this whole story so we've gone through kind of what you've seen in social media right coming out the other side and living with kind of like you know living living kind of the ad Tech world uh so what do you see when you look at web3 today and you've got a company that that you spun up it's called spindle and it's all around this problem of attribution right and before that before you said what you said earlier in this episode I don't think I really had a good definition of attribution but attribution is just did they buy the thing you're tracking to see if they bought the thing so why are you doing this in web 3 like what did you learn from web web 2 why does web3 even need this can you make the case for why attribution is important or good for for web3 yeah yeah um I mean there's a few reasons why I got into web3 right I mean it's tremendously exciting like to me it's almost like deja vu of the excitement in web 2 10 years ago and I wrote a post about when the whole FTX thing blew up that's like Dude guys like I know this is your first time going through it but relax like like the world comes back it's like the first.com boom like wrecked the entire US economy right it was way bigger than FDX and there was so much hate against all these companies okay can we just camp on that because a lot of people haven't they didn't see that so does this feel like the.com boom bust to you or no no it's way smaller it's like a way smaller hiccup it's so much smaller you realize that NASDAQ lost 80 of its value in 2001 after the.com crash like it wrecked lots and lots of people this is small in the scheme of things right if anything it says the crypto is still relatively isolated that the biggest or one of the biggest exchanges can blow up and people aren't like literally losing their houses in in Phoenix right like it was it's not the mortgage crisis in 2008 and I should also mention another thing to mention is like there's so much like what you would call wig history like a sort of perfect idealized history of how things went down dude I'm old enough to remember when Uber sounded like a stupid idea which it was initially it was literally only black cars running in Two Cities the whole uberX concept didn't exist like it didn't work in some cities like it was not actually a good idea the Airbnb seemed like a dumb idea early on Paul Graham has written an essay about it right they had to sell cereal at political and conventions because nobody was using it because who the hell would sleep in some stranger's house I was at Facebook when the ad system sucked like you literally could not you could not sell Facebook ads because it was so shitty right so like everyone assumes that all these companies were always amazing and always are great and there wasn't like this drum beat of haterade going all the time there was just like there is now in web 3. like all that hate was there and all the people who were like [ __ ] on web3 now who are gonna have to like eat crow five years from now when it takes off they're just gonna disappear and never refer to it again just like everyone who hated web 2 kind of disappeared and referred to it again right this is just this is just the eternal return of human Innovation so you know that part of but I wouldn't worry so much about what I like about web3 though is that it's like it is the wild west right like like we're like we're in like pioneering a new field as we build it which you can't do in web 2 anymore it's like it's like boring SAS it's buying some other dumb [ __ ] on your phone like there's nothing that radical that knew that interesting that exciting in web 2 anymore um and like if the web two guys who are being web3 like trolls or being honest with themselves the smartest Talent isn't going and working at some of these web 2 Giants anymore they're simply not you know dick Dixon uh describes it at web 2 as like sterile it feels like it is rather than like a real neighborhood it is and you know maybe maybe Chris and I are having midlife crazy because I'm old enough to remember web one and web 2 and that excitement of like oh there's this just like untrammeled Frontier and you have to invent all this [ __ ] to make it work and that just doesn't exist in web 2 anymore like those companies became the man that there were once the rebels against they just don't realize it right and web3 is kind of that rebellious thing right and so to me it was exciting but answering your specific question which is like why did I build spindle like I said I looked at web 2 and said like what should be a blockchain something like attribution or some you know some layer of shared State and I look at web 3 and like what is totally missing attribution right like I got introductions um to a lot of you know game developer and stuff and like hey what's your CAC like what's a CAC like well it's your customer acquisition cost like how much you pay to have that user come in there it's like I don't know we did an ft drop I'm like okay well did you check and see if the guys who got the nft like converted more than the guys who didn't no why not it's like well it's hard all we have is Dune like we'd have a good way of querying the data uh we don't have data science like I don't know they just it was there was no technology there for them and I don't mean to like being super critical these people like they're just working with the tools they have but there's no tools there to actually to measure this and the problem is like in my opinion web3 is not going to really take off in a big way until you have those tools because these are basic table stake stuff on the web 2 side it's not rocket science right yeah so tell us that story can you give us a story of what is a spindle if it's maximally successful what is the future blockchain world when we have this part of that world built out uh let me sketch It Out by maybe listing the questions that spindle can answer and that might be interesting Way say say you have I'm not going to name individual companies because we may or may not be working with them in any case I don't want to feel like I'm plugging them but let's say you have some web3 game in which involves like some nft game like something like well just a site when crypto unicorns or zedron all these games on polygon in which you buy and trade and breed nfts right and you're wondering okay what is my what is my LTV like how much money am I making off every user and if I'm paying them to use the game how much am I paying them is it a positive Roi trade how long are they sticking around retention is a major problem right churn is murder like you literally go through the funnel they use the app and they drop out and if that turn rate gets above a certain amount like think of your app as a churn rate of 20 that means you have to grow by at least 20 a month just to stay flat right that's how you that's how you that's how a mature company thinks about growth and I don't think a lot of web free companies are thinking about that because they had such explosive growth they didn't have to but now that we're in crypto winner money isn't free users aren't using the app they have to start asking themselves this question so like what is my what is my retention rate what does that mean a retention rate it's like okay I didn't nft drop or I had a Twitter social media campaign I got a hundred thousand new users how many stuck around a month later if that number is ten thousand versus ninety thousand one is a good app the other you're on the road to death you cannot survive a 90 turn rate uh force your magic cohort you have to either fix something or go out of business because it's over right and just quantifying these sorts of things are just the V1 of spindle there's a bigger Vision here right which is okay like if you think about how should user acquisition by which I mean there's a machine in which I put in money and I get users and more Revenue right which has to exist for any media ecosystem to exist right it doesn't have to be ads necessarily but there has to be some way to get users to come into your app right what does that look like going forward it's like well do we want to speed run the 10 to 15 years of AD Tech History I was forced to live in or do we want to LeapFrog to the right answer which is Advertiser should be able to say look I am a lending protocol and I want people to come in and put liquidity into my exchange and have it and stick around for more than a month that's what I want that's my that's my target event I'm the head of growth for Ave compound whatever that that's my target that's how I get paid how do I how do I do that right um spindle would help you answer that and structure that problem such that you can so how does it work right like let's just gets it to details um in the web 2 world right like when you buy a thing on Amazon like literally a signal goes out to Facebook or to the to the Amazon attribution system saying hey David came in and bought this thing right great how does it work on the blockchain sites like well usually that conversion event is on chain right it's like you literally did a currency swap in uniswap where you lent money to whoever or you bought the nft and so what we do is basically carve out a subgraph of the of the blockchain and say um this is the conversion event and so if you come and you buy the nft on open so you buy AI the crypto unicorn or whatever it is we capture that and actually index that event right and then we can join it and it's as simple as a single transaction hash that the event is a hash in the happiest case often often the actual conversion rent is a little more complicated right so like in a lot of these Web Two Three hybrids like the polygon nft mint they did two weeks ago for the World Cup how it worked is you just signed the transaction and then they sent you the nft so that you wouldn't actually have to pay gas fees because they didn't want users to get tripped up on having Matic right and so there it's a little weird because the transaction that like you didn't actually sign the transaction that gave you the nft but then we we did a little bit of finagling there and we made it such that okay whatever look the point is they got the nft and that's what you want to track and then you know using a little bit of clever front end code we could we could answer questions like okay how many mentors came from telegram versus Twitter for example or how many how many users did you lose on the landing page because the landing page sucked or maybe it didn't suck maybe they converted it and they actually signed in with their wallets at an enormous conversion rate but until you actually get what's called that user funnel together you don't really know how well you're doing all you see is like I don't know the men sold out or it didn't right and so without it you're just in chaos and endurance and with an attribution system you at least have some logic around the world can I can I sort of um frame this um a little bit differently and see if this uh this kind of resonates a little bit uh for for listeners and for you Antonio so I think some people listening to this in crypto and there's an undercurrent in crypto who are a little bit anti-marketing uh anti-anti growth and so they hear some of what you're saying and they're like great another marketing person entering crypto that's all we need right like tracking our clicks awesome cool and optimizing every click and grabbing more of our attention that's certainly one View and I think that has been a view that's sort of why you're encountering you know not only having companies haven't had to but I think culturally like many crypto companies like don't want to um but let me counter that with a with another idea that that I've been thinking of as I've learned about this one of the reasons in 2022 we gotten the mess we did with Celsius and with blockfi and with um FTX and others is because we were forced to funnel all of the growth of crypto into centralized intermediaries and one of the big reasons was because we didn't have a growth engine working for defy and for nfts and for quote-unquote real decentralized crypto and they did it was very easy for an FTX and a sand Bank been freed and his growth team to track clicks using all of the traditional web to uh infrastructure and pump growth and benefit that way it would was very easy for them to do that very difficult for a protocol like Ave to do something similar for its lending and borrowing protocols why because they don't have the web 2 infrastructure they don't have the attribution they can't tell you how to attract new liquidity the only thing they can do is do shotgun approaches like liquidity farming and giving away essentially like protocol value and doing it that way it's very expensive and guess what if we don't improve in this area we're going to continue to lose to web 2 centralized C5 companies that do and we all know what happens if we lose to C5 companies that's another way of me thinking about this and I'm wondering what you what you think about uh would that take Antonia dude that's exactly right we're actually hiring for BD person Ryan if you want to join spindle.com you've made the perfect that is exactly the case for spindle that is exactly it right we're we're not we're building a fully web3 native attribution system so that the truly web3 companies can actually do the growth that they need to do like I it might sound cynical but you know you're going to have to have a growth strategy of some sort that's more than just sprinkling nfts and liquidity bonuses and even if you do that you're going to still have to track those and see where it works best and where it works less well right so yes that that is that is the goal to yeah let me ask you about an underlying concern let's say we get this it's good we have attribution we have some of the the tools that that web2 had in web 3. um how do we not make the mistakes that web 2 has made all right how do we not become them I we talk about this all the way uh like all the time in Bank list right this is a bankless movement right do more without banks um but the question always The Meta question the back of our minds is bankless is how do we go bankless without establishing a new set of bankers and becoming them how do we set up that defensive perimeter and embed that in the social contract and can you do that with attribution are we just going to become web3 Facebook 3.0 whatever yeah that's a very good concern because again if we end up in another Google Facebook duopoly that's like a major fail for web3 and just to be clear that's not at all spindle's aim whatsoever just because I work there it's I kind of know the Beast we're not trying to reproduce the Beast here right how you do it right and this was part of the original promise of a lot of programmatic AD technology you you make you embrace web3 you make it permissionless you make it trustless you make it composable like right now we're thinking about how we're going to work with you know potentially other partners in the sort of web3 marketing space to make it easy to work with an attribution system right but again it's going to be fully Unchained fully transparent there is no there's no way that it hopefully there's no way that a Facebook or Google emerges from this who just sits there in a cruise value right the the cool thing about web3 right to Echo Dixon read write ownership right you have true creators who are creating things you have their fans who want to enjoy that creative you have brands that want to dress their users you have apps you want to dress your users as well that's where the value is that's the cool part right the the you know the Facebook sitting in the Middle with a 70 take rate that is that is the enemy and that is not the goal so anything we have to do has to be geared around that that's right and and I think if we do this right it'll be impossible to have like a Facebook sitting in the middle of it hopefully this is cool Antonio so so uh We've appreciated your time and and just maybe as we close I'm curious like maybe a personal question what gives you kind of the energy to do this I mean you you were around during.com boom bust you did 2008 and that was crazy that was crazy that busted and then you did the whole web 2 thing you wrote that you wrote a best-selling book chaos like you've done all of this stuff now here we are in 2022 I imagine you don't have to to have to work for financial reasons uh I'm imagining you're enjoying what you're doing um why why are you giving it another go why are you like because this is not a one to two year project to me what this sounds like is another five-year type thing in order to get this off the ground what gives you personal energy right now I mean my kids tuition bills maybe um it's it's partially true um yeah no it's exciting I mean I I I've had the good luck of being kind of in the right place at the right time like with Facebook right I kind of chanced into it to be honest but it's a sort of place where if you have the right idea and the ability to execute you can totally change kind of the course of a technology and that's super exciting right for as much as I kind of bitched and moan about Facebook and Chaos monkeys it was a hugely exciting thing that frankly in retrospect I should have appreciated more but now now I do in retrospect I do appreciate it right and I think that weird little tingle I got when I'm like you know what I should pitch stuck on like outside targeting and joining like this is gonna like totally upend the apple cart and like who knows what it really does but it's gonna be big right I had that same tingle when it like I started thinking through what web3 needs and had a bit spindle it's like okay you know it's a whole Archimedes cliche about like applying the lever and moving the world or whatever like there's some like I think it's the right place it's the right time it's it's the right person hopefully the right team and it's just I don't know it's tremendously kind of exciting I think I have one like big startup thing left in me and then then I'll then I'll really move to the island or the sailboat and just never turn off my Twitter account this is here forever but I think for the next five to ten years we've got a window to really change the way web3 work and also like I you know ideologically I'm in the Chris Dixon Camp of like let's wreck the fan companies web3 is a new internet let's create it like to me have to find a web three like forget all the reasons that I've told you about why I think it's cool I'm just tired of talking about Facebook and Google and apple like I just I'm just like I'm so [ __ ] tired of hearing about these people like I just want a whole nother internet that doesn't involve them and that I don't have to think about oh what's Google going to do if I build this thing I don't care I don't want to think about that I don't want big giants in the picture that can just crush me right and so yeah building an alternative internet I think is important right that's that's not a big deal yeah we absolutely love that sentiment when we talk about uh going bankless it's uh in direct opposition to uh Wall Street but it's also Silicon Valley too uh it is the intermediaries and the Arbiters of our experience on the internet that we definitely want to to Route Around Antonio one last technical question with um uh web3 the this the the theme of this podcast has been just like the ad model of web 2 as it's going to change but still still exist in web 3 same same but different yeah and and I want to unpack that that different thing a little bit where I don't think uh in my intuition my gut tells me that where like when the nothing's new Under the Sun we're still going to have attribution we're still going to have advertising in web3 but it's not going to be a one-to-one the same thing it's going to look different and so uh hopefully uh if this goes in line with my general thesis for for this base the ads and AD model of web3 is going to be there's going to be more creativity there's going to be more culture there's going to be more alignment with the user there's not going to be a sort of like this oppressive owned relationship when you think about the ad model in web3 how is it going to be different how might it be a little bit more vibrant and and fulfilling as users of this internet yeah I mean to be clear to your listeners I'm using ads in a very abstract level of like a piece of media that drives a user action so like nft drops I think our web 3's first ads right it's addressable media you can send it to somebody they may not engage but maybe they do um but I'm with you that I think if we end up in the world of like little display ads I mean that would just suck that would be skiomorphic to use Dixon's term like there has to be something cooler maybe it's something like forecaster um which small investor in full disclosure um or like a web 3 version of tick tock where like I'm an influencer but I own the nft as you know the video as nft and if a brand comes in and wants to use it they can promote that to some other thing and I still get paid and there's an attribution system by the way that tracks it all right like it has to be something interesting and cool that's not just like little colored squares like interrupting your mobile experience it cannot be that um and I I don't know that's why to be honest that's why I didn't build like an ad system per se because I think it's really up in the air and it's really early um but hopefully it's something around again Brands influencers creators there's like a personal connection like that's the luxury good in the digital economy like the connection that I have with that artist and that interaction somehow doing that in a non-obnoxious way that still gets the Creator paid and pays for the forecaster or whatever the publisher is in the future like that's the thing I'm not sure what it looks like but I know that I know it has to be attributed to some degree so that's why I'm making the bet that I am but I'm hoping that there's a lot more consumer adoption inside web 3 so that we can start experimenting with these models to see what I I personally like forecaster but um I'm a Dau on firecaster but um yeah things need to get crazier like we need to turn up the crazy knob somehow and yeah have different media experiences yeah 100 100 yeah if the ad model the the acquisition attribution all this stuff um if this goes from invasive and uh uh like a banner ad is like invasive right and it kind of It kind of just gets in the way right if we go from invasive to enabling and this is again just a general thesis I have for the space where web2 extracts web 3 enables uh the ad model for web3 should enable us to be better to access cooler things uh and Antonio if that is what you are working on it at spindle to help support that platform I'm all for it so thank you for joining us here on with the bankless nation to talk about the story and hopefully how web3 ads can be uh enhanced our lifestyles rather than extract from them yeah yeah definitely thanks for having me guys it's been fun banglades Nation uh we appreciate you hanging out with us some action items after today's episode you'll find these in the show notes as always read the post that we talked about the right to never be forgotten santoni's post about privacy web 3 contrast versus web 2 also is post on why he started spindle and what problem it's solving we'll include those links in the show notes of course gotta remind you risks and disclaimers and Antonio this is the part where we ask our guest to read these out if you're willing okay am I am I reading this yeah okay crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank
