i was already kind of thinking oh my gosh how are we gonna you know how are we going to simultaneously create these freedoms but also you know make the world a better place and make give people money welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because the theorem is people all the way down and it always has been today on the show we're talking to carl florsch who is one of my main inspirations for uh overall being in crypto but even the introduction to layer zero itself cypherpunk's understood the code they write impacts the people that use it uh and and carl is one of these people that is very intimately attached to this part of the crypto world and what he's doing over uh with optimism the optimism layer two and retroactive public goods funding goes to the heart of this issue um carl i call him the eternal optimist he just exudes energy he exudes positivity and i think he's really just emblematic of the ethos and values that drives this industry and that's how he's found his way towards what i call like the core beating heart of ethereum the people that are driving towards public goods and building a more sustainable future and answering the question of what that even means in the first place uh and so we go from uh carl's just beginnings in the into the crypto industry and how he started working with vlad zamfir and vitalik buterin on on just consensus protocols and then we go all the way to how retroactive public's good funding solves basically humans biggest problems which is if you imagine us as a school of fish how do we direct the school of fish towards a better place so we use this school of fish metaphors throughout the podcast to illustrate some of these grand meta problems of humanity um when you are an individual in a school of fish you don't have a lot of power but we need to make collective decision making as a big school of fish and we can't just be swimming around in circles we actually need to go somewhere and so we use this metaphor throughout to talk about just consensus protocols and tinkering with incentives and we go from there and talk about what does society look like when we can finally put a steering wheel behind this like nebulously defined school of fish and where can we go so i think you will absolutely enjoy one of my favorite conversations on layer zero so far right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you're

are you how are you good good good man i'm excited to do this uh people that have been paying attention to to the bankless podcast for a while will know that you're one of the main influences i have for for coming into this space so being able to do this podcast specifically a layer zero podcast with you is is gonna be i'm really excited for this my man well i feel very blessed to have had my you know played my part in that this story and oh my gosh see what what has happened to this ecosystem now that you're in it and all of these other people like it has been a wild journey right yeah yeah so i mean i came in class of 2017 because i had people leadership like you and like other people on the optimism team and vitalik obviously all of his content were paying attention to you guys whereas like i don't know there's a lot going on in this world of crypto in the era of 2017 but what what they're paying attention to i think is the right thing to pay attention to and that was kind of like the last moment i stopped paying attention to i started prioritizing ethereum as an ecosystem but i don't like did you have that same did you like who's your carl florsch like who who is that for you my conflict is 100 vitalik okay i uh i just happened to want to you know do peer-to-peer technology because i was like okay google is investing all of this uh uh you know in effort into centralized technology so there must be a market opportunity for decentralized technology and so i just like was looking up peer-to-peer stuff and i found the devcon zero youtube videos and i saw vitalik and i saw vlad and they were talking about like consensus protocols and like not just doing file sharing with peer-to-peer but literally rebuilding a peer-to-peer internet from the ground up and i was like okay this is it i'm leaving my job let's go okay so it was also youtube content that that got you into this space oh 100 100 i had no i don't think i had any like real world human connections into crypto it was f 100 the internet and then meetups and that's where i met all these people and so i'm sure you must have heard of bitcoin by at that point in time but were you compelled by it no i really i mean okay i uh had heard of bitcoin um i was somewhat interested but it really sounded like some like libertarian you know hibijubi kind of weird thing and i was just like oh like that that doesn't speak to my revolutionary side in the same way it's like just money right i want i want something that is like reform you know that is like change in like a more fundamental level and i don't i wasn't compelled by the like you know add money to the internet and everything is worked out narrative right okay so you knew that bitcoin as a technology existed you understood it to some degree but then uh you were at google uh and and what was the impetus to uh not not at google not at google i was at in college considering where i was going to work and considering all of these things and i'm like oh everything i can apply to is just like going to centralize the world even further right like it's i just had that entrepreneurial spark right i wanted to set out into new lands okay so uh that's crazy that you went straight from college and into this uh did you think in terms of decentralization and centralization because that's a lot of people's like awakening moment when they came into crypto they're like oh i didn't even understand this concept of centralization versus decentralization and all of a sudden there's this new fascination with this word decentralization did you already think in those terms before you found crypto i did because i was learning about the net neutrality stuff and the you know fight for the the internet and like i i really was inspired by torrance and peer-to-peer file sharing and i was like oh there's something here like i want to create an internet i i'm also into music right so i well i had a very personal connection to this because i witnessed as i was in college and before as i was just growing up the kind of shift of artistry from pre-internet era to you know post internet or in the internet era and that shift was like how do artists make money and i'm thinking intuitively as a consumer of music i want to have access to everything right but then at the same time as a producer of music i want to pay and get paid for the music that i'm creating and be a part of a economy that values me um and so that kind of spark was like okay so there's something about this peer-to-peer tech that is like really freedom preserving but then at the same time we're not quite there yet because we're not paying the artists properly and so it was like this i was already kind of thinking oh my gosh how are we gonna you know how are we going to simultaneously create these freedoms but also you know make the world a better place and make give people money okay so yeah you saw all these components floating around in the then state of the internet you saw like distributed systems uh and that piqued your interest but then you also were interested in value creation as a creative person and you saw like there's something here like what happens when we smash these two together how do we even smash these two together in the first place and so you're probably asking questions like that and that's where you started typing these questions into youtube and that's where you found the devcon zero videos yep that's exactly right and then what did you do next so i um i was in college i was about to graduate i had a networking kind of open source job i was going to work in like web 2 but it was open source because i was obsessed with open source as well um and i was working on this like peer-to-peer cdn but then i saw these devcon or devcon zero excuse me defcon zero videos and i was just like okay this is a different design paradigm so i just started binging content oh my gosh and then i i just so happened to live in new york city and so i heard consensus was in brooklyn so i cold emailed one of the people at consensus um and was like hey i would love to talk about ethereum with you and grab coffee and they were so kind as to allow me to do that i then immediately went to a meet-up that night where i met all of these ethereum people that i had seen on the internet out of like wow star struck because everyone on the you know everyone that i had seen or heard is there in person i was like amazed that this had happened so quickly and then i was just like okay let's go oh i have this so embarrassing story i started working out of the consensus office while working my job remotely and there was a photo shoot from the new york times that came into the consensus office it photographed me and i ended up in the new york times article a new kid on the blockchain and my boss saw me like what are you doing in this consensus article like i mean about blockchain i had talked to them but i hadn't talked about quitting my job anyway one month into that job i had i had quit it was a great job uh very blessed to be working in open source but i did not look back that is the uh the foot in the door into web3 store i've ever heard so your boss finds out you're gonna be leaving by a new york times article oh my god and so okay you got your first job at consensus yes i did and i was working on ujo which is like an og nft you know music payment application audios before its time right certainly certainly okay cool well how talk a little bit more about just like you mentioned how fast it all happened as in like you and that you like speed ran that where you're like okay uh smash my interest together open source uh consensus i'm in new york and then i'm gonna meet all these people that i just was watching on the youtube and like i don't know it seems like a very compressed amount of time one thing i've said about the crypto industry is once you get into the industry climbing your way up to the top there's not that many rungs up to the top of the crypto industry but you like speed ran that thing just like to elaborate a little bit more on that part of the story so i mean i lived and breathed crypto and i just was grabbing any opportunity that i could to kind of meet the coolest people and learn the coolest things and it wasn't because i wanted to like progress my career or anything i just wanted to contribute in a major way to what was a tiny industry right and i really wanted to you know have an impact so i started you know my website carl.tech and i just like you know talk carl.tech to everybody which you can go carl.tech um but nonetheless it was this really interesting experience where i would go to these conferences and i would just talk to the people that i respected the most not because of who they knew or how fancy they sounded but because they had some cool and crazy ideas and i had my own ideas that were you know uh kind of bubbling around but i wanted to learn from the masters and so i kind of talked to vlad zamfir and i just was like hey i'll do work for you i you know vlad zamfir is this og consensus protocol kind of core ethereum researcher and i was willing to learn his consensus protocol work and just do work for him like whatever he said whatever he needed i was happy to do and i just you know wrote some python with him and then that gave me this this kind of door or this like foot in the door to you know going up to vitalik and being like hey vitalik uh you're at a crypto conference i've seen you all the time but i've been working for vlad on his consensus work like can i help you with your consensus work as well because we're these are early days trying to work on casper trying to build out the core consensus protocols of ethereum and there were almost no people who had the skills to do that and i didn't have the skills but i just binged content like 24 7 web 2 decentralized uh distributed system stuff and then just like asking for help and it ended up being you know it turned out that vitalik didn't really have enough support at the time to get all of the ideas that he wanted you know implemented implemented and so i just ended up working for him thankfully you know consensus is a really free organization and they allowed me to um help vitalik and help vlad on their uh you know consensus protocol research because it helps ethereum right that's a magical thing about ethereum right consensus is a company within the ethereum ecosystem which meant that i could as i could contribute to the ethereum the broader ethereum ecosystem and that would be directly incentive compatible with consensus like that is a magical thing that crypto enabled and so i just took advantage of that right wherever i could yeah uh and i think i'm gonna go ahead and guess that people like vlad and vitalik maybe they weren't as skeptical as they are nowadays now that the crypto industry is like a trillion dollars in market cap and there's a bunch of other incentives out there but uh carl something out of you is just like you exude not trying to like you know uh join the top ranks of like crypto celebrities or trying to like show your new project or something but like when you talk to vitalik and be like oh i would like to do work and help like it's easy to trust carl because of it's very easy to see that you are doing it for the right reasons uh and and this is i think it's something that i think a lot of listeners should take away from is that if you come in with the intent to help with the intent to build and not to leverage clout or to leverage you know other or other incentives then people just like adopt you in their social circles and then you just become a part of those social circles and that's how you join the community is that kind of how it felt for you yeah that 100 like you have to leave your ego at the door like i was a student and i you know continue to try to cultivate that mindset because that is the way i mean what is the point of doing things if we can't learn i mean i love i personally love learning and i was just so interested in this subject matter and i wanted to help in whatever way i could and i was i was honestly really lucky that i was in the right place at the right time to help but if you make yourself available you know constantly over and over again then hopefully right you roll the dice and wow now you're in a position where you're actually able to make a contribution to join these circles and to help the people that you most look up to like vitalik is a hero of mine and continues to be now that you know i'm i'm friends with him and i you know it's i just i feel really blessed to be in this community and have made the friends that i that i have uh so you you came out of college and like just jumped head first into this thing and and so you understood computer science you knew you knew like the basics and uh maybe maybe more than the basics but at some point in time like you when you run into the world of crypto like it's just a frontier of unknown knowledge and so like how long would you say it took for you to start working on some of these problems of crypto consensus problems before you were like perhaps the expert on them as in like you knew more than basically almost everyone except for a few key members of of this whole industry like how long did it go from like you know college graduate to crypto economic expert it took a few years i will say but i mean realistically nowadays it's probably even longer that the syllabus is jam-packed at this point um however what happened for me was i spent about a year fully immersed like 100 all everything i thought about i was daydreaming about crypto protocols and like incentive protocols this was a dream come true legitimately a dream come true and with that i kind of did speed run as you say through this knowledge and this information um and it actually kind of brought me to my my the the kind of next chapter well uh of of my story read i i well i had two chapters really first i started working on on casper and literally coding the consensus protocols so that was a huge uh uh kind of shift from theory to actual practice right i like wrote the first you know the alpha casper test net casper is now the you know ethereum uh eth2 uh proof of stake protocol so created this test net and like learned a lot about what a consensus protocol is writing the actual code for a consensus protocol and let me tell you i struggled through that code i was it was that was really out auto lib right there for me um but i made it through made it through and i will i dare say i made some contributions you know it was actually a useful piece of software um which i'm very very very grateful for so that kind of got me you know this real world uh experience i'm still i will say one thing when you're jumping into a new field like this cultivate your naive optimism i will say that right now because there are a lot there were a lot of fundamental computer science things like you know lessons that i was just reinventing left and right and so was vitalik and so were a lot of these early crypto people like their these consensus protocols and these you know designs have been around for a long time from sharding like scaling distributed systems there's a lot of prior art but you can kind of reinvent a lot of the prior art or figure it out on your own if you if you think about it it's not you know inaccessible and so having that you know going out there and actually doing in the thing was a kind of bridge or a gateway for me to to really learn the theory in a very deep way and at what point in time did you start to really think meaningfully about like the because the cool thing about web3 and crypto is that when we build out these systems values get embedded in them right and you know you you can probably think about these things in the web 2 context right like when we tinker with fake facebook's algorithm uh the atoms of the world change and so when we think about the algorithm then we also are in need to also be thinking about in what ways does it change the atoms of the world like when did this become like a part of your your fascination oh that was definitely early on that's like 2015 2016 era um my i i think one of the best ways to put it mike golden actually gave me this great uh quote um crypto allowed us to program money programming money means we can program incentives and programming incentives means we can program people and that was simultaneously the scariest thought and the most exciting thought because my god if you can with your hands write a computer program that programs the way that people behave on a massive scale that is the biggest single impact that i think anyone can hope to have right we are the most intelligent beings like we talk about artificial intelligence all the time you know and we're super excited by gpt3 holy cow right but you go on the internet before gbt3 exists and you can see a heck of a lot of you know dolly two generated things but generated by human beings because we are that intelligence and so i i like just the idea of having access to this incredible resource and that is like human ingenuity and creativity that is where we can make this huge huge impact so i was just enamored by that that concept and that the focus of crypto was programming incentives and programming social structures as opposed to programming apps and and the the human interacting with the app is a kind of an afterthought and you know i think that in some sense video game design is close to crypto in that it's all about thinking about how the person is like interacting with the game right it's already you know the game design is probably not a uh a mistake um and so i was very into video games and so i just love this concept that we can program mass action um that's a really interesting uh framing where like facebook's algorithm twitter's algorithm these are products where the incentive is the byproduct of them like oh we accidentally caused a civil war rather than like accidentally going causing it right like that's what facebook accidentally did uh but then when in the world of web 3 like we no we're going straight for the heart of it we are actually trying to reprogram crypto and like that's actually that vibe is is baked into a lot of crypto memes like the whole uh bitcoin fixes this meme where like you know there's a problem out there and then the bitcoiners will say bitcoin fixes this what they're really saying is that like the incentive structure around hard money fixes this problem right and so like they they understand that they're going straight for the incentives as well but like yeah you said it was one of the most like intimidating and scary like realizations like when we were going straight for the heart of just like yes this line of code is meant to manipulate humans hopefully for the better like how with great power comes great responsibility like does this how does this hang on you is this is this like hard to tussle with absolutely i i really do think that um this moment in time might be i mean if it's not okay that's great but it's a solid chance that this is an inflection point where human beings have a lot of authority and autonomy and power and control of you know our destiny as a kind of a a group and so programming us and and kind of building the incentive structures if we build those incentive structures without the right you know mindfulness we could actually end up undermining our own authority and our own power to then influence the next incentive structure that is that is created right like this is an iterated game we're creating the incentive structures for you know the next couple years which will then create the next set of incentive structures and the next set of incentive structures and so if the trend is as it is right now which is decreasing autonomy and decreasing power for the individual which i do think there's a solid argument for at this very moment if that trend continues that is a very scary future that we live in because i the thing that makes me confident that my like life will improve as a human being on this planet the thing that makes me really confident about that is that all of the other human beings are in the same boat right like i'm talking to you you want a better life for humanity i want a better life for you like we all want that so if if we start creating systems that actually put take us out of the picture that is so scary and so possible is this is this a similar subject matter to like um like there's this realm of like ai safety thought out there where like oops we accidentally made this generalized ai because that's really cool thing to make uh but then it then it gets out and then it all of a sudden like takes over the world and we can't there's no command z button on that like that i'm fearful of like a similar thing with crypto protocols we're like oh we've we've created these crypto protocols they've self-propagated they self-perpetuated uh we've we threw away the keys so we can't change anything and now they have the outcome of these incentives of these crypto protocols because we didn't build them right uh makes us do all these bad things that we don't know about but like there's no command z on that either right this is the same sort of dilemma yeah exactly and i do think that the part of the interesting thing about this whole like ai safety issue is that it's really easy to anthropomorphize ai because you're like there's a machine and it has a will and it's doing things it's acting in the world right but it's harder to anthropomorphize collective action and like us as a species where we are headed and social systems and governance but it is still similarly you know anthropomorphizable right we could have created the artificial general intelligence like the thing that is important that might already exist and we are kind of playing out its its will in our economy as we speak right that is totally a thing that you know i i do think uh is a perspective that we don't really think about and and what you're talking about how we have a kind of ai safety problem it's almost like an uh human economy safety or human directionality safety problem where we're like we need the economy our economies that we live in and the thing the social structures that we live in we need those to promote human values and promote our intentions and right now we don't think very thoughtfully about where our collective you know systems are going and it's pretty scary you know what one model i have for how daos work and or these distributed organizations where there are no like boundaries it's like a school of fish or like a murmur of starlings where like yeah each each individual fish in a school of fish just places itself next to a fish points itself in the same way uh swims about in the same direction at about the same speeds and and then those relationships between all the fish creates the school of the fish but your individual choices do impact your neighbors and that can like murmurate throughout the whole entire thing but what is not possible by a single fish is like directing the whole entire school right and so like everyone in the school of fish can like see some sort of shadow and then we're all like all right move left uh and then all of a sudden that like this that response to that can actually like accidentally like drive us over a cliff because we don't the individuals have control over their own part of the group like the grand system but what are the incentives of the whole system right like what are like the if we can conceptualize this thing as a whole how do we make sure that that doesn't steer itself in the wrong direction just by the micro decisions of the individuals right like how how do we do that and like a lot of like this fascination in the dallas base of like snapshot votes let's all vote on this thing but like we're all voting on these choices and we can only see so far into the future and we don't actually know like the longest term time horizons have you thought about like how to how to make people think in longer term more system level uh structures yes i have indeed uh i will say that my journey in crypto was really a search for the algorithm that would coordinate humanity right it was like i wanted this honestly it was i was hoping it was like a financialized algorithm where i could deploy this one smart contract and boom all of humanity would now self-organize and go into a good direction and it was so simple and beautiful but unfortunately i think the reality is actually a little bit more complicated than that but i also think it is beautifully elegant or at least it could be so uh you know uh the this is where retroactive public goods funding comes in the picture for me so uh basically when you're talking about where you know it's really hard for these organizations these school of fish to direct where they are going right we don't know where we don't know how to predict that kind of future but what i'm hopeful is that of is that we can actually determine where we are with respect to where we once were so what has changed and what has been a positive change and what has been a negative change and i want us to be able to quantify that and kind of understand the the things that we like and we want to see more of and the things that we don't like and we want to see less of and then once we've got an understanding of basically where we used to be and where we are now that we can all agree on right we can all kind of have some it's not everyone's going to agree 100 right because what i want is different from what you want but we can come up with something that is like roughly you know for maybe my community my circle of friends we can all agree on what things we like and then we can make sure that we are rewarding the people who are giving us the things that we want and that is i like it's it's kind of this funny thing where i think rewarding behavior that we want to see is almost the most fundamental but also the most dumb and simple thing that crypto can do right this whole idea of like air drops being given to like users for using a protocol like that is the most rudimentary form and kind of dumb form of this but i think there's actually something really special there um so i do think that we can actually as a you know collective many schools of fish it's not just one school of fish right it's all of these daos all of these doubts that are going to be made up of other dows it's going to be this crazy system ecosystem i hope that we can start getting a better you know directionality and more intentional directionality part of what you said made me think of um like the story of humanity grows and grows and grows and like our coordination systems grow larger and larger and larger and more more effective and they get more humans onto the same coordination system is part of uh your vision for this crypto industry with the goals the meta goal of crypto is to put all the humans on the same coordination thing like we're all we're all on the same page is that like one of the meta goals here absolutely and that medical has to be achieved both from uh a kind of meme perspective like we need to talk about that as a medical and we have to make sure that people know that we're all headed in we're trying to head in the same direction um and then we also need our systems to reflect those medicals and that's really like the the the kind of definition of public goods right we that it's been very confusing but generally people think that it's uh uh things that are good where that aren't being rewarded enough but that produce positive externalities and what do positive externalities mean that just means that it like benefits a large group of people so the more that we can create systems that kind of bring that that kind of build on each other in this cooperative way the more bullish i am on us all having a kind of uh a a part in defining what the future looks like in a voice in that future like i don't want us to cut out you know i don't want to cut out don't want us to cut out human beings in general i also don't want us to cut out various groups of human beings like i do really think that the the ideals that you know uh uh have divine defined uh modern times around you know voice and participation and equality and like those kinds of things they're generally pretty useful for keeping people on track and on the same page and minimizing suffering yeah you talked about it being at the meme layer at the social layer first where we need to get everyone on board with hey we are having this conversation as like there's this pocket of like ethereum researchers and other crypto people that are like trying to create the incentive structure for the whole rest of the world hey guys you should kind of be paying attention to these conversations say we successfully because like there's a there's many many parts of the world right like there's the the average joe that like puts on his suit and goes to work and uh the the the lady the woman that goes and takes kids drops kids off at daycare then they come back and they have family meal every once in a while they get a ballot in the mail to vote on their democracy and then for that one part of that four year cycle they think about the incentives of their particular nation state but then the other nation states have different like organizations and other incentives and and like we're all trying to get on the same page but like so many people are busy with their own like day-to-day lives that like and like getting everyone on board with this whole like hey guys we're redesigning the whole entire incentive system for humanity uh is like a kind of a tall ask but if we were to get there and like all of a sudden like every human is like oh i get it like we're tinkering with incentives uh and i want uh a stake at this table right i want to express my my version of what i think good incentives are imagine like where like if if the most bullish case for this crypto industry getting really sci-fi here the most bullish case for this crypto industry is everyone has the at least the knowledge that they have the option to communicate their expression of incentives and all of a sudden we have like this new species on planet earth with their humans but now we know that there's like this this meta goal like hey we have this meta goal here like all the humans are on board with like there's this medical we need to figure it out uh what what happens next and so like when we have that future where like all the humans are on board with like okay we we get to pick where the school of fish goes right like all the the mini fish all become aware of the school of fish and that like when our when we turn to the left we actually turn the whole thing to the left and all of a sudden all these fish these micro fish have the ability to steer them the meta fish humans have never had that ability before to steer the meta meta school of fish of humanity like are we ready for that like what happens next okay so first off you know i work on optimism i work at it on ethereum and so uh you know i'm a but i these are these are my views i am i'm a crazy person i believe this though this is it this is where we're going so here is the future that that i see right i do not expect that your average individual is going to be able to let's say vote on whether or not we should prioritize uh you know cleaning up the oceans or technology which takes carbon out of the the atmosphere right i don't think that we can do that but i do think that every individual is is deserves the ability to say hey i am living in a part of the world that is negatively affected by this you know big you know let's say i'm negatively affected by some kind of climate related thing just to continue on the climate situation i'm negatively affected by that and i'm going to put my opinion out there that this is something that's harming me and something that we should prioritize and lots of people start saying i'm negatively affected not saying that i know the solution not saying that i know where we're gonna go out of that but that this is how i feel right and i think i am entitled to the ability of saying hey this is how i feel about my local government about my you know the parks in my neighborhood about the you know the weather like all of these things i'm entitled to that and so then what we can have and i'm a i'm a crazy you know marcus person right i'm simultaneously this like social you know socialist crazy person but i'm also this libertarian crazy techno libertarian crazy person it's a very weird combo but that's what crypto does too i swear it really does oh my god um anyway so i think we should all express this opinion that's a socialist in me right but i also think we need markets to solve these problems right i don't think that we're going to be able to say vote on the solution to global warming that's crazy sauce but if we can empower the people who are innovators who are listening to this podcast who are you know out there trying to solve problems and make a positive impact if we can empower those people with the knowledge that they will be rewarded for their innovative solution to take carbon out of the atmosphere or clean up the oceans or you know help the environment in a local area which has acid rain right like all of these things if we can have the entrepreneurs you know empower them and empower the investors so the investors know the investors instead of thinking of the you know the vcs as the enemy right imagine the vcs as talent agents that are investing in the best works that are going to push forward humanity right like imagine the problem solving capabilities that we would be able to achieve like the the the internet that i want to use in the future is one that is protecting my rights at all times that gives me the right to exit from the the the services that i'm using that gives me a you know peace of mind that you know what i'm saying is private when i wanted to be private or as public when i wanted to be public and and and my my even all the way down to my you know my local neighborhood has the right uh parks and that we can solve these uh pandemics and global warming like just the meta problem that allows you to solve the other problems it's like teaching yourself how to study or like how to work hard right like that if you can do that the sky is the limit and my gosh if we can empower the brains on this earth that is the most powerful force of intelligence that we have at our hands the brains being like the entrepreneurs or the problem solvers yeah the brains being the entrepreneurs the problem solvers the people and and i think we're all entrepreneurs if we are given the ability to you know the creativity the space to to express ourselves right like there are going to be a lot of jobs realistically that need to get done that are not going to be you know super fun and creative and whatnot that that should be rewarded actually quite heavily considering they you know uh uh but at the same time there's a i think that generally this the trend of the internet really generally has been this trend towards like smaller more nimble organizations that are able to coordinate based on you know you know these protocols that automate our interactions right like the the theory of the firm is all this is this theory that like um you know corporations get to a certain size and they've reduced the switching costs inside of that organization which makes them more effective but if they keep growing then there's like more switching costs it gets it gets tricky like internet technology is lowering that switching cost and that that coordination cost across the board and web3 is doing that even further so i really think that we're going to see an explosion in human creativity um if we actually do this thing right arbitrarily is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrarily and the d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrarily as their home all the wild d-fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the

maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence okay i'm going to tee you up another metaphor and i want you to take it the rest of the way maybe we end up back at public goods because it'll be very important uh again we're viewing humanity as like this one global system uh it's a school of fish gonna swap out that in that metaphor with like a a human body right where like uh some people in some part in some county in some city in some country somewhere are saying hey like we're getting acid rain it hurts uh and they need the ability to express that it hurts and so if we view this as a body like if you if you your few pain at the end of your finger it goes up to your brain and then your brain creates an action to remove pain right it's just like a stimulus there's a negative thing it's hurting me and your foot doesn't need to be an expert on fire it just all it needs to do is to say hey this hurts i would like this to stop please uh and then it sends that that message that relays that message to the brain and the brain is like oh uh foot and fire it hurts i'm going to remove the foot and now it's better and now the people who live in district foot uh don't have the fire that hurts them anymore because the brain helps solve that problem uh and so like the where where do where do public goods come into this metaphor and global retroactive public goods funding and like who is the actual part of the brain that helps the foot decide to move away from the fire that is a great question you are absolutely right uh the retroactive public goods funding what with the point of it the like the g like the amazing thing about it is that just as you said the finger or the foot they don't need to be experts on the solution they just need to identify the problem exists today they your finger is not at it predicting if it's going to get a paper cut right that is a that is given to a different part of the brain that is given to you know and by the way our brains are emergent complex systems right we think of our brains as this like big like one thing actually inside of our brains are crazy consensus protocols there are little neurons voting like hey yes i want this i don't want that like it's insane right so we what we're doing is we're coming to consensus on humanity's priorities we are building a brain right now humanity is self-harming because it doesn't have the feedback loops that give it the proper you know impetus to respond in a pro-social way everyone's incentives are aligned at a fundamental level because the with technology with the the kind of systems that we are building i do not believe we are in a world where the human beings that exist on this planet cannot get along and thrive together right there have been theories that have said oh no they were running out of resources etc and we blew past those numbers we have way more people on the planet than people thought was possible and we can keep progressing so we're all in this together we just need that positive sum mindset and we need the systems which provide the feedback loops that says hey this is a problem and then other systems which go out the entrepreneurs you know come in solving the problem right so like this is a legit we have to stop self-harming as a species right right yeah as a species we just have our foot in that fire and we're like hey this really hurts i'd like to know how to like remove my foot from this fire so that things could could get better uh i want i want to actually dive into the whole brain as like an emergent system because uh uh this is where i can actually use my my psych degree uh the neurons are just a bunch of logic gates right it's like yeah is it on or is it off and the is it off is a vote for like a zero and if it's on it's a vote for a one and all of these neurons intertwine with each other in certain patterns uh in certain structures where they like the one neuron voting for a one will cause another neuron to vote for a one which can cause another neuron to vote for a zero and we have this like this emergently like uh bottom-up constructed path of neurons for all these voting to make decisions uh and it's gotten the brain has gotten so efficient that it's basically a reflex at this point to vote to remove like the foot from the fire right and this is this is the goal for for crypto right like how can we make like something like acid rain such a automated automatized like reflex that we know the solution that it's just like acid rain just like immediately it's just like gone from from the earth and this is where we get into like a star trek future there's just a few steps between where we are now versus where we're going uh i'll let you take that when they take that one and run with it for what it is yeah no that is what you are saying i mean it's music to my ears and one of the key things right when we say there's a one and there's a zero or there's a yes and then there's a no like the key thing is that there is always going to be a you know a response a a kind like every single no matter where human humanity is going there will be a response system where we're saying you know where we do things or we don't do things based on feedback that's just like you know how we operate we take in inputs and we produce outputs this is you know there's only state and state transitions in computer science so this is going to happen but it's really critical that the people in our brain are relatively equally represented like we are as a species all going in the right direction right i really want to live in that future where we can all move in the right direction and so that's why it's so important that for instance we move past just you know simple token voting in the you know in the crypto space and we move towards richer forms of identity that privilege human hood i'm not saying that it's always going to be one you know one person one vote for every single thing but it should not be a bajillion you know votes for one person and one vote for the other right because then our human is going like if we think of our human as the our our collective self then yeah we can have our foot in the fire but the only thing we actually care about is our you know fingers because that's where all the money's at so like the foot just falls off and people you know we ignore it as a species but that would be a real tragedy like we need to get the maximum you know velocity for human advancement everyone needs to be in the same ship so i i yeah this is this is why we need these identity systems this is why we need to make sure that we're getting getting better at quantifying things that we want things that we don't want to happen and specifically things that are you know i i'm i'm really obsessed with focusing on where things are at quantifying the the state of affairs because that's actually hard enough right that's what retroactive public goods funding we say this is you know this is the state of affairs we like this we don't like this this has been a great public good this you know hasn't been been really anything and then based on that we just reward the creators who got us where we are today right and we do that consistently and that gets everyone in this mindset it changes the script everyone's building in towards a future that is you know pro social that is pro that that that does incorporate the full body of of of responses right and that is you know that is the the the that's the retroactive public goods funding future that i really want to see okay i'm just gonna go random left field i'm just i have to do it here's the thing here's another reason why you should like retroactive public goods funding oh my gosh i have a broken record but this is concept of quote ethers phoenix okay no no wait wait wait so i want to first go into defining retroactive public goods funding and just like actually explain that what what that is and then we're i want to talk about roku's basilisk and then i want to talk about ether's phoenix so we're heading we're heading there but first we have to actually do a good definition of retroactive public goods funding so let's start there how does that work uh what is it and how does it work okay so what it is it's just a it is it is rewarding public goods that have already been created rewarding the creators of public goods that have already been created doing so consistently so consistently that builders build for build public goods to get the reward in the future so just in the way that we have seen the crypto space explode with crazy bot farmers the bot farmers are trying to get these air drops right they're trying to predict what is going to be incentivized in the future but we can do that and harness that energy for good for actual positive you know pro social progress and the way we do that is we create systems governance systems which allocate retroactive public goods funding to the creators of the best public goods and we do this consistently over a long period of time and the more specific the goals are that we're you know retroactive public goods funding right you don't necessarily want to start with you know uh funding uh uh the best public goods in the uh climate space right maybe we're funding public goods that are more localized to our communities but we're doing so consistently and so as the communities grow the more you know you're getting more and more public goods getting funded right you got you got to put the mask on before you help your neighbor right and so we need we need to make sure our system can survive before we start caring about the health of other systems okay so how does like the vc the vc uh element work into into retroactive public goods because uh the line that we gave during our live stream was that we're injecting like startup type in financial incentives where if you build something really cool you can make a ton of money but how do we how do we can you explain how those types of incentives gets injected via retroactive public goods funding into people that build public goods sure yeah so if you have a credible source of funding so for instance optimism the blockchain using the optimism blockchain you generate transaction fees these transaction fees are then put into a pot of money which is then distributed to fund retroact to fund public goods on the network if there is a pot of money that is going to be distributed then vcs and other investors can look to see what are the best public goods teams that i know of so i'm let's say i'm a new builder i want to create an open source library you know on optimism of course and then i will go up to my investor friends i'll go up you know what's up paradigm i'll say hey guess what my business model is my business model is to build this incredible piece of software that all of optimism is going to use actually all of ethereum the ecosystem is going to use because optimism is evm equivalent right so we're i'm going to build this crazy good public good and guess what look at all this money there is a pot of you know a billion dollars that is going to be distributed over a reasonable period of time i only need a million dollars of investment to fund my project and i bet that i would make a return of at least 10 million dollars probably a hundred million dollars because this is going to revolutionize all of the you know ethereum ecosystem so i'll go up to my investor friends and my investor friends will be gonna be like okay there's a chance that you fail but if you do succeed i agree that public retroactive public goods funding money is significant and so i will then invest and this creates a market for creating public goods the problem with you know charity and uh open source software generally is that like you go in and you're like i know this thing is going to be insanely valuable and i know that everyone's going to be profiting off of it just like massively like the guest team for instance and you know all of these ethereum forks and then there's no business model so we're giving a business model to the builders of open source software first right we're giving them a business model to then pitch to in you know investors and who whomever their family that is going to put money in and they know they will get rewarded right we should be if you create an open source software library that is you know changing the world you should be paid by like you should be paid like an mba you know superstar right if you really if you made something that is so impactful that should be uh you should be paid like that so okay so optimism from the the block space sales of the optimism layer two generates this pile of money uh that is going to be sent out for retroactive public goods funding people will build these projects and if they get used they get to have some of that money how who and how is who determines how much of that money is sent to whom how does that governance process work great question so this is we are currently building out various governance experiments to do this well what do we need to experiment with well we need to experiment with number one we need to experiment with non-plutocratic forms of governance right the optimism community is a group of people individuals that are all using the network and are all benefiting and so we have created this you know this two house system or two bicameral system which we talked about in our our previous podcast but we created this system one house is the token house and one house is the citizens house and the citizens house are the ones that are directing this retroactive public goods funding we have done one experiment thus far for how to direct the retroactive public goods funding we gave out a million dollars a few months ago to a bunch of projects including geth including you know etherscan including about you know tons uh ether's jazz and then we're going to do that again but probably have a larger set of people who are judging right we had this set of 26 uh badge holders which are now we're calling citizens we had 26 of them they all just voted and then we're going to expand that group pretty significantly and probably expanded expanding expand it over time this is why right it here's a reason why we're not doing a token vote for that right it's because tokens are relatively centralized and your experience on the network the things that mo like that you really like about the network and that you are benefiting from that should not be decided by this you know heavy bag holder that should be decided by the people on the system that are using the system and so that's why we're trying to spread that voting power out a little bit more more equally but the details of how we're you know all the nitty gritty details we're gonna be experimenting for four years on this so we're gonna we we have this whole governance system built around experimentation built around non-plutocratic governance and there's a bunch of parallel experiments going on in the space that are highly related to this right like get coins quadratic funding seems extremely relevant uh coordinate what coordinate is doing where they're pushing the decision making of financial allocation to dow contributors towards the people that are seeing the other people contribute and they say okay that guy or that person or that or that woman they contributed a lot they should get paid uh and that is completely separate from a completely different corner of the dow because uh like they just didn't see it but the people that do see it get to vote uh and so there's like a bunch of peripheral experiments going on and it seems to be that optimism can just inject the ones that seem to work the best but but for right now with like the citizens house the people that are in the citizens house is it just like one person one vote there's like a million dollars and there's a there's a proposed distribution of that million dollars and people vote for that distribution that is how our first experiment went okay um the amount of money is you know surely going to increase um for the next experiment um and the mechanisms there's still a little bit uncertainty a little bit of uncertainty however i do think that it's very overwhelmingly likely that it's going to be one person uh one set of votes it may not be one vote it may be you get 100 votes and you can spread those out and we count them quadratically we counted them quadratically in the first experiment as well cool cool cool okay uh the the beautiful thing about this and what i think people who are listening in who think like oh this is really great this is going to be awesome for humanity this is also tapping into people's just like reptilian brain of like oh you can make a bunch of money but the cool thing about this is that it opens up a new field of products that were never before possible with the incentive mechanisms that we saw bootstrap web 2 right so like web 2 level growth but with products that have never been seen before like products that are public goods where you know it starts in the software camp of course it starts in on crypto economics but like no one has seen what happens when we have web 2 silicon valley type incentive mechanisms where the products are public goods so it's like not only have we not seen this in the crypto space but we've never seen this for the world so the amount of opportunity there are for entrepreneurs non-technical entrepreneurs who just have an idea to build stuff like the the golden age of crypto building hasn't even begun yet because like it's got to be this because we haven't seen greener pastures that have like so it's like fields of snow that have zero footprints in them like there's no no one has delved into this world yet because we haven't found it but with now with retroactive public goods funding we have found it and so i expect there to be a this to just suck up a lot of hungry builders out there who want to build something really cool and also make a lot of money like this is something that has been like untouched untouched no yeah i'm extremely excited about this and because i am one of those creators and you know i i'm excited to see not only you know yeah as you say technical kind of like coding projects could be created but think about the educational products and the the access to information that we can you know i i one of the things that i worked on which you know i think that you you you looked at was cryptoeconomics.study and it was an open source course which you know shout out to all the the learnings that i had learning from vitalik and and vlad and justin drake and all these eth2 researchers i wanted to just communicate that to the world and i was like lucky enough to be working at the ethereum foundation at the time to be able to like spend my time all of my time creating this this course and giving it out for free and guess what that course i'm sure had tons of nice ripple effects and got a bunch of people into the space and you know uh uh was was very helpful and i think i think valuable and so the thing is that that was just i was lucky to be in the right place at the right time working at the ethereum foundation where my stars aligned and i could release an open source course for anyone to look at but we can tap into the creative genius of so many people that are in the crypto space and if we can give those people a incentive mechanism that gets them paid for creating awesome educational content from on all end ends of the spectrum from like governance theory to you know deep uh uh crypto economics to you know what's happening in the space week in ethereum like all of these things are so valuable and are currently just i i think personally i think they are way under invested in um across the board con good content is so hard to come by i mean thank you for doing your your stuff well well like like what you said like part of bankless is is came out of cryptoeconomics.study where i was like just pounding my head into just like white papers and like youtube content all of a sudden like this is this came out like oh this explained like things that i was taking hours and hours to learn it was just in this one like website that one person just built because they thought that it was useful uh and so like if we could have more of that imagine how easy it would be to onboard people into into this industry um uh okay i think it's time to get into roku's basilisk uh can you speed run us through roku's basilisk okay i will and i will just say please forgive me less raw community oh oh yeah we're about to curse everyone that listens to this that that is part of this falcian bargain i think that we can uncurse by having a better alternative and the curse is is is dispelled because of it that's my hope um but you can we can is the is the dispelling of the curse ethereum's phoenix yes i'm hopeful that that is a dispelling so roca's basilisk right uh is this thought experiment that was posed on les wrong that was then banned from les wrong you can look it up and it's it's generally frowned upon to you know we're not supposed to talk about it the thought experiment is imagine in the future there is an ai and the ai will punish everyone who doesn't who didn't help it come into existence and the worst part is that if you've heard about it and you didn't help it come into existence then it'll punish you even more yeah so sorry everyone that just heard that sentence because now you are doomed uh because if you do not start building this thing it will punish you for not building it so it's a little bit like the game where like the game that everyone just lost because i mentioned the game so sorry about that as well uh but it's a little bit like that we're just like now that you know roku's basilisk exists uh if you don't start building it roku will punish you for for not choosing to to do that but can you okay let's go a little bit further into the metaphor why does this thing have this power like what gives what gives roku it's its power what gives roku this its power is uh a causal bargaining anyway i don't i i'm not really the the expert but if you think about it right you can you can play out this future and you can kind of construct a compelling argument right you listen to this and you're like oh okay so everyone who hears this is going to have to work on it and so if everyone's working on it then it'll actually happen and that will actually bring it into life and so this idea it's literally like an idea that is in the future and it's reaching back into the present and pulling us towards it it's like this attractor that's what you know people you know these mathy people talk yeah basis of attraction right because because only one person needs to actually do it because if one person builds roku then roku will punish everyone else so it only takes one person to defect and say hey i'm going to build roku and hahaha for all you people that didn't help but i won't be punished because i was the one that built it uh and so it only takes one person to actually build roku for this ai to start punishing all the other non-builders out there yeah very scary and you can i do think that it is interesting like these crazy people think of like ideas and memes as like physical objects that exist and like you can imagine these as like literal physical like physical things in the in a kind of higher dimensional space you know i'm just talking voodoo but whatever like pulling us there it's it's kind of kind of freaky um but don't worry about it don't worry okay because we have we have the dispel we have we have we have to do we have a spell curse or the ability to dispel the curse how do we and an emphasis on the aspect of this thing that doesn't exist pulling uh in the future pulling us in the present towards it like emphasis on that point like it does it doesn't physically exist but the mere thought of it creates it um but also we can do this in the an inverse fashion so carl can you teach us how to dispel roku sure so the same logic can be applied in the opposite direction so instead of an ai or and remember when we're talking ai we can be pretty liberal we're just talking in some thing it could be a governance system like we talked about before so something in the future ethers phoenix instead of punishing you if you don't create it it will reward the early creators of the positive public goods future so the sooner you cooperate right where in the prisoner's dilemma you have two choices you can cooperate or you can defect and defecting you're going against you know you're kind of like being mean you're being selfish yeah rocos basilisk right the other option is let's cooperate let's build a good future let's build a positive future that we all want to see happen and guess what the sooner you start building that future the sooner you dedicate your life and your motivation to this and you get people along with the cause and you're building open source software and contributing to ethereum contributing to optimism bitcoin all of these things the sooner you do that the more you're going to be rewarded because guess what either is phoenix is this you know is this future where retroactive public goods funding has succeeded every the world's you know incentive system is aligned and so the people who didn't get rewarded in 2022 those people will be rewarded in the future when ether's phoenix is born and so we can really think about instead of let's forget the negative stuff right the negative stuff is literally is just some like heebie-jeebie i think there's a lot of other ways for us to destroy the world um you know we don't have to do that that's silly but we can focus on the positive attractor and that is the attractor towards public goods towards greater forms of coordination and cooperation for all of us and the sooner you start getting involved bringing that future to reality the more money you'll make because that's why we're doing it because we love money and so okay so pulling back from pulling uh forward for some of the metaphors that we've been using like this school of fish that you know no one really can direct and the school of fish isn't conscious it just goes in circles even though there's move fish are moving everywhere ethers phoenix offers offers like a point a place to go for the whole entire school of fish right and so like now that we have this place that we're going to progress towards the fish that help steer the whole entire school towards that point get rewarded and the more that you do that and the earlier that you do that the more you get rewarded when you finally do get to that point and so this this gets it goes from being like a dumb school of fish that only reacts to its environment to a smart school of fish that as can have goal oriented behaviors and can pick its goals can actually make progress in getting there but the final issue with that the final like tbd that we need to collectively work on as a group is well where that point actually is is up to governance decisions like we need to make sure that that point is where we actually do want to go and that that actually actually is the right choice this is the brain in when the the foot is getting is in fire this is the brain like the brain knows like okay goal let's get this done let's go there but the brain can also be wrong like and it can also be right but it could also be wrong and so like making these choices is the meta problem for crypto and again that starts at the optimism uh a citizen's house and with uh identity innovation and and like uh uh decision making innovations we can start to actually refine where that point one uh needs to be um how's that for summing that up anything you want to add that's beautiful and i just want to say that if we think if we make a bet that our governance systems that our ability to determine what is actually bringing us closer to ethers phoenix right we know ether's phoenix is the goal but if those systems improve over time then actually the future system of governance is going to be able to accurately reward the people who are left out of the earlier iterations so that's saying that even if the governance system isn't quite good enough yet right we're we're doing retroactive public goods funding and we're taking checkpoints and we're saying oh who got us here and how close are we to ethers phoenix and we reward the people who got us then we get a little closer and we do it again and we do it again but maybe some people are getting left out because we're kind of not going quite to the ethers phoenix point that we want to go one once we get to that ethers phoenix now it's time to reward everybody and make sure that all the debts are settled right it's a lannister it's paying all its debts ethers phoenix uh the golden air i don't know stretching some weird analogies nonetheless i'm excited for that future right and also the beautiful thing is that the meta question of like how do we get everyone on the same page that's also that question itself is also technology that can be iterated on like the question can get better it can become a better question as in like hey what is the what is the local maxima this is pulling in kevin owaki is like what what is the the local maxima versus the true maximum right like maybe the ethers phoenix finds like hey here's a really good point on the value spectrum the value landscape that's higher than where we are now and then we get to that point and then we're there and then we discover that there's actually a higher point somewhere else that we wouldn't have been able to identify because we haven't developed the technology to ask that question in a better fashion yeah and this is why we need entrepreneurs we need different thinkers right because we hit the local maximum right the the people who are in the governance system they should be determining all you know they they're doing their job right but it's up to the innovators and the people who are risk takers to push us out of that local maximum and find a new maximum and innovate in identity tech or innovate in you know our ability to quantify the universe that we live in and quantify our wants and our needs and what things are bringing us up or bringing us down right like that is there's this like really beautiful thing that we're not we're not you know sacrificing innovation to democracy like i i would be terrified if we just start using democracy as our hammer that is insane but if we can empower those innovators oh i feel i can sleep easy at night because my god the number of people who are out there that are just geniuses waiting to create the next dig is the most happy thing like the fact that human beings get better as time goes on is beautiful i'm so excited to see the you know the you know people hate on young generations i bet i will bet all my money in those young generations they know what they're talking about i'm i'm out of my mind i don't know what i'm talking about uh so carl say we find the true maximum right like we've gone from local maximum to the higher local maximum then we find the true top we find the true maximum where all coordination incentives have been figured out and this all humans are aware of the meta question and are doing their part to help answer it and we're a globally unified society what is that society looks like like what what does that look like like what does the earth look like what is our relationship with our neighbors look like what do our jobs look like can you illustrate this for us well i it looks like first off it looks like a well-oiled machine and it looks like things if you imagine dysfunction governmental dysfunction and if you think like that that is a kind of day-to-day that is a baseline everyone i wake up in the morning and i'm like wow that is some serious dysfunction over there like what are those people doing why are we making this decision why is this company being so stupid right like that is like think about how much bad stuff happens these days at least we learn about it right before i'm sure we didn't even learn about it because information was traveling at a snail space but now we're learning about we're like wow something is horribly wrong so the first step to reform is knowing something's wrong right then the next step is actually fixing it so we i am at least well aware of the wrongness in our world and so i am excited to see a future where i just feel liberated right i can like try it's like you know gliding through water in and and we we can find new challenges right it's not like i i want the the challenges to be over eventually i'm excited for the challenges all to be over but like you know exploring space different you know uh uh planets and and coordinating like cross-planetary consensus that's gonna be hard right like the delays between information propagating it's like these are there's some really fun problems and i just want us to dive deep in them and i also want us to connect to each other right like all of these barriers we're working all you know 24 7 like let's give ourselves time to you know spend time with our families and care about what matters right like i really do think that is important and i will say okay this is that's all like very materialistic type stuff but i will say that the you know the reason why part of the reason why i got into crypto is because my mom is hindu and i grew up going to the ashram and meditating and like doing all of this stuff that's why i'm wearing these beads and from my perspective i basically i think there are like two options where you can either become a you know monk and and self-realize and recognize the universe and kind of be be at peace in one or we can use technology to to make that process automated and give it to everyone so i'm really hopeful that that you know self-actualization realization like we literally elevate our consciousness to places that haven't we can't even conceive of right now because we don't have that we don't have the the doors to those perception to that perception carl that was beautiful and and that line is the
