what up coordination how you do and welcome to this very special episode of the green pill pod with danny zuckerman of the ceramic network three box labs and ceramic are on a mission to bring data composability to web3 ceramic is a mutable storage layer for storing decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials on their network so basically what that allows you to do is store identity documents off chain in a way that is self-sovereign and decentralized uh self-sovereign to a user and decentralized away from an application and what that does is it enables a network effect of identities in web3 in this episode of the green pill pod with danny zuckerman we talk about how identity is going to be different in web 3 than it was in web 2 what is on that frontier why is it better for users and how we're going to build a flywheel in which there is more utility for people to build their web 3 identity which creates more incentive and more web3 identity which creates more utility which creates more web3 identity and how bitcoin passport which is an integration between ceramic network and the git coin dow is going to enable that so get coin passport is basically an implementation of the ceramic network in which you can store a did that helps increase your civil resistance on the git coin network and you can take that to other applications and instantly get civil resistance from the git coin network in other applications simple resistance is sock puppet resistance basically how can you go from one token one vote to one human one vote and that's a core pillar of creating more green pill world is being able to move to more democratic dials and so ceramic network and bitcoin have launched bitcoin passport which is enabling that and i think that we're using that as sort of the tip of the spear to talk about how reputation based economies are going to be bootstrapped about how identity is inherently multiplayer so really fun episode that crosses a lot of teas and dots a lot of eyes on decentralized identity and reputation danny is just so lucid and articulate when it comes to talking about web3 identity has been studying this stuff for five years and it's those insights that have enabled ceramic network to be such a useful tool for developers that are building decentralized identity networks and i think it's going to be the shelling point for building this network effect of web3 identity there's really not another product on the market that resembles ceramic it's got a really unique selling proposition it's the only mutable storage layer that's decentralized and built around identity that i'm aware of and that's why this is such a special episode for me of the green pill podcast so without further ado i give you danny zuckerman of the

your vision for decentralized identity so can you tell us what you've been working on over at ceramic uh for sure so um i've been working with my co-founders and our small team on how to make um share decentralized composable data organized around identities and users a reality for developers for five years now that's taken a whole bunch of different forms but the last few years have been really focused on bringing ceramic which is basically a decentralized database protocol to life um the reason that we are focused on that is because we believe that at the end of the day identity is really about managing and linking to and routing to information associated to an identifier and so data is the primitive that we think really unlocks the most robust and powerful forms of identity right got it so what does the world look like in which ceramic is maximally successful i mean it seems like you guys are building data composability to web3 what does that sort of look like yeah so we think about a future of the internet uh whether you call it web3 or the meta first but just our digital lives online um being super interoperable and fluid and powered by something that we think of as the dataverse which is basically a concept of all the data flowing around the web that we use day to day today that data is really trapped and siloed on application servers and by big platforms and it's really limited in how we can deploy it and that forces us to kind of bend to the web in a world powered by ceramic and other related technologies and decentralized identity and data things really change and the dataverse becomes this much more fluid layer of data where each individual is in control to some degree of their own data the data relevant to them their interactions their experiences their reputation and it follows them around to applications and products and services and those products and services are much more seamlessly composable with each other because of that and so that's the the future that we're building towards right so it seems like more sovereignty of our data and more composability of our data you know one of the problems with web 2 social media is this lock-in that you get with the network effect say facebook for example it's it's every facebook user makes facebook more usable for every other user of facebook's the network effect of your friends are there so i want to be there and it makes it really hard to leave but if you could take your social network if you could take your data from d app to d app if facebook was web 3 and i could just take my social graph from that app to another app you get way less lock in which enables more competition between the apps and hopefully can create a better experience over time for consumers uh or citizens of these services so um you know what are the big advantages of of the dataverse over over web 2 i think i mentioned composability uh sovereignty and the ability to take things from dftd up or do other other things that you think are the the dataverse has advantages over web web 2 with yeah i mean i think it's it's those and i just extend them like when you have that competition you have way more innovation and so the ability for developers to plug and play and we talk about a world in which there's a billion apps and everyone's a developer because when those network effects are shared and the data is sharing the information is shared anyone can just like come up with an idea and program it with in different ways and plug into that that universe of applications and you don't have to get a massive user base and network effects to succeed um and so that diversity of applications where you get both scale and personalization together the other thing that i call out is i think sovereignty is really important we talk about the duality of sovereignty and collectivism or mutualism around data because a lot of our data isn't actually just personal and sovereign a lot of our data shared experiences when you and i have this conversation lots of data is being generated it's both of ours and and lots of the stuff that happens online like lots of the stuff that happens in the real world is is shared and so we talk about the data versus needs to be owned by everyone in no one both of those things together users need more control and governance and sovereignty over certain things and privacy too but also it needs to be on this shared state where everyone can participate together and and that really changes the playing field of the web it changes you know again to extend what you talked about it changes the incentives for anyone building applications there's no longer an incentive to hoard data and abuse it because data is much more accessible and powerful we can get more out of data as long as you're not an abuser in the system and so it really flips the incentives for um developers and users to be much more on the same page right so i mean i want to go back to the philosophy of what's being built here but i think in order to inform that we have to talk a little bit about ceramic and the current in instantiation of what ceramic is so i kind of think of it as a mutable data store as opposed to ipfs which is a immutable decentralized data store uh is is how would you characterize what what ceramic is and the unique thing that it brings to the market within the dataverse yeah that's absolutely right so technically it's mutable data um so data that can change over time if you're looking for an analogy it's not perfect but um it's the database layer in web 2 which is not built on top of file systems and kind of raw static storage and so if ipfs filecoin and others provide that static storage um ceramic is this layer for mutable data and one of the really important um kind of principles in how ceramic was built is every piece of data um so each of these mutable data objects is really just a stream of data events um each of those events is signed by a did a decentralized identifier and and in this string and so you have this network of these data objects being signed by these identities which what that really means is these identities are controlling that data and that means both they're permissioning out who can write to that data and so like you have prominence and authenticity verifiability over this data the way that you do on a blockchain but also they get to govern who has access to that data and how you route to that data and so you have this database layer that is organized around these identifiers which is very different than the web today where you've got data organized around whatever database architecture is designed by each individual application and because it's organized around dids it can interoperate with any blockchain any key any wallet any client any smart contract layer um and have this shared data layer across web3 yeah so i have i have both like theoretical experience in thinking about this from you know you and i actually the listeners may not know this but we both incubated uh what was then called three box now i know you're focused more on ceramic and and git coin works were incubated at consensus we've been talking in theory about the dataverse for several years and we've been playing with the idea of having a partnership for several years and uh recently gitcoin just launched getcoin passport on top of ceramic and one of the things that i think is really cool about bitcoin passport is it allows you to take the civil resistance of your git coin identity anywhere with you on the d web and it's backed by ceramic and and one of the cool things about that is that ceramic just gave us out of i'm saying us but i've actually disaffiliated from bitcoindow leadership uh ceramic gave bitcoin the ability to have out of the box a mutable data store for verifiable credentials that we wouldn't have had previously before so it's been like a really useful tool for developers at get coin to build the the bitcoin passport and one of the things i think is really cool is that i is that that ceramic data store the their bitcoin passport is is sovereign to the user if someone forks get coin passport and makes a change to it and i don't know let's say it's called legitcoin passport someone makes a fork of it they can still access the same ceramic data store because it's sovereign to the users and i think that that's really really a neat property of of ceramic is that you take your data with you so um yeah i don't know is there anything else to say about passport and the integration that we did there yeah i i first of all it's one of the most exciting projects happening not just around ceramic but i think in identity reputation weaponry generally and i think the value comes in three layers um or kind of three waves almost the first yeah it's like this sovereign data store that getcoin can use to create this um sovereign piece of reputation this anti-symbol that's so been so missing for get coin but also for web3 more broadly and so there's this this missing infrastructure for this type of data that now exists that you know gave out of the box support for what you needed the second piece is what you laid out um uh oh actually so that i actually would say the third piece is what you laid out where someone could fork it and create their own you know version of it but in the middle we've had so many other applications throughout web 3 d5 product calls layer ones who need it you know civil resistance now they can go use the bitcoin passport because it lives associated to the users they don't have to fork anything they can just discover that this exists whether through bitcoin or through ceramic or through the users that are coming to their applications and query it with a single api for data and so you have like single player value of database infrastructure you have multiplayer value of discovery and sharing of data but then you have the ability to extend and compose more logic on top of that the way that you talked about and so to me this is where you talked about the more competition but it's like stacking innovation that can really take off and move reputation forward yeah for sure and i also don't want to oversell the value prop of get coin passport it's a way of bringing civil resistance of get coin uh from the app to the diap but simple resistance is very much an unsolved problem and i think that over time there's gonna be a live iterative game between the the good guys and the bad guys to create more civil resistance and the cool thing about the mutable data store is that as that game evolves and as the personhood game uh the personhood scores evolve over time that those can be updated over time and they're still stored in a decentralized way which has been really useful for get coin as it moves from a centralized company to a decentralized application so uh yeah so passport.getcoin.com is where you can go to to check out check that out and we've been really happy using ceramic for for that that utility anything else to say about passport or should we move on uh no i know there's some big improvements uh underway for the next grants round so i'll let listeners stay tuned for that yeah totally so i'd love to talk a little bit about how you think interoperable ecosystems will out compete siloed platforms so what are the advantages that you see of these interoperable ecosystems is it is it basically that we can build network effects over time where instead of start a cold start if you're launching a social network in web 2 where you have to build your own social graph you can kind of get a running start because you can take the social graph and the data from d opt to d app i mean what do you see as the the ways that interoperable ecosystems will out compete the siloed platforms of the past yeah i think that's the foundation on which a bunch of other things happen um so i'll give two different kind of ways of looking at this one is um today if i want to inter-operate on say a piece of content um with you you and i have to both agree to use either google docs or notion or or something else and we share this everything about what we're collaborating on is shared but in the future with shared data under the hood you can choose to use one text editor say any type while i can choose to use say clarity but they might share this and access the same content and so as long as there is shared standards for the data we can use very different tools and what this takes us to is a world where there was an analogy i heard once where like software development today works where likes you know imagine if you were building a house and you wanted your walls to be blue and you asked the contractor like can i have blue walls on my house and they had to say their answer was let me go pull users and see if enough users want blue walls and if so i'll offer blue walls and that's the world we live in with software today we're like everything it's all or nothing products and services and applications and the world of future each app and service can really customize the logic and the interface and features they're offering to their specific community in their specific user base but share the content under the hood so you still have the scale and the interoperability and the collaboration that we're used to so to me that's what's most exciting is that we're unbundling applications and platforms to get a lot more personalization and specificity and innovation at the top while still preserving the ability to collaborate at the bottom even more so than today like beyond just you know winning the apple ecosystem or something um i i have a little more say but i'll pause there does that make sense to you yeah i think so yeah i mean so so to summarize i think it's it's it's not only having like a common data store but also shared standards for how we how we i'm saying we in the the most general sense we as an ecosystem create deops that that interoperate with each other and then from there users can take their their data from site to site i and that enables us to get around the cold start problem and just provide immediate utility of these d apps you know i'm curious to keep pulling that thread so how else do these interoperable ecosystems benefit users and and help help help grow the ecosystem yeah so uh i stopped at kind of the personalization of the application layer while sharing the underlying content but there's a saying in in kind of tech circles that to get a product adopted um in an existing market it has to be 10x better than the incumbent um and the reason for that is you have to get people to switch to your product and they've already built up um so much experience possibly network effects data um just training and like all these other things that make the incumbent sticky um and part of it's network effects but part of it is lots of other things too the switching costs are very high um and so that creates a really high bar to innovation like it's crazy that a 5x better product can't get adopted when it's five times better um obviously this is like very high level rules of thumb here i think that like does it disappear completely but it mostly does in a world powered by the dataverse because the switching costs from one application to another are so much lower i can use zappify this morning in xerion tonight and access the same tokens and ft's i can switch wallets fairly easily like the underlying um data that whether it's assets on a blockchain or data on something like sorry i'm at is on a shared network so it's very easy to to switch applications that access it and so what that does is it reduces the the the limit for innovation from a 10x better product to just 10 better say and so developers and builders can build something that's 10 better 20 better and get a bunch of adoption again because not everybody has to switch at once just some people do and so i think we start to see is an internet that doesn't have to wait on 10x better product improvements every few years in any given domain but rather constant pace of innovation and change that compounds and you know like the the saying is about how powerful compounding interest is but i think we're going to see compounding product innovation that rapidly outstrips 10x innovation our 10x improvements sort of used to and so i just think that like you know we're already used to a world that moves fast um in some ways but like the pace of improvement of our products and services online will get so much faster in so many more and diverse ways how we have data yeah i think that you know that's a really interesting insight that users don't switch for a 10 better product but they do switch for something that's 10x better and you know one of the things that i've always felt is a truism about web3 is that a group of hackers can go into a hackathon and build something in a weekend that it would have taken a bank ten years ago like 100 million dollars in a thousand people in order to build and it's because of the open source software and the modular money legos that they can build on top of in order to build these applications and there's this exponential growth that comes from web 3 because every new money lego adds utility to the network of money legos because there's new configurations of money legos that can that can be built on top of that and they grow exponentially because of that network effect and uh so that really works well for things that are on chains these these composable smart contract money legos work really well in that way but when you're building social applications you're not building financial applications you really need sort of off-chain data in order to build reputation and building the network effect of that is going to make it easier for it's going to make it so that we're going to enable a world in which in the dataverse people will be able to walk into a hackathon and build a new social network that 10 years ago would have taken zuckerberg 100 million dollars and a thousand people to build so taking that innovation just from financial applications to all sorts of applications i think is the is the upside that i see there yeah i completely agree i think that's really well said so um i'm you know i'm curious what would have to be true for ceramics vision of the internet to be successful for this dataverse to happen i mean what what do you need from partners like bitcoin what do you need from everyday entrepreneurs in the web3 ecosystem how can how can the green pill listeners help to make this a reality yeah so um you like i i won't oversell where we're at right now like ceramic is live getting you know more and more usage and really exciting use cases there's still a long way to go with the tech um if we think about money legos and what is often called kind of on-chain so the blockchain stack um so there's still a long way to go on that too but like it's been deployed and working in production with billions of dollars um in in various kinds of use cases deployed on it for years the that kind of rest of the dataverse so the non-value data which is really what i think of as blockchains that keeps track of scarce value data what we're trying to do is build analogous infrastructure for all the other data which is abundant not scarce and there's just a lot more of it and the principles for how you manage it are a little different and so there's still a little ways to go and kind of filling out the web3 stack and so ceramic's a big part of that but so are plenty of others in the ecosystem working on that data stack so the first thing is just kind of learn more about the dataset if your developer helped contribute to that that is really the infrastructure that will power all of these things it goes all the way up to the authentication layer so key management and seaweed sign with ethereum and wallets and all the way down to file storage and everything in between um so there's still quite a bit of work to be done there but then it's really i mean i think the the biggest thing that we need to unlock what you just described the open innovation not just for money legos but for social like some other things his product innovation on um on this stack and and more experiments in what can you do with decentralized data and identity that you could never have done previously not trying to just build this you know decentralized twitter over again but like what's new composable communities is something i'm really excited about content that's shared between uh completely different applications so a blog post and a comment thread might show up on mirror but also in a discord like channel and so you don't segment things and so um it's really the product thinking about what does this tech enable us to do that's uh now possible and then what are users going to get really excited about and so experiments in this and there's plenty of places that listeners who aren't product builders developers can go and experiment with the latest and greatest and give feedback to those who are doing this so orbis.club is a really exciting social sdk and application it's doing like pushing this forward really fast the cyberconnect team is doing this as well those experiments on lens protocol which is a little bit of a different approach to this but in the same boat and so um using some of these social legos and giving feedback to those who are building it i think that's the most helpful thing right now right yeah so i think you like you said starting with well so building on top of ceramic and building applications that leverage the the what is enabled by data portability and you know what that brings to mind for me is there's this concept of skeuomorphism which is basically the idea of does the old resemble the the new yahoo and google both had the mission of putting the world's information on a computer network and yahoo did it in a skeuomorphic way because they just took the card catalog system and put a directory of information online and google invented a completely new way of interacting with information the search box that was fundamentally better and leveraged the properties of the new information so you know when i extend this analogy of skeuomorphism to data portability into the dataverse it kind of makes me wonder oh what are going to be the non-skeomorphic things that are over the horizon that are enabled when our data can just follow us around the web are we going to do are we going to build data cooperatives are we going to be able to build bring our reputation from site to site and bootstrap social networks in a in a very fast way i don't know can you help us peer over that horizon which which of these which of these use cases are you most excited about and are any of them non-skeomorphic that you can alpha leak here yeah so uh by nature of the evolution of these tech waves i'm going to be really bad at predicting exactly what will what this will look like um yeah that's how these things are but i can i i won't shirk the question completely um there's two that come to mind i'll let you pick which thread to pull on one is very far out there the other is a little bit more concrete so the first is composable communities and composed of content so i really strongly believe that web3 social after the skeuomorphic phase will look nothing like web 2 social and what it's really going to look like is completely different applications um sharing pieces of the same social graph and network but not all of it and sharing pieces of content um across them but not all of it and so we can talk about what that might look like but i think it's really really different model for social interaction online um the other really big domain that uh again it's a little bit more fuzzy um but i really think that the way that we think about reputation online is gonna fundamentally change um and it's going to power so many new kinds of experiences online um it's a decentralized composable reputation to me is going to be not just an enabler for like things to work without being attacked but like new entirely new economies online and new ways of building businesses um and so those to me are like the big picture things i'm keeping an eye on for the future yeah it sort of reminds me of one of the theories that so the whole reason that we're going deep on decentralized identity in in web 3 in season 2 of this podcast is that i have this sort of theory that web 3 is a dark forest you have this adversarial relationship with everyone online where uh where like they could hack you and it's a very zero-sum thing and and decentralized identity and reputation is like the light that you can hold up to your counterparty and you can see who they are and as soon as you have reputation then what you can do is you can bootstrap repeat interactions in which you can kind of track what each person is doing and that enables possible win wins uh if you have an environment with repeat interactions and possible win wins and low miscommunication that's the evolution of trust we can bootstrap new economies on top of the back of our social social data and that's going to enable all these sort of new use cases where i can say oh danny and i have known each other for four years we worked together at consensus and i'm gonna give him a ten thousand dollar under collaterized loan and we'll just slash his reputation if he uh if he doesn't pay back that loan or we can say we're going to give you a certain amount of rewards in this in this application based off of your your history and so i i just have this sort of like it just really feels to me like identity is is the key to bootstrap positive some economies based off of repeated interactions with each other and so that that's how i try to peer over over the skeuomorphic frontier and i think it's really neat that you said to that that web 3 social is going to look nothing like web 2 social once this fly grill really starts humming because that just makes you really excited to see what's going to be invented at that point yeah um and again like neither you nor i can predict what that looks like but i i think that you are we arrive at some of this my guess is you and i share a lot of the same reading list um but there's kind of different ways to arrive at this um conclusion that social and reputation are both critical but also going to look very different one way is like the um the kind of economic and technical and game theoretic kind of extrapolation of things like we need some of this stuff in order to have repeat game interactions once we have repeat game interactions you can kind of like think through rigorously like what this needs it looks like another is almost like the um you know the oppo like the inverse the opposite of just like a very different way which is look at like the history of human society and evolution so like the nostalgic approach and like what what should digital society look like if it's going to mirror human society and what we see there is there's a fantastic book called the righteous mind i recommend it to everyone who's building social systems um that i won't go into too far now but a great quote like the fastest way to protest social behavior is to make sure reputation everyone's reputation is on the line all the time like empirically that is just the way that you get altruism and pro-social behavior is reputation ben franklin had a gossip column because he knew in the early days of creating communities in a new country where there wasn't a whole lot of trust um we evolved like gossip like as one way to actually like influence reputation and make sure people were doing things that conform to the norms that we expected of each other um and so this gossip comes from somewhere it's not just like something that we indulge in for no reason um and so reputation has been like so siloed and so limited online to date because of like the nature of what it is like it is its reputation basically runs on top of data that data needs to be stored somewhere and so it exists in uber or rv or credit scores in all these fragmented ways but if we have a way to now create much more kind of composable reputation systems we can create a much more pro-social web um and bring some of these much more natural experiences online it's my hope at least beautiful i love that if we can build reputation we can create a more pro-social web refi summer has arrived and sello is here for

other element that i want to bring into this conversation it's based off of a tweet that you sent about a month ago you said identity is inherently multiplayer in the physical world identity began as a construct enabling peer-to-peer interactions in society in the digital world it roughly functions the same way identity is a tool for providing context trust and efficiency to transactions i'd love to pull that thread of it identity being inherently multiplayer because that to me is where things get really really exciting when when you've got not only your personal identity but you've got the relationship to others it just feels like it can compound really fast uh constitution dao showed that web3 is really good at doing capital formation in a really fast way tens of millions of dollars raised within 24 or 48 hours and what's the equivalent of web3 identity uh flash flash social networks popping up when when identity becomes multiplayer gets really exciting for me i don't know if there's anything else that you want to add about identity being multiplayer no i think just for those for so um like very briefly rewind my entry into this world came right after i wrote a book um about identity completely outside of the digital realm it's about the sociology of identity and there's there's as a co-author along um with my mom who had suffered a stroke and was kind of grappling with identity she'd been a professor and so i go very deep into identity literature again in the social sciences and psychological sense and one of the things that you come to learn when you dive into the kind of history and of identity is we think of this identity as like you say identity if you haven't thought about it you think it's like identity it's uh sorry individual you think it's static and you think it's singular we have this sense that we've been raised with like find your one true self like whatever that is but like anyone who's telling his identity knows that it's plural we have multiple identities that it's dynamic it's ever changing and it's actually social identity is about how you relate to others and if you even look at the first identity systems they mostly came from nation states who are trying to just distinguish between individuals and associate information to them or if you like go back before that it's tribes you have names so that people know who you're talking about it's like the the identifiers that we use day-to-day which is what we often call identity only really matter because people are trying to like interact with other people um you don't need one for yourself and so i think that's where when we come back to trying to build around identity and build and do things in the digital world just keeping in mind where this all came from um and why we actually design identity systems it's not for us it's for us in our relationships to other people right i i think that that one one thread that i really want to pull on from what you said there is this idea that you don't really just have one identity that you're you're bringing you're kind of bringing different parts of yourself to different relationships the kevin that i showed to my to to to you on this podcast is the different from different from the kevin that i show to my wife is different from what i show my kids versus a potential partnership and and you know i think that's actually it's it's it's obvious when you think about the privacy implications of showing your whole self and your whole identity to every single person on online but but i think it's worth stating explicitly here that you really only want to reveal the minimum amount of information to a lot of these people for privacy purposes the the analog equivalent of this is like you go into a a store to buy liquor and you have to show your id to the cashier and you're giving your name your address your date of birth your eye color your hate your height your weight all this personally identifiable information but really what we just want is the zero knowledge proof that you're over 21 at least here in the states you have to be 21 to buy liquor and so i i think i would love to just pinch and zoom on the ability to just show a like a part of your identity to people um i think that's going to be a key part of privacy preservation in in um uh in in this in this uh dataverse that that you're talking about and one of the things i really like about ceramic is that i sovereign own all of the data that is on ceramic for me and i can only reveal the verifiable credentials that i want so i think it's neat that the way ceramic is architected just reflects the way that we want to work with identity in in this new world so i don't know anything more to say to say about that yeah i guess the one thing that i say is i talked to the very beginning about how we actually approach identity from a data first perspective um that we think that that's the primitive and so very frequently when we talk about identity the story goes first if you have self-sovereign identities then you can start to attract like accumulate um like verifiable credentials around them and with that you can have reputation and you can start to build big data source and that's not wrong that's like very very true but there's an inverse way to look at this too which is start with the data like what if we can just have lots of lots of data that we're able to control and manage um and then on top of that data we can choose any given collection of it or any given portion of it on which to use at any given time that might be used to disclose like share some piece of information or to share with zero knowledge proof or it might be to run some reputation algorithm on top of that data and share it and so if we actually just have like this massive pool of data um some on our team called like a data ocean because ocean protocol has kind of worked with that concept too um then we can that's like the smallest primitive on which we can kind of aggregate and do interesting things with it um and so i completely agree with you that selective disclosure over certain things is really important i do think there's some limitations to that again not all data is sovereign and if we're doing social things i don't want you to be able to filter out every negative review you ever had on airbnb if i'm thinking about staying at your place like that yeah it's just um but it's also not just about selective disclosure of our one personality or one identity it's also like sometimes i love talking about this stuff and like my part of my identity is like talking about you know crypto web 3 data sometimes i need to turn off and i'm with certain friends i don't want to talk about the stuff at all um and that's still me it's just like a different version and so um i do think there is a very real way in which each of us is not just like portions of our one true self but like actually different selves at different times there's tons of brain research around this we have different personalities in our brain you have certain traumas um and like you actually will have multiple different personalities competing with each other um and so again like are we ever going to like reflect our identity online exactly the way that our brain works now because we don't understand how our brain works but like uh to to to try to it's both about preserving privacy and selective disclosure but also about preserving the ability to really be different people at different times if that's what's the case beautiful you know one of the things i really appreciate about you danny is that you've just been working on this problem for a long time and thinking about this in such a deep way for i mean i know because we work together at consensus for four years but you just have such a depth of knowledge and experience working on this for the last four years that that it it just really comes out from talking to you that you've thought so deeply about this and it's great to see you guys have a product coming to market and then also enabling the next tier of applications and i and i really believe that the the identity-based applications are going to be the next tier of web 3. you know if we want to get to a place where web3 is useful for the mo for the mainstream of humanity we need to go from applications that are only good if you have a lot of capital to applications that 99 of humanity which their financial lives is their their jobs and their relationships not their not their bank accounts and not their not their investments because they don't have a ton of capital and so i think that it's really going to enable the next the next tier of the web and and that sort of brings me to this this uh this article that you've been writing about reputation based economies i don't know if that's that's out yet or if that'll be out by the time the pod is out but i'd love to to talk about reputation-based economies next could you could you sort of tell me what those are and and and the the opportunities that you see within reputation-based economies yeah for sure not out yet um whether it's out by the time this goes out depends on how much time i can find to finish it um before i jump to that i'll just say that the appreciation is mutual in the history of identity systems online most of them come into usage and popularity not because of some perfectly built identity system but because of some product or service that applies them and makes them widely used uh facebook connect being one example there are many others and so working with you for years with your kind of in-market product and thinking about how identity plays a huge role um is what makes you know our thinking much better and actually like um ensures that it's built for the real world use cases that developers and others need thanks for saying that um i should also note that bitcoin dao is uh i've just affiliated from leadership in bitcoin dao and now there are tens if not hundreds of contributors that are powering bitcoin dao and it's it's them that are pushing bitcoin passport forward and i think it's only an alpha that's out right now it's gonna it's gonna have to evolve over the next couple grants rounds in order to become actually useful for people but but yes the feeling is totally i know our team has been working with them very closely on the actual product um informed by some of the conversations you and i and many others have had over years um but yeah um so reputation-based economies so we talked a little while ago about uh so you actually i really liked when the examples that you gave uh i can't remember exactly i framed it but um the ability to do different financial transactions um and know that if someone defaults on their loan their credit score is going to be slashed um and that's a not a reputation based economy but i think it leads the way to an interesting insight that one of our investors actually shared which is each month we all pay many bills um including say our phone bill and we probably don't pay our phone bill because we're worried that if we don't pay the verizon is going to come take us to court and track us down and get damages from us um if we don't pay on time then our credit score is going to go down like it's a reputational hit that actually has the most proximate impact on our behavior um and uh i think that reputation if we look at what humans are motivated by generally it's it tends to be there's different ways to break it up but i think of it as like cultural norms reputation and kind of you know like financial incentives or like pr utility maximization um and the pre pyramid utility maximization works really well with one time games and market transactions but as you said earlier it's like a one-time thing reputation is actually a much more powerful motivator when at times when we're thinking about like long-term gains and our reputations are super valuable they open up doors for us whether that's relationships or repeat business or whatever it is and so a world in which our reputation is on the line all the time and can be used to get access to protocols or applications or services or better terms or deals or whatever it is now there's actually a really big incentive for each of us to improve our reputation and at least not to slash it and so if we think about um that world where we're using these products and services our reputation is on the line to either get you know signed credentials that we did this say a great contribution to a debt or that we did pay back our loan or whatever it is that we did or slashed if we didn't do that um there's a ton of value for every given user in actually just adding to their reputation because now unlike today that can be gone and it's it's like it's reputation legos i can go use that reputation elsewhere um and so you know this this sounds very abstract but if we think about the massive numbers of users that come and contribute massive values to twitter or to tick-tock or these social platforms what they're really gaining early on is reputation they're getting followers they're getting likes they're getting cred in whatever it is that they're doing then later they can turn that into monetization with sponsorships or with just distribution their own fan base whatever it is so we see this already even though the reputation is kind of locked into certain platforms um and i think that's going to become more common is um applications who can attract users and and make themselves valuable because they present opportunities to add to your own reputation to show that you did pro-social behavior um i think another great example is stack overflow or just actually the open source movement as a whole developers contribute to open source because even without a super like you know codified way to do it if you're a big open source contributor that's a great reputation as a developer it's gonna help you get other jobs and help you get different positions um and and that's without any kind of formalization around it and so i think that kind of economy basically even though it's not the typical scarce economy we're used to we'll start to become much more common when we have attributable verifiable data and reputations following us around the web yeah yeah i think that flywheel is really exciting of i have reputation accrued and i can use it in order to get utility on an ecosystem deops that consume that reputation which incentivizes me to accrue more reputation which gives me more utility which gives you more reputation that flywheel really starts to spin and i'm i'm really you know i think i think that you know when i look at that flywheel i i kind of see the partnership between get coin and ceramic there in that bitcoin has these 70 700 000 data points of what public goods people want to fund and the civil their civil resistant identity and ceramic has this data store in it so in a way we're kind of the first i'm saying we but i've disability from get coindale um get going dallas and ceramic are kind of the first two at the dance that they could become a dance party when it when it comes to this decentralized identity and it's and i just really i mean i actually shouldn't give bitcoin too much credit because like poep and rabbit hole and a bunch of other apps are doing this kind of stuff too but i i really think it's about getting that flywheel starting and getting that cold start problem and that's when things really start to get interesting for sure and i do think it's it's both positive flywheel but also if i know that you um but i think it applies equally to you kevin or to any business um if i know you've built up this extremely valuable reputation um and i know that you bring that with you to any given event or transaction or experience or social whatever like god said you're talking about a governance proposal um in a random dao and you've staked that somehow and i think i can mean stake both in a very general sense like you we all put our reputation online all the time when we show up to the office and have conversations but also like you could actually do that you know technically state your reputation in some way i know you're going to behave in a way that i expect because it's way too costly for you to risk harming your reputation um like you've built it you've spent so much time building it up you get so much value out of it you would never endanger that um and this is where a pro social web can come from like if we're all building up orientation get so much value out of it and we know people aren't going to risk putting that at risk um we can move ourselves into this repeat game we're in a together framework instead of this maximize financial incentives all the time world that we're in both on the web too in certain ways but in web 3 especially today we're not so kind of token heavy right bootstrapping that reputation-based economy well i think that we've only got a couple minutes left so i'll move into closing questions is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say danny i'm sure we could talk about all sorts of things for much longer but we we hit some good points so yeah totally well where can people find you in ceramic online um so ceramic is uh best found at ceramic network on twitter or ceramic.network is the url the website is criminally out of date but you can follow the links to the docs if your developer and start to dig in there or chat.ceramic.network join our discord and forum.surrender.network for our discourse forum there's a lot of properties just go to our website you can be directed to them um for me i'm at d-a-z-u-c-k on twitter nice and then i'll also give a quick show for get coin passport which is built on ceramic you can see that at passport.gitcoin.com and then if you're a developer you can build on top of passport instantly bring civil resistance from bitcoin into your app at docs.passport.getcoin.com um and if you're a developer i'm assuming you can build on top of the ceramic network by going to the ceramic network website exactly and there's a link to the docs there word well thanks so much for joining me on the green pill pod dan danny it's been great kevin always blast talking thanks for having me [Music] you
