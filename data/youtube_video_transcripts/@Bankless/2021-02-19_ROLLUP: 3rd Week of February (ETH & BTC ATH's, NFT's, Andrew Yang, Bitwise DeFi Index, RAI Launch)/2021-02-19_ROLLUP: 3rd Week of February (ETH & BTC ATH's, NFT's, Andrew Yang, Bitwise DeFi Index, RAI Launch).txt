[Music] hey everyone it's the third week of february happy friday morning david what are we doing today we're rolling up the third week of february the crypto world moves so incredibly fast and so ryan and i go through a week's worth of news as fast as possible so get that coffee ready because we're coming at you hot here's what we do we always talk about the markets what are the markets saying then we get into releases what got released in the last week then we go into news what happened in the news cycle lastly we finish up with some ecosystem ecosystem takes who had some good opinions in the world of crypto in the last week and then we finish with what ryan and david are excited about and then of course the meme of the week the meme of the week is a new feature super excited to get there it's like the dessert at the end of a fantastic meal david are you ready to roll him up we're rolling it up let's do it all right david before we get into the roll-ups we should tell our audience what a lattice is these are really cool devices you've got one sitting over there right yeah it's a new hardware wallet it's a different kind of hardware wallet it's not a mobile one it's one that kind of feels a little bit similar to your amazon alexa your google home you leave it at home and it's got a big screen for you to digest the uh transactions that you are about to approve uh it's the kind of a new standard in security uh and i've been having a fun a lot of fun just playing with it it's pretty cool yeah lattice wanted us to let you know that they are back in stock for the bankless nation so we will include a link in the show notes if you want to pick up a shiny new lattice wallet they are back in stock all right david you're ready to get to markets let's do it there's so much is happening in the markets that's for sure always always and forever let's start with the bitcoin market what is going on with bitcoin did we just hit another all-time high my friend you know once again i i actually can't remember the last time we've done one of these where crypto hasn't hit all-time highs uh but yeah bitcoin 20 52 000 crossed the 50 000 mark after flirting with just being under it right after elon musk announced the tesla 1.5 billion dollars purchase of bitcoin uh bitcoin shot up to like forty eight thousand dollars and then it hovered there all of last week and now this week we're finally cross over that fifty thousand dollar mark so congratulations to bitcoin for breaking fifty thousand dollars that is a milestone 50k per bitcoin pretty impressive what's eth doing this week david ether is 1933 dollars i the way this is going i expect it to be higher by the end of this recording so we will see yeah by tomorrow morning when you're listening to this it may have hit 2k it may have hit 1800 who knows there's a lot of variability here but it is on a tear i wouldn't be surprised if we're 2k by tomorrow morning when you're listening to this we will just see eath has been an absolute tear as well so has total locked value in d5 it is up again hitting all-time highs what number is locked in d5 now 42 billion dollars locked in defy last one we recorded it was right under 40 billion dollars so in the last week we've piled on two extra billion locked in defy and of course the dpi is up to 430 dollars i remember when we started recording this ryan dpi was like at 80 or something when we started doing the weekly roll up so dpi has been on an absolute tear it is down a little bit on the week though which is interesting and i think this uh this kind of reflects in a ratio that we've been tracking on the roll-up that it you know indicates the seasonality we are in in crypto and this is the dpi to eat ratio do you want to talk about this ratio why it's important and what we're looking at this week yeah dpi of course is the index for d5 the top 10 defy assets and i've been paying attention to the eth dpi ratio because it's a it's a stronger signal in my opinion than the dpi to us dollar price because you know the dollar's inflationary highly inflationary and really ether and bitcoin are the new benchmarks and so especially with ether and ethereum dpi price versus ether really indicates how uh how risk on people are being how far down the market cap stack people are looking at and there was a pretty strong retracement in dpi versus ether in the last week and so it hit a it hit a high of 0.26 dpi per ether and now we are down to 0.225 um so but overall dpi is performing really really strongly versus ether but taking a little bit a bit of a retrace lately yeah it's interesting because it's not like dpi is necessarily weak it's been you know relatively consistent versus last week but it's just that ethan's been on a tear which which means uh that the dpi to eat ratio obviously goes down in those types of conditions um let's talk about bitcoin on ethereum this tweet by josh stark who noticed that our there are 173 000 bitcoin on ethereum right now that number is also up and he also takes us in this tweet uh where he kind of compares it to total bitcoin supply that's almost one percent 1.1 of all outstanding bitcoin is now on ethereum which is absolutely huge and if you compare it to sort of the uh more uh bitcoin-centric bitcoin maxillas maybe i might say uh scaling solutions like block streams liquid uh it's there's 63 times more bitcoin on ethereum than block streams liquid and there's 158 times more bitcoin on ethereum than there is on the lightning network now what do you make of this yeah first off this is something that fits in the ethereum ethereum native uh narrative excuse me is that like ethereum is this nexus of economic activity it's a it's a black hole of assets assets are more useful on ethereum there's bitcoin and then there's bitcoin on ethereum and bitcoin on ethereum is straight up more useful than bitcoin on bitcoin right so there's this natural gravitational pull to pull assets into ethereum and like lightning is just not really doing the things that people that bitcoiners really wanted it to be doing and i think there's a very strong case that uh all of the use cases of lightning are going to actually be facilitated by bitcoin on ethereum's l2s like perhaps loop ring loopering is fast instant payments trustless payments in the same way that lightning promised that but i think that wrapped bitcoin on ethereum is actually going to facilitate some of the same demand for bitcoin on the lightning network so lightning is based on state channel technology it's interesting to me david that state channels didn't really take off on ethereum either right and they're they're not taking off on bitcoin unfortunately for ethereum there are other layer two approaches available on ethereum we're talking about one in the podcast that comes out on monday morning which is roll-ups primarily um but um you know bitcoin has only had sort of this this one bullet in the chamber which is lightning and it's not sucking in a lot of bitcoin right now the crypto banks certainly are ethereum certainly is but not lightning all right david let's talk about miners for a second eth miners are making bank right now it's insane they made a total of eight 830 million in january dude and 40 of that was fee revenue right so again miners make revenue on any blockchain including ethereum or bitcoin in two ways one is uh issuance so they get a reward based in ether every time they mine a block successfully so that's issuance reward and they also make fees on the gas that you pay or the transaction costs that you pay on the bitcoin network these two fee structures combine to form the total miner revenue and what's amazing here is now transaction fees compose 40 of total miner revenue on ethereum so what do you make of these high numbers and that proportion of uh fees being minor being transaction fee revenue yeah this is just a very strong signal as to what the longevity of ethereum could be right the way that you understand a blockchain to be able to live long into the future is demand for block space and ryan if you click on that image it'll blow it up a little bit bigger look at that bar on the right that that red part on top of the blue part that's the fee revenue and the blue part is the issuance right they're almost equal they're almost equal in fee revenue to issuance and what that tells us is that uh if you take that fee revenue side of that that bar chart it's larger than all of the revenue that miners made in like the bear market for for almost an entire year like the fees that miners made in the last couple months match the entire fee the entire issuance and fees that they got in like 2018 and 2019. and this is really important this is super super important and the reason why is because if your blockchain can collect fees if the validators can collect fees you don't have to issue as much currency to fund security that means that your asset will be having less issuance which means your asset will be more scarce will be more hard the more fees that are collected the less you have to issue and so the whole narrative around like this this bitcoin hard cap is still thrown into question because we do not see this same minor revenue from fees in the bitcoin network the whole narrative around bitcoin is that at some point issuance will be replaced by fees yet we are already seeing this in the ethereum blockchain we are seeing a 40 out of the 100 of total revenue 40 of that is fees paid to miners in ether i don't know what the bitcoin fee percentage is i think the last time i checked it was like 10 to 15 but ether ether and ethereum is already out competing bitcoin in long-term sustainability ethers ultrasound money it's so ultrasound we're gonna talk we gotta i wanna talk two things about this too david just said to add on to what you're saying it is the case that if all of the bitcoin were issued as is the plan right and let's say all of the ether were issued that ethereum would be a higher security network than bitcoin today if they were both based on just transaction fee revenue which means ethereum's blocks are more valuable than bitcoin's blocks which is interesting because bitcoin is the one switching to 100 transaction fee revenue which is not its strength its strength is a meme store of value its strength is not the value of its block space and its network so it's kind of switching from its strength to its weakness in its issuance policy and again issuance policy is also security policy so these are trade-offs that uh you know people often confuse the other thing i wanted to say is all of this this red section that you're pointing uh at on on the graph guess what happens to this red section guys eip1559s means it starts to to go to holders this red section a large proportion of it starts to get burnt when eip1559 is active which means it actually decreases the ether supply so i don't know how much we're looking at here david but like 829 million right in january 39 of those were fees let's say it's like 300 million or so something to that effect um the large proportion of that would be burnt under eip 1559 say 200 million 250 million of fee burns that's a de-inflationary pressure on ether and the scarcity of eth so this chart is well gas fees suck right like it is long-term very bullish for the health and security and the product market fit of the ethereum blockchain for all the visual learners out there and for those on the podcast you should check out the youtube because there are plenty of things to to look at take that red section and then take that an equal amount of the size of that red section and like delete it from the blue section right and so like all of that red feels that you're seeing you can actually remove the issuance right and so if you remove the red part from the blue part that is actually the issuance of ether and the if the red part continues to go up and up and up the blue part will continue to go down and down and down under an eip1559 paradigm and just like that this whole roll-up turned into an eip-1559 episode yeah we could go on for 10 or 15 more minutes about this david but we've got to move on it's so cool it is awesome revolutionary part about this whole entire industry right now yeah and it's so underrated like most people don't understand this this is not the popular main street narrative this is the stuff that like you're hearing from bank list because you know people in the bank list computer are actually looking at this stuff anyway we've got to move on this is a really cool chart david this is companies by market cap dot market cap yes so this section is banks by market cap so um you can look at all total fortune 500 all the biggest companies in the world you can also just narrow it in by banks and what i love about this is if you rank all of the banks in the world and compare that to these new crypto banks bitcoin and ethereum uh bitcoin ranks number one it is now the biggest i guess money bank type system transaction system by market cap so it beats jp morgan chase it beats bank of america it beats icbc uh and ethereum is number of five in this four number four versus the banks five if you include include bitcoin exactly so it is number number four versus the banks maybe we'll focus on that so it has a ways to grow to beat jp morgan chase uh david but if it doubles if we're if we're seeing ether you know 3000 if we're seeing youth at 4 000 per eth then it becomes the biggest banking system by market cap in the world so what this tells me is that ethan is is climbing right up the banks uh to to the banks in terms of value but it's still also undervalued right like if you compare jpmorgan chase which is 440 market cap billion market cap versus ethereum right now which is a 221 billion market cap what's more valuable the credibly neutral money system for the entire planet backed by a reserve asset store of value money or boring old jp morgan chase i guess that's for investors to decide right and ethereum like banking services is just one of ethereum's possibilities right that's just one thing it can do it can also do like nfts and art and gaming like in all the other things like just banking is is selling ethereum short it has a multitude of possibilities and it's still just half the market cap of jpmorgan all right david the last thing we should explore in a market section is this chart which is really exciting to me as kind of a bankless maximalist as i know you and i are and a decentralization maximalist so this is from glassnode.com they put together fantastic metrics on this that i haven't seen anywhere else and this is a charting on ethereum the percent balance balance of each supply that's on exchanges right now and you can see this this chart over time versus uh it's compared this is that's the blue line here is the percent balance of each supply on exchanges and the gray line here is uh ether price and you can kind of see it ebb and flow but the good news is um the balance of ether on exchanges is going down and what that means is it's going to to other places essentially primarily back to the ethereum network primarily back to back to people's wallets back to the decentralized finance back to being bankless out of crypto banks and right now um there was at kind of the the early stages i guess of this this bull run or about a year ago or so about 17 of all ether supply on crypto exchanges and now there's 13 and it's continuing to drop this is really good for the bankless revolution because we want cons smart contract custody as much as possible we want self custody as much as possible we want a self-sovereign monetary system we want decentralization so this to me is a really bullish uh stat david what's your take yeah it's also doubly important for ethereum versus bitcoin to not have too much ether on exchanges because ether is a staking token right and so we want people to be staking themselves either through a decentralized service provider or just doing it at home too much ether on exchanges is less than ideal that means there's a lot of consensus by exchanges and while there are reasons to why that's that's not the end of the world it's still better if people are staking their ether at home and ether having this exodus from exchanges is good for that and it's also good for the price it's both a symptom of increasing price because when people buy ether they remove it from exchanges and then also there's less ether on exchanges to be bought right and so any further buying pressure increases the ether price at a faster rate the less and less ether price there is on exchanges i think you would you can note that the the lowest ether percentage on exchanges there's ever been was at the previous all-time high in 2017 uh when or just in january of 2018 when when eth had peaked out at the last uh last point in that cycle and so eth continuing to leave exchanges is just indicative of this being a bull market and we want that to continue absolutely well said david all right we are going to tell you a little bit about the fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible and then we will get to the releases stay tuned gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which

world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today all right david we're back with releases we gotta start with this one i think this is big news people so that is the the the artist mainstream artist who sold millions of dollars in nfts in december now beeple art is bringing the nft revolution to christie's christie's is an auction house david have you heard of christie's before not at all i have no idea okay so like i don't i don't know much about the um kind of the the art scene i don't buy a lot of art myself you know when i do it's like nft form but christie's i believe is an auction house where a ton of the most popular art is is auctioned off so this is how like art collectors uh in the real world buy art and equity for art this is liquidity for art in an auction style because every nft is different so these are non-fungible sort of you know collectibles of course uh they can't just trade them on an exchange so they typically auction them off and they do so at christie's well an nft is being auctioned off at christie's for the first time wow i'd love to be able to fly on a wall during that process like like these art collectors are getting educated in nfts in ethereum this is like you've talked so often david about um ethereum having a ton of surface area particularly this bull cycle to to collect uh mainstream interest and nfts are a big part of that surface area and now we're at christie's auction house with some of the most wealthy people in the world educating them about nfts that's big yeah yeah that's absolutely huge again like i would love to watch i don't know who these people that attend christie's would be but i would imagine that they are older in their lifespan because that's kind of the cohort of people that engages with art it's people that have had time to accumulate the wealth uh and so i would be interested to see like what how do you even display our like an nft art at christie's like are they bringing are they like wheeling a tv onto the stage to show the uh to show the art i don't know but uh congratulations to people for all just being a fantastic pioneer with the nft space uh and this is just extremely legitimizing nfts are really they've been having a moment but especially in the last like one to two weeks they've really started to just rocket ship into the mainstream uh mindshare yeah and it's cool because people's kind of a like an apostle of this because he both loves nfts and he loves kind of decentralization and and um and everything that's going on in d5 but this is not the only reason he he's in it to make money like there's a tremendous amount of economic opportunity here and at the end of the day that's what's going to draw the world into crypto is the economic activity in this this new land of infinite white space that that can be had here and that's exactly what's happening like billions of dollars billions of dollars of economic activity is going to draw the world into here um speaking of which let's talk about the first bitcoin etf in north america that's that's the headline speaking of which speaking of which but this is this is in canada it's not in the us yet um but i think it's still a big deal ontario securities regulator approved you would think it's a big deal mr canadian but i don't know if bankless solicitors know that i am uh i'm canadian and american i get my dual citizenship so i snuck this headline in because i'm you know canadian nationalist here um anyway i think this is big news and it's interesting i mean u.s regulators have got to catch up to other jurisdictions do they not this is this is a race this is an absolutely a race uh and the the most crypto friendly jurisdictions are going to be rewarded for this uh and i would always say canada is generally a little bit ahead of the curve when it comes to stuff generally just stuff uh and this this is a an indication of that yeah absolutely so it's good news hopefully an nf an nft an etf is on the horizon in the u.s as well um david let's talk about rye this is a we we i talked about this a little bit at the end of rollups is something i was excited about these new kind of money primitives algorithmic almost money primitives that were coming to ethereum and then uh here's one of them what is rye it's it's been released it's now live what is it yeah rye is a crypto native form of stability right and so rye for those that don't know rye stones are these very ancient uh like massively like massive stone discs that were used in like this island i don't know where i've got a picture oh yeah yeah it's a and it's a lesson about money right and so these things were a very early primitive form of money for these guys these uh people that lived on the island uh and so they if you go and like many many bitcoin podcasts and like history of money podcasts like use these rye stones as an example of how money forms and so because it's like a ledger right like each delegates represent no one moves them but uh they trade ownership of them as if as if it's a ledger of some sort and that's how their money system worked on this island right yeah and so i i think that's actually the only similarity between rye and rye stones and this dry project is just a name but what's really cool about this rye project is that it is self-referential stability right and so the the fantastic thing about maker dow is that it produces dye and dies worth one dollar the shitty thing about that is that the dollar sucks right the dollar is just exporting the the brand of the dollar into d5 right rye is a self-referential stability and so it's it's a little a little bit nuanced and it's kind of not really the right time in roll-ups to really explain how self-referential stability works but understand that it is a is a native native peg that doesn't need the currency an external reference point to become stable it's stable to itself uh and so this is about self-sovereignty this is about escaping the dollar and creating our own native forms of stability inside of ethereum right and the best part about this is that it's in it's also very similar to maker dow except one of the biggest differences exactly is that it's governance minimize where maker dao is very happy to have governance that's part of the the maker dao protocol what that leaves is that there is a potential for a governance minimized version of stability and this is what rai is uh one of my friends amin solemani is is part of this and also uh stefan who was actually the first to meet the nation that we ever did um for those that want to go back and learn about dai that's a great resource um and amin did this fantastic article which and his writing is really really good so definitely go check it out and he talks about the concept of like a new money god he rai is like this new money god and what amin is really talking about is a self perpetuating defy protocol that doesn't have human control a la a uniswap right a uniswap where uh at least with unisop v1 where there was no governance and it just perpetuated and because it required no external human dependencies no external human actions this thing can just perpetuate in the same way that bitcoin just perpetuates there's no external dependencies for bitcoin it just continues and so amin calls this like a money god because as soon as it's turned on the theory is the hope is is that it can't be turned off and it's all of a sudden here for the rest of time so long as aetherium exists so i'm very optimistic about the future of rye yeah it's super cool and it's all based on eth right so all of the collateral is eth only so that it's what gives it its its censorship incredibly neutral uh properties you know the other interesting thing about this david is like we this theme we talk about so often on bankless is that every experiment that can be tried in d5 will be tried i remember there was kind of a fork in the road for the maker project there were kind of two directions it could pursue one was honestly it's this rye direction right where you just you know collateralize the entire thing by eath but you make some trade-offs in in some other areas and the other and maybe you don't uh peg it directly to the dollar anymore and the other direction is the direction that that maker ended up taking which uh has ended up as like die is a is a is a great primitive stability primitive for ethereum and ford d5 but it also has a ton of centralized collateral like there's a ton of usdc and usdt backing it so it's not as pure so the cool thing about this is there's kind of like a fork in directions of the project maker took one direction and now here comes rye that's pursuing the other direction don't know if this experiment will work or not but we get to try it that is awesome so we'll see what happens here it's a pretty cool new primitive david tell us about euler beats i don't know what this is but tell us about this yeah euler beats it's a new nft uh release kind of in the same way that hash masks got released and also crypto punks got released yulu beats is this new nft experiment and what's different about this is that it's mostly auditory it's a music it's it's not it there is a visual component but what's cool is if you click on one of these ryan though it's kind of like a record player and it'll start to play if you go on to the website and this thing this graphic will start to rotate and there will be a music that is performed right by this this kind of like construction of a pattern right it's this automated thing uh it's kind of hard to explain so definitely go to the i'm i'm hearing the music now it's coming in my headset but no one else can hear this no one else can hear it but it's pretty cool and so each pattern has its own like musical orchestra to it it's musical notes and so what you are buying is the unique pattern that the music create is created out of these euler beats i think that's phenomenal and i think there's a huge world of nft music uh musical pieces that i think is yet to be created like imagine the world where like somebody like rac who one of my favorite artists who's deep in the into the d5 world i think he might be a listener what's up what's up andre uh creates total like create songs and then have those songs become tokenized where you can only listen to the song if you own a token right there's so much design space that's possible here and i'm really excited to see the world of musical nfts come about you know what's cool too as with people we didn't mention this but as with beeple these euler beats are all denominated in what david ether ether yep uh you put out this great great tweet earlier that art nft art is priced in eth that is the denomination of nft art right now even in christie's basically the way you buy that beeple art in the christie's auction is with eve it is denominated in eth this is an example of eth serving beyond the the store of value but all the way to the other end of the spectrum which is like the medium of exchange and even the unit of account this is an asset that is becoming more money-like over time and increasing in its in its money-ness uh which is which is pretty exciting i think for the the ethereum space yeah we're already seeing the explosion in digital art and that will be like like you said earlier the surface area for ethereum is massive and one of those surface areas is buying and selling digital art and that will all be done with ether i think the digital art revolution is absolutely upon us uh we're seeing that in basically every single indication that we can think of in any type of market participating like you don't have to give a give a about ethereum to to care about digital art you can care about digital art and not really care about d fire or ethereum but if you care about digital art you're going to need to have ether to buy that digital art because things are going to be denominated in ether ethan's money david all right i've heard i've heard that before let's talk about the pool protocol uh they just did a community airdrop so david for our listeners what is the pool protocol and what did they do yeah pool together is a no loss lottery where you can pool your funds with other people and for a a time period in that time period is one week and then for that week all of the funds that are pooled go into something like compound some interest bearing system uh and then it's the interest that is lotteried off not the actual underlying not the principle right so you will only put your interest at risk not your actual funds and so it's kind of like a leighton cusack ceo founder i actually met him in tel aviv when i did my ether new model for money talk leighton is a big fan of just like psychological tricks to get people to save money right and so it's a little bit of gaming but you are actually saving money along the way because you don't lose anything it's a no-loss lottery you can only lose your interest or you gain the interest of like a thousand other participants and the point is they just airdrop their pool token so if you have ever used pool together if you've ever bought a pool together lottery ticket you have the pool together airdrop so go claim that um ryan i think you you are a pull together participant or at least you were for a little bit i did and you know why david because i follow the bankless tactics i i subscribe to the bankless newsletter and i follow the tactics and we released a tactic in september 19th uh september of 2019 just about pulled together as a cool d5 protocol you could try and i tried it at that time i put like 38 dollars in 38 die in and that ended up being worth in this airdrop 81 pool tokens which of course these pool tokens they're just governance tokens so they they allow you to govern the parameters of the protocol but they do have a market value so if i were to sell those 81 pull tokens on a uniswap at least if i did yesterday it would have been worth fifteen hundred dollars so david this is another example of like def using d5 is rewarding in and of itself but also because of these token air drops that are coming down the pike all of the time uh we actually released something new to the bankless program which is an alpha alert email so what we're going to start doing for bankless members is sending you an alert when something big like this happens and you have an opportunity to make some immediate roi with an airdrop or some big opportunity so we sent that out the other day something timely uh so anyway it this is continuing the story of like using defy is is uh rewarding it's very rewarding it's a rewarding experience all around david let's talk about this uh this last interface which is dex guru this looks like another bloomberg terminal for defy what is this yeah i think we were talking before we started recording and i think this take is fantastic so i'm gonna steal it it's so easy to spin up a ui for d5 right this is like the fourth or fifth one we've seen in the last like two or three weeks it's just a new ui for you know uniswap sushi swap you know dex aggregation price movements blah blah blah like history on trades uh it's just a fantastic place to go look at what's going on in defy so if you guys want to go check that out that's decks.guru um pretty cool just a builder's inner like it builders paradise right because like any developer can create wire up their own interface and all you have to do is bring your crypto wallet to that interface and it's like just br bring your money to the interface you get to select what interface you want uh super empowering for developers and users alike all right and this is how uh defy ux and ui really gets fixed because the competition to have the best uh ux is absolutely massive like dex guru is entering a very hotly competitive space to be the ui for like dex uh activity yeah and you know what they probably did this with like two developers and they didn't need to ask anyone any permission in order to do this this is like the early internet all right um let's get to news uh robin hood to enable crypto withdrawals and deposits what is this is this due to some of the pressure they were facing from uh as a result of the gamestop fallout um maybe i don't know about that that would be very interesting if that was the the connection i think they are what they're really trying to do is follow in paypal's footsteps and just trying to get ahead of the crypto game they already had one foot in the door with when it comes to crypto and uh honestly it was the minimum foot in the door which is just having exposure to assets not actually owning them just exposure to just like ious that i use for bitcoin or ether or whatever yeah right except you could never actually withdraw your bitcoin or ether um but since crypto's heating up i guess robin hood is finally deciding to double down on what you can do with the crypto side of things and so now in the future it's not yet not live yet you'll be able to deposit and withdraw crypto assets from robinhood uh i think the next step is for them to enable alternative uh crypto assets that they have in there because if it's pretty abysmal in there if you go into uh the there's a folder in there i actually checked this out where you could tap the ethereum family and see all the ethereum family assets do you know what's in the ethereum family assets ryan i do just because you told me and it's pretty embarrassing but why don't you tell them it's ether and ethereum classic and that is what robin hood calls that's a messed up family that's that's robin hood get your together like get dpi in there come on well you know they are getting their together at least with this and what i love about this story is this is an example of the um the competitive pressure that's forcing a robin hood if they didn't have to do this they wouldn't they'd rather keep everything within their silo within their four walls but there's user pressure there's economic pressure there's competitive pressure and so they have to open up that is uh that is a good thing for crypto and for the world and for the banking system at large let's talk about another good thing for krypto my favorite edger yang tweet why don't you uh why don't you uh read out this tweet and talk about it david yeah andrew yang he tweets out as mayor of new york city he's not the mayor he's running for new york mayor so this is like a tweet trying to say like what he will do as mayor as mayor of new york city the world's financial capital i would invest in making the city a hub for btc and other cryptocurrencies andrew yang is my guy like he's got it he knows what the future is like he knows how to position america to capture that future to capture that innovation he is an entrepreneur and he's the right guy for the drop let's let's get andrew yang to become the new mayor of the financial capital of the world that's my that's my political opinion that's david's political opinion right so like so what's cool though is uh we're starting to get politicians on board into seeing that this is not a kind of sketchy um like terrorist currency that's only in the shadows that this is good for their economies it's good for america it's good for the world and it's good for their political prospects and that's what andrew yang is is doing here i i'm very certain he believes in the ideals of crypto but uh i i'm also certain that that he knows it's good for his uh mayoral candidacy candidacy in new york city so it's kind of a win win uh and so it's great to see him speaking up i hope more politicians do so but look andrew yang brought ubi into universal basic income into political discord something that like no one ever talked about so maybe he could do the same thing with crypto bring that into the wider political party platform and just foster the discussion and there's so much about ethereum that really aligns with andrew yang's message andrew yang is all about how do we figure out a way to inspire people to create how do we figure out ways and mechanisms for people to be more entrepreneurial and like personally i never really considered myself as an entrepreneur until i came into the crypto space until i came into ethereum because that's what this space creates we it's a very entrepreneurial rich environment and the important thing about ethereum is the is the amount of surface area it has for people to be able to monetize their labor rac second time i'm going to talk about andre rh ric uses ethereum the protocol to monetize his own labor for himself digital art creators making revenue making a business by creating digital art and selling it on ethereum sushi swap has like a 200 million dollar treasury to help people in their community do provide labor and then receive money for it as a job all the defy apps with treasuries are trying to pay people to do work for them the amount of jobs that ethereum is going to create in independently from like these large organizations these large legacy boomer organizations sorry boomers uh is is massive ethereum is going to create so many jobs and it's going to be creating jobs in the ways that andrew yang has been saying we need to create jobs like this we need to get figure out how to get people to monetize their own labor and ethereum does that david when we were setting andrew yang come on the podcast okay well i was gonna say when we were setting out goals for 2021 that was one of our goals to have andrew yang on the podcast over under on whether that happens this year what do you think it's andrew yang's coming on the podcast in 2021 he's gonna figure it out david is declaring it uh and i think we might yeah i should go get my andrea i'm sure he's listening so i'm sure he's listening he's gonna email us right after this um let's talk about more about this news which is i think news in a series of kind of the institutionalization of crypto but more specifically of defy so bitwise has just launched a new d5 fund it was only last week or maybe the week before we were reporting out on a roll-up that bitwise was starting to incorporate defy assets like ave and uniswap in its top 10 index so bitwise is like a it's like a set protocol it's like a traditional uh index that you can buy almost like an etf not quite an etf but that you can buy to give you exposure broad exposure to an asset class of some sort now they're launching a defy specific fund why is this important it's important because this is how institutions onboard into defy and bitwise is giving them a way to gain exposure to another bridge from institutions to our crypto world david any other takes on this yeah yeah it's really important because institutions when they say like oh this defy thing is hot like how do i get exposure to that like they're not going to go like researching individual tokens they are going to outsource that responsibility to someone else like bitwise right uh ryan i think if you scroll down it'll show the assets that are coming into the bitwise top ten is that true maybe not but like they're all the ones that you would expect which is like uni oh yeah yeah yeah we got it here uniswap ave synthetics maker compound uma urine finance uh 0x loop ring right that's it that's a great portfolio that's relatively similar to my bags so thanks thank you for buying my bags um very happy about that but yeah like i think bitwise is is it's inside of crypto but i would still call it quote-unquote institutional and so really what this is uh relaying to me is that the rest of crypto that isn't ethereum native that isn't really deep in the weeds of defy are pivoting to start to capture the value of d5 because that is the thing that is cool and unique about crypto this cycle yeah we are going to have the chief investment officer of bitwise on the bank list podcast here pretty soon to talk a bit more about that so stay tuned if you're interested in this story david let's talk about support eip1559.org this is how governance works in ethereum and in crypto can you talk about this and why this is important and they kind of relate it to you uh to governance yeah the this support eup1559 campaign is a response to a bunch of miners that are uh collecting themselves together to do the opposite where they're trying to nix eip1559 because obviously that's bad for is straight up bad for miners like there's less minor revenue if eip1559 goes in all those fees that we were talking about earlier that that we under an eip1559 paradigm that gets burned instead of going to the minor so miners don't like that uh if you want to listen to a really really good rant listen to uh anthony suzano and eric connor on their into the ether podcast that they did where they talked about this like the the mine the the minority of miners by the way and what's interesting about this is the support side of eip1559 is is also led by miners but the the anti-eip1559 also another a different set of miners different pools of miners like honestly those guys because they are making the most amount of money that they have ever made ever and they are just trying to say like no eip1559 is going to like destabilize ethereum we're not going to make any any money even with eip1559 miners are making the most money that they've ever made ever like cry me a river like this is why proof of stake is so important because miners are not aligned with ethereum as much as ether holders are so this this website is a website it's basically an advocacy type website where you can you know tweet your support you click a button you tweet your support and uh just go on record as saying you support eip 1559 and basically the entire community does support eip 1559 with a few very small exceptions except for miners but let's talk about this because i think this is interesting what i guess weapon what tool do what what leverage do miners have over the rest of the community so let's say i'm a miner i don't want to lose my revenue here and i i start saber rattling what's my threat to the ethereum community what am i going to do if you guys go forward with eip 1559 yeah the the minority of miners would be able to fork off their chain and i i guess they it would actually they wouldn't fork where like when eip1559 comes in that's going to be a fork and so the miners that don't want that are just going to continue on in their own chain but like good luck convincing the rest of us to go with you right this is the power of community consensus if there's two forks the community will choose the one that they want to go with and from what we can tell eip1559 with overwhelming support everyone's going to choose the fork with that support so you know go go fork ethereum and like go play in your like non-eip1559 playground have fun with your like one dollar eath fork the apps aren't coming there the community is not coming there the users aren't coming there i guess the upside is we might get an extra token out of this that we can we can go sell dropping right like so this is like an ethereum classic classic type of situation so they really don't have leverage here yeah they really don't have the leverage here which is super interesting but if you're an eath holder it's kind of all upside right because you you basically get you know both forks uh in in this types of uh situation but this is also an example of how governance works right this is this is kind of the counter forces at play and ultimately community consensus is the engine here is the governance layer that layer zero everyone together deciding which fork they're going to download and support is the community and that's what ethereum is works the same in bitcoin and it's a brilliant i think mechanism for for governance that's as credibly neutral as it can be well i'll actually be uh push back on that and be the devil's advocate here so for anyone that wants to call me an eth maximum list here's my critique of this i don't want in the long term any sort of like i support this fork versus i support this fork because the whole point of ethereum in the long term is no governance right we were talking earlier about rye and how it's like a money god because it's autonomous and free from human intervention this is like this is you know support eip1559 that's the same like messages i see when i see like the billboards or the the road signs about like in seattle where i live where like there's political movements about like let's you know add in taxes onto soda or gas that's not what we want for ethereum to be so like the fact that this is even here is a little bit concerning i don't want ethereum to be a politically engaging thing it's supposed to be autonomous there isn't supposed to be any sort of like political rallying to try and change the direction of ethereum the direction of ethereum should be the direction of ethereum which is autonomous and takes its own course again we are in this early research and development phase of ethereum so that's why i'm okay with it but over the long term i don't want any sort of this activity at all yeah and i think i would agree with you right so the only answer to uh can we completely neutralize all political decisions basically is to to solidify your base protocol and don't make any further changes and at some point that will happen to ethereum i think actually some point soon in the next like three to five years we'll get all of the the core changes we need into ethereum uh in the same way that bitcoin is kind of like codified it's it's solid there are no further changes although there's probably one coming down the pike once issuance gets to zero and security drops maybe ooh spicy spicy but like but yeah i agree with you ultimately um this has to happen with ethereum but in the meanwhile we have this nice kind of fork choice rule that lets the the community and social consensus ultimately decide anyway david let's get to the next release news item which is nba top shots man this is this thing's heating up the dapper labs uh community company actually behind this is raising 250 million dollars david at a two billion dollar valuation i feel like i'm in 2017 when i saw like when i saw the the uh telegram ico here is that what we're looking at or like is there something here what is this nba top shop thing what is dapper labs doing here yeah the numbers are absolutely staggering a 250 million dollar raise that's not the valuation that's how much people that's literally how much cash people are handing over to dapper labs at a valuation of two billion dollars and so dapper labs is the team behind cryptokitties and so they were one of the first teams to really experiment with nft's on chain and it was so incredibly successful that it clogged the chain back in 2017 it's a famous story and so this is kind of like the payoff or the reward of being early and figuring out development issues in ethereum as soon as possible right cryptokitties the cryptokitties craze was absolutely phenomenal it was massive and it brought so many people into ethereum who again don't care about ethereum they only cared about the kitties and how like unique they were and like they just they just came for the kitties uh and so dapper labs had that experience in 20 2017 and then they they took that information they put their heads down they built for two years and then they landed this nba top shot deal which is already pulling in millions and millions of dollars of revenue like these it's an nft system with the mba right so nba plus nfts and that's uh ran by the dapper labs team uh so congratulations guys like you guys earned it uh well done that's a massive raise yeah interestingly enough so i think one difference between 2017 is actually they're generating a lot of revenue right like the firm has generated almost 100 million in nft sales right so the the icos of 2017 weren't doing that the other thing is it's interesting that uh nba top shots is not built on ethereum so it's on this blockchain that dapper labs has created called flow and what it kind of reminds me of what flow kind of reminds me of is it's much less decentralized than that versus ethereum it almost reminds me of like a binance chain for nfts or like a base for nfts type of offering i think ultimately all of this is synergistic with what's going on in defy but um it's interesting to see how this is evolving across chains as well um david let's get to this exploit which is our next topic so there was an issue with alpha finance recently and it's funny because we've recently had them on for an ama and asked me anything for the community like two days after that uh there was an exploit via alpha finance uh at like 38 million dollars lost something like that uh 37 37.5 million lost what's what can we like take away from this this exploit yeah the uh the d5 summer cohort of applications of which cream is a part of uh and even later alpha i believe are very big fans of integrations partnerships building with other apps and i think that's fantastic the unfortunate side effect is that that is a lot of surface area for attack um so that's kind of basically the story here there was an economic exploit i believe um that leveraged the the iron bank which is this very interesting project which i'm trying to get some content out of the bankless program on the iron bank in the future um and um unfortunately because of the composability uh they had a weakness that was exploited sad yeah it's it just it's another reminder and we'll talk about this when it happens but it's another reminder that hey this is the wild west this is risky it's the frontier be careful what you put into these d5 protocols i was struck by how like talented the alpha team is but also david when we talk to them about the like i was struck by the complexity of the protocol right so these protocols are getting more and more complicated and sophisticated and with that complication uh comes these sorts of potentials for for backdoors and flaws like alpha was audited out like like crazy and this still happened so um you know the the most powerful risk mitigator of any protocol is what we call the lindy effect that is how long it's been going on the total locked value during its lifespan the longer it lives without exploit the longer you can expect it to live in the future and alpha's still a relatively new protocol so i'm not blown away that this happened at all but we should remember that this kind of thing does happen and can happen in d5 and just be careful out there guys um another thing to be careful of is volatility liquidated don't get liquidated we saw a little bit of volatility right recently like these these these are like little you know bear markets dips for ants i feel like david but like this 30 dip that we had i don't know in the last week it's over now yeah it was on tuesday monday and tuesday on tuesday liquidated a whole bunch of people who had loans taken out of ave curve unit swap d5 this is the biggest liquidation we've seen in d5 so far 1.6 billion in total liquidations that tells me a lot of people are playing with with some leverage here in these volatile markets lots of people playing with leverage which of course is arguably the reason why these markets tumble when they do tumble is because people get really bullish and then and then they take leverage because they want more exposure and then things don't go their way and so they get scared and so they deleverage and what happens when you deleverage is that you have to sell into the market to cover your position and since things were already going down it made you sell which makes people the market price go even down even more which makes more people sell and so like we will watch the price of bitcoin price of ether price of these defy tokens like skyrocket and that's a sign of people taking on leverage and then that people get out over their skis and then things won't go their way and then it'll tumble back the other way it's not sustainable so these these contractions these retracements are really really important for a healthy market don't get wrecked folks like don't take too much leverage the whole point about this cryptocurrency revolution is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime event and if you it up because you took leverage you're an idiot like don't do that yeah like we're going west this is the oregon trail do not get killed somewhere on the trail like just stay alive that's your number one goal in the bankless program stay alive to fight another day and leverage man leverage can kill you um unit swap has processed over 100 billion in volume there's nothing too much to say we talk about unit swap all the time this is an incredible feat it's a team size of 11 and they did this with a protocol david i mean yeah team size of 11 but they had ethereum on their side exactly right so like it it what we're really looking at is a like team in kind of their garage almost like you know the early silicon valley days that can disrupt entire industries that's what crypto that's what ethereum gives you the power to do so super exciting great milestone well done hayden adams come on the podcast we know you're listening okay uh coinbase powers tesla bitcoin buy feels like coinbase is maybe evangelizing among like the executives in corporate america about crypto and maybe bitcoin specifically what's uh what's the take on this headline yeah the the big news of last week's roll up was the 1.5 billion dollar purchase of bitcoin from tesla and now the we were finding out that they actually got that bitcoin on coinbase so really bullish for the coinbase ipo honestly uh and i'm sure they took a nice fee out of that that was that was probably pretty good for their bottom line yeah coinbase is going to be one of the biggest ipos of all time one of the biggest tech ipos over of all times like looking at like 80 billion right now if you're you're to believe kind of like futures volume so that's going to be huge for the industry uh last thing tell us about the crypto punks nft movement someone bought this crypto punk for 600 for 1.2 million dollars 650 each what's going on here yeah yeah so crypto punks are kind of one of the og nft phenomenons i'm pretty sure they came back around in 2017 along with cryptokitties uh and so the each one has different features just like cryptokitties each one has different desirable you know aspects about them apparently people really really value this particular one it's uh i i don't know it's a guy it's a it's a guy in a bandana uh funny thing enough these these things are i think 25 by or 24 by 24 pixels and i did the math ryan it's 1.12 ether per pixel is the evaluation on this nft which is insane wow what a punch per per pixel maybe maybe the most expensive per pixel art piece ever sold possibly i don't know um like so i look at this david and i don't understand why this is worth 1.24 billion but that's okay like million excuse me not billion but like i'm not in the the culture like i again i don't know if we were to go to christie's auction house and you're gonna tell me some painting was worth millions of dollars i wouldn't know that either but the market gets to decide the price of these things which is super interesting yeah absolutely crazy the nfcs are hot let's go to takes david what takes do you want to start with let's start we're going to start with let's do it all right let me start with this so uh i tweeted this out i said i found binance chain david do you remember those aol cd roms these come out um i was actually too young for these man you're too young all right i'm like the elder millennial here right so we used to get them in our house we used to play like frisbee with them and aol would just like mass spam everybody these cds and it was kind of like a gateway to try aol and it was really a gateway to the internet so people um are are comparing the binance chains transactions to ethereum transactions and when they do that i part of me gets it but a huge part of me me doesn't because binance chain is basically it can't be compared with an open permissionless credibly neutral settlement network like ethereum it's a separate thing binance chain is aol it's not the internet right and i think people really need to understand that when you're looking at transactions on something like like aol you're not looking at transactions on the open internet these are separate things so binance chain is really like a permissioned world garden and that is indeed i think synergistic with open networks like ethereum but they're not the same thing like if if the internet stopped at aol david like the internet would suck it was a completely different experience all kind of curated applications from aol and later like time warner and it's nothing the same as the the open internet so i guess my message is understand like we're in a bull cycle so there's all of these narratives flying around but like understand the fundamentals of these networks are totally different they are the aols out there that claim that they are open and that they're the same thing of the internet and then there's the true internet networks like bitcoin and networks like ethereum that are permissionless open credibly neutral those are the things long term that are going to be important for this industry and for humanity and the aols will just become it like another cd you play you play frisbee with so anyway that's the hot take here i love it i love it all right let's move to yours um art is priced in eth david did we already talk about that should we talk about that again a little bit yeah let's talk about it again though so uh mariano and eric connor talking about uh mario mariano gives like the one fire emoji for the phrase tokens are priced in us dollar and then two fire emojis for tokens or price in each but then three fire emojis for arthur art price and ether we talked about this earlier of course and eric connor just drives this point home the future of art will be priced in eth uh the future of already is digital and that digital art will be priced in eth that's super cool do you think though that what could happen with the artsy and nft art scene is that stable it will start to be priced in stable coins as well or do you think like eth preserves its uh unit of account in this world in kind of a different way yeah that's a really good question definitely something to pay attention to i don't have an answer for you however i will say that the nft mania that's going on is these things being priced higher and higher and higher is going in a correlated fashion to the price of ether so yeah it's super fascinating everywhere we see nfts they're largely at least right now denominated in ether so it definitely lends some credibility to that take um david i want to get to this take and this is a picture if you're watching on youtube what am i looking at in this first picture here it looks like almost like you know the brain it looks like neurons firing here what is this picture yeah i got this picture um it's from a it's from a wikipedia article but it's supposed to be some sort of like a networking infrastructure testing mechanism right and if it came from uh my conversation i had with trent and zach cole from whiteblock where whiteblock would try and recreate environments to test networks they they like eos hire them to test networks and other other studios with working in distributed systems would ask them to test their network and so they would create this like pseudo replication of the internet right and this is the picture that we're looking at right it's like this branching forking uh like network of just connections and nodes and it's supposed to be like a representation of um just the way the topological map of the internet right and uh will price tweeted out an image that caught your attention and i think if uh yeah that's the one that's the one and this is a semantic network of ethereum right and so this is actually connections as to um transactions and and calls and things i'm not a coder so i'm going to flub all these words but like all of the transactional data and contracts that people use on ethereum it looks the same it looks the same it looks like the same kind of like structure same kind of pattern semantic mapping it's pretty cool this is like a superstructure that we see in nature all of the time like if you look at kind of in like deep space at how galaxies are arranged it's kind of in this like network like fractal type pattern that we see in you know trees and veins and arteries and in in you know pine cones and snowflakes and all of these things this fractal pattern you wrote this great priest david called uh ethereum is an emergent structure and it's funny because this is kind of how emergent structures look right like they're kind of chaotic kind of unpredictable uh but they somehow aortic organization okay what is capable what is chaotic organization because i think that's important to the take here right it's organization through chaos right like what happens when a bunch of chaos just is allowed to just be chaotic over time eventually patterns emerge eventually we get order out of the chaos and that's what we call defy right like eventually defy stratifies it self organizes it self creates uh and that's the pattern that we're seeing here it's an emergent structure all right david uh let's go with another michael saylor type take he's buying more bitcoin you know what's interesting too is he is buying bitcoin uh once again with convertible notes so what what's crazy here david is debt for everybody is relatively cheap right now like home mortgages if you look at that on kind of the consumer side but corporate debt is super cheap too because of course the fed sets interest rates interest rates are at an all-time low so if you're a big corporation with a decent balance sheet and some cash flows you could borrow a lot of money the question is once you borrow that money what do you do with it michael saylor is borrowing that money at really low interest rates like two three percent super low interest rates because the money printer is cranking the money printer's printing so he's borrowing all this money uh more and more of it it seems what's he doing with it he is investing that in crypto in particular he's investing that in bitcoin he's buying bitcoin so he's playing like this um money printer arbitrage game where like he's like okay print the money it's super cheap i've got a good balance sheet i'm just gonna take that money no i'm not gonna plow it back into my business because i i couldn't invest 600 million dollars in uh my microstrategy business and grow my business analytics products but i can take that money and i can go and buy bitcoin with it and that's going to be worth a lot more later it's crazy dude this is corporate arbitrage once again and it feels like the like he's found a hack he's found like some sort of hole in the matrix exploit that like the other corporations haven't quite seen yet and he's uh he's front-running that uh we're gonna see more of this aren't we david what's your take here yeah my my take is actually we forgot to include this in the news section that mike michael sailor and michael jackson bought success because it's this is a lesson in printing printability versus unprintability right michael saylor can print as much micro strategy stock stock as he wants and then he can take that and people are giving him dollars which again are printed and then he's buying bitcoin with it which is unprintable right and so this is a lesson in printability versus unprintability yeah it's a fairly smart move all right guys we're gonna come back with what we're excited about and the meme of the week but first we want to talk a little bit about the sponsors that made this roll-up possible ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave.com that's aave.com if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma mobile app dharma is a non-custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right

friend yeah i am excited about this podcast that i didn't know that we were going to produce until this week when i fell down this little rabbit hole that i went down and so i'm on a quest to produce this article that's coming out going to come out on the bank newsletter at some point in time all about how like one of the most underappreciated things about the cryptocurrency industry is our culture and it's one of our best exports the crypto one of the cryptocurrencies best exports is our culture and uh yeah my ideas aren't really completely formulated around this so i'm going around the ecosystem to talk to people who i know has ideas around this so i've talked to amin i mean soleimani and then he forwarded me to uh this guy peter pans who's a big nft fan he's in the meta cartel uh has his own podcast wizard of the dapps uh and he wrote this uh four part series as the the called uh before bitcoin the history of cryptography and the cyberpunks and so what i've done is i read every single one of them except i've recorded myself and it's a fantastic story it's a mind-blowing story and so we're going to get peter pan on the podcast to talk about what it was like to uh to write that in addition to actually the the audio of me reading it it's a it's a mind-blowing story i think it's going to be a really unique piece of content and it just kind of illustrates my big takeaway was that bitcoin and ethereum are just the latest in a multi-decade year-long story of the evolution of cryptography and so if you think that like bitcoin just came out of nowhere it's like oh we have bitcoin now like no no was there were three decades of fighting between uh these cryptographers cyber cypherpunks and the us government to produce what we can to now do today with cryptography and it's an underappreciated story it's undertold and i hope we can tell it on the bankless podcast that sounds super awesome this this movement we say so often is a cultural movement it's a social movement and when you can get to the roots of where the social movement came from and what the belief structures are that formed it i think you tend to understand crypto and what we're trying to do here all the better that that sounds awesome david i'm excited to dig into that with you ryan what are you excited about uh i'm excited about the movement too and i feel like the bankless movement the d5 movement is going mainstream so uh david we we i i got on the the andrew yang podcast about a week ago gang speaks so not with andrew yang uh not yet that comes when hopefully andrew yang comes on the podcast but they were they reached out to us because they were interested in crypto basically they were interested in in doing sort of a 101 on crypto so uh we got on yang speaks that's kind of one mainstream type event we're also getting mark cuban to come on the bankless podcast because it's a big deal nfts he's really into defy so he's being scheduled on the podcast we hit 25k subscribers on the bank list newsletter so i feel like this defy crypto this bankless movement is growing and uh i'm super excited about the progress we've made my friend yeah absolutely the the bank list is a really scalable meme um people people when i wear my bankless shirt people like i don't know what that is but i like it and i'm like you definitely know what it is but i bet you do like it so i i think that the future is bright all right david let's get to the meme of the week i'm going to share this screen maybe the theme of the week what are we looking at all right so we're looking at the scooby-doo guy i don't know what his name is actually does that make me a boomer i don't know the blonde guy the from scuba boomer would know who scooby-doo is i'm sorry okay so he and he's about to pull the mask off on the villain and on the mask on the villain says on the blockchain and then the caption is let's find out who this really is and then the mask is pulled off and it's the ether logo and it's actually built on ethereum fun fact when you see on the blockchain there's a decent chance that they're actually just talking about ethereum yeah absolutely uh ethereum definitely underpins a ton of this industry and i think is underappreciated as a brand right so even even when i'd like describe kind of what i do they're like oh you're into that bitcoin thing like bitcoin is the the coca-cola type brand that describes all of the other uh all of the other like you know soft drinks uh and uh it's interesting that that so much of this is actually built on uh on ethereum too so all right um that's the me of the week this has been the roll-up third week of february week of february guys we're almost concluded almost the end of feb it's not leap year nope we're almost done february that's it disclaimers yeah disclaimers keith is risky crypto is risky so is bitcoin you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
