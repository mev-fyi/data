coordination how you doing this is the first episode of season two of the green pill podcast we are going to go down a rabbit hole on decentralized identity and look at how it can create more positive some games decentralized identity allows us to go from a dark forest where everyone's a potential adversary to being being able to see our counterparty but digital identity lights the dark forest and it enables more positive some games and repeat interactions with our counterparties in markets and that is why i think it's a foundation of a regenerative society so this whole season is going to be a rabbit hole on civil resistance and digital identity and we are about to go down a rabbit hole with professor brian ford who leads the decentralized and distributed systems lab at the swiss federal institute of technology what is civil resistance why does it matter civil resistance is basically sock puppet resistance how do you prevent someone from manufacturing new identities and then what you can do is you can enable one human one vote dowse one human would vote systems and go from one token one vote systems to one human one vote systems which is deeply important for democratic dolls for positive sum games that matter for everyday people not just the ones who have money this is a problem that is at the heart of get coin grants which is built on quadratic funding which depends on civil resistance and i'm so excited about this episode with dr brian ford because a it's a perfect kickoff episode for season two of the green pill podcast b civil resistance has huge upside for the space and since i've been doing research on civil resistance everyone has been like you got to talk to professor ford because he's been working on this problem since 2006 when he got his phd at mit he continues to write and think about civil resistance back then it was about spam attacks in wikipedia defacing these days it's about quadratic funding quadratic voting one human one vote dows and dr ford just understands theoretically and empirically how to design these systems we talk about four categories of civil resistance that he has studied government-based civil resistance so basically your id cards biometric identity social network trust-based systems and then presence-based systems so what a great way to tee off season two of the green pill podcast which again is all about digital identity creating more positive some games and outcomes for democracy digital identity is a foundational part of regenerative society and decentralized society and this is the perfect rabbit hole to go down when it comes to the data structures composable money legos that can create the assurances of civil resistance and so without further ado i give you professor brian ford to talk about his 15 years of research on civil resistance enjoy the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet opera lets you access

personhood the more your name comes up um it sounds like you've been working on this problem of civil resistance since 2006. um what got you interested in civil resistance uh well uh it was really during the uh previous uh um era of um global interest in decentralized systems namely peer-to-peer systems uh like file sharing systems like napster and the nutella and um and distributed hash tables and things like that back in the early early 2000s as well as uh um the the the very um well-known famous paper by a short paper um um uh about that uh titled the civil attack that that kind of demonstrated uh uh you know how hard and important the problem is uh you know how how fundamental the problem is uh in that like you know no decentralized system we have ever built has been able to stand up you know to uh you know to to civil attacks in a meaningful way in uh you know ultimately right and that was the case then and it's the case now yeah so pulling out quotes from one of your papers combating civil attacks is at the heart of many online problems such as spam wiki vandalism online ballot box suffering and solving it should need not and should not force us to give up our privacy that's a quote that i pulled out from from one of your papers so just to frame in the listener's mind it's not all about decentralized dowels uh when you're doing this research on the space it's more about email spam and wiki vandalism and online ballot box stuffing right so so though yeah those are examples of of you know these different symptoms in this you know very broad you know uh class of problems basically you know and it affects practically everything we do in the decentralized world you know you know including but not limited to taos you know but but these basic problems like just spam that came a lot earlier right so i mean if you were redesigning the internet if you're redesigning udp and tcpip the the protocols that the power of the internet would you have baked in identity as a first principles thing and you know how do you think about starting to solve these problems yeah well that that's a really good and really difficult question because uh you know and it's it's hard to answer because you know i'm in a way i'm glad the internet didn't bake in identity you know in that it left left flexibility i kind of have to suspect at least my pessimistic side says that tells me that if the early designers of the internet had baked in identity it probably would have been a not very privacy preserving right you know kind of very strong identity kind of system where like you know show your id forget privacy kind of thing and you know fortunately you know they didn't do that and we've had you know some time to some decades to think about how we want to approach identity and personhood so you know at least gives us a little room despite all the problems it created i i guess i would like you know i wonder if this if this is valid pushback but you know with browsers supporting cookies which it can basically follow you from site to site it feels like that's kind of the beginning of an identity protocol at least the way the advertising ecosystem has evolved around around cookies would you would you qualify cookies as sort of an identity system that was baked into the early web i i wouldn't really go so f go that far i would i would i would call it a tracking mechanism you know a mechanism for you know linking a future visit with a previous visit right you know by one person running in one one browser or you know one um you know and uh you know as an identity calling it an identity mechanism is a real stretch until and unless you bring in the uh you know kind of the um the the you know mass surveillance flavor of that yeah you know kind of the the fact that you know you know modern advertisers then go and link those tracking ids with all kinds of external databases without our knowledge or consent or any transparency and then yeah you're right it probably becomes to some degree a non a very non-consensual identity system you know which is you know i fi as a privacy person i find completely you know creepy and unacceptable in the in the big picture but you know so yeah i think you're right that it kind of evolved into a quasi-identity system but i don't think it was you know ever intended to as that in the first place it was basically just a convenience mechanism to recognize someone who was coming back right right yeah and it was and it was never even trying or pretending to be any sybil resistance mechanism because you know from the from day one you could have any number of browsers on any number of machines and those by default you know wouldn't be linkable you know by the basic cookie mechanism right right yeah it's almost like a centralizing force that you've got these massive advertisers with a business model who are trying to link the data and they make millions of dollars a year and consolidate into bigger and bigger data centers in machine learning systems and so it's a centralizing force but um you know and i actually actually i was listening to a podcast with mark andreessen and i think that he had said that uh the way cookies were designed was one of the things he thinks that could have been done differently at the beginning of of the internet so um you know i guess maybe maybe to back up a step i i would just wonder with the last 40 years of designing digital systems in the evolution of the internet what do you now think an appropriate civil resistance solution could could look like does it leverage crypto economics what kind of technologies does it leverage what criteria does it have and what does it not have yeah well you know that uh unfortunately that's still a in my understanding a very open research question yeah you know it's it's still not clear you know what the best or or even you know what what the available approaches to civil rights at least personhood-based civil resistance of course which is my you know my interest you know of course there's a lot of you know non-personhood based uh you know approaches to civil resistance proof of work proof of stake uh you know proof of storage prove you know it's it's actually pretty you know technically pretty easy to come up with a just a cost that people have to pay in proportion to how many sybils you want you know and that that's what that that's what you know kind of these these classical um uh you know just economic barriers to entry are um you know but but they're fundamentally limited uh in that they're you know they're they're limited in you know not being truly decentralized not being fair by any human definition of fairness certainly not by any democratic you know classic you know democratic definition of fairness right so so if we focus attention on you know personhood base like you know one person one vote rather than one dollar one vote you know approaches uh so you know it's it's still very much an open research question you know whether that's even reliably solvable let alone in a secure privacy preserving fashion yeah um and i i'm basically aware of four main categories the four main uh approaches uh you know depending on the principle you you leverage either basically a government paper trail uh you know government identity or biometric identity linking people by actual biometric features or third is the the large social social network or trust network um you know category and then the fourth fourth is basically presence based trying to ver verify you know real people are present at some kind of uh online or offline event at a particular place in time right um you know so and all of those approaches there's many variants of all you know for those categories they all have important strengths weaknesses and trade-offs that uh um and it's you know very much unresolved still uh if any of them is ultimately going to you know prove um to have the right set of uh properties that we really want right beautiful so we just heard that there's four different categories of approaches to solving civil resistance the government identity approach the biometric identity social network web of trust model and then present based and then none of them are really a silver bullet they all have different important strengths and trade-offs associated with them is that a fair summary of what you just said yeah absolutely got it um i think that we've we've covered a lot of the what of of civil resistance but i just want to to to focus pinch and zoom a little bit on the why of civil resistance as i see it as someone who's working within the web 3 ecosystem one of the beautiful sort of pictures that that i've i've seen articulated of what could happen if if civil resistance ecosystem could be could be built is one human one vote dallas as opposed to one token one vote dallas which are inherently uh plutocratic which you know we can enable genie coefficient measurements ubi could be streamed once you have one human one vote it solves for spam uh civil resistant air drops quadratic voting quadratic funding you know these these are maybe other what's inside of the y but i just envisioned this world in which we've built there's web3 is trying to rebuild the internet of money and it strikes me that right now it's still a very plutocratic system even though it's open source and transparent now and in solving this one identity problem of civil resistance is how it could go from plutocratic web 3 into web 3 that serves the needs of everyday citizens the preferences of the poor and the many over the rich and the few that's my why for solving this problem i'm curious how that resonates with you and um and you know how your why has evolved over time yeah i i um yeah that i i think that's that's great and i i think we're not that far apart in you know why i might use uh slightly older more traditional terminology uh in describing my why i would i would be more willing to use the word democracy um and you know participation you know kind of words that existed uh you know for um uh before the term dao and uh you know and and web three and you know these these kinds of things and i think um you know most of these concepts in this in particular these why's you know kind of long predated web free of course um uh and and it's partly just you know about uh in the question of in online or offline governance uh you know do we want one person one vote or one dollar one vote to prevail right um and you know currently online we really only the only choice we technically have is one dollar one vote right and you know we need the at least the ability to to do one one person one vote um uh you know deliberations or you know democracies uh uh your participatory structures of any kind uh whether we call them dows or or something else and whether whether they're technically centralized or decentralized in other ways right yeah yeah i think it's beautiful to use the word democracy i'm actually sort of embarrassed that i didn't use the word democracy in in my description at all um but one of the sort of like big opportunities i see here is the ability to take democracy and build high-resolution democracies into web three in into some of these dial-based systems so you know absolutely yeah uh um so i i i uh yeah i mean i'm curious i'm curious like of the four categories where what are the promising solutions that you've seen and what are you excited about right now well so um i i would say i would say say the you know the government paper trail approach is attractive because it's the most you know it's the one that's obviously the most compatible with the existing prevailing systems right you know kind of you can take existing kyc know your customer mechanisms and you know all of these kinds of mechanisms that already exist and are already widely deployed you know and you you can build some kind of you know me i would say non-ideal certainly less than less than privacy preserving you know proof of personhood you know on top of those those kinds of systems yeah you know so the the delta the the effort delta um you know investment delta is certainly going to be smallest you know to to deploy a you know government id based proof of personhood at a large scale and and you can you know take that kind of approach and make it more privacy preserving by say adding a privacy preserving layer on top of government id or you know things like that like yeah so there's still a bunch of caveats it's still not perfect it's not really what i would call the ideal but you know it's it's maybe the most likely the most uh you know immediately deployable internationally um but you know so that's the attraction of that approach now the attraction of biometric identity of the form you know india has deployed with over a billion of its citizens um you know the attraction of that is it's clearly and obviously scalable right it's also clearly and obviously usable uh even by you know kind of lots of people with no special expertise right and most of the most of the more technical geeky approach to approaches to uh proof of personhood that i think both you and i are fans of you know that has not been proven yeah you know for either social trust network approaches or pseudonym parties or anything else you know we have not proven that you know massive you know that a billion of peo you know people in a um uh in a large country can all or mostly reliably use use that thing right so so that's attractive about you know biometric identity on the other hand there's you know obviously some super creepy disturbing and worrisome problems about not only privacy but just general reliability because of you know false positives and false negatives still happen it's not clear how civil resistant that that approach really is uh in the presence of say any single point of failure or point of compromise in even a single compromised registration authority right so yeah you know so it in all of the biometric identity designs i've seen it doesn't look that difficult for you know a single compromised registration authority to create all of the fake you know sybils that they want right and that's uh you know that's a big security issue independent of of all the privacy issues right so you know so so again biometric biometric identity has these very strong attractions but it's a really you know really scary and worrisome uh downsides too now um coming to social networks so you know social networks like in the tradition of you know pgp key signing parties web of trust etc um you know this approach has has a lot of appeal from the let's say geek appeal you know frankly uh from the uh you know strong decentralized yeah yeah you know the you know the real you know kind of decentralized uh you know philosophically decentralized community and and i'm you know partly you know i i partly count myself uh in that community i i feel the appeal of that too you know as decentralized as possible you know it would be nice to just you know trust only your friends and build a you know kind of massive reliable secure private structure based on that right i totally feel the appeal the problem is uh you know with this with this approach uh i mean it has a number of problems one of the fundamental problems is uh is there's there there seems to be no um you know when you ask your friends to vouch that you're not a single right so that like if i ask you to vouch that you know i have no other identities i'm asking you to vouch a negative like you know if i if i want you to vouch that you know i can play piano or you know i have a certain ability well you can say oh show me and i'll show you myself playing the piano and you say okay you've proven it to my satisfaction you know you have reasonable confidence you have a reasonable basis of confidence right that like you know maybe you're now willing to put money on the fact that you know you know um on the other hand you know if i tell you that i'm not superman right well you know it's i'm probably not superman but you know maybe i am how would you know right you know what what basis do you have you know to to vouch for for that right and and even in just normal life you know people habitually wear alternate roll hats all the time you know it's it's one of our basic psychological you know i would say defense mechanisms to you know show show different facets of ourselves in work or in you know personal life or to a lover or you know we we have we play different roles very naturally anyway um and yeah you know and just like you know um vouching that you know a friend no matter how you know well you know them has no other identities other than the ones you know that that you know they have presented themselves to you with um you know strikes me as just a very you know tenuous uh ask basically right from a social perspective and then um and then you know if you what then once you you try to you know and that that's just kind of the interpersonal problem in this in this basic equation then then you know at the larger scale if you're trying to account for the fact that you know small groups of people might collude or like you know uh to to create you know sybils or groups of sybils um you then have to have to start relying on even more tenuous graph analysis type assumptions you know plausibility test assumptions you have to start asking like asking people to expose more and more of you know of say their their online profile to say some larger scale analysis like you know i like i see many trust network-based systems doing so you know the more plausibly secure you want to be the more you have to give up your privacy just to you know just to make it even plausible that you're not a sybil right um and then you know and then you're once again up up against the ai problem of well you know uh how long will it be uh will it still be that you know real humans are better at presenting plausibly genuine you know say online profiles than ai's are at you know making you know fake but plausibly plausible looking profiles right and they're already getting really pretty good at that you know tricking people uh you know making plausible profiles right and so so yeah you know so so i i see the you know you know the the trust network uh you know approach as kind of fundamentally limited in that uh you know and worrisome in that i was gonna say one of the things that i really like about the trust network approach is i just had the founder of bright id on the pod and their web of trust style trust network thing and he was showing me the social graph of it and he was like you know because the social graphs branch out in all these directions you have trunks and then you have branches and then you have leaves you can kind of see if if a civil attacker gets introduced you can kind of see the branch that they create and all the leaves that come off of that and then you can cut that off right at the trunk if you have the adequate data to prove that that was a symbol attack it felt like that was a very elegant tool in the blue team's toolkit in this adversarial game between red team and blue and blue team so yeah yeah i don't know if that what your response is to that though i i agree with you know the attractiveness of that model unfortunately from a security perspective i see that as what bruce schneier would call a movie uh movie plot attack or a movie plot scenario because you're assuming uh that the attacker will take a particular approach to a civil attack right and and this is a very classic assumption there there was a back in the peer-to-peer networking days there was a whole series of very interesting and technically um sophisticated uh papers on um on graph analysis based civil defense approaches and and a common assumption that all of these schemes make you know in including uh you know i think this uh uh this latest approach that you're that you're talking about is that um attackers will try to build uh like one big or a few big clusters of sybils right that are very densely in you know in which uh all of these attacker-controlled sybils are very densely connected to each other but very sparsely connected to you know real otherwise live honest users right and so this this goes by uh uh say the um uh you know the limited cut assumption or you know kind of uh assumption about a small cut uh between the between a uh you know the honest region per se and a any particular civil region right so you know and i think it's it's true that like to the extent that that an attacker does exactly that right you know plays to that movie plot by trying to create a huge dense region of of nothing but sybils with a relatively small cut to the honest world yeah that's you know that's kind of detectable um by graph algorithms you know more so the the bigger and denser and you know more suspicious that civil region is right but the problem is that's not you know the only option in the attacker's toolkit you know the attacker you know has lots of choices the attacker can can attack in different ways which you know in other ways might not be quite as quite as cheap but they might be just as practical right you know and so so the you know the motivation by that behind that model was simply that well you know in that particular movie plot attack sybils are basically free you know it costs the attacker absolutely nothing to create an unlimited number of sybils in that big dense region but you know they have to pay something even if only a little to trick or convince or bribe real users to create uh connections between their civil region and the honest region right so so you can see the appeal i i totally get the appeal of that assumption based on you know the cost model that you know it costs at least something more than nothing to create connections between an honest region and a civil region right but then you know we we really got like we uh the geek community you know especially those uh you know interested in this social network model really got uh kind of fixated on that particular movie attack movie plot and you know started neglecting the fact that well there's there's other things the attacker can do such as just pay the cost of you know creating a lot more uh connections with with genuine users and even like not you know not creating big uh you know civil regions but instead focusing on like you know creating one sybil at a time that has mostly or largely you know legit connections right at this point we're kind of almost talking about an economic game because the adversarial tactics that you're going to need against a script kitty is different from organized crime is different from north korea and so you know do you sort of look at these four categories government biometrics social network presence based as sort of the like the battle line in an economic game between the blue team and the red team and what is at stake is the cost of forgery of an identity or like you know tell me about the economic portion of this game yeah well so from le let's uh so i'd like to come back to your why and my why you know you know personhood-based taos and democracy but but that's that's fundamental because like you know if we want that why then playing the economic game of just you know kind of say increasing marginally increasing the cost of a civil attack is not good enough right because because you know even if we just kind of marginally increase the cost per civil identity of an attacker to create that you know can still create an unlimited number of sybils but just you know has to pay a little bit more for them to farm them or or whatever right so we are then we are relegating ourselves to continue living in you know the you know the world that we're trying to escape namely the world of uh of um you know non-civil rights of the equivalent of proof of work the you know rich get richer world where you know the more money you have the more votes you can get yeah you know in whatever uh participatory structure or dow or whatever right you know um you know so so and and no matter what threshold you know you can always tweak the cost threshold you can make it more costly or less costly to uh you know to create a sybil in that market you can make people wait longer you can make people buy off more or trick more genuine you know existing users or whatever like you can increase or decrease the cost but the more you increase the cost the more you exclude you know legitimate totally legitimate people that just aren't rich and you know at the same time you know the more you decrease the cost the more you leave it totally open to people who are rich to you know create as many civil sybils as they want right so so to me you know treating this as an economic game um you know just means that we're giving up right we're giving up on the ultimate goal the ultimate why right and so i i prefer not to think of like you know i i prefer to think of you know as a a proof of personhood mechanism that's you know only strong enough to you know raise the the cost a little you know as a certain amount and and have to struggle with how how high that barrier should be that like everyone has to pay and then you know kind of the the tough choice between excluding anyone who can't or doesn't want to pay that versus uh versus you know letting anyone who can pay that many times over be a be a civil attacker right you know that's just not the game that i want to play personally that you know and it's to me it's not the game that's going to get us to to the goal that i feel like both of us have yeah that's that's interesting um so there is sort of like an adversarial nature and sort of like a red team blue team thing but but you don't think that it should be on the ground of economics because that's inherently a plutocratic uh sort of playing ground okay yeah if it's if it's only about you know if the only enforcement mechanisms you have are basically incentive economic incentives you know not to misbehave or to like you know have you have a certain amount of stakes slashed if you're caught being a sybil or you know that kind of thing then you're just you know you're just playing that same game you know of fungibility you know allowing sybils to be fungible you know with with dollars like you know more dollars more votes right more dollars more sybils you know you're just you're just kind of arguing about well you know kind of how high should the exclusion barrier be and how low should be the the cost of sybils to to the you know rich plutocrats right right yeah i think that i think that's a fair criticism i'm wondering you know given that there's four different categories of of ways that you can solve this problem and then they're all good at some things and bad at some things i'm wondering if there's sort of like a hybrid approach or like an aggregator or something that might be able to solve for some of the trade-offs of them um you know that's where i want to take the conversation next but i'm curious if there's a obvious next point for for you that you know you're the subject matter expert here yeah that i mean that that's a good question i yeah i would love to to see a hybrid mechanism of some kind succeed and i and i've been happy to see a lot of interesting uh you know projects that that do have you know interesting hybrid characteristics in in different ways like uh um you know for example identi you know is a is a very interesting uh design that uh that combines you know some amount of social trust at least uh you know like say as a barrier to entry as a as a way to vouch for people entering the system but also in involves a presence uh present presence mechanism not physical presence but online presence uh you know which is clever and interesting you know i'm not i'm totally not convinced that it's going to stand up to sophisticated ai or or various other attacks but you know it's it's a very interesting hybrid mechanism um yeah and and you know there's others now the my on the other hand um yeah i i'm also skeptical in general about about hybrid mechanisms again because of the um because of the the fundamental um issue that like you know that an attacker especially a rich well-resourced attacker uh you know can usually you know pick the you know if there's a hybrid mechanism that has combines multiple factors multiple paths multiple different approaches to proof of personhood right and most of them or maybe even all of them are in some way that some level you know fungible attackable fungible with with with cost right then you know then the result is always fungible with uh with money as well right you know because well if all of the you know you have to analyze it in a kind of uh in a way that depends on whether the hybrid is is kind of an and or an or composition right right you know kind of do you have to do a and b or do you have to do a or b right now if it's an a or b kind of kind of hybrid right then and either a or b is fungible with money then the then let's say a without loss of generality say a approach a is fungible with money at some cost right then the attacker can always choose a and you know trade trade money for sybils right right yeah you know no matter how strong b might be right or just flip it right so any ore style composition that has even one choice that's actually fungible with money at some level yeah um yeah you know is is not going to get us out of the economic gain right on the other side the and side right you know if if you know if you require people to use proof of personhood a and b right yeah and you know maybe one is secure you know but the other is fungible with money then well you're you are presenting an economic exclusion you know namely b whatever you know the threshold b defines that applies to everyone right so that's that's kind of an exclusion that applies to everyone even though you know it may be secure you know sybil resistant on the basis of a so you know so it's still not clear that you've you've really succeeded in that case either right so sorry i'll i'll let you yeah ask your question no that was beautiful and so articulate and you're the subject matter expert i guess i wanted to share an anecdote of one of the things i've learned from vitalik buterin who's the founder of ethereum and uh one of the things that he talks about when designing proof-of-stake which you know is is a consensus mechanism that is designed to uh move us away from proof of work which is too capital intensive into proof of stake where you have a stake and your stake is is is at stake i shouldn't use the word in the definition but it's what's coming to mind now um is that you want to design an economic system which it's much cheaper to defend than it is to attack and and that's how you build a hyper structure or like a system that is is going to withstand the like a plutocratic attack and so it's with proof of stake you stake your 32 eth and if you start lying in the consensus mechanism you get slashed your 32 goes down to i don't know the exact amount but you lose thousands of dollars within one block and so i i guess what you know what i was wondering and by the way i agree with the trade-offs of fungibility there where you're economically excluding people or you're making it into an economic game but i'm wondering in the economic game branch of that argument if there was a slashing mechanism where if you're if if you're a civil attacker you lose your stake basically you shift the game from being one where you just pay to participate to being one where you have to pay and put your funds at risk of slashing to participate which shifts the the fundamental aspect of the game to uh to make it cheaper to defend than to attack so i don't know if you if you see any light there that is promising or or it or or not but but that's what came to mind for me yeah good good question i i think you know the the pr the problem with that you know i totally get the you know kind of the slashing risks you know the the requirement to invest stake you know and and um and uh you know undergo you know a slashing risk if you if you are observed to misbehave right um on the other hand like say you know 32 each is a lot of money like that you know that's that's just a particular choice of exclusion barrier right and it's a very in practice it's a very high one right yeah you know so and i get you know in the context of ethereum you know they they totally want to raise the stakes pretty high even if that excludes a lot of people really a lot of people who might otherwise want to run a run an ethereum node right um and uh um so so you know to me that you know that doesn't fundamentally change the game it just you know shifts the shifts the barrier between exclusion and civil uh you know simple vulnerability to a much higher cost point right that's all so yeah i mean i wonder how much this design space is just kind of choosing between lesser evils i mean you know with like proof of stake yes it's bad to exclude people who have less than 32 eth uh but is that worse than proof-of-work which excludes people who don't have a high-speed internet connection and a ton of power and it also destroys the planet and so you're just choosing a lesser evil here you know well so yeah i mean so i i would i would would totally be behind the proposition that proof of you know proof of work is evil you know and should be abolished and at least replaced by proof of stake just to eliminate the eliminate the energy waste right but it does uh so you know i'm i'm totally down with that right you know because proof of work is just you know energy waste for the purpose of proving proving that you wasted energy as you know as part of this crazy uh you know economic incentive that bitcoin invented right but it's still you know that energy waste is completely fungible with you know the steak you have to invest in proof of steak or you know the storage you have to invest in proof of storage or you know any of these other uh you know mechanisms and ultimately you know proof of stake is actually you know not that new right you know the fundamental thing that's going on in proof of stake is merely a more more automated slightly more decentralized analog of a traditional shareholder corporation right you buy stock in a company you know you exercise voting power with uh you know more or less in proportion to the stock you know tweak it according to your particular rules uh you know what are voting shares and what are not and you know there's a bunch of details but uh but it's more or less just that you know and it's uh it doesn't change the fact that it's uh remains um you know vulnerable to say 50 to 51 attacks namely you know hostile takeovers you know anyone who can buy you know or create a consortium holding you know 51 of the stake or stock or whatever of course can take over the company that's the way it works right you know and it doesn't fundamentally assure that it remains centralized right it's so you know to me proof of stake isn't better than proof of work in any kind of guarantee of a system remaining decentralized or you know reliably it has all the same economic classical economic you know centralization or re-centralization incentives uh that just derive from the rich get richer principle you know economies of scale that applies to ethereum you know post proof of state just as well as it does you know in in proof of work uh right you know so so you know proof of stake is a great thing we should all you know kill proof of work move to proof of stake at least but that's not that's not what's going to get it get get us to this you know this personhood-based taos or democratic online democracy or any of these things that we

discovered this thing called matthew effect which is a fundamental law of economic systems that is the cumulative gains that come with accumulated wealth so basically the risks get richer colloquially but it also applies to matters of like fame or status like famous people get more famous and and it's a fundamental law of economic systems like you said proof of work proof of stake economic systems that have this uh wall street has this and and i'm wondering you know one of the things that sort of gives me hope is that you know you could have like 150 years ago said well gravity is a fundamental law of nature and so therefore we'll never be able humans will never be able to fly but you know that didn't stop the right brothers from creating a contraption that could create a local economic a local physical olympia that stopped gravity from being the most counter the biggest force acting on an object and so the economic equivalent is like how can we generate engineer a local equilibria that pushes away from the matthew effect the rich get richer and optimizes for the identity of everyday people and so i don't know if those analogies conjure up anything for you but just just noting that matthew effect is a fundamental law of economic systems i think was a big eye-opener for me and kind of depressing and so i don't know if you have any optimism in the face of that well i i do have optimum optimism in the face of that but i think the the answer is very simple you know you you are not going to find an answer to this problem by by limiting your attention to you know economic mechanisms alone right so you are not going to find you know a mechanism that's purely an you know incentive driven you know economic mechanism alone without adding something that's not economic some you know enforcement mechanism or transparency mechanism or you know something outside of you know pure economic incentives uh you know you're just not going to find a solution to this you know in the purely economic space right uh and uh and ultimately you know this this comes back to one of one of the basic points i've been trying to make you know over and over that that any plausible solution to this problem has to somehow connect to real people in the real world right you know kind of you can't solve this problem without somehow you know bringing the solution into the real world there's not going to be a magic purely cryptographic algorithm like you know that's another thing i see a lot of desire and interest for like you know everybody would love to have a magic cryptographic scheme you know the silver bullet protocol just distinguish a person a person from a non-person sorry you're not gonna find it but and similarly i you know i'm gonna say that you know even though economic mechanisms incentives could be useful as elements in a true solution but it's any real solution is not going to be able to rely on economics and incentive mechanisms alone right there's going to have to be something in there that actually connects to you know to the real world in a way that uh that you know let's let's uh you know admit clearly that fights against the um uh you know the inherent nature of uh you know of the economic purely economic incentive mechanisms including the matthew effect as as you mentioned right so you know you're just not going to solve the problem in by purely economic means right yeah i i think that's an important design criteria um i want to call out that we only have eight minutes left on our booking uh i want to respect your time and so maybe we should move into some sort of wrapping up or or closing questions i can go a few minutes over but but i don't want to do that to your schedule so sure i'll just ask you a completely open-ended question which is is there anything i didn't ask you that you that you want to say or anywhere you want to refocus the conversation well i get i guess there is one thing like that a topic that didn't come up which which i think you know is is just as important as the you know privacy as the other security and privacy and other topics we've discussed but illustrates how you know how how deeply hard this problem is to to achieve what i think we would like to achieve namely coercion or or vote right right um and uh you know so the fact is um you know even if you have a perfect you know person distinguishing mechanism like a real say reverse touring test or a you know a a way to distinguish a real person from a from a fake person you know sitting at a computer you can't immediately tell even then whether that person is acting of their own free will or is acting on behalf of someone who paid them to act on behalf of say a coercer or vote buyer right and so so so even you know coming back to this i this vision of of uh you know personhood-based dows right even if the uh even if you know say you know identity is a is a nice nice example like let's suppose all the reverse touring tests or you know the human to human challenge tests work perfectly and only real people you know are actually get through the system and maintain identities well anyone who is who's sufficiently rich and powerful can still pay a bunch of real people to participate in identity or proof of humanity or various other things you know get uh you know get some you know get realistic you know genuinely human identity identity certified and then just uh you know verifiably act on the on behalf of the attacker right so um and so you know so this is this is actually much much harder so you know and and to get true um you know personhood-based doubts you've you've got to er or or democracy you've got to address that as well right you you can't just stop it basic civil attacks uh you know or or you know humanness uh uh proof you've got to make sure somehow that the you know human that the real humans involved are not only real humans but are able to act on their own free will right and that's you know to me that's what kind of uh ultimately makes uh makes me much more pessimistic about um anything that doesn't actually have a physical presence uh element because because with a physical presence element like in pseudonym parties that i proposed a long time ago i at least you know as as difficult and awkward and you know kind of maybe uh maybe costly maybe you know maybe difficult to use as as those might be i at least see a path forward toward you know not only civil resistance but coercion resistance right being able to ensure that people are acting you know people are showing up and able to act on their own free will even if somebody paid for them to show up right um and uh you know i i see uh ways to address that and i do not see that with any of the you know kind of purely online approaches so so so you know i just wanted to bring that up like you know kind of the the additional challenge the additional hurdle that i think you know not enough people are thinking about in this space and you know once you do start thinking about it it kind of totally changes you know the equation both our understanding of the hardness of the problem and what the promising potential solutions are right so i think i heard that it's not just the civil attacks but it's coercion how do you know that each actor is acting upon their own free oh free will and there isn't vote buying taking taking a place and this is what makes you really optimistic about physical based solutions which would basically be uh i think you said tsunamis uh identity parties pseudonym parties was the with the term i proposed in the in the 2008 paper um and um also the the encoiler system if you're familiar with it is uh is experimenting with a variation of this also using in-person uh in-person events um so it's uh um yeah so so it's you know it's it's still i believe uh you know a fairly uh you know fringe approach that you know kind of requiring people to like physically go somewhere is is certainly you know understandably a big ask so i you know so i i understand why it's not very popular from a you know usability or cost perspective but um but i i you know but it kind of remains the you know it to me it comes back to the question do we actually want to solve this problem the whole problem or not or are we willing to live with half solutions that are still remain fungible you know still still put you know person people fungible with money just at some you know very tweakable threshold between exclusion and civil attackability right and i want to solve the real problem not just uh not just come up with this half solution beautiful well um i want to thank you for coming on the pod because i i think that just the amount of thought and lucidity that you bring to this problem is going to help a generation of practitioners that are in the web 3 space and are thinking about civil attacks and i think the upside for that for humanity and for web 3 is really quite high and you know i guess my question for you is you know how do you how do you like to work with practitioners uh say there's a founder out there who's building a a civil resistant identity system how do you find out about them you know what is the relationship between your work and the the gaggle of people who are working on civil resistance tools out there yeah well i i love uh so so um i i love it when uh founders and activists reach out to me you know about particular projects i i'm now i'm not very good at answering emails promptly i'm just you know washing such a flood so i apologize if i if i'm either slow or you know m.i.a for a while but uh but i do love to uh you know to discuss and and compare notes and and you know provide feedback you know if i can and and uh you know and most of all i'm i'm super excited about the explosion of interest that uh the the basic concept of uh proof of personhood has received in the past you know five years or so uh especially um and so like you know i'm really happy that there's so many people working on it and i hope a lot more people will you know join this uh uh this nasa movement yeah yeah well i hope uh speaking on behalf of web3 which i have no authority or legitimacy to do um i i really hope that web3 can solve this problem or at least move the problem forward let's maybe say address instead of solve because solve sounds too too self-important but um you know are you are you optimistic that within our lifetimes that there will be a scalable solution to this problem that hits the market or you know where do you tend on optimism versus pessimism of seeing this world realized i i am optimistic i you know i think i think we're not not that far from you know moderately usable um uh you know if in rough and inconvenient yeah you know kind of approximations you know yeah um you know and like a true you know strongly usable secure private massively deployable one certainly that's farther farther out but i don't think it's that much farther out like you know if we if we got a really critical mass of people who really understand the problem and are willing to invest you know the time and effort and costs to to solve it you know i think we could i think we could do it in uh do it in five to ten years you know uh you know maybe i'm being super optimistic there but yeah you know i i i am optimistic that makes me so happy to hear you say that uh just because of your depth of knowledge and how hard the problem is it makes me have hope that you have hope and one of the things that i would really like you know i'm i'm contributing at the edges of get coin i'm not at the center anymore but uh there are 40 000 accounts every quarter on git coin who go through this civil resistant quadratic funding tool and there's an evolution an iteration that happens every quarter there and i've seen some of the data and and the civil attackers are quite intense but but one of the things that makes me really optimistic that we could solve the problem is the network effect of if if we can create more civil resistant d-apps that lures more users into these systems that need civil resistance and that creates more data for studying the civil attackers which you know there's like this iterative network effect game that that i could see the web 3 ecosystem bootstrapping and and i don't know network effects is one of the most powerful things in the world it's why it's why we're having this the this this call over the internet is the network effects of the internet so uh that's one of the reasons why i have optimism um i i guess is is there anything else that that that you want to say any other words of wisdom before we wrap i can't think of anything i i really enjoyed the discussion uh though yeah thank you for having me on yeah thanks so much where can people find your work online uh well my my website is b4.in bford.info uh and uh most of my papers uh are are on on that website uh probably the most relevant one for the purpose of the this discussion uh is my paper called uh uh identity and personhood in digital democracy from 2019 that's um just on my papers pages a few uh uh papers page a few lines down yeah um uh from november uh 2020 um but uh so so that's you know probably the most uh relevant uh contact point okay beautiful well uh dr ford you're so lucid and so articulate and so thoughtful and i'm just so thankful that we had you on the pod today to inform a generation of researchers and practitioners in web3 about your work so thank you again so much for appearing on the pod you bet thank you [Music]
