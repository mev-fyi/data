[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless hey david we're in corona era now how are things on your end yeah man it seems like we're at a huge turning point in where this world is about to go uh in times of crisis in times of volatility the future becomes obscured and we're all kind of flying by the seat of our pants you know taking it one day at a time crypto markets have hit a resurgence lately while the equity markets have stayed flat uh people are still worried that the coronavirus has just begun uh a lot of things are changing um so we're gonna talk a little bit about that and then we're gonna get right into the meat of the episode how about how about like your friends and family how are they reacting to this are you finding everyone's on the same page as you that we've got to buckle up and get through this uh i have been sounding the alarm in my social media feeds and with my family so i'm the one that's taking it the most strict uh my mom and my dad uh the two the two boomers are just finally hunkered down for the first time thankfully like three days ago uh so i'm happy i finally convinced them well absolutely so um we could talk about corona a little bit more but we should talk about what the focus of this episode actually is which is eth as a triple point asset so ether as a triple point asset why is that so interesting why is that so exciting this triple point asset which is a term that i created which is a terrible meme but somehow people still use it it's it relates to the outside world there are three main asset types in the world one's a commodity asset one is a store value asset and the last is a capital asset and these are like the three most significant types of assets that you find in the world uh outside of crypto uh and so they they correlate to real world things like the bond market uh the equities market and also cash uh and so the cool thing about this topic the cool thing about how these three assets are found all at once inside of ethereum inside of ether produces new characteristics the fact that they're all happening so closely together it makes things really interesting and we're going to get into that all right before we dive in let's talk about our sponsors today we've got some fantastic sponsors first up is rocket dollar this is for our us listeners primarily if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's stuck in jail in brokerage jail you can't access crypto easily when you can access they charge you 4x the price on brokerage exchanges that is a complete rip-off i call it the retail rip rip-off what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail i've done this with some of my accounts my retirement accounts i plan to do it with some more soon it's a pain to do it yourself so rocket dollar takes care of the pain they help you break your retirement account out of brokeragedale the jail they handle the paperwork you can go to rocketdollar.com you use the code bankless you get 50 off and you can start buying crypto in a tax free retirement account today in this episode ryan and i are going to talk a ton about different d5 protocols also different ways that ether operates inside of them and also the different forms that ether comes in if you need a place to view all of these things at once go to xeron.io xeron is the comprehensive portfolio viewer for the d5 ecosystem if you need a summary of all of your activity you need to go to xeron they can integrate multiples of wallets and they have many different d5 protocols all in the same spot so if you want to buy sell trade trade on unit swap lend on compound put assets inside of uniswop you can do all of these things all at once inside of xeron it is the one stop shop for all of your defy activity so if you want a summary of where your position is as this coronavirus has moved markets up and down xeron is the place for you every significant d5 app that exists is available inside of xeron and i only expect them to include more as more come about there's really no need to go to anywhere else you don't need to go to compound.finance to go to compound you don't need to go to uniswap.exchange to go to uniswap you don't need to go to the maker cdp page to get your vault under management you can just go to xeron.io and access everything in one spot switching back to corona for just a second then we'll get into the meat of the episode which is ether as a triple point asset um you know a few things that i i think uh i'm expecting to see wrote a post about this yesterday on bankless like kind of the the covid 19 prep plan if you're if you're in kind of crypto or if you're in in bankless i expect these four things to happen first i think things are going to get worse uh for a little bit that's because western nations primarily have underestimated the virus we've been slow to social distance ourselves this morning i noticed california has just gone full locked down it's like 50 million people the cases will increase probably exponentially i think that deaths will increase as well unfortunately and things will get worse for a while in the markets as we're all trying to sort that out and in the process the second thing that's probably going to happen is that central banks are going to print a whole lot of money uh we've already started to see to see this with with uh fiscal stimulus plans but then also the fed going directly to to qe uh announcing that they are injecting i think close to a trillion dollars into the economy or into just issuance of money last week so central banks will need to print their way out of this crisis that seems to be the approach that they're taking but the weird thing about it and this is the third thing is that in the meanwhile it seems like people are going to still want dollars the first stage of a crisis like this is usually a liquidity crisis that's what we're seeing we're seeing everyone fly to the most money asset there is the most liquid asset there is dollars are the money that you panic into it's partially because a lot of debt is denominated in dollars across the world oil in particular that is generally usd dominated so when people have debt denominated in dollars and they're panicking and the world's crumbling around them they want to make sure they can pay their debt so euros eurozone is good for that yen isn't as good for that other currencies aren't as good for that so they buy dollars we're seeing things like the australian dollar you know suffer and diminish 15 relative to the us dollar so i think we'll see that flight to liquidity continue as people want dollars but then on the back of this and here's kind of the bet and the expectation that we are making and that is crypto will rise that's that's the fourth thing to expect in this world where central bank systems are printing money non-stop when i just noticed this morning venezuela has actually closed their banking system they're saying it's to stop the spread of the virus there's probably deeper reasons that they are closing their banking system but 30 million venezuelans no longer have access to banks this is what crypto and the bankless revolution was was made for we're not fully ready now we've got a ways to go on you know scaling on economic bandwidth uh but by the end of this decade i expect crypto will rise crypto will will fill the void that central banks uh are leaving and traditional finance is leaving and the internet for the people by the people as you like to say david will have its day this decade so those are a few things to expect you can read more about it in the bankless article that we published last week interesting times to say the least are they not absolutely anytime the federal reserve prints money is just rocket fuel for crypto uh maybe short-term prices aren't don't reflect that maybe they do we don't really know but we haven't really seen money printing since you know 2008 where bitcoin was invented in the first place uh and so this second wave of money printing of quantitative easing of bolstering the economy of humans controlling what the future of the economy should look like that's just rocket fuel onto the narrative of crypto uh so you know the the idea is that we're about to see a bunch of new entrants into the crypto markets because of this same narrative like the fed printing money doesn't isn't just a narrative for crypto people that's the narrative for the world economy at large uh and so the crypto is here to serve that need of being a asset that cannot be printed i i totally think so too i mean this decade belongs to crypto 2020s belong to crypto and you know this is the crisis to kind of kick that off um all right well let's let's dig into it this is a super important subject ether as a triple point asset um so when when we talk about triple point david and the three asset types maybe we should take a minute to go over the three types of assets and this doesn't just apply to crypto right this is this is any asset what are the three types of assets yeah so the three types of assets are a capital asset a commodity asset and a store of value asset and where we get the term triple point is from the term that you get when you combine a substance and the right pressure and temperature so that all three phases of matter are happening at the same time so you can go look this up on youtube type in triple point of water on youtube and you can see water being ice liquid and gas all at the same time it's just because of the right parameters that this intersection of these three phases emerges it's actually a pretty cool experiment and so the triple point asset is an idea that the ether can be all of these three asset types at once and so again a capital asset commodity asset store value asset now a capital asset is an asset that produces capital it's something that produces dividends it produces cash for you so like if you are renting out your apartment or your house you get rental payments and that's cash if you have your money in a t bill in a in a bond it produces cash for you over time uh companies stocks these are capital assets the main purpose of a company is to generate revenue and generate cash flow and that is supposed to be returned to the owners of the company in by in cash in some way or another the next asset commodities i call these one-time use assets these are generally things that you that are valuable because when you use them you can take something into something better so like wheat is a is a asset you can only use it once but you can turn wheat into bread and people need to eat bread or you can take oil and you can put it in your car and you can move yourself from one place to another and that's good for you um and so yeah one-time use assets the big analogy that we're gonna get into later is energy energy is the biggest commodity asset there is it allows us to take things and produce better things with it we all need the energy to do that and then the last one is store of value that's stuff like gold that stuff like cash like the dollar things that are inherently scarce they don't very they don't do very much they're not meant to be useful necessarily but they are meant to be scarce and be exchangeable for other things at a moment's notice so interestingly a house can also be a store of value people use their house to rent out for cash but people also use real estate to hold their value across time art has been used as a store of value the reason why our pieces go from millions and millions of dollars is because they are partly art but they are also partly a way for people to store their wealth across time uh so these most pretty much all assets in the world fall into one or multiple of these categories yeah i used to collect magic the gathering cards you know hoping that they were a store of value for me um didn't quite work out that way but would that be called a speculative store of value i think it would i mean collectibles certainly fit under historic value so you mentioned art some people collect old cars you know old old money uh it could be a store of value a lot of things collectibles have kind of that that emergent quality where they start as a collectible and then can become a store of value you know what th this this uh this these three asset types the capital the commodity and the store of value that you're talking about um funny thing is i you know considered myself kind of an investor and you know somebody in finance for for a while but i like just learned that the world could be divided into these three asset types in the past couple of years like that was a newer taxonomy to me when exploring crypto and and the reason i i stumbled upon it i think chris berninski actually um he pointed it out in a paper and he found it from from another paper yeah robert greer the man 1999 there he is 99. um he figured this out that the world's assets could be fit in these three different buckets but it's super important because um it has to do with valuation and in 2017 uh we've talked we talked about this on the last episode the economic bandwidth episode but we had an ico mania where there was you know tokens everywhere and people didn't seem to know how to value these various tokens these various crypto assets and this framework that the capital the commodity and the store of value really helped uh cement how to value crypto assets to me as well because you can value them in these three different buckets so the capital assets that you were talking about like rental income and stocks those are super easy to value you just value them based on profits the net present value of future cash flows that's how stocks are valued they're based on how much you pay for the earnings per year that's where price to earnings ratios come from you can get even simpler than that how much does it cost and how much money is it going to give you over time exactly that's exactly right super simple capital assets most of the assets that we kind of know and trade or in our brokerage accounts these are all capital assets um commodity assets are a bit different though these are valued based on supply and demand and what you're saying you're talking about oil and energy as a primary commodity um you know it's it's really based on what you can produce on the other side of that commodity so if i can produce um you know some sort of asset based on oil then oil is going to be valuable to me to a certain extent and if everybody else is is buying oil as well that increases the demand for oil and since there is only a scarce supply of above ground and below ground oil that increases the value of oil so it's really just supply and demand dynamics right store of value assets those those are really unique and really different so most of us think a lot about you know capital sometimes we think about commodity assets but store value assets they don't generate any income at all at least pure store value assets they're just used as money so dollars are a great example of a store value asset you're not earning anything on your dollar you're not getting any interest or income unless it's in a savings account as a dollar it's just meant to store value for tomorrow or for next week or for when you want to pay your rent you know at some point in the future store value assets are just used as money and and the thing that i think is important to realize is that these assets can be more than just one at the same time i think you mentioned that earlier with with houses and with real estate david that real estate can be a capital asset but it can also be used as a store of value asset you know what we should do we should go through some of the common assets and talk about um how they can be where they fit you know so let's take stocks what are stocks are they are they capital are they store value are they commodity are they all three yeah so people will give you different opinions as to what a stock what the role of a stock is a share of a company is in someone's portfolio uh the the genesis of a company is always about cash flow right like you always start a company thinking about how you're going to get more revenue how are you going to sell things and make more money but at some point it turns from just a capital asset into also a store of value asset and some austrians would argue some austrian economists would argue that the reason why stocks on the stock market are treated as store values is because the store of value the dollar is actually not that great of a store of value and so because the dollar is targeted to lose two percent of its value every single year people take their their store value dollars and buy stocks on the stock market in order to maintain their wealth across time so it's a capital asset because it produces revenue but people also use it as a store of value at the same time because it theoretically in you know in bull markets holds its value better than the dollar does it's interesting that you said uh theoretically david because um part of this is is somewhat of a generational thing so stocks have done really well since the mid 1950s you know the era the baby boomers grew up in you know gen x uh millennials stocks have done well for most of our lifetimes but the era before that if you talk to some of the folks that grew up during the the great depression stocks crashed in 1929 and they didn't recover to all-time highs for 25 years for their generation stocks were not a good store of value asset so a lot of times we kind of you know retrofit the model of what a store of value asset is based on even generational preference and generational experience it might not be the case that stocks remain a good store of value moving forward for the next 20 years the next 30 years the next 50 years um but part of it is a generational preference which i think is is super interesting but let's take another let's take gold for example uh what is that capital commodity store value uh so gold is largely a store value asset the majority of the world's gold is held in central banks somewhere and like you said on a previous episode all of the supply of gold of the world can fit inside of like an olympic swimming pool so there's not that much gold but sometimes gold is used in electronics it's a really good conductor of electricity which makes it a good thing to carry data across across distances in wire it's also extremely durable which is actually kind of one of the reasons why gold became money in the first place because it doesn't tarnish it doesn't decay it's very it's very um inert it's very dependable uh and so people use it you know in in dentistry in industry uh but because other things can do that as well gold has primarily been a store of value maybe maybe it would be useful to contrast that with silver right because silver has some of those same commodity like properties but it's less of a store value now right right yes and so silver is what was once a store of value and perhaps it still is but comparing silver as a store of value to gold as a store value just is two completely different stories uh if the price of gold doubles there really can't be a much a larger increase in the production of new gold however if silver of the price of silver doubles then a lot more silver is going to be mined and pulled out of the ground uh and so that inflates the total supply of silver and that makes it a poor store value in comparison to gold and so that's why silver is much more used in industry to do different things in lieu of gold absolutely and at different time periods it would have been different at different time periods silver would have been a stronger store of value so it seems like the store of value point on the on the triple point asset side of things is is the thing that we decide we want to become money collectively as as as a a social collective as a society as a civilization that's the thing we all select and settle on as the money and to me it's it's not too much more complicated uh than that although it is quite a path and quite a journey for a commodity asset to become a store of value uh can take decades maybe we should talk about crypto so how do the various crypto assets fit inside of those three different asset classes how about bitcoin yeah bitcoin as an asset that cannot be uh minted or printed when the price goes up is one of the big bold cases for why bitcoin is such a good store of value if the if the bitcoin price goes 100x there still isn't more bitcoin that is being minted there's still just 21 million and that's a feature that bitcoin has even above gold uh and so bitcoin is is is held as the premier store of value simply because of this rule uh this is why bitcoiners love it so much this is why there there is an absolute restriction on changing the monetary supply of bitcoin that is its big role um but different people have different opinions as to whether bitcoin is just a store of value or also something else ryan what's your opinion so my opinion is that bitcoin is a store of value absolutely but it's also a commodity uh and i think a lot of people miss this so the reason it's a commodity is because it's used to pay for block space on the bitcoin network so in that way it acts as a commodity the way you transmit one bitcoin from a bitcoin address to another is by paying transaction fees and those fees are denominated in in bitcoin so essentially there is this um supply demand scarcity if you if you want to do stuff on the bitcoin network directly you want to send transactions around you need bitcoin and bitcoin almost acts as a as a commodity to pay for those transactions in that way because just like other commodities a transaction on the bitcoin network is potentially an ingredient into another good uh there was a time for instance when uh and and still is where usdt was kind of pegged or was kind of based on the bitcoin network and usdt through a protocol called omni actually had to pay fees in bitcoin so it used bitcoin as a commodity in that way so i think it straddles both of those sides both commodity and store value though others have different opinions but what about some of these d5 protocols david like like a maker yeah mkr maker is really interesting uh it's one of my first fascinations in crypto and so talking about it as an asset classes is really interesting to me so mkr is the asset that appreciates in value the more die there is out there and dies a stable coin pegged to the dollar and these dies come into existence when somebody puts in a an another asset not mkr but an asset like ether into a a kind of a vault an account and they are able to mint die based off of their collateral in that account now that die that they have minted is a loan it's a loan from the maker protocol and there is a fee for having an outstanding loan and that fee goes to burning mkr now this is like a business this is like an internet bank this is like a an internet protocol bank where it allows you to mint uh money based off of your assets and then repay it at a higher price later or a larger amount of money later and that's the business of mkr it's it's a revenue generating business it generates fees so that makes mkr a capital asset however i would also call mkr a store of value because you'd it there isn't much upside in die die is meant to be stable in fact there's supposed to be zero upside in die uh it's designed to be flat it's designed to not have upside potential and just to be a thing that other things reference for stability for price uh which means that upside potential gets pushed into mkr and so if you to the degree that you do not want to store your value in die because there's no upside potential there is upside potential in in mkr and so the the mkr system is always burning mkr from the fees generated by the protocol and so in theory in good days in in if this whole business works out there they're at the start there is one million mkr and then the fees start burning burning burning mkr and so it's designed to be a deflationary asset so the bull case for mkr is that you there's 1 million mkr you buy a handful of them and then in 50 years there's only half a million mkr and the total percentage of the supply that you own has doubled this is like bitcoin if the 21 million was actually getting smaller over time and so you were incentivized to buy and hold it early and wait for your share of the network to increase totally and in in what you're saying it seems to me like mkr is is almost in some ways like a like a stock so it does throw off revenue now unlike a stock which distributes that that those profits and that revenue to shareholders it actually uses its profits to burn mkr and that makes mkr deflationary asset and in some ways like a stock is it's it's a store of value but it's not quite like a a money store value if you will you know something like die for instance or usdc that would be more like the dollar a pure store of value that you you know you're going to store your your money in from week to week you might not want to store money in something like usdc or die for decades uh for the reasons we talked about the dollar is is constantly being inflated and losing value over time but but certainly a good short-term store of value there are other assets too one that i think is interesting in crypto or one category are these other assets that are kind of base chain assets so um the ethereum gillers fall into this category um also assets like like atoms from cosmos so cosmos is a blockchain network it has a base asset called atoms these atoms act as a capital asset uh in in the same way that that that kind of maker does in that if you have these assets it entitles you to a right of future cash flows future transaction fees of the network um but it's a bad store of value asset because it's constantly being inflated over time and it's not being used as a money today in the same way that bitcoin is or ether is and i think that is the flaw with a lot of these ethereum killers we talked about this a little bit in the economic bandwidth episode that they're focused on getting trustless or some of them anyway are focused on getting high trustless transactions per second but they're not focused on getting a value accrual mechanism particularly a monetary value accrual negative mechanism on their base asset they're not focused on on making their base asset become a money and unless they do that they won't have the economic bandwidth to grow an entire open financial system on top of okay so we talked about it we talked about a lot of the assets uh in the traditional finance we talked about uh some assets in crypto but we left one out what about ether so ether is the triple point asset how is it a triple point asset david yeah this is why i get so excited about ether this is what gives me chills uh so ether to my knowledge is the first asset to ever encompass all three asset types all at once so it's a store of value asset there is a there is a restricted supply of them no one can print any more or less the supply of them is determined by the protocol the increase of ether price does not meaningfully change the issuance of ether is a use as a store of value and people take their ether and they put them inside of defy applications and they deposit them into open finance because of the value that they have as collateral and that's why you see ether as collateral across ethereum it is the store of value of ethereum it is the it is the thing that backs die it is the collateral inside of unit swap trading pairs it is the collateral inside of compound collateral collateral collateral that is the m0 it is the store of value for ethereum it also is a capital asset or it will be in proof-of-stake ethereum you will be able to stake your eth inside of the protocol provide your services to the network of validating transactions and you will receive ether as payments for that service that's kind of like the dollar inside the bond market right inside a treasury bill you put your asset inside of the protocol and over time you are receiving dividends for that service for that staking and so ether is also a capital asset it returns you more ether across time and lastly it's also a commodity and this was like the first meme of ether when ethereum was getting really off the ground ether is gas ether is gas for ethereum which is true it is it it is one part of ether's role for ethereum if you need to pay the fee to get your transaction included into the ethereum blockchain you need to pay for that and you pay for that with ether so ether is like the oil it's the energy of the ethereum ecosystem when you pay ether to a miner you are you are making his computer heat up and consume electricity to include your transaction in the blockchain so you are paying your ether for electricity for the inclusion of your transaction into the blockchain so it's also a commodity it's also energy at the same time and it's doing these things all at once you in one single transaction ether can represent all three of these asset types which is why ethereum is so cool which is why ether is so powerful and so in one fellow swoop ether has checked all the boxes for all three asset types which i can't find any other asset that does this and that's why i get so excited it it is uh pretty interesting for sure i mean so it checks all the boxes right it's a it's a store value like gold it's a commodity like oil it's a capital asset like a stock or at least it will be when staking goes live this year there doesn't seem to be much like it in the legacy world maybe the closest comparison we could make to what this ethereum thing actually is and what ether the asset actually is is the comparison of a nation-state ethereum is like a digital nation-state we could maybe compare it to uh another protocol we talked in episode one about the constitution and the democratic republic protocol as a governance structure as a as a protocol structure ethereum is kind of like the us in terms of being a protocol it is a digital economic nation state instead of a physical democratic republic economic nation state and so we can start to sort of compare things between the us and the ethereum system maybe we should do that like so let's talk about how the u.s you know analogies from the us as an economic system to analogies as ethereum as an economic system where do you want to start yeah so let's let's start with the bond market and i kind of illustrate these things as the three pillars that really hold up an economy and so the bond market or in ethereum terms proof of stake staking your ether are kind of the same pillar now when i say ether is a triple point asset imagine just those three pillars of ethereum are just a lot closer together in the legacy world these three pillars are are far apart and not very uh they don't they don't support similar structures where in ethereum it all kind of supports the same structure but in the legacy world these three pillars are much more distinct and much more separate from each other so let's start with the bond market one of the first pillar yeah the bond market is incredibly interesting and when we're talking about the bond market maybe we should start talking about the government bond market the the sovereign debt bond market so in the u.s that is uh the t-bill those are treasuries that's that's sort of the the government bond market um the u.s allows you to take their base money dollars and put those in a t-bill in a government bond that is equivalent to staking eth so eath is the base money of ethereum and when you stake it when you bond it that's another word for staking you're essentially putting it in a t-bill now the u.s government what it does with its bonds essentially you're loaning the u.s government dollars denominated uh in its its currency of course dollars it's providing you interest so it's it's giving you some additional dollars for providing that debt and then it uses that debt ideally to pursue its interest to secure its economy military diplomacy uh to to spend all sorts of to spend on all sorts of things that democratic republics uh you know spend their spend their money on in eth uh that staked ethereum also goes towards securing the network it provides economic security we talked a bit about that in episode 2 and episode 3 on economic bandwidth so it's similar in that way the us and ethereum are also similar in that they have this this base money of course we talked about how that base money can be bonded in in the us that base money is us dollars in ethereum it is ether both of these things have been somewhat called into existence by the protocol both of these systems also have a tax system set up they have an irs so in the u.s there are there are two forms of taxes there's the irs where you you kind of pay income tax essentially on money that you earn but then there's also state taxes of course other other other nation states around the world have kind of more federal use taxes consumption taxes where you're charged every time you make a purchase ethereum doesn't really have an income tax but it does have this consumption tax tax so every time you do something on the ethereum network you move either from one place to another or you lock some eth into a d5 protocol like maker you're using the network you're consuming a portion of it and you pay a tax that tax is called a transaction fee uh it's it's it's also called gas so in the same way you have taxes in the ethereum system you pay for your usage for the network just like in the u.s economic system you pay for your consumption of goods um so you've got these these kind of three things that uh start to resemble almost a digital nation state i really love the comparison between like the irs charging taxes versus ethereum charging taxes uh because the irs or just taxes in general is supposed to be a tax on your usage of the economy to pay for shared goods but it's kind of a subjective there's no perfect way to collect the right amount of taxes per person and that's why nation states have basically always been in debate as to how to manage taxes ethereum really solves this problem by saying well there's a market rate for getting included into the blockchain and you have to pay that and it's really there no one is taxed more or less than what they should be taxed because you're only ever taxed if you include a transaction into the blockchain if you never make a transaction you never pay any taxes to ethereum if you make a ton of transactions to the ethereum blockchain you pay a ton of taxes it's really a pay-per-use mechanism and it really just takes all the subjectivity out of who should pay what and so it just says if you use the ethereum blockchain you pay this amount of taxes and it's equal for everyone and so it really takes a lot of debate and political decision making out of the protocol and just commits everything to code for sure yeah we've used that term the term a lot credibly neutral to talk about monetary policy we did an episode too but what you're talking about you know credible neutrality that's also true for ethereum's transaction system it's it's tax system essentially which is which is i think a really important quality that nation states don't tend to have um you know they kind of bend bend the tax rules in uh the the interests of of lobbyists and whomever is in power and whomever asks the the hardest and and you know makes maybe donates the greatest amount to their political campaigns um you also used this term a little bit earlier david when you're talking about ether as a triple point asset you called it m0 maybe we should take some time to define what you mean by what we mean by m0 um you know i'll just jump into that so the in the traditional financial system there are different types of of money there's m0 which is the base money of the system that is the money issued by central banks so it's the money on their balance sheets um central banks also issue physical cash so it's that money too so all of the the base money on the central bank balance sheet in the form of digital dollars uh to take a fed example uh and in the form of physical dollars that is what the traditional banking system calls m0 that's the base money in the system m1 is m0 so all of the base money plus all of the dollars that are kept in bank checking accounts so it combines this bank the central bank base money the m0 plus all of the commercial banking money in checking deposits so it's still highly liquid it's still sort of money but it's not base settlement money then we get to m2 which is everything from m1 which includes m0 plus some additional things all the money in savings accounts so a little bit less liquid savings accounts tend to be a bit more locked up or in cdos or in money market funds so m0 m1 m2 all of those things combined are that's kind of a taxonomy that the traditional system uses uh to talk about money important to realize that the base money um that is equivalent in the the crypto space to things like bitcoin or things like ether bitcoin and ether are really the m0 in crypto those uh assets are the base settlement assets so when you issue more m0 in the traditional system the central bank is doing that right now through quantitative easing and through all of the the things we're about to see probably they will be issuing trillions uh they're actually printing money so they're actually increasing their m0 based money when ethereum or bitcoin are producing block rewards to reward miners for providing security while they are increasing their m0 in the open finance world um you can also think about m1 and m2 and m1 might be eth if it's locked in a protocol like like compound so it has a little bit more risk uh there's some protocol risk that's involved with putting eth in compound so it's not quite the the base you know settlement eth as an m0 might be it's it's m1 or die is a good example probably of an m1 it ultimately has to settle to eath if die has a global settlement it basically becomes a redemption coupon for some eats so it settles in ether but it is in this other layer it is in the m1 layer we could talk about m2 as a layer as well it's important to to note i think that this traditional scheme of the base money and these other monies that have additional risk but but still provide liquidity that's kind of the the monetary fuel uh for these systems um but the base money itself that is probably the most important money of all because everything settles back to the the base money and the issuance of the base money is something to play pay close attention to as we've talked about often the issuance in a central bank money system is arbitrary uh in 2008 for for example the fed printed 40 in one year right bitcoin and ether they print three 3.5 percent for uh bitcoin it's dropping down to you you know one percent range one one and a half percent uh ether prints four point five percent but you could see exactly how much these systems are printing with the fiat money system it's really up to the central bankers and they're under pressure political pressure to print more and more depending on the circumstances and what's happening a lot of comparisons a lot of similarities between a nation state and the ethereum system and the crypto system so the m1 m0 how does that fit into our triple point asset idea where what pillar is that relevant to it's all relevant to that store of value pillar so again the store value pillar you could also call that the the money pillar and these m's all fit under that pillar they're just different types of uh of money under that pillar and really the the base money that's that's the money that actually exists everything on top of it is essentially a credit of some form or another a coupon some sort of redemption for that base money and that's true true in the traditional system it's also true in these crypto systems as well so that's the perfect time to start talking about monolith monolith is a defy card it is a card that you get that you can hold in your wallet that you can spend anywhere visa is accepted so basically the whole world and when you spend your money you are spending your die you are spending the m1 of the ethereum ecosystem and so monolith offers you a credit card a visa card that you can take anywhere and so you can access the m1 of ethereum wherever you go you get your card you load it with dye you put it in your wallet and then you have a little bit of ethereum in your pocket so what monolith allows you to do is it allows you to transfer some of the world's economic activity whenever you go out you buy your coffee your pizza your whatever when you do that you are putting some of the world's economic activity on ethereum using ethereum's m1 using dye using applications like they're supposed to be in the background to support your financial life so go to monolith.xyz check out their defy card they have a ton of cool features they have a ton of cool features coming soon such as meta transactions ens wallet connect that will allow you to further use your monolith account your monolith card in a bunch of different spots very easily it's going to be a great way for people to get onboarded onto the future of ethereum you can take it out it looks great it's a sexy card you can show your family and say hey there's crypto on here really cool innovations happening over at monolith so again go to monolith.xyz and check them out we have the best sponsors david on bankless want to tell you about ave it is one of the most interesting d5 protocols out there it is a lending and borrowing protocol on ethereum so it allows you to take your ether that triple point asset and do more with it it allows you to create dye out of it you can create dye out of it and then you could lend it to ave it will magically transform your dye into something called a dye which is die except earning interest it's a little bit like a savings account in the traditional world you can also borrow from it so you could take some of the m0 eth that you have and you can put it in the protocol and create a fixed rate loan on top of that rather than selling your precious eth developers you have to check out their flash loan protocol they've just integrated that into d5 saver so with defy saver you can use the ave protocol and actually swap out some of your your maker loans collateral on the fly incredibly powerful stuff go take out alone if you're interested or go use the lending protocol from ave ave dot com that's a a e all right david so we talked about a lot of the pillars in the nation state ethereum versus the united states let's let's take the last one what's the third one the last pillar is the whole rest of the economy so the world the u.s economic system is nothing without you know all the jobs businesses companies that people go to on their day-to-day basis so when you get in your car and you drive to work you are using energy in your car you park it in the garage you take the elevator up that consumes electricity you power on your computer you are sending messages on your phone to everyone from everyone everyone is passing things along and it's all taking energy to do this and so it's really the energy of the system that is really what allows the u.s economy to really come into fruition everything runs on top of energy and that's like the last pillar of the ethereum ecosystem is the energy the energy of the ethereum system is of course ether right it's either when it gets converted into gas to pay for transaction fees but it's also something more it's also the block space of the ethereum economy it's the capacity of the movement of goods in one unit time and that capacity is how much energy ether has ethereum has at its disposal and so think of the block space of ethereum as the highway that people drive to work on if there was only one highway the plans to expand ethereum in ethe 2.0 that's like taking that highway and creating 64 more lanes right absolutely yeah it's allowing us to be more energy efficient as as an economy the more highway the more lanes that we can produce the more the same amount of energy can allow us to go further uh and so you know any sort of any sort of activity in the world takes energy and it's the same is true on ethereum if you want to do any anything you need to pay ether to pay for the block space now that's why there's been so much emphasis on scale when it comes to ethereum how much more lanes of highway can we produce how many more lines of lanes of highway can we get into the protocol and how efficiently can we make those cars on that highway you know how how can we do the same activities using less energy using less gas and so it's really a function of how efficient the whole system is because the more efficient the system is the more economic activity we can fit inside the protocol more cars in the highway baby and so if ethereum is trying to be the world's economic system it's going to need a few more lanes it's going to need more efficient cars and that's what the growth of ethereum and the usage of ether as energy is all about okay so we've got a digital nation state versus a traditional state nation state what if what if you want upside on this digital nation state so if i want upside if i want to invest in the american economy i kind of know what i have to do right it's a basket of a few things mostly it's a basket of the s p 500 stocks u.s stocks maybe some corporate bonds sprinkled in there 80 percent of my portfolio is going to be that 20 of my portfolio might be things like us dollars or treasuries but i don't want to keep very much in u.s dollars because anything i keep in us dollars is just going to get inflated away how does that work in the ethereum economy so what if i want upside on the ethereum digital nation state what do i do and this goes back to when i said that the pillars of ethereum are a lot closer together than their real world correlates the three pillars of ethereum are stitched together better and this is why if you want exposure to the growth of the us economy you buy you don't buy dollars you buy equities you buy probably the s p etf but if you want exposure to the growth of ethereum the equivalent s p etf is basically ether it's mostly ether if you want exposure to generalized health and growth of ethereum you buy ether yeah absolutely so a basket if you're going to invest in the ethereum economy right it makes sense to have the base layer money it doesn't make sense to have the base layer of money in the u.s economy or at least very much of it but it does make sense to have the base layer money in the ethereum economy because it's a different type of money it's issued by algorithm not by central bankers so it's decreasing to one percent issuance uh per year the eth actually that is consumed as energy we haven't talked about this much but the ether is used in transaction fees a portion of that will actually be burnt we could talk about that more on another episode and all of the protocols all of the economic activity built on top if they're going to be trustless they have to use eth as economic bandwidth so i think a better portfolio if you're investing in the ethereum digital nation state is going to be more heavily weighted towards eth and then later eth staked eth you know uh ethereum is going to have its initial bond offering that's going to be staked those are the treasuries of ethereum makes sense to have a decent portion of your assets in in those two classes as upside maybe the rest you put in in d5 protocols or something to me that is a better portfolio to gain exposure to this digital nation state um you know what i one one last thing i think we should clarify a bit more i think you you hinted at it but we've been talking about ethereum and ether in particular as a triple point asset as being a store of value we made that case we talked about that a capital asset when it's staked but then also a commodity i do want to say this explicitly because ether itself is actually not the commodity right so there's some subtlety here that now that we've gone through the the entire triple point asset case we could talk about the subtlety because i think listeners will understand it more um ether is not the commodity it is the money that's used and enforced by the protocol to pay for the commodity the commodity itself as you've said in this in this podcast the commodity itself is block space so that is the scarce resource commodities how you know the amount of transactions you can fit in an ethereum block uh that is pushed out every every six seconds or so yeah totally that block space that comes every six seconds in east 2 and every 12 seconds today uh that is the product of ethereum that is what ethereum constantly produces and sells to the world uh so you know that is ethereum's one responsibility that's where all the security of ethereum goes to protecting all of the security goes to protecting the value of the block space and the whole entire point of ethereum is to produce good block space block space that people want block space that is in demand and it's like pumping oil out of the ground in a way because you know one new block is produced every 12 to six seconds and that block space is there's no more no more no less and you know new block space is produced so there's always more but for that one particular block you can't make any more space in that block and ether is the asset ether is the money that buys that space and it's the it's the only money that buys that space just as just as the irs only accepts u.s dollars for your taxes ethereum only accepts eth for for its block space and that that's how through all of that economic activity that you're talking about that's how it's bootstrapping itself into moneyness through demand in its own economy demand for block space demand for economic bandwidth the cool thing about the ethereum protocol is that you know the ethereum protocol is selling the block space but it's actually really the validators of ethereum in in ethereum 2.0 uh so if you are the person that is staking your ether in the bond market you are the one that is receiving the fees from selling that block space so the revenue from the bond market is partly the revenue from selling the fees because like i said the pillars are closer together here the pillar of eth being staked to the protocol is really close to the pillar of selling block space as a commodity and so the purchasers of the block space are paying the people that are staking their ether to protect that block space so these pillars are right next to each other totally full episodes we need to do on staking david uh takes 32 eath to stake i think a lot of folks that are listening will want to become stakers in eth 2.0 get exposure to that initial bond offering you know and as we start to think about wrapping up here we can also think about some of the the tokens that are issued on ethereum and how those affect the value uh or not of of ether so something like usdc for example that is a stable coin issued by coinbase it's backed by fiat so traditional us dollars in in a traditional bank account but when usd is deployed on ethereum it increases value to eth through demand for gas through gas that in the future is going to be burnt through every transaction so that decreases issuance and also and i think this might be the the most important catalyst for value accrual on eath is it starts to onboard more people into ethereum into creating an ethereum address and having an ethereum bank account if you will and the people once they're in the ethereum bankless money system they tend to do other bankless things they tend to buy the bankless reserve asset which is ether that creates additional demand on ether dye is a little bit different how about die how does that increase the value of ether yeah so die and usdc are both stable coins they're both these tokens that are worth one dollar on ethereum and when you send one of these stable coins to someone else you pay a fee that goes to the stakers and so that increases the value of ether to a small degree die is different because die has a much more direct link to economic bandwidth and so for every one dye out there there's at least one and a half dollars worth of ether inside of a maker vault somewhere so not only is the economic activity of dye buying commodity block space but it's also pulling ether off of this secondary market and having and making it be deposited into maker dow so it's actually increasing the value capture of ether in two different ways it's pulling ether off of the secondary market and depositing it into maker dow and it's also paying fees to those that are staking ether and making it more profitable to stake ether which if it's more profitable to stake ether then more ether will be pulled off the secondary market to stake more and so dye is really hitting this twice it's really adding value to ether in two different ways it's like some of these tokens have uh indirect value accrual mechanisms for ether and some of them have very direct value accrual mechanisms for ether wouldn't you say absolutely yeah so all of the native finance on ethereum defy open finance things that use ether as collateral they are doing two things they are using ether as collateral making it a really good m0 but they're also hosting economic activity on ethereum they're creating demand for block space and they are making the price of block space go up the more competition there is for block space the more people have to pay which means more ether stakers are receiving more fees and so it's the really good protocols are the ones that are holding a lot of ether deposited into their contracts and doing a ton of economic activity at the same time those are the gold standard applications that we want on ethereum if you are interested in the price of ether increasing absolutely and i i think you know maybe to close this close this out uh the reason we're talking so much about ether is because it's been consistently underrated by folks people often talk about the value of the ethereum economy and all of the the the value of ethereum the network and all of the developers who are building on it and all of the cool things that that they can do and that's all awesome and that's all true um but ether itself as an asset we should take some time to appreciate it because it's really a kind of a magical asset it's really a bankless crypto native asset that is going to fuel this entire open finance movement and i i hope today we helped guide you in understanding it as a triple point asset so as capital when it's staked it produces cash flows as a commodity when it's used to pay for gas and as a store of value when it's used as economic bandwidth when it's used as collateral and money within the system that's ether the triple point asset guys talk about risks in disclaimers uh nothing we've said here is financial advice we are super excited about assets like ether as you know but buying ether is super risky crypto is risky defy is risky uh we're headed out west this is the frontier frontier it's not for everybody um there's bandits along the way uh so be careful out there guys what we want you to do as far as actions today obviously subscribe to the podcast if you haven't done that you've got to do that we're doing this every week a new podcast release every monday keep leveling leveling up every monday also start thinking about ether that you use as a triple point asset so when you use it to pay for gas what are you doing well you're using it as a commodity when you're using as collateral for a loan it's a store of value and then in the future we'll do episodes on this uh staking will be part of the equation too so putting ether in a bond and a treasury that is staking it start to think about how you're using eth in the context of a triple point asset also you've got to go to bankless and read david's post one of the best posts i think ever written in the ethereum space at least pertaining to the economics of ether it's called ether a new model for money look up that post on bankless he also has a fantastic video i think it's a 20 minute video uh that was recorded at an ethereal event where he goes through um the entire case for ether as a new model for money you've got to check it out guys we are super excited to have you on this journey this has been bankless thanks for joining us [Music] you
