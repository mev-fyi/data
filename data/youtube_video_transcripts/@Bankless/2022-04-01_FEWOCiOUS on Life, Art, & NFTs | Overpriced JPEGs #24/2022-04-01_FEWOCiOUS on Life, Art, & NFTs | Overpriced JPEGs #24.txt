tremendous prolific creator hope you don't feel like i'm i'm over hyping you i truly believe this i absolutely love your work fiocis so i'm i'm not saying this uh out of any place but my genuine heart and really excited to talk about what you have going on right now uh you you've made a pretty big announcement about what the next phase in your work life looks like and we are going to dive all into that and what fuel world is but let's start with just like hello give folks your background there's somebody here who doesn't know your story um wow what an introduction hello hi to you and hi everyone listening uh i'm felocious i grew up in las vegas and i've always loved to draw and doodle on random things drawing my math homework because i don't really understand math and i would draw because i thought it looked cool i didn't really understand what art meant or that art was like a craft and a skill i was like oh i drew a dinosaur on a skateboard on fire it looks cool and then i would draw more and more and as i got older i didn't really have that many friends and then i would be sitting at my lunch table and be like well i feel sad so i would just draw sad like literally right sad over my dinosaur on a skateboard on fire and then i'd be like oh i wish i had some friends and then i would look up and see like a group of friends sitting together and i would draw them just because i kind of envied that and then there would be the word sad next to a group of friends then i'd look at that and be like whoa this is how i feel this is weird i made something that that's how i feel what is that and then got older had access to the internet learn about art oh art is pictures of feelings i've been making art this whole time i want to keep making that oh i can learn about it and then i'm googling like anatomy book pdfs and learning about how to draw eyes realistically but then i'm like that's boring let's make you look crazy so that's me so that's amazing and this is actually a question i had for you and we're getting to it early which is do you have any formal artistic training uh no the last art class i was in was like third grade where they like make you be in art class for like an hour yeah and i remember the teacher being like you need to draw this painting with this color it was like dark blue and i was like why i don't want to use dark blue i i want to use red and green and all of the colors why would i limit myself and she's all bizarre to be like an art teacher very specific structures and correct answers here in this art class exactly so after that in third grade i banned art school for myself and would just like learn from books and and how old were you when you first started drawing you said you were really young and then had this evolution yeah i'd say like five i would draw but i didn't know i was drawing i'd say 14 is when i really was like i'm drawing and when did you have this realization sort of a two-fold realization one that like you were good at this and two that it could be a career uh that i'm good at it well i mean i would be drawn in class and kids would walk by and grab my notebook and then like to make fun of me but then they would be like wait this is cool and i'd be like whoa popular kid that i want to be friends with you think what whoa whoa whoa what do you mean it's cool and then they would give it back to me like you should keep drawing and then kids at school would just like walk up to me like oh i see you always carrying that book can i see it and it kind of became a thing that everyone wanted to see my sketchbook so that was a hint and then the career aspect of that i was like 14 and i was on twitter and i saw some artists post that they got their first apartment off of print money like selling prints of their art and i was like whoa you don't need to just sell like fine art paintings in big galleries to be able to afford a living off being an artist so that's when i got that mindset so i i think i have a sense of the answer of this from listening to other interviews with you but i don't know the whole audience would know in terms of adults in your life family members teachers at school did you have anybody else telling you hey this is a career hey you can go be an artist or supporting that dream once i would once i started getting the idea of i want to be an artist i don't want to do anything else uh my family did not they hated that idea and i would talk about all my ideas of like but uh i'm not gonna just like rush into it like i'm gonna first try to make enough money off clothes or try to do this try to do that and um my core family like my grandma would be like that that's not safe why would you do that go be a doctor go be a lawyer and it was kind of insulting to her like how dare you like waste my time raising you and then go fail at something um and after i expressed how serious i was my family kind of would just bash my art and say well it's too scary you really want to be an artist well your art looks scary look at van gogh it's beautiful landscapes what are you making it it's scary people their eyes look scary and they're blue no one wants to see blue people on their wall at home and you know i'd look at other art and they'd be like well you're kind of right that's i feel bad now so it became this secret that i would hide making my art and just wouldn't talk about it i'd never had people in my life supporting me except a couple kids at school but then they would like not really care that much they'd just be kind of nice so what's so amazing about that is like you didn't stop you just did it right you didn't let those voices impact what you kind of knew in your heart to be true and i guess that's that leads me to a couple questions one what was that was that like an internal voice that was like you can do this like it's gonna work out that kept you pushing on despite the fact that in some ways like your biggest influences were telling you otherwise it was it was it was looking at my family and seeing my grandma was a great drawer artist i'm called a drawer uh my my mom and dad both would win like art competitions when they're like little kids and my mom won like a competition where she got to paint like a mural at her school and then they would always tell me about it like brag about it as i was growing up but then i would look at them as adults and they never cared about art they stopped talking about it they bragged about it as a past thing but to actually pursue being an artist is a funny thing and they'd make fun of people trying to be artists and i thought it was sad and i didn't want to end up like my family like lose the magic and just do the same thing every day and just think that creating something is a crazy thing so i think that was it just like not wanting to be like them i'm gonna ask something if it feels like it's too personal we can always cut it out nothing is too personal okay well and that's i think why so many people of course resonate with your art is just your your complete vulnerability like do you think there was envy there do you think you had your parents didn't make that choice and on some level were jealous and afraid that you were gonna go make a different choice and invalidate the choices they made i feel i feel they were scared that i would think i'm so right like i don't think it was out of like hatred i think they really loved me but i think it was a they didn't understand and i think it was a they didn't want to see me fail and for me to be so confident in this thing and just get like pushed down to earth of like you're wrong uh i don't know i think it was just lots of misunderstandings that unfortunately we don't talk anymore um but i don't know do they know about your artwork i mean and i'll put this into perspective for folks i mean you've sold art what's the what's the not to that it shouldn't all come down to monetary value but you know i know you you your artifact drop for example sold out i think three million dollars in seven minutes like yeah in terms of what you know truly i think probably one of the most successful living artists to date you you're in a very very rare crowd of of artists who are able to command that kind of a you know monetary value on their work so wildly successful and you're 19 yes does your family know uh i'm aware that they know because a new york times article came out about me uh where i kind of talked about how hard my family was really abusive and like the extents to how mean they were about my art where further than i kind of described like they would threaten to rip up my art and just call me uh mean names for making art uh and so i talked about that in the new york times i would go very like honestly and open and i got a text from my uncle saying hey we see what you're doing also they didn't know that i'm transgender so they like found out about that at the same time yeah in the new york times they found out i'm transgender and then they found out that like i'm just being very open about how abusive they are and they're like first of all we see that you're transgender second of all we're mad at you because we're so embarrassed that you just said all this how dare you say like all these things we said to you how dare you speak honestly about what was happening yeah we created it yeah they were like trying to guess like me saying like we didn't do that and i'm like what yes you did you can't like say that years of my life didn't exist and then i just blocked his number because i'm like i don't want to deal with i don't have the energy right now so i just blocked him and that's the last that we talk to each other are you would you describe yourself a spiritual do you believe in a higher power um i feel like there's something i don't know what it is but i i'd like to believe that there's something out there and when i get nervous or scared i like to like this might sound silly but i have all these art books like basquiat warhol and sometimes it'll be like three in the morning painting and i'm like yo i feel like they're giving me like the energy like you're like goodbye like pumping through me and we are in the squad together i love that well it's that feeling like i'm not alone like there have been artists throughout history who have gone through something that's similar to what i'm going through is that part of what it is for you yeah there was a it was after sotheby's or before sotheby's where i was just in my room crying and i felt so much pressure and fear because i don't know like i went from a kid in my bedroom making stuff that was only for me and i would post it but i obviously everyone has the dream of becoming an artist that everyone sees but i didn't i thought it would happen but i also didn't think it would happen and there's that abstract confidence and then there's the looking at your life being like how could this really happen exactly and i was like oh i have sotheby's next month i'm so young i know that when i'm older like what i make now won't be as good and i'm just so nervous and everyone is talking about markets what if this one doesn't sell as much as the last one i don't know i don't know i don't know and then i was like damn how did basquiat feel like he was on a other like level like beyond like how did he feel when he got the first gallery sale i can't even imagine everyone isn't everyone talks about him like he's a legend which he is but how did he feel like when he made that first big sale who was there for him what did he talk about yeah you see his cool art but like it's kind of scary to put your feelings out there in front of so many people like that i love that and you know the start of this question was if you're spiritual and and part of that was coming from a place of like when you've had these really dark moments in your life what is that thing that that helps you get through art being one of them seemingly like belief in your own art but it's almost like your higher power are these like legends that came before that you like turn to in those dark moments which is like a beautiful thing that's so true like with nfts i view it as this really cool extension like damn everyone else like died before they got to see this and it's like what would these super creative awesome people do with this technology it's just an extension of the canvas i feel like like i don't know when i added sound to my first nft at first i was like i don't want to just put slap music on my artwork and then i was like but what if it was what does a painting sound like oh [Laughter] like new level unlocked new art level unlocked um this is something i wanted to ask you about and i think we're getting to it all right up front which is kind of a beautiful thing for a podcast people will be on the edge of their seat the whole time like you're so young you've had so much success you also come from an abusive background like you you come from a dark place like the the dramatic shift of going from an abusive household very controlled you know a minor so you have no control over your own money to freedom way more money than you probably could have imagined fame like how are you doing today how it how is your mental health i feel so happy and healthy and i'm not saying happy and like a ultra high woohoo way like i feel like a good meal like healthy like i don't know how to explain it talking to you quickly describes it you're contented you're satisfied you're full but not overly full like yeah it feels pleasant oh my god i totally get that uh analogy hopefully others get that analogy as well um okay let's let's maybe talk a little bit about your creative process which you started to get into uh and and that can lead us into fewer worlds which is it did it you've been sort of teasing it for a while but it came out today it's tuesday march 9th 29th as we're we're doing this you sort of really announced it today um i i wanna well i guess let me ask this because you just have great answers no matter what the question is so i'm gonna give you this broad answer and i'm gonna or a broad question and i'm gonna ultimately love your answer i'm sure like what is your creative process you mentioned the sotheby's sale for example you're like i've got this stuff to be sale what am i going to do or for this fuel world like how do you begin an art project um i feel like i feel like i'm not the kind of like i draw a lot i'm really bad at sketching and i'm really bad at making prototypes like i feel like i rather just smush everything into one and make like an ultra cool thing than like five okay thanks so basically what i do is i just sketch and sketch and maybe i don't even know what i'm feeling because i'm not good at articulating my feelings in words so it's not so it's not like i can like write like i'm sad or like i want the peace like i don't know how you think i don't know like in your brain when you're thinking is it words or is it like visual like you're not on youtube and can't see my face uh he's just blew my brain um like you thinking right now i have to close my eyes okay is it words i think it's just words it's like abstraction tell me what you think well what i think it's like fuzzy like blackness uh-huh and then sometimes there's words but sometimes it's like a color like red or like magenta gradient with green and i don't know what that means so like it's like trying to unravel that and be like well what word is that and it'll be like happy okay but why and then it's like but like that's me breaking it down really slow it's happening like really fast basically at once so you're you're kind of observing your own process of thought to figure out the feeling and then abstracting it back into art it like it sort of seems like it's that like it starts sort of as an abstraction that you in very quick order turn into a feeling which you then in very quick order turn into something on a page that's literally like articulated so well yes exactly that that's amazing okay next question about your process so i i'm actually have been reading a book shout out to my friend danny green who lent this to me called the war of art and it's obviously a spin on the earth the war of art when he talks about the muses and how you have to like oh my god the war of art by stephen pressfield is my favorite book ever oh my god okay i'm reading it now i love it i was so excited that i was going to get to interview you like sort of after finding this book because well now you know what it is so i would love maybe we should give folks do you want to give folks the the like tl dr on this book or do you want me to do it i don't even know how to can you do it because you probably say sure no no so i'll tldr this basically it's a it's a book by steven pressfield right who's a writer and it's a very short interestingly written book that is sort of a self-help book but it's not written like a self-help book it's to describe the process of being a creative and what he does is he personifies this idea of something like resistance and if you're creative even if you are not basically resistance is sort of everything that causes you to want to procrastinate that causes you to not want to do a thing and instead of making that something that i think we all feel is like a flaw in ourselves he takes it out of the individual and is like there's this thing called resistance that anytime you're doing something creative or doing something hard or whatever you're going to feel and you're going to have the desire to like avoid the work and that desire to avoid the work is this thing resistance and then it's basically a a book about kind of overcoming that resistance and then there's the muse which which ferocious i want you to talk about but this idea that if you just show up to do the work muses and sort of inspiration arises and again it takes it outside of you so it takes it outside of like i'm personally responsible for being inspired by something amazing and makes it much more about the act of just doing the craft i think that was a very long description so we may have been better off with you doing it uh but um it's an amazing book so so uh i might the question i was initially gonna have but i'd love for you to to spiff or riff off this in any way is how much are you inspiration driven and how much are you every day i show up and do the work because that's the job like where do you fall in that spectrum um it's really funny that you bring up that book because i feel like that book like trained me like i literally i would read that book and then reread it and reread it and just like highlight parts i like and use it as like a rule book kind of as like a 12 like 13 year old so i think that kind of formed how i am um obviously inspiration is real like real like random things do pop up but they can't pop up unless you show up every day and maybe you think you're making like nonsense or it's boring or not perfect but you know you work in every day it coagulates and combines and makes this big ball of inspiration and then one day it just kind of comes at you and you're like oh yeah this was in front of me the whole time i just wasn't ready yet to put that piece in so both so and to give folks a little more context right the the sort of thesis of this book is like the the true professional the true artist and professional doesn't have to mean you're necessarily making money at it it means you treat this seriously you take your craft seriously is that every day you show up sometimes there will be inspiration that sparks something and sometimes there won't and it doesn't matter you just keep showing up you just keep overcoming resistance essentially and by you know just doing the work each day um and what what's so important to me about hearing you say you love this book and that it has inspired your work is you i think come across as somebody who's just like and i think this is probably true to some extent right but like boundlessly creative like you just are able to make it happen and it's stress-free and you just like produce this incredible art and the fact that you like that book tells me like you are also a mere mortal who struggle at time and and who hit roadblocks and who want to tear your hair out and like and just day after day show up to do the craft and do the work and that's so interesting because i think it's so important for people who want to do creative work but who doubt themselves to realize like you know even you are taking this like a craft and every day showing up whether whether the inspiration is there or not oh absolutely i feel with creativity there's always a tidbit somewhere like you really have to take every idea and just dissect it completely and just take what you like and then move on and then try to build something else with it or try to keep building on that and i think doing that over and over and over makes you faster which makes you like i don't know like people would say like better or whatever because you're making better things more consistently but i don't know that book is awesome that's so cool you brought that up no one ever talks about that book so good do you have a prime way like you procrastinate like a prime way resistance shows up in your life where when you really should be working on something it's like twitter twitter's just therapy like come play with me the oh my gosh you know what the worst resistance is is resistance that makes you think you're working really hard like i'll be like sketching a lot or doing a lot of research i'm like oh i need to do so much research for this project or i need to do tons of sketches to make it perfect but it's really because i'm scared to fail and continue the next step that's so brilliant okay here's the part of the war of art right that uh that i found so helpful and it's speaking to exactly that point which was he says resistance will show up the fiercest like right before you get over the finish line it's sort of like it's always darkest before the dawn and there's a couple projects that i have in my life that like i was sort of at that point of like almost wanting to give up on them and reading that i was able to reframe the wanting to give up feeling instead of it being like this is too hard or something i was able to reframe that as that's how close i am right like i'm so close to the finish line that's why this feeling is showing up for me i have to keep going because it's actually just resistance at its fiercest because like i'm actually really close to being to cracking this case um and it's sort of like true to your point it's like just push forward when you're you're distracting yourself with all the other like you know gobbledygook that seems really valuable but it's like you know you're not maybe that wasn't as related to what you did yeah in my brain i'll like try to be like oh but like it's better to spend more time making the perfect sketch or idea than wasting time executing it but then i'm just wasting time no matter what when like i would have saved time if i just finished it if that makes sense totally so you mentioned clothes earlier as i think in the context of like maybe being a fashion designer sort of a context and i promise the next question i ask is going to be about fuel world because i'm so excited to really dive into what this is you've pretty strongly alluded that there's a probably a merchandise component when did your interest in merging your art on the page with like clothing design where did that start or what age do you remember finding that concept interesting uh i liked clothing before i liked art like when i was like two years old i'd go to walmart and see light up spider-man shoes do you remember being two years old well like whatever the youngest man i saw spider-man light up shoes that might sound silly but like i thought that was cool and i didn't realize it like not that light of spider-man chooses our art but like the cons you know spider-man's art i think there's a case to be made that's shoes okay spider-man is art it's just like okay light up spider-man shoes okay i didn't realize it was like it was hard i just thought it was a cool thing i can wear and flex on my friends in kindergarten but but that was like the first interest in growing up it's like seeing what the other kids are wearing i thought clothes were cool but i couldn't at first it was cool because other kids were saying it's cool but then i'm like oh it's because that shirt is red with orange that's why i think it's cool not because everyone else is saying it's cool and then but that wasn't accessible i don't know how to make a shirt but i can draw a shirt with a design on it and then that looks weird by itself so i'll draw a character wearing that shirt with a design on it and then it evolved into my own characters with feelings so it's like first clothing and then drawing and then realizing oh i can combine the two and then i'm just gonna draw on like a hanes t-shirt that like my grandma had with sharpie and then give it to one of my friends and now they're wearing it at school and that's crazy so that's where that started so it was young because you know and then you had the artifact collab was that your first foray into call it quote unquote like professionally designing for clothing slash you know called streetwear um my first i don't know how to say that word foray yeah first uh toe dip into that yes my first toe dip would be like i would uh sell commissions or make commission whatever for five dollars and i would save enough to get shirt screen printed and then i would sell those shirts that were screen printed and i would sell them for like 18 when i should have sold them for more but i was like i refuse to sell for more and so i barely made any money and then i would sell that to make hoodies and then i would sell that to make like to buy paint to make a painting because paint is expensive um so that was my first toe dip but like big scale major whoa was artifact for sure yeah okay it's time i want to talk about your latest announcement which is the launch of fuel world and i want to start with your tell me what this is and i i can also tell you what i've learned i believe about what this is but you tell us um fuel world it's feel world is my life like it's it's i don't even know like it's so hard to put into words it's just everything that i've ever incorporated yeah it's your magenta black fuzz that gets turned into a feeling that gets turned into art honestly like it's different than my personal paintings because i feel like personal paintings are more so like encapsulated moments of my life at that time but like fuel world i view it as just like a vibe like just going for it and being like oh let's do clothes oh obviously the clothing line will have an articulated storyline and stuff but like what can clothes be i don't know growing up there was so many things that i didn't understand why people didn't make it this way so it's my turn i want to make it my way i wanna i would watch shows and they would change my life and be like maybe one day i could do that but that's not accessible but with the show that changed your life i mean uh i was i was thinking more so movies like wally and like up like that made me cry so bad what or like verse spider versus so good and i want to make something that makes some other little kid look at it and be like wow i feel empowered to go create um and i think with web 3 seeing like working with the artifact guys they were the first time i saw people feel empowered to like to just do it on their own they're like why do we need someone else let's just make it ourselves you want to come with and i was like oh yeah i'll come with and i feel like working with them kind of trained me and taught me so much about oh i don't need to just make paintings like i love making paintings but also i'm allowed to go make clothing i'm allowed to go talk about my characters in other ways and express them in further ways it's art and art i don't want to stick to one medium i want to do everything so that's real world when did you first start using the term fuel world because i'm using it to describe this sort of upcoming drop but i may be erroneously doing so few is fuel world a term you've been using for a long time and it's sort of to describe your ecosystem i'd say yeah like um the first time field world was ever brought up was the artifact drop okay and then after that it was just thinking on how can this world be expanded i i am so like hungry to explore the world more because i was trapped in this abusive household for so long i'm free now let's explore everything and here we are now exploring it living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bank list nation

hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 so what you've announced thus far in terms of this latest iteration of all this i think there's like a couple components of this from what i glean there's there's something called paint there's canvas there's fuels and then there's like fuel wearables that are coming which of course ties into everything we've we've just been talking about is that do i have that right is am i missing anything that's a part of this latest drop of fuel world i mean real world fear world is starting with pain yes and pain is the building block to everything else and everything else is kind of un undetermined more so from a standpoint of like while i'm learning what if i learn more and then i can make it better and uh yeah but that's pretty much everything like uh paint canvas fuels fashion so we'll get into each of those i'll ask this also stage setting question and this is a loaded question is fuel world a metaverse i don't know if i'm allowed to answer that it feels like that's the obvious thing but when you didn't when you didn't start off with few words of metaverse i was like well i guess i'll ask the obvious question it's got the world my goal is yes that's what i'm working towards that's why it's paint is building block because we need to like get there first did you have opinions on the board ape metaverse and apecoin launch and all of that that happened recently i mean i think what they're doing is cool i think i think it's really cool just to see the community grow and explore and i'm just excited to see like that's one take on like a path to go and it's just like oh what else is there the reason i ask is because that drop and then others that other things that i've had happening meta angels launched their own meta angel marketplace if you're familiar with that project and and i made i think a comment in an earlier podcast episode about this but it's relevant here which is like i love seeing this i think artists and projects just like being empowered you know and it was like okay yeah we have the sandbox we've decentralized there's no knock on them but like the reason we're all here is your art fio you know the reason we're all here is board apes like right now the reason this ecosystem exists are these projects and these artists so it actually makes a lot more sense for you to be like you're here because you like the vibe my art gives you like cool i'm the metaverse now you know as opposed to these sort of just like plots of land where maybe something is built and again it's not a knock on them and i you know i think there's plenty of room for lots of metaverses but i love that concept and it was sort of a click moment for me that that makes all the sense in the world of like you know we're here for you like you should go make the marketplace and the and the metaverse i think it's fun to see creatives explore further ways to express themselves in ways that have literally just never been done before at all like i would say like the closest thing is like a store in real life and that's like not even not even it's just what do you mean everyone's making their own metaverse that's just such a if you said that to someone from the 1700s they would explode yeah yeah like that's a nonsensical word you crazy person like here's an asylum i'm just forward thinking which sums up i think a lot of history um okay so let's get into these these components that you've mentioned so far and then we'll get into maybe what this looks like in six months one year 20 years um i'll just overwhelm you with those questions so paint you said is the building block and what's been announced so far is that paint is going to be available to purchase on nifty gateway starting i believe april 3rd april 2nd is pre-sale second okay pre-sale being for fuel piece holders if you own some of your stuff you hold the fuel um you can get into pre-sale but april 3rd is like public sale okay so you basically have 24 hours to mint paint and you can mint as much paint as you want in that time and mint our ear c721 you know unique nfts and it sounds like are they generative yes they are generative they are generative and they each contain within them like we're sort of using paint in two ways here i think right there's paint as sort of the nft but then as part of the traits of that nft there will be a certain amount of quote unquote paint that each nft is ascribed is that true it's like i could get one paint that has more paint than the paint your paint has yeah yeah i know it sounds kind of confusing but but like so that's right so um my paint drop everyone gets a paint drop but it's like how much paint is in your paint drop my paint drop might have one paint in it but yours might have like 200 paint in your paint drop so i uh on a note on the paint drop front and this will be a way to encourage folks to go to the website which we'll link to below i wanted to know because i am obsessed on your website right now fuelworld.io uh you know it's a scroll down site you know and it just sort of scrolls endlessly and on the paint part of the website there's it says paint is the building block to all life and fuel world and you know the paint turns into fw and then it goes back to paint like i just loved your website and i was like how much of this is like do you creative direct and control all of this or are you like i have this i'm sure you have a talented team regardless but like how much of how involved in the nitty-gritty are you of like what this website looks and feels like everything it was so brilliant truly every every paint drop i sat with my 3d artist logan we sat together and we made paint from scratch together every how the hue the way the light comes through the paint i was there and helped make sure it looked how i wanted it to look the website literally like until today when it like we opened the website it's like oh let's change this button oh i need to draw the button okay here so it's like me drawing and sending it to aaron the web designer as he's coding it the startup life well everyone should go and check it out it's i think the website is beautifully done and there the little details are there and that's that's why i wanted to ask that question because it has your fingerprints obviously all over it it's literally your it's your brain but i'm not surprised to hear you're that deeply involved um okay so that's paint and so everybody get you can buy a paint drop i think it's if you're not on the pre-sale list it's a thousand dollars which was also interesting if you list it in in usd but it and then it'll be uh that'll get you a paint drop and you'll have a certain amount of paint in there can you explain to folks what what we can do with paint i don't know how much i'm allowed um more than you think that's good for the podcast um paint got to be very careful with my words here um i would say that with paint it will give you access okay i think i read that you can buy canvas and fuels if you have paint you get gifted canvas and uh depending on what kind of paint you get uh you get a trophy and you get like maybe you get a custom fuo when we do fios so it's like you're i can't even say that you get a custom fuel okay and basically paint acts like power-ups for your fuels and it gives you access to unlock particular things that we cannot reveal yet okay and fuels are the collectible dry it's it's a pfp it's your sort of you know collectible identity i view it as an enhanced version of that okay i know i was almost hesitant to use the term pfp because i feel like it can sound you know people have feelings around that term it's become a loaded term but but the point is it's a it's a collectible it's it's an avatar style i don't know if it's an actual avatar but it's something somebody might make as their profile picture on twitter is that yes fair and it's is it a 10 000 collection i can't reveal that okay um so we're starting with paint but there's uh clearly that will be evolving into meaning other things that you'll be able to unlock as holders of paint yeah the way i view paint is like the the first step that if you have it it will open so many doors it unlocks the rest of this universe yeah one might say unlocks the rest of this metaverse and so yes and the clear implication is encouraging folks to buy up a paint there's something this is also on the nifty website where uh at the end of this paint drop which again will last for 24 hours there's a leaderboard and the the top 50 people who have the most paint will be rewarded and will get additional nfts and sort of parts of your ecosystem so the the the encouragement there is buy up a lot of paint you're going to want to use this as unlocks in fuel world some of you will be explicitly rewarded for it but in general it's probably good to have a lot of paint if you like fuel and want to be a part of this yeah like it's just a reward of like if you believe in it that much that you're going to spend extra then heck yeah like here you get a custom feel here's a trophy like thank you so much but the general like idea is like hey everyone we are about to make something really crazy and there's no road map there is a crazy vision behind it and we're we're going for it but like with paint uh this is the first step and if you happen to buy a lot then thank you so much like here's a reward for that you know so let's talk about your future vision here i understand i i i might i'm seeing you squirm anticipatorially potentially you mentioned movies that inspired you in the grand vision here is that's a place where you'd like to play create your own characters pixar style have shows movies is that of interest i mean fewers are the little inhabitants in the fuel world so i i imagine a world in the future where there's episodes or something just what is fear world of course we see the characters but like how do they interact in the world what are the stories behind why are they blue with polka dots what does that mean what does it all mean um so that's how i view episodes for things in the future and i'm sure you're obviously very hands-on with this story but do you have a like with the let me ask this what's your team like right now in terms of my team right now is very small but we're mighty [Music] i'm trying to look on the website right now because i know you had sort of a list of folks um okay and so one of the things you hear right now is like i think board 8 made this point when they launched their metaverse like again it feels like we keep digging i keep digging the sandbox but like not intentionally but you know hey you show up and it's just like this empty space right now and maybe there's a couple games but you just like kind of wander endlessly and there's sort of it's unclear like what you're supposed to be doing or feeling are you hoping people feel in fuel world or if this were a metaverse like and people were entering this what would you want to be there i mean i would want there to be there the the heart and the soul and the the understanding that this is a beautiful art project that all came together and i mean the the tech is the the paint it's the the coating behind all the beautiful things that you're seeing is like the paintbrush the paint strokes of all these beautiful creations coming together and i'm seeing the characters interacting with each other you're seeing the nuances and emotion of how it's not just happy it's not just sad it's happy but a little bit confused and feeling a tad bit sad because of this thing that happened last week or whatever um i think just seeing the characters for what they are and seeing all the complexities of the world world is not simple our world is crazy and i think real world should be crazy that's what i imagine when you think about the metaverse let's call it as a concept broadly forget fuel world specifically because i know it's hard to talk about specifics there when there's so much you you want to be careful about saying like what excites you about it i know you've talked about wanting to build robots in the future like you're clearly you obviously are you know love art what excites you the most about the idea of the metaverse i think just finding new ways to express yourself and uh interpret others expressions like the fact that i can go in the metaverse and just be like literally look like a fuel is so cool and then you'll talk to me and maybe not know what i look like but i look like a fuel how does that change our conversation i don't know but that's so cool or like i like just the concept of like expression i think that's really beautiful and that there's new art that's gonna be made that has never existed before i love that when i look at like your past work you have you were doing art drops you started with art drops i think was it on ozone super rare was really where you started in nfts right it was you had every week you were minting a piece of work on super rare and eventually you listed one and it's sold and you know here we are today and so that was sort of a phase where it was you know clear individual works of art and then i look at your sotheby's drop for example which i i want to actually ask you a couple questions about that um and i that was when i first heard of you i think there are probably a lot of people who first heard about you from the sotheby's drop you were the youngest person to ever have a sotheby's you know auction which is that's crazy what amazing uh and then you have this collaboration with artifact and these are very sort of one you call it one off like you do it and it's done and it's wrapped and it's closed are you entering a phase now where with what you're building it's going to all be a little bit more like do you expect the next five years to be building around this sort of concept of fuel world in a way that's one thing leading to the next and building on almost like one central concept honestly i think more than five years i'm like ready like this is my life like i'm trying to build something like not even disney like just something new like i don't know like the farthest art can go i want to push it and see where i end up can you give us a a glimpse into anything you talked about the tech as the paintbrush like an area where tech and art are pushing the boundaries with something you're doing right now that you feel like you can share um i mean the paint drops themselves the fact that there was the concept of this building block but i did not want all of them to look the same uh the paint the paint drop nfts animate and turn into fw for fear world and then turn back into a paint drop but literally every animation for every paint drop is slightly different they warble it's a different way one red will not be the same red as another red like literally no paint is the same even the linework paints where you think like no way how can it look cohesive and all of them be different they're all different and i think the fact that i had a vision and idea and that we can extend it infinitely and i get surprised by these ideas and it's like we built a little brain in the computer to make art like me is crazy like and that the generative piece you're describing like basically it's generative so you have an algorithm that's outputting each individual piece based on the inputs that you gave it of like this is how i make art and how i like things to look yeah like it's basically about setting guidelines for it to go as crazy as it wants and then it just looks crazy and i find that to be so fascinating that i can only do so much with these two hands in my brain but if i can think with someone about how to articulate the right rules and guidelines to infinitely extend that's beautiful what for the sotheby's drop i wanna i'm curious how that came together was that something you had to apply for and seek out and then you find out you get accepted did they approach you how did the sotheby's auction happen um i literally think one day they just reached out to us oh no no that's not what happened oh my god i'm so sorry i was so wrong um my friend ryan thank you x he is an amazing painter and curator in the space and just amazing soul and one day he called me he's like dude i'm curating a sotheby's sale do you want to be in it it's about showcasing painters or any physical art and connecting it with web3 and showing the traditional art world that they don't have to be so separate it can be it's like a bridging bridging the gap and i was like yeah that's crazy what i don't even know how you got that opportunity but yeah i'm in like come on let's do it and he was like cool you're in do whatever you want physical nft that's it bye i'll see you in london and then i had a couple months to just think of well the theme of the the whole sale is well for us i felt like the mission there wasn't like a set theme but like i felt like the mission at hand was how can we get this other part of the world to understand our part in a very artful way and i made a big sculpture i don't know how to sculpt i'm a painter but i i felt like the gap is so large that i needed to make a seven foot tall glass blue sculpture to like make people look and see it wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on hold on are you telling me you got invited to to do a saturday's auction and you as a were you 18 at the time yeah as an 18 year old artist who could do like digital art and painting and like fully in that realm were like you know what i'm the youngest person ever to sotheby's auction i'm going to do a thing i've literally never done before a glass sculpture as part of this drop yeah oh my god does it i mean did you watch youtube videos like how did you figure out how to do it well luckily i didn't do it on my own um me and my team um we found these amazing people in new york uh shout outs kevin this guy named kevin help me shout out kevin yeah he helped me make the entire thing kevin and brian literally just like we sat and they're like okay like how do we make this work and i had this sketch of my character mister misunderstood it's this blue guy with a curly hue that has a big red bow tie um he's just like this sad little guy and i'm like well there's a sketch i have but i don't want him to be small that would be weird if it was just a small sculpture like gotta go big or go home and then we kind of kept scaling him and scaling him until it like got to the point where it was like if we make him any taller he won't fit in a room and also how are we going to ship this overseas to london [Music] so that's kind of how that happened it's amazing and then have you also done work with christie's is that when you did this is my life and hello i'm victor and and that work or was that also a sotheby's okay that was christie's that was christie's and how did christie's come about um christie's came about sotheby's christie's was before sotheby's it was oh here's what happened i was talking to my manager andrew and we were just chatting about life vibing around and andrew was like hey this was right after the people sale and andrew was like hey so people just had this sale at christie's i think it's really cool that you know he's shown the traditional art world what nfts are have you ever talked to christie's like you ever reached out to them and i'm like reached out to them how am i going to reach out to christie's what are you talking about and he's like you know just email them and i'm like i don't have that access what do you mean email them he's like dude it's literally on their website there's an email yeah so he literally just emailed like the same email on the christie's website he just emailed it and was like hey guys we this is victor let's do a drop and they saw the email and they're like oh snap we were about to email you let's do it and then that's how it happened okay so and that's actually where i first learned about you was christie's i was conflating the different drops so christie's came before sotheby's and i think that's what a lot of people learned about you is the hello i'm victor and this is my life and it was it were there four pieces each representing a year in your life those are five hold on let me i gotta count fourteen fifteen sixteen seventy eight yeah five pieces five pieces okay um and again i think people are maybe familiar with this but you you basically did each piece represented in age you know when you were 14 then 15 and 16 and you know through 19 the emotion there was like a sentence for each of them that sort of encapture you know captured where you were at that point in your life so chris's response is like we want to do a drop with you how do you go about determining what you're gonna make for your first like major auction house show well it was really hard because christy says yes you don't think christie's gonna say yes so you're just like ah i didn't think i'd get this far no i gotta do an auction i gotta make some art and then you're in your bedroom and i'm on the phone with my manager and he's like you know i was on your instagram and i noticed that your old art says victoria and not victor and i was like oh stab we're about to have this conversation right now oh it's now okay and i was like yeah and he was like do you want to talk about that like at christie's and i was like you know what yeah i do like yeah let's talk like why not like this is something i've had to deal with my whole life yes let's talk about it and then we got on a call with noah davis at christie's and it was just like hey man like i'm trans by the way and i've had to deal with this my whole life uh i want to make a whole collection about it and i don't want to go lightly on it either like i want to talk about like the times i've thought about death and where i hated myself and my family was mean to me and like i saw moments in history where just people like me are not accepted and still today still not really accepted as much and he was i was worried i'm like oh my god am i about to lose like this christie's opportunity i don't know and he was like yeah let's talk about it like of course why not and he they both pushed me to be myself to the fullest and go as deep as i wanted to go so that was the goal we set a timeline for pride in june and i just got to painting how amazing to go from a childhood where you felt like not only could you not be yourself you were you were ridiculed you had to you know you had you did so hide yourself because you were so ridiculed for it seems like anything having to do with who you are being an artist your identity at everything to a place where you have people around you who are like starting that conversation and who are the ones like pushing you into being more truly yourself like that's incredible yeah it's it's really beautiful to have people around me that are like yeah be you to the fullest and if they don't accept that then they're whack and it's like whoa i've always thought i had to like uh appease people and like hide myself but it's cool to just fully be on you that's cool that's awesome i love you feels good yeah yeah okay last question we're we're just about time here but i i want to is we're sort of on the the personal questions again i know you we we alluded this to a little bit earlier but obviously you're in this abusive household you start discovering nfts you sell your first nft at 17 yeah i think it was like a couple weeks before the pandemic before lockdown is that right yes so you're in las vegas you are already in a home in which you're not happy you're suddenly having this you're have you're getting money but it's eth yeah lockdown happens and and you can't you can't get your eth out because you can't open a bank account because you're underage and you can't ask your family to help because they won't help and now you're on lockdown so you're stuck at home like an abusive situation basically counting down the months until you turn 18. is your birthday's on january 1st too is that correct yes okay so counting on the months when you turn you like it's march 2020 you're counting on the monster you turn 18 january 20 21 so you can actually like get this money that you're now earning yeah that's wild i listened to an interview you did with gary v which by the way i recommend folks go listen to they you guys go a little bit more in depth i think in the moment by moment um of of that time in your life but like in in some like what did those seven months whatever it is eight months like feel like you you know there's like a light at the end of the tunnel maybe but you're stuck at home like what what what was that time in your life like oh my gosh i felt like i was gonna poop my pants every day like it was just so stressful like every i i like a month after my birthday i sat in math class like just right before the pandemic i was sitting in math class and i made a case before your birthday seven when you were 17 right yeah and i i made a calendar of okay when i turn 18 i have a year i mean when i turn 18 i'm gonna move out how am i gonna make enough money to move out well i don't know so i made a calendar of month by month what i'm gonna do to make enough money and options that i can do like sell shirts if that doesn't work sell stickers if that doesn't work i don't know figure it out and nfts just came randomly and i thought they were a scam at first and then i realized they weren't a scam and eth was 200 and everyone was like one day ethel maybe be a thousand dollars i don't know though don't like listen to me and i was like i don't know that's like a big jump and i didn't really understand what crypto like it was like a lot and then like you know i've i heard about like how bitcoin like went down and i was like oh my god is am i like i'm saving my money and ethan like is it just gonna go away before i turn 18 like i don't know what's gonna happen i i don't have anyone that can like turn it into dollars but then just as the months kept going nfts were growing and people were learning who i was and then other people were joining the space and then it was confusing because i've only been in like weird friend groups where like no one cared about us and it's like what you want to join my group what and then um i remember uh uh trevor jones sold picasso's bull for fifty thousand dollars and that was the first like art nft that i saw everyone go wait what like this is real like it's actually going on it's happening and he was in the news and the art was in the news and that was just the first time i was like oh my god like we got this like let's just keep going wag me yeah and then after that like i was just so confident i was like i don't care what happens like i'm in forever yeah so on your birthday january 1st when you turned 18 yeah like that day did you go get a bank account like the moment is here what did you do so what happened was so i i had like a kid bank account because my grandpa secretly made a bank account with me because i kind of told him what was happening but not the full truth so i had like a kid bank account that had like a weird limit and that if i put money in it he could see it so and i was scared to make one because i don't know i didn't understand how they worked so i was scared to do it on my own so basically what i did is i had the money in my kid bank account and just kept all my eat because i believed in it and i was like whatever that's fine and had like a thousand dollars i saved and just like went to seattle wow she had a thousand dollars in a kid bank account because you felt like that was enough that was your your grandpa would you could kind of justify that with your art you know but you couldn't justify like however many tens of thousands of dollars yeah and so you're like okay you know yeah i'm selling a couple things and it's like i've got a thousand dollars and then you you took that money bought was it like a one-way ticket to seattle for a thousand bucks like how what was that you know yeah i was like yeah it was a one-way ticket to seattle but i didn't get it for the next day because my auction was a 24 hour auction so i had to stay there and like i didn't want to be on the airplane when it ended and it was just this like itch in my skin of like oh my god i'm leaving tomorrow or is my family gonna find out somehow are they gonna like check the bank account somehow ah are they gonna like know with their like parent senses i don't know but they never found out until the like an hour before i left wow so you had an auction happening which is on your birthday which is and and that was 24 hours so you couldn't leave the day after your birthday so you had to buy a ticket basically for january 3rd yeah and so that left this window between like having purchased it and when you were leaving that somebody could have maybe seen and and your fear was that your parents would what was your fear i don't like i literally didn't know what to expect i'm like are they gonna like beat me up or like i'm like i was prepared to call the police are they gonna try to like hold me down if i try to run away i don't know what's gonna happen i was like on google being like i can run away when i'm 18. that makes sense i'm a legal adult but like and like i didn't know i wasn't actually running away this is just me now being a full adult human right like yeah wow and then you told you ended up telling your grandpa father right before you left yeah and he thought i was joking at first he's like yeah haha me too i'm going to miami and i was like no grandpa i'm serious i'm going to seattle i can't go with you to the store later and he said well are you sure like where are you going and i said i can't give you my address i don't want to i don't want to tell you i don't feel comfortable and he said well when i was your age i i was too scared to travel the world and i didn't do it and i regret it but uh my dream for you is i love you and i want you to see the world and if this is what it means then go for it and he like got my birth certificate and like gave me 200 cash and he said go i'll drive you to the airport and don't listen to anyone else and then as we're walking out my grandma obviously saw me with two luggages that were big full of sketchbooks they're heavy just sketchbook no clothes nothing just sketchbooks and she's like where are you going and i said i'm leaving and she said you're not gonna say bye to me that's it you're just leaving like that you treat me like trash well then all your stuff is trash and she went to my room and grabbed all my stuff and was just throwing everything in trash bags like right in front of me and that's the last time i saw her wow we're like you know we're a little over the time but i feel like that's that's on the one hand like the best ending and of course on the other hand i'm like okay but then what happened when you got to see how where did you go in seattle um i met my friend parrot through the nft space just this amazing artist i saw i found online and his bio said seattle washington so i texted him before i moved i said dude is seattle cool and he was like yeah man and he wrote me a long novel of this neighborhood's good this place is cool if you need to drive from the airport like i got you feel free and you know you hear your whole life don't trust strangers on the internet but i i talked to him enough in the space and saw his art that i was like i don't know he can't be that bad of a guy so you're coming from a situation where you're like what do i have to lose really like i'm coming from a toxic situation so i i understand that exactly and then i i i believe you're you now are based in new york yes not even a year later you moved to new york which is where i am so oh snap you gotta come with me i would love to i mean like yeah with anything um okay this is the actual last question can you explain to felix what paint parties are now that you've mentioned painting with folks and paint party people i think are also involved in the fuel world yeah the extent that they get access to things so paint parties are just events where like we rent out like okay paint parties are just like big events where i rent out like a warehouse or just like a big venue and we just fill it with canvases and we give everyone jumpsuits so that they don't ruin their clothes and access to all kinds of paint spray paint uh gloves to dip your hands in paint and just like finger paint on the walls do whatever you want there's no structure there's no nothing it's just art supplies you get a jumpsuit go paint and we blast music and it's fun because during events like when i'm seeing my buddies that live so far like i want us to make art together and see how each other's brain works brains work so that's why i decided to do paint parties and that's what they are just big playgrounds of paint and with that this has been a conversation with fuocious who you know there are no words i think you're you're just a remarkable person so thank you for coming
