what that does off the back of that is it actually unlocks a whole bunch of new products and services which weren't possible until now welcome bankless nation to this alpha leak episode where we cover volts protocol volts is an interest rate swap amm it's got uniswap v3 code in it and it helps us arbitrage interest rates across d5 in inside of one side of the volts protocol can go in variable interest rates and out on the other side comes out stable interest rates and volts is really a market maker a coordinator between these two types of market actors in d5 some people are willing to take the risk of volatile interest rates and some people are willing to pay for that risk being reduced and get stable interest rates and volts is an amm that allows these two market participants to come together and meet in the middle uh and allows one person to get stable interest rates and one person to get variable interest rates and perhaps a bunch more yield there's also the conversation of liquidity providing since uh this is using unit swap v3 code but instead of with assets with interest rates uh there's of course the possibility of being a liquidity provider and gaining a ton of yield and vols really is trying to position itself as like the curve of d5 for interest rates where curve is where you go it's the epicenter of stable coin liquidity or like kind asset liquidity volts is going to be or trying to position itself to be the epicenter of interest rates liquidity and defy and we don't really have a single central point of interest rate liquidity while the interest rate swap market in tradify is like a quadrillion dollars and i didn't just make that up there is literally a q uh this is a line from simon in the show there's literally a q in front of the volume and yearly interest rate swap market volume in tradify uh and if there's one thing that we know that d5 produces it's yield uh d5 is really good at producing yield and ave produces some yield for some assets compound produces some yield from some other assets we have the eath stake rate we have the usdc lending rate we got the urine yield rate we have all of these yield rates that are different from each other and volts can be a coupler a center point of liquidity between all of these different yield rates allowing people to arbitrage them in a leveraged fashion because that's what unisop3 v3 with concentrated liquidity does the reason why i'm so bullish on volts is that like it allows defy to set the mark the interest rate dynamics of the ethereum economy right the mar the interest rates of crypto are set by the market rather than the fed right and so in the trout fire world interest rates are set by like 12 12 dudes in a in a closed room there's no input it's just like it's whatever they say uh under like a volts paradigm or really like and this is why i'm again i really am bullish on the future of volts is that volts allows the market to determine the interest rate uh and so it just kind of like how uniswap v3 is an oracle for prices organically like there you put in die into one pool ether into one pool and the market balance these things out and naturally prices die versus eth uh volts can naturally price the interest rates of all d5 uh and so you know this is bullish for just a bankless permissionless money and finance system where we don't have 12 dudes in a closed room determining the cost of money uh instead we have a protocol to determine the cost of money and that protocol could be volts at least that is the bull case for volts of course i ask simon is there a token coming what about the token when token uh that question comes at some point during the show so you'll have to stick around to hear about that just as a disclaimer both ryan and i have invested in the uh as angel investors in volts in previous rounds uh so we are upside access to the upside there so that's the disclaimer there uh so i want to get right into the show with simon right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get r eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started

always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free welcome bankless nation to this episode of alpha leak on today's episode i'm talking to simon jones co-founder and ceo of the volts protocol and volts uh recently just went to main net so simon congratulations on that no thanks it's super exciting simon for the listeners that haven't heard of volts protocol or what that is can you just explain the high level explain like i'm five what is the the early explanation for volts protocol yeah sure so the really high level is that we have built out a protocol that effectively brings interest rate swaps to defy and i guess to talk to the significance of that first so if you just look at traditional finance as an example interest rate swaps they're just a core pillar to a well-functioning financial system and to put that in context there is a kind of almost cartoonishly large quadrillion of notional exchange each year in tradify interest rate swaps i mean it literally starts with a queue and it's that large because it supports such a wide spectrum of use cases both across risk management across speculation but then also across the construction of a whole bunch of different products both for corporates and for retail and at the moment in d5 we don't have this piece of infrastructure and what that does is is it kind of through it not existing is it limits the amount of products that we can actually build in order for d5 to be able to become the financial system for the whole of the world so by us bringing this to defy that is what we ultimately really hope starts to happen so let's keep things really basic here what is an interest rate swap market what what is that yeah so there's there's basically a a number of different actors that exist on the protocol um so we have lps because it's an amm but just to ignore that for a second and talk about the traders um you are either a what we describe as a fixed taker where you are selling a variable rate of return in exchange for a fixed rate or you're what we described as a variable taker where you are selling a fixed rate of return in exchange for a variable rate and if i just talk about two kind of really simple use cases for that so if you're a fixed taker and you have an asset that produces a variable rate of return like cdi for example and you don't want that variable rate what you can do with volts protocol is you can deposit cdi as margin which effectively enables you to sell a variable rate into the protocol and in return you are then converting that into a fixed rate asset so you are selling variable and exchanging that for a fixed rate which if we just look at that very simple use case like an interest rate swap market actually opens up a very wide spectrum use cases but if you just look at that really simple one what's really interesting is is for the first time in d5 that has actually removed the silos between fixed and variable rates you have a variable rate asset with a click you convert it into a fixed asset if we look at the other side and again take a really simple use case actually in this instance you're a variable taker you are selling fixed in exchange for variable um the fixed rate of return that you're selling away if you're essentially wanting to go along the variable rate so for example if you believe there's another bull market that can around the corner and the rates on cdi are going to increase you can actually get levered exposure to that variable rate as it increases over time so the idea here is that there are some market participants that desire a fixed rate and they will pay some amount of cost in order to access that risk reduced rate and so if you like lock in four percent you have removed a lot of risk because you've removed the volatility of the fluctuations of the interest rate uh and then there are people who are willing to be paid for taking that risk who are willing to take the variable rates because uh being paid to take the variable rates comes with a higher yield although you just don't know what that yield is because it's variable but you also don't really care because you're willing to take the the variance and the risk and collect what is like a not not a direct payment of a fee but there's a backdoor fee in the sense that you get to charge higher interest rates if you are the one taking the risk of the variance and you are charging people who are de-risking what the the yield is by getting a fixed fee am i on track here yeah kind of vaguely i mean there's there's um there's a bunch of different actors that will exist on the protocol um but it is highest level there are people who are more risk averse and therefore they are willing to sell away variable rate in exchange for fixed there's people who are kind of on that use case more kind of risk loving who are basically able to take advantage of the fact that there are these more risk-averse actors in the market keeping things again high level can we talk about why this market is so big in trad fi like a quadrillion people don't know how to think about the word quadrillion that's a very large number why is it so big in the traditional markets yeah it's really big because it supports such a wide spectrum of use cases um which exists across kind of three main buckets so there's there's risk management there's speculation and then there's also the construction of a whole bunch of different products both for corporates and for retail and actually in traditional finance right like so if you had to go to your normal person on the street and say hey have you heard of an interest rate swap chances are they probably said no but if you go to them and say have you heard of a fixed rate mortgage the chances are they'll probably say yes and what's actually happening is in the background that in traditional finance that bank which is constructing or typically that bank which is constructing that mortgage for consumer they're actually using super low level capital market infrastructure i.e an interest rate swap in order to package up that product um so when we kind of think about this in the context of defy you know if we want these types of products to exist and if we want to increase like this this spectrum of uh kind of utility that defy can provide to people around the world such that defy can become the globe's financial system right we need this this core pillar to exist such that we can start building these products and services can you illustrate what d5 looks before and after a like sophisticated robust interest rate swaps market like what what is the current state of defy and then what is defy going to be once we have all of this interest infrastructure around interest rate swaps built out what changes yeah so there's actually if we look at d5 today there's there's almost a structural problem where d5 is structurally variable and this exists all the way across the stack so if you go right to the bottom of the stack to your kind of proof of state mechanics obviously where kind of vast majority change converging you know on a block by block basis uh due to supply and demand dynamics the rates of emissions which miners are able to generate change right so you have right at the lowest level you have variable rates of return coming out of the ecosystem on top of that you've got protocols uh so if you think of say avi and compound just as examples again supply demand dynamics mean that the rates of return change on a block by block basis and then on top of that if you're a trading firm or you're trying to build products or kind of that you distribute to retail or whatever even if you deploy some sort of market neutral strategy you are doing that on top of an ecosystem that's structurally variable and what interest rate swaps unlock at the most macro level is it enables us to build a system where we have structural stability for those that want it and that it kind of opens up this whole spectrum of different use cases and products and services that can be built which kind of span across different retail use cases as that could be stuff which is on one end of the kind of complexity spectrum stuff that's relatively simple like fixed rate vaults all the way through to actually the other end of the spectrum you can start building for example fixed rate mortgages on chain and there are teams that have reached out to us since we've gone live kind of exploring that as an idea um and then on the corporate side you actually have stuff where you can do stuff around risk management and you can also do stuff around speculation so if we talk to risk management as an example you may have a c5 lending business for example which is kind of promising say fixed rates of return on one side but then a kind of lending out variable rates on the other and actually what they have a balance sheet level when you aggregate that up is they have a rate liability and they have no way of hedging that risk on chain and all of a sudden with volts you can do that which enables them to to be more stable as an entity and therefore start to expand the products and services that they can offer and then on the speculation side what's actually really interesting is you can build because it's a derivative and you can trade rates just like you can speculate with uh kind of like crypto assets um you can actually build a whole bunch of really interesting trading strategies that take advantage of um kind of different rate markets and the way in which those rates are produced and the fact that they kind of at times for example may diverge and you believe they're going to converge and because you can do that and trade that exposure on volts with leverage all of a sudden it's 100 basis points which one percent kind of like change actually if you're doing that with 100x leverage it becomes really attractive um so there's there's a much wider spectrum of use cases which then get opened up off the back of it and crypto has this branding of being this like chaotic volatile unstable wild west and perhaps it's because we don't have some infrastructure like this which really creates like solid foundations for people to make like longer term plants and so if some like big institution with a bunch of capital comes in they need solutions to lock in their interest rates so that they can think in the long term right and like you know the my model for this is that the crypto industry starts extremely degenerate extremely speculative extremely unstable extremely volatile uh but as it grows and grows and grows both in just like amount of capital a number of users but then also like sophistication of financial primitives all of a sudden we come up with tools to turn what is a chaotic unstable place into a orderly uh orderly markets with solid foundations and like the cool thing the cool thing that i'm seeing here with this is that you have two parties one that is the volatile party and one that is the uh the non-volatile the stable party and like the stability can come on the backs of degenerates right like people that are trading with like a thousand x leverage on interest rate uh variants uh and if they are right they get a bunch of money and the the people that are looking for the orderly institutions can ride off of the liquidity of like the degens who are uh taking a bunch of leverage with interest rates uh would you would you how do you like that take is that a good take or what would you change no i think that i think there's definitely parts of that which i like completely agree with i mean it's completely fine for elements of like i have absolutely no issue i think it's amazing that there's parts of d5 that are kind of volatile it's like lots of speculation it's a completely legitimate thing to do with your money but there's also uh if we really want d5 to become the financial system for the whole of the world there's also a whole bunch of other people who don't want that and actually the existence of an interest rate swap market enables d5 to exist for both sides of the market and actually frankly enables those different types of kind of actors with different risk appetites to almost be able to kind of play off the fact that there are different people with different risk appetites and and you can effectively exchange that difference in risk appetite with one another yeah right this is volts seems like it can be a coordination tool between the risky and the risk-averse right it allows the risk-averse to find the uh their other half to balance each other out to create a stable foundation in many ways yes and then what that does off the back of that is it actually unlocks a whole bunch of new products and services which weren't possible until now so um a good question about how volts actually works under the hood like we already have like stable interest rate options like ave has stable interest rates uh in its protocol when you borrow like usdc or die or anything really i think you you can get a variable interest rate and pay a lower fee than what is offered for a stable interest rate so like either you can lock in like a three percent uh usc borrow fee or you can get a variable interest rate which will be something like 2.5 or 2 percent but then there's the chance that that variable interest rate goes up to like five percent or perhaps even down to one percent like but we already have this option in in ave and in notional as well uh and so like other d5 applications already provide the service so what's different about volts yeah i think the key thing is that volts is generalizable so and composable such that you can build a whole bunch of different products and services off the back of it um so and and alongside that the other thing which is extremely different is that it's so capital efficient um so actually when i kind of go back to when archer and i asked my co-founder when he and i were going through a process of just figuring out how on earth you build this this type of market in in d5 uh where the constraints are frankly just fundamentally different uh to say traditional finance if you're trying to look at that as an example um uh the the the kind of two things that we're really optimizing for was number one capital efficiency which is kind of led to a bunch of architectural decisions that we made in the protocol and i guess the headline there is it is around 3 000 times more capital efficient than alternative structures but then the other that we're really solving for is to try and make the protocol as composable as possible which meant that we figured out a mechanic where everything exists on chain such that people can start using volts as a very low level building block to build all these products and services that kind of we feel that it is going to unlock uh through the through the next few years right so ave and his variable or fixed interest rates is like a money market but it only has so it only goes so far in providing like the actual tooling for all yield bearing assets to be able to access both fixed and variable interest rate markets but then also like another big difference is that with leverage right and so you can only you can only arbitrage the differences between variable and fixed interest rate markets on ave to so like it only goes so far because of like the capital intensivity and obvious just not really meant for that volt is specifically meant for arbitraging the differences between variable and fixed interest rates and you are able to do it with leverage uh how does the leverage happen uh how do we get like leveraged interest rate market swaps like where does that key unlock come from yeah so the way that we've built the protocol is is we deliberately split out the amm uh from what we described as the margin engine and the amm what that now does is it would describe it as a virtual amm because it essentially only acts as a pricing oracle where we essentially mint and burn fixed and variable tokens as trading activity takes place and that obviously drives the price and that then acts as a pricing oracle into the margin engine and the margin engine we often describe it as the beating heart of the protocol because it's responsible for defining the leverage that you can take as a trader it deals with settlements it deals with liquidation events it collects fees for lps basically does everything except at the pricing oracle which the virtual amm does and then in terms of like specifically how it creates leverage so if i just walk through a kind of a really simple use case if you've got a pool which has got a one-year term and say a variable taker so you're selling a fixed rate and imagine the price of the fixed is 10 right if i'm doing a hundred of notional a really simple uh kind of model i would assume that i need to deposit 10 of margin right so i've got 110 for a year 10 of margin um and so at in that instance you are already trading with 10x leverage uh but what's actually very naive about that model is it would assume that the variable rate would drop to zero and stay at zero through the entire course of the term which actually when you start to run a whole bunch of modeling around that is it just extremely unlikely to happen so what we have instead is we have a margin engine which computes predictions into the future of what your likely upper and lower bounds are going to be for a rate and then that defines uh kind of within a safety measure it defines the amount of leverage that you can take as a trader which actually in some instances particularly as rates actually start to come down so if you go from 10 to 1 you know you you could theoretically be fully covered and only be depositing one instead of 10 for a year term as rates start to come down it means that actually you're able to take more leverage as a user so so the the actual kind of underlying number associated to the rate is not what matters because it's offset by the fact that you're able to take more leverage and this is where yeah we're definitely taking a peek under the the complexities of of the volts protocol and what really powers the volts protocol to make it different than all the other fixed versus variable interest rates markets can we actually just zoom out and like start from the very beginning about the technical details behind behind volts you talked about how it's a virtual amm uh and like i kind of can wrap my head around that uh but like can we just like go and do uh just a walkthrough of like all the details of the volts protocol under the hood i know you already just did it but like let's start from the beginning and like go through it like step by step to explain the architecture it's actually easier to just explain the different actors first so we've got we've got three different actors you've got liquidity providers you've got fix takers and you've got variable takers if you are providing liquidity we actually borrowed concepts from uni swap v3 uh where we have tick kind of spacing within the amm so as a liquidity provider you choose your tick range that you want to deposit liquidity within and that's essentially the way which you go about doing it um but that requires you for the margin engine and that's like in uniswap v3 that's like uh concentrated liquidity right that's the concept of concentrated liquidity in v3 when you say like providing between two tick ranges this is the same thing but with interest rates rather than asset pricing right exactly and actually if anything what's really interesting is um well not only does that unlock capsule efficiency but actually within a rates market where your rates tend to be mean reversing if anything is actually a better uh kind of use case for the concentrated liquidity mechanic um which i guess to talk to that just very briefly so if you've got diane eath for example where that you know that's quite volatile as a liquidity provider you are having to change your tick ranges relatively regularly in a rates market um where rates have this mean or exhibit this mean reversing behavior actually you can choose your tick range and even if the rates kind of go out for a period of time you can kind of like confidently kind of predict that it's going to come back at which point you might not even need to change your tick range you can just leave your liquidity there for a period of time right yeah i'm just a double down on that uh you're providing liquidity between ether and dye you know some people choose to do this behavior but i don't choose to do this behavior because i think ether is going to like ten thousand dollars and beyond yeah uh and so like i don't want to be providing liquidity there when i when i want and bet on ether going up and up and up and up that same bet doesn't happen with interest rates right like it's it's just ridiculous to to like make a bet that you think the interest rates are going to go from five percent to 10 to 20 to 100 to 1500 that's not how interest rates work they never really get that far away from some certain mean and so liquidity providing inside of a concentrated liquidity model that unit swap v3 unlocked is like more efficient from like a fee taking perspective because when it mean reverts what that means is that it's going back to back inside of a range that you can depend on more than like ether ether's not going back into a range like ether is going to the moon so it is meant to escape the ranges but interest rates are meant to stay inside of certain like ranges and so i just wanted to like double down on that explanation there yeah now that's absolutely i think the the only thing which i'll add to that is obviously in bull and bear markets in a in a real bull market you'll see that the underlying rates on say having a compound do typically go up so you kind of end up at this more a different equilibrium but they still tend to exhibit mean reversing behavior around some sort of equilibrium right right like we're not we're not seeing 10 or 100 x's in interest rates uh and not for very long at the very least no okay so we just we just explained um concentrated liquidity providing with interest rates uh where does this where does the protocol process go from here yes you've got you've got the three actors you've got liquidity providers which obviously provide liquidity through that mechanic and then you've got your fixed and variable takers um it can be it's really important to think about that architecture of your virtual amm and your margin engine because every single actor including liquidity providers you are depositing margin to cover a position and then that is minting fixed and variable tokens which is at your your actual notional that you're trading and that's going into the mm and your notion all that your trading is essentially your margin times your leverage um and and by separating these two out not only does it enable us to to essentially have the ability to to introduce leverage into the rates market but it also enables us to have this mechanic where the virtual amm is just purely functioning as a pricing oracle from the user perspective from the external perspective volts is unit swap v3 for interest rates but it actually it doesn't mimic unispot v3 in every single way in the sense that you aren't not depositing assets it's using the uniswap v3 code as an oracle more than it is an actual exchange is this correct yeah so we we originally when we actually kind of came up with the idea we thought that we could route trade via unit swap v3 and then actually when you start going in and and and kind of really trying to build that um actually there's so so much of that code that basically needs completely refracted for a different market um uh that in the end we actually needed that code to be native to our code base and it and it is essentially only the very low level kind of uh kind of building blocks such as the use of tick ranges that actually ended up going into our code um if i didn't if you remember this we actually had to go through obviously uni swap v3 code is is subject to what's described as a business source license um so you can't just fork it and kind of put it into your code base so instead we had to go through a process with the unisop dao where we asked the unison dao to provide us with essentially a license it's actually described as an additional use grant but it's a license which allows us to have uni swap v3 code in volts protocol code base yeah this is a fun piece of d5 trivia unit swap v3 uh rather than being fully open source it's licensed for a number of years i think something like three to five years or something and that's just mainly to protect the efforts of the unit swap team and the investors eventually it will that that time frame of licensing will definitely just end and it will become open source i don't know i can't remember the years on that it's like three to five or something um but volts protocol wanted once wanted to use unisoft v3 code inside of its application and so it needed to convince the uniswap organization the uniswap dao to allow volts to use the code yeah because the code is licensed and i think volts gave uniswap 1.5 percent of all tokens in order to pay for this license is that is that the correct number one percent one percent yeah but yeah one percent one percent which is just a cool story of just like inter dow relationships uh so like one one org wants to pay another org to use their software uh and so they they just paid them one percent for the for the uh costs of producing unison v3 and now it's integrated inside volts which is actually an interesting business model that i don't think many many people think about unit swap or even open source software that's not fully open sourced yet um but just like kind of a cool side quest of a story between volts and unit swap v3 yeah what was really cool about that is the first ever um like doubted out deal that has taken place in this space we actually expect and we've already seen a bunch of proposals that kind of mimic that um so we expect that to continue but what it what it also does is actually ties the success of the two dows together in many ways um so we've got people coming in from the uni swap dow that are now contributing in different ways to the vaults uh kind of protocol and and to the dow that we're building out um and then alongside that kind of going back to uni swap well like they own one percent of volt's future token so as volts grows that actually has an economic advantage to union swap as well so it's not what's actually really nice there is it's not just the composability of the software you start getting some sort of composability across the two communities as well which is pretty nice yeah the phrase composable communities is something that ryan and i have been like leaning into ever since defy summer uh and like so like while it is like a one percent capital cost from the volts organization from like all the one percent of the capital goes to unit swap it's also kind of investment in unit swap and uniswap's community uh so it's not just like a fixed it's not just like a cost it's not just like a a negative on the balance sheet you also get well you know the unison b3 code but also uniswap talent just by proxy because of how composable these ecosystems are yeah exactly exactly and what it means is that uni swap you know very much the grandfathers of amm design and you know perhaps in version four or whatever like assuming they're kind of working on that type of thing um you know there's opportunities for the ideas that are generated within that ecosystem to really kind of like come through into into the vaults community as well because you have these people that now start to exist across the two ecosystems um which which then just enables uh you know more innovation and and kind of ideation to take place which perhaps is an ecosystem gets us to an even better place as well the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users control your digital footprint with

through the details of the volts protocol under the hood and we kept on finding these side quests can can we do it like one more time where we just like speed run through the three market participants the variable interest rate sellers the variable interest rates buyers and then the liquidity providers yeah sure so so well the way that it works is you have these three participants um liquidity providers provide liquidity within tick ranges that that creates the market from which uh fixed or variable takers can start trading and the way that that works at a kind of a more practical level so imagine you've got a fixed taker who comes in um they're wanting to sell a variable rate in exchange for it fixed um what they can do in the way that that works relative to the liquidity providers is if uh the kind of prices within the liquidity providers tick range fixed taker comes in they initially use the liquidity providers liquidity to execute a trade at which point the lp is effectively the variable taker because they're on the other side but then if a variable taker comes in and has the same amount of notion of the price is at the same point um and they do the trade actually what happens although they use the lp's liquidity initially those two trades then actually net each other off and the liquidity providers kind of liquidity then kind of is released and goes back into the mm to continue to collect fees and that's a process that we describe as margin recycling and then those two positions basically are are sat as essentially it's actually a pool to pull basis rather than peer-to-peer but they're sat in two pools uh which are supporting either side's uh position until the end of the turn this kind of feels like a perpetual swap market as well where like there's a central contract uh and then like and it just or it orients the two sides of the market but i guess that's all kind of how all markets work um yes with a uh margin margin recycling all right sorry go ahead well it's going to say the key one of the key things is that all the pools on vaults have terms um so the pools which are live at the moment they have 60 day terms and and that means at the end of the term everybody settles um but the margin recycling when we're thinking about it coming back to some of the stuff that you're saying before about how like volts is different and how we kind of create this markets actually having fixed and variable rates which are tradable within the same amm such you can transition from one side to the other and back again and what that does from a liquidity provider's perspective where you're able to have this margin recycling mechanic all of that contributes to having a kind of an amm design that is ultimately more capital efficient and removes the silos between fixed and variable rates it's all mathematically connected why fixed at 60 day terms why is is there a future revolts is like infinite terms or like what's the story here yeah so we well so rate markets are still relatively new in d5 so um it kind of opening up pool terms that had kind of kind of a year term and someone's trying to speculate on what's going to happen to the variable rate and seed i over the course of an entire year um it is the you know the cycles that exist are just a bit too unpredictable for someone to kind of reasonably take a view on what's going to happen over that longer period of time so what we did instead actually is we built ourselves a whole bunch of statistical arbitrage kind of models internally we've actually within the vaults labs team we have our own quant team um and we started looking at what type of uh kind of apis can you generate depending on how long the pool terms are and that type of thing and that's where we landed on actually a 60-day term to begin with is a is a sensible length of time which enables you to have a few cycles in rates where they kind of like converge say between a die and c die it will converge for a period of time and then it will kind of come back to get so diverge and then converge which means that you can start building these models that trades that kind of movement with leverage in a in a time period uh that is sufficiently long enough for that to take place but also sufficiently short enough for people to be confident speculating over that period of time so is this 50-day window what's the vision for the um development of different time frames and we're now we're getting into the conversation of the vault's roadmap so we can talk about that next but but first like what what's the roadmap for like opening up further further longer time scales yeah so we i mean we can know it's very the protocol is generalizable actually to the point that not only can we introduce a market on top of any asset with a variable rate of return uh so we so long as we have a rate oracle pulling in the variable rate um we can basically create an asset on top of any asset uh sorry a pool on top of any asset so to begin with we've done that on avi and compound and we've just done that for six to eight terms but we will launch pools on top of uh kind of other assets and one of the ones which been public talking about is lido um kind of in the future as well and then in terms of the actual term it is super straightforward we we kind of felt 60 day was the most sensible thing to start off with but we could very easily introduce 90 180 days even a year long term uh if that's what the market desired but the thing is if you start stitching these 60 today terms onto each other you you can sort of replicate something similar anyway yeah so volts can open up any length of market that it it wants to it just needs to make sure that there's enough liquidity there and so it sounds like the interest in specific time frames will is going to be what determines those time frames like opening up and so since volts is literally in it's like it just got pushed to main that very very recently starting with 60 days and then as volts gets adopted the interest rates markets on d5 grow uh so will the options for time frames inside of volts is this all tracking exactly and because if you were to have say a 60-day term on an a-die pool and a nine-state terminal pool live at the same time actually what you're doing is you're fragmenting liquidity across those two pools um so it's a lot more it's a lot more sensible actually to have kind of shorter duration single pools to begin with and then as the liquidity starts to increase we can start opening up kind of more terms kind of on the same asset we know that stable coin yield uh is huge in d5 of course uh but also we are coming up to the merge so like this is a beautiful moment for volts to be on main net as we as ether goes from proof of work to proof of stake so i definitely want to talk about the future of volts with like east the east stake rate and its relationship as like a financialization of eth financialization layer on eth uh but but first i just want to uh get more of like the volts roadmap what are you guys working on like right now what are you guys working on the next few weeks next few months and then like longer term horizons for the next few years yeah so in terms of right now we're obviously in this alpha state where we've just gone very recently going on to mainnet and what what alpha means at a more practical level is there's a cap on the amount of liquidity that could be provided as an lp per pool um which not only enables us to kind of like test it in a more kind of like kind of safe environment to begin with it then means as trading volumes start to pick up we will start opening up those caps too but then alongside that we're actually working on a bunch of uh different rate oracles uh which pulls in the underlying variable rate on chain uh so the kind of first one which we kind of obviously public in talking about is that we're going to launch lido markets which will enable people to speculate on the rate of return that they expect to occur on state eath and we'll launch that alongside a bunch of other east-based pools so a e c for example which actually also enables people to start arbitraging between those different rates and the way in which the rates are behaving in different kind of protocol designs and there's so much coming online uh in in d5 right now like not there's ave and compound of course there's also rari's fuse pools which can create interest rates uh but then there's also euler finance which is a brand new amm which can also tap into volts so it sounds like any uh any uh market money market like um like ave or compound or euler or or fuse can just hook into volts and they it can take their variable interest rates and volts can turn into stable interest rates so this volt seems like a tool for every amm or every um money market that comes into defy but then also like we have lido's staked eath and rocket pools r eth and we have these two variable interest rates but also coming online is uh the the new coinbase announced one alluvial i think is also a new like liquid staking as a service organization uh obel network is here to like make a bunch of uh competitive staking as a service networks and so perhaps a bunch of uh liquid staking derivatives uh there's also like things like stakewise uh and like all of these things that produce yield and defy and i i make this joke like bankless listeners who tap in uh to bankless all the time will hear me and say this joke all the time uh like crypto is here and has made really three good things like we there's three good things that come out of the crypto world one is non-sovereign store value money and that's bitcoin and ether the second one is yield uh like that's the second big thing that crypto makes uh and then the third one is content which is like the joke but also i think it's true um and but like volts if if you agree with me that like the first use case of crypto's money in the second use case of crypto's yield well volts is turning that whole entire second use case and making it stable and allowing other people to uh to take the the uh the risk and the upside on the volatile side and so as we get into the eth pros merge state where ether yield rates go from like 4.2 up to 7 and beyond but then also goes up further as a function of the heat of the ethereum economy the hotter the ethereum economy is the more varied the more higher the e stake rate goes although i'm sure like volts is just like licking its lips and just like the possibilities here so like how do you guys think about how volts interfaces with the east stake rate over the long term yeah well i mean what's you kind of touched on it there because the protocol is generalizable such that we can create kind of pools on top of any asset with the variable rate of return um all that's required is a rate oracle to be built for all of these different protocols at which point you can start speculating uh kind of on the direction which uh kind of the rates of return on say state teeth is going to go over a period of time but then you also can start arbiting between different protocols um so what what becomes really interesting is as you start getting kind of more competitors to lido um actually you know if they are starting to produce different rates of return you can start arbiting that with leverage by the fact that volts exists uh which is obviously something which you could not do before uh which starts to obviously kind of post merge it starts become kind of really interesting as the dynamic evolves and as there's more competitors which start to exist um uh actually people starting to speculate on that we we see is like a really interesting and big use case for the protocol i want to touch on the very last uh participant in the volts ecosystem before we talk about some candy topics uh i am going to ask uh if there's a token um the liquidity providing uh why why would somebody provide liquidity what do they get out of it and can you also explain um the the cool quirk about volts and liquidity providing which is there is no impermanent loss because we're not trading across assets but instead there's this other thing can you overall just like pitch why somebody might be interested to be a liquidity provider and like the whole like trade-offs that come with being a liquidity provider in volts yeah i mean well the headline is that there's opportunity to generate pretty significant apis um which is both driven off the fact that uh you are depositing within tick ranges so therefore your capital is more capital efficient it's also driven of the fact that actually you are generating fees off your notional but you're only having to deposit margin in order to create that notion within the amm um and then the last thing is actually this this kind of really interesting dynamic where um i say unlike a uni swap v3 pool where you have two assets like say dianeth with the rates market your kind of fixed takers and your variable takers are getting paid in the same kind of underlying asset so if you've got a a pool which is created on top of c die your fixed interest rates are in die and your variable interest rates are also in die which means there's a liquidity provider to actually create either side of the market you only have to deposit one asset which is die and then all of a sudden you do not accept you do not have the concept of impermanent loss it is replaced with other risks um so we have what we describe as funding great risk where just for argument's sake imagine a fixed taker came in and traded with your liquidity but a liquidity sorry a variable taker never came in and then did the opposite side of that trade what would actually happen is your liquidity would be locked into that position supporting the fixed taker until the end of the term um and you're more exposed to that risk if you are depositing within a tight tick range at a place where it kind of like your your tick is outside of the band where you have this mean reversing behavior um so that that's the that's the small quirk which is i guess is different to a permanent loss but if you're depositing it within a tick range where you've got balanced trading activity taking place on either side all that's happening is you support a trade until that corresponding trade nets it out you go through this margin recycling process and you're collecting fees okay so if instead of in permanent loss you're exposed to the risk where if there is a lopsided market as in there are more people on the fixed side of things and not enough people to support this people on the variable side of things that is the that is the new and permanent loss for volts uh uh i kind of didn't totally follow the mechanic on how it works but that imbalance costs you yield costs you fees and like you are the one taking the weight of that imbalance as a liquidity provider in volts yeah that's right there's a there's a chance that that costs you um so if you get end if you end up having a position that's not netted out and if it happens to be for example a fixed taker position and the underlying great market moves against you because on one side it's going to move for you and on the other it's going to move against you so if you don't get netted out and the rates move against you then there's a risk that you are supporting that person's position that traders position but the best way to kind of avoid that is obviously to put put your liquidity within a tick range whether it's balanced trading activity at which point you just have this continuously recycled recycling mechanic uh so simon is there a volts token [Music] well that so so we did the unit swap down to down deal and they received one percent of volts's future tokens so i think it's completely fine to acknowledge that there will be tokens in the future but right now there is there is no faults token okay so there's just like uh their ideas for future tokens uh do you know how that token would be released into the public yes so there's a lot of the design around that and the decisions around that which which honestly have just not been not been a core focus as we've been building the products and getting it live um obviously we want the whole kind of protocol to be transit transitioned to a dow such it becomes a public good which is owned managed by the community i think that's it's incredibly important for the whole ecosystem but exactly how that gets distributed is obviously not decided at this stage what are the parameters that if you had a token uh the token would likely govern over like what are the governing parameters of the volts protocol yeah so there's there's the initiation of new pools um uh there's kind of launching of new markets so say if you wanted to launch a pool on ave instead of compound but then there's also the actual risk parameterization and the setting of things like lp fees which are all things which can be voted on via governance i'm assuming since like we've been talking about uniswap v3 there's so much there's probably also like the concept of a fee switch whether that's like formally built into the protocol from day one or introduced later uh but there will be like perhaps like a fee switch mechanism uh that is similar to uniswap's fee switch mechanism as well exactly so the way that the protocol can generate fees for the treasury is is it well the lps generate fees and the protocol can collect can collect a proportion of lp fees if it chooses to uh that is currently set to zero but obviously it is a governance decision for the future as to whether it's switched on or not okay awesome simon this has been uh really really interesting i've learned a ton who are you guys hiring uh what kind of jobs are you guys looking for or like for people that just want to like join the community what kind of people are you looking for or just like overall what talent are you looking to find in the vaults ecosystem yes we we've been growing pretty aggressively over the beginning of this year like it if i go back to january it's literally just archer and i i'll just be my co-founder um we're now a team of 12 gonna be 14 relatively soon we're obviously always on the lookout for kind of really high quality kind of developer talent we're also looking for a head of growth but then actually within the community itself uh because we're a kind of such a low level building block which unlocks so many new products that could be built in this space and we're constantly getting teams coming through uh who have now that we have this new market which is an interest rate swap market constantly getting teams coming through thinking of new products can be built on top of that which spans from stuff across like swaptions uh through to more simple products like fixed-rate volts even using uh kind of faults as a form of stable coin collateralization which is pretty interesting use case we've got two teams which are doing that at the moment um so if there are teams which i guess ultimately listening to this and thinking oh wow there's this new market that's been created and actually unlocks all of these kind of new opportunities for me as a builder i'm coming to the discord we often set up kind of like one-on-one channels um with that team and the vaults labs team and we really try and help teams through that ideation process at to the point which they can actually go live amazing well simon we will get the link to the discord the twitter and all the other relevant information into the show notes for listeners that want to dive deeper into the volts rabbit hole simon any last comments or anything you want to share that i forgot to ask about before we sign off here i don't think so i think that the main thing which i'd say is that when when we're going through a process of uh kind of figuring out what we felt was the next zero to one innovation required to move the whole sector forwards um you know interest rate swaps they're just a core pillar to any well-functioning financial system so so by us building this we want it to help defy ultimately become the financial system for the whole of the world and in order for that to happen we need now that this low-level piece of infrastructure needs to exist does exist that kind of provides these opportunities for people to start building these new products and services which serve a much wider spectrum of financial needs and that that's frankly that's the one thing which more than anything that's the thing which kind of excites us about the fact that we've now launched amazing yes and once again congratulations on getting to mainnet uh this is well i'm sure it also feels like the end of a very long journey is also just this start of an even longer one so wish the best to you and
