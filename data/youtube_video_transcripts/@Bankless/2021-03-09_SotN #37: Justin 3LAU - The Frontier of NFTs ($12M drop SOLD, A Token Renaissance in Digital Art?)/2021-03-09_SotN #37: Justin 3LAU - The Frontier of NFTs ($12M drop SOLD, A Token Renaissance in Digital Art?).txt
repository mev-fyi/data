[Music] welcome everyone to this fantastic episode we are super excited to bring justin blau who just set a record-setting nft sale if you don't know what nfts are how they can empower creator communities creator economies and disrupt the entire music industry this is the episode to watch david tee up this episode for us yeah justin blau has been experimenting in the world of crypto for years now and one of those experiments landed really really well selling over 12 million dollars in these nft things we get into what that process was like and what these nft things are with justin and i think the biggest takeaway that i got out of this episode was how justin thinks these nft tokens on ethereum represent tools of emotional connection between an artist and their fans and how this feedback loop can be established between these two groups of people the value creators and the value consumers that really just disintermediates a lot of the legacy platforms that we note as the platforms that historically have allowed artists to you know distribute their art but now things are changing because of this new revolution in nfts guys before we bring you this episode want to give a special shout out to the sponsors that made this conversation possible gemini check them out ave monolith and cuenta exchange by synthetic thank you to these sponsors for making this episode possible okay let's get into the conversation with wow all right bankless nation we are here with justin blau more commonly known as the artist blau he just had the largest nft sale in history in human history human recorded history that is he sold 33 nfts in the collection one for more than 3.6 million a total of almost 12 million dollars blah's got a fantastic uh history in crypto he also i found this interesting studied finance in school and now he's bringing some of that experience into his music career i'd call him more than electronic music producer now he's become almost a crypto entrepreneur justin blau welcome to the bankless podcast man we're really excited to have you thanks for having me i've heard such great things i've actually listened to a couple of episodes in the past and it's just an honor to be here dude we we're excited you know what we got to start here because you've made some some history this is nft history and we're just getting set up for for a killer crazy 2021 here before we started recording you were almost like on tech support with a bunch of your friends almost like ethereum tech support guiding them through the process of setting up nfts but you just sold 12 million worth of nfts how momentous is this how does it feel it feels amazing and as someone who's been invested in the distributed ledger tech space since 2014 20 2015 you know 12 million is such a huge number and everyone's going to be attracted to that number but i'm way more excited about the statement that we made to the legacy entertainment world that is really what i'm excited about you know if we had done 1 million 3 million that's cool but the fact that we basically trumped and this is statistically true we basically trumped any single album deal raise from any major label ever um with this sale is pretty incredible and it didn't even have a grant of rights so i think the number one record deal ever was michael jackson and i think it was a 250 million dollar record deal but for many many albums right so the fact that we sold one album only as collectible editions of that album for uh close to 12 million dollars breaks a lot of records in a lot of ways and and to me that's the statement that i was most excited to make not the fact that it was 12 million dollars but the fact that the music industry is ripe for disruption an industry that has taken over 88 of its of its revenue and profit from the artists right artists statistically only receive about 12 percent of all the money generated in the music business this is an insane statistic right and so when i was first introduced to blockchain technology and its potential for just intermediation it was so obvious to me that the industry that i knew and love could could so easily be destroyed um or at least the legacy model of which could be destroyed by this nascent amazing technology and so i started exploring that in in 2017 more deeply but was just genuinely enthralled by this idea of frictionless value transfer and permissionless value transfer 24 7 with the original concept of bitcoin like that to me was unbelievable having studied finance in college i studied economics and derivatives index and equity derivatives like those were my focuses in college and so everything that applies in in the distributed ledger world um you know made a lot of sense for me to think about you know how this technology would apply to to my passion which is music and i i tried to bridge both of my most you know passionate interests over the past six years and it kind of all came together in uh for this for this particular nft auction it was you know people say that he did it in 48 hours when the reality it was maybe more like seven years of studying and four years of execution to get to where we where we were uh last weekend so so yeah that's kind of the back story this is we're going to touch on so many of those themes and it uh it appears it's like david and i as we were taking a look at what you've done in this space that you've just tried a series of of experiments right and you've kind of refined each of those experiments and those evolutions we're going to go through some of that history we also want to talk about the statement that is being made to the existing music industry what that statement is but let's go back to i guess not last weekend but the weekend before during the auction because this was kind of an interesting auction so set the scene for us right so auction starts on thursday this is for 33 or so nft goods uh related to um related to the album the tar it was targeted to end on sunday right uh and but but you had this mechanism in here this is a fascinating mechanism that the during the last three minutes of the auction process the bid would reset uh so uh if someone bid during the last three minutes it would just reset and as i understand it wow this happened like 40 different times toward the end so you're sitting there and i don't know was with it was it was ticking up you'd already raised like a half hours of extra of extra yes so set the scene tell us tell us about that what was that like what did you expect going in what were those final minutes and i guess hours like of this auction process so a little little quick background i i studied uh macro microeconomics and game theory probability analysis in college my professor glenn mcdonald is the reason why he actually let told my parents that i should drop out to pursue a career in music because at the time some of my stuff was going viral on youtube so my economics professor uh had convinced my parents to let me drop out but but i was always a huge kind of math nerd um which which applies to music in the sense that like when i'm programming sounds for electronic music it does require a lot of like background mathematical knowledge programming knowledge and stuff like that i'm not a software developer or engineer whatsoever but but there is some overlap at least in in math and mathematics and music so one of the things that i was noticing in the nft space is that it's actually like most of the sales were economically inefficient and so i wanted to create this little nash equilibrium experiment um applying the knowledge that i have of game theory to my auction where you basically capture everyone's highest willingness to pay for what they receive at different levels of rarity and we assigned a certain rarity to different um songs on my album the most popular it was the more rare it would be and the higher your position in the ranking the more likely it would be for you to get rare assets versus less rare assets so position number 33 likely received all more common assets whereas position number one received all 11 songs and position number two unfortunately um only got seven of the 11 songs but received a majority of them at the highest rarity level and i kind of built a lot of these mechanics on previous uh really historic nft cells i love the rarity mechanic that hash masks and that axes and that you know punks with attributes i was always a fan of like how they created these gamification mechanics and i wanted to apply that through the lens of music with this auction of course none of these tools existed in on an existing nft platform so we had to build it ourselves and uh the risk that that was that kind of followed that was you know i had to bring my audience to my website there wasn't a built-in audience for it for this auction and i was very surprised that we actually had over 2000 registered bidders for the auction we only had a total of a little over 300 bids because i think as the price floor went up a lot of people were a little bit more nervous the price floor after the first day i think was already at five or six grand so some of those registered bidders were unfortunately weeded out of the process but the one thing that we did that was great is that anyone who even just placed a bid received a loyalty nft um so they still got something for free which is great and they didn't get charged um and if you uh actually deposited crypto to bid in the first place and you um and you didn't make it into the top 33. um the origin protocol team actually gave away i think it was 300 ogn or or maybe a thousand og and i don't know exactly what the number was just for your participation in the process so of course we we started out this auction with the with you know there's a vinyl nft um tier one gets to make a one-of-one song with me tier two gets to make a mix with me that would be tokenized and the final tier just gets the music and the actual physical uh vinyl if they choose to redeem their vinyl nft there's a lot of complicated mechanics that are all available on the website we don't we don't need to go into the to the depth of that but what i'm actually most excited about is some of the extras that we're gonna announce um i should have announced last week but i've been so busy that i haven't had a chance so the top 33 collectors um will all be receiving open editions from me in the future for free um anything that we do as an open edition a lot of them will be receiving those um to the wallet address of their choice that we will mint for them for free and the rest of the world of course would have to buy them at market prices we're also allowing the top six collectors to receive an all-access pass to any blouse show of their choice that of course is going to be tradable as an nft in the future so the top six collectors if you guys want um maybe scroll to the top and hit view rankings and i can kind of walk you through what each ranking looks like so bitter65 whose identity is still unknown um but who whom we have email contact with um will be able to make a custom one-of-one song with me and actually provide creative direction for me to create that song that's like kind of their mega prize that they get in position one they also get all 11 song nfts and the platinum vinyl nft uh anyone in tier two will get to um make a tokenized mix with me so they get to kind of tell me songs that they like that i can include in in a mix that i will tokenize for them they also receive seven of the 11 song nfts um and receive that in in rarity accordance with their position um the silver tier receives um a a silver nft that's redeemable for a real vinyl and then they also receive three of the song tokens that are assigned by rarity based on their position and as you can see as we go down the list according to proper nash equilibrium economics um the bottom bids are you know very very close to each other whereas the higher bids start to spread out a bit more and what people don't know yet that we'll be telling them soon is there any airdropped edition that we send them will be addition in their ranking accordingly so uh b1 would receive edition number four of a future blouse open edition that i release and he will receive that into perpetuity so there's gonna be a lot of really cool interesting mechanics and gamification that we add as we go here um the all access passes will be applied from positions one through six so um they'll receive an nft that they can use to get backstage at any blouse show including festivals there are some festivals that like only allow us to get two to four all-access passes and for those festivals you know based on your ranking you get first priority or first right over refusal right so like for ultra music festival we only get so many passes we won't get six and you know bitter 65 or 888 might have a better shot at um you know their first rate of refusal on those passes before zero xb1 right click save and silence so those all x passes will be airdropped to the addresses that hold those those vinyl tokens later um if they trade the vinyl tokens um they won't get access to these open editions or these all access passes in the future right so there is quite an incentive for them to hold on to these vinyl tokens and um finally i'm going to be throwing a private party in la where all three of these collectors will be invited um we will also invite all the other bidders in the auction to this private party but of course the 33 will be on stage with me during the event we plan on doing that in la once the world opens up just to celebrate such an awesome event and to celebrate what changed the music industry for good i'm lucky to be in touch with a lot of these collectors which is really really nice um i'm in close touch with whale shark he's been a supporter of mine for a long time i've been chatting with 888 i've been chatting with um as we can go down the list i don't know right click save or silence or master seed but illustrator is a very close friend of mine an illustrator actually built this auction mechanic into a smart contract on chain and we're probably going to name it the blow auction so it's basically just a game theory influenced nash equilibrium style auction where the top x the top end number of bids receives something in different tiers of rarity um ito is i'm also in touch with ito on twitter who is the man and he's been so supportive of the space and helping new artists uh seed phrase danny is also an incredible dude like a lot i think flexible i've been in touch with on twitter jay han is an amazing art collector who has a robust you know a robust collection of real art in hong kong uh ben is someone who i befriended recently just after the you know around the time of the auction and you know all these people are going to have a direct line to me like they'll have my phone number and forever they are they are forever my family because they help me change history and uh we're just really excited that you know this was so successful and we took a big risk doing it off platform but uh we did it also shout out to pablo and gabby and ari steinberg who's my childhood friend i can't believe that my childhood friend uh ended up he was the only uh credit card bid at the end which is really funny he was he was the only character this is so cool and i think the why this is so fantastically cool is exemplified and where you you just ended that where you said like all of these people have a direct line to me the the creator or the the bitter number one they get to collaborate with me and direct my art my creations and also you know all these people because of the direct connection that they have between their ethereum address and the auction right and and so there's two through lines here that i see here that are really really fantastic one is that your biggest and best fans have a way of expressing their biggest and bestness fans right all of a sudden there is something that differentiates um a listener on spotify who is your biggest and best fan versus a listener on spotify who stumbled across one of your songs on like the radio mechanism so that differentiation is so so cool and then the other differentiation that i see is that you actually see these people you know their names you actually can get in contact with the quote unquote listeners or your fans which you can't really do you like if i i was listening to your music yesterday but you would have no way of engaging with me through spotify or through any other streaming platform and so this this both of these things together seems to be so incredibly powerful a hundred percent so this is the most important aspect of nfts for any artist is the fact that social platforms and centralized platforms have been rehypothecating the data that i generate for the past decade what i mean by that is the same way a bank rehypothecates its reserve funds or or the funds that it's not required to keep on reserve these centralized platforms of entertainment rehypothecate the data that we don't even own as creators and sell that data to advertising agencies and at different rates it's super wrong right so the number one use case for nfts aside from monetization is actually data i've generated over a billion streams across youtube apple music and spotify i have no idea who those listeners are same thing with tickets i've sold you know millions of tickets over the past decade i don't know who any of those people are i have zero data on any of those people the only time i get data is if a fan purchases merchandise which is is is you know a select few number of fans for them to collect a digital asset that has you know off-chain functionality is is interesting in and of itself and so you know the way i see the future of nfts is as both tickets as access passes as unlockable for exclusive content you know we're building a web3 wallet that if you just sign a signature on metamask or portis which i'm a huge fan of and we can talk about portus in a second um if you just sign a message you'll be able to access content on the on on my website and you'll be able to listen to a bunch of unreleased music just by owning an nft and only you will be able to do that now people are like well theoretically couldn't you just rip the music yes but why would someone who spent 60 thousand dollars be incentivized to ripping the music and sharing it with other people i don't think so um you know and if they choose to then that's their choice right and so there's there's really an incredible opportunity that i've been thinking about for four years in in bridging the gap between fan and artist and there are very few ways to do that when there's a centralized intermediary in between and you know what we did with with origin protocol it's a centralized backend you know centralized wallet back end because we wanted to accept credit cards we wanted to keep it simple for fans but my opinion is that fans will gradually start to move to a decentralized ecosystem as they discover its merits and as they discover its benefits but there's been this huge disconnect in the history of you know blockchain tech which since 2008 since the bitcoin white paper obviously cryptography predates that but you know since the bitcoin white paper there's always been this disconnect between the mainstream and and cryptocurrencies because of austrian economics because the idea of dollars and cents is the only thing we've ever known when it comes to money but when you bring nfts into the picture you create something that's a little bit more tangible than owning point zero zero zero one bitcoin for someone right like they don't understand that because it's just not something they've been trained in but they do understand what it means to collect their favorite images they do understand what it means to collect their favorite music because people used to collect vinyl records back in the day and if the record store sold out of the vinyl they would trade for crazy numbers in the aftermarket right um elenium is a good artist friend of mine who's going to be doing a drop very soon of his own that i'm that i'm helping coach him on um some of his vinyls from his first album are trade for two to three thousand dollars on ebay because he only did a limited run of them so this idea of collecting and this idea of digitally native art is certainly not new the idea of virtual goods is not new it's just that now we have a ledger to prove provenance and ownership that is transparent and immutable and this is one thousand percent where the entire world is going to go we have gas costs as a problem we have challenges and barriers that we need to overcome but with the you know with matic and other l2 technologies optimism with with you know other blockchains that are are now pursuing nfts in in a huge way with cross-chain technology and cross-chain transfers that you know that i think will be a really essential essential part of the ecosystem in the future we're starting to see a world where this stuff can exist in a way that consumers understand we're finally getting there and when we do consumers and and people who consume entertainment will realize that everything they've known in the past is just not right it's already happening i have my fans are figuring it out they're saying to themselves huh i want to support my favorite artists in a decentralized way in a direct way because they'll see more benefit from it artists care about or fans care about the artists that they listen to i have a very deep relationship with the musicians the music that i listen to it's a relationship that's more than a third of a cent on spotify it's value that's been emotionally almost impossible to capture in history and now you've been you've created this mechanism to capture that value and that's why we're really only seeing the beginning of this market i mean my favorite statistic is two quick things and then i'll let you guys ask some more questions um before january of 2021 the nft sales market was about 160 million in volume so like from 2008 the beginning of bitcoin to january 2021 there was 160 million of sales volume in february alone we topped 300 million it's exponential the traditional art market market does about 65 million per year the traditional music record sales market does about 40 million per year what do you think the size is of this thing it's it's in the hundreds of billions hundreds of billions and yet cryptocurrency as a whole we as the total market cap is just barely over 1 trillion right i don't know what it is today 1.5 1.3 something like that one point one or two yeah one or two okay so if you think about how big the market is for content oh my god it's massive so so here's the next thing people are like well when is this bubble gonna burst these prices are ridiculous like how can every how is there space for everyone how is there space for everyone on instagram how many musicians do you know that can't make money how many photographers do you know that can't make money how many performers do you know that don't get paid it's the same as anything else like there will be they still create yet they still create there will be those who rise to the top and those who maybe make some memes and try to sell them for some money so just like anything else there will be value ascribed to the leaders and there might not be as much value ascribed to some newcomers that being said we've lowered the barrier to entry to an insane you know low level where i know this this um young girl named aaron who's 14 years old who makes ai fashion designs who sold you know 20 000 worth of her art and she's 14. i also know this kid justin who's 16 years old who's done 75 000 of his art sales just because his  is awesome and i want to put it on the screen back there i have screens all over my house these aren't turned on because i'm actually doing a firmware update um but but i think all this stuff is really important and and finally you know one other thing i want to mention that i'd love to you know have you guys asked me to ask some more questions is for those of you who don't understand nfts or are looking to explore it i'd like to give this example um the mona lisa is a priceless piece of art but did you know that you can buy an exact replica on amazon for fifty three dollars i assumed yes do you want that 53 replica from amazon no i do not would you want the real one well no no i mean like if someone said to you right not at cost of course assuming you had infinite money would you want the 53 one versus real one right so there we go the reality is and the same goes for charizard like do you want a real holographic charizard or do you want to hire a company to print you a fake one like no one wants a 50 cent fake holographic charizard but it looks exactly the same so who's to say that there's not emotional value ascribed to something being authentic there is it's existed in so many other areas of the world in the physical world it's even existed in the digital world in gaming and with the instagram verification check mark this idea of digital scarcity is not new it's just the first time we're seeing it applied to art and the possibilities are limitless with that i'll end my rant hey guys i know it's annoying but i gotta stop the video there is so much left in this conversation so don't go anywhere justin takes us through all the various intermediaries that restricts his access between him and his fans and his audience and he goes through and talks about each one about the merits of each one as an intermediary and evaluates them based on how much value they extract versus how much value they give back to the artist and then we talk about how this tool of the focal point of a token between a fan a fan base and blau or a content creator how this token can be the connection point that really disintermediates some of these legacy institutions it was really interesting and i really enjoyed blouse perspective don't go anywhere we got to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main

go bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com this is so cool but look justin you've just unpacked so much for us to get into some more um you know we'll get back to this phrase i think authenticity i want to talk about the music industry because when when we were in the intro you said look 12 million dollar nft sale this is a statement to the music industry right a statement to the music industry i don't think i realize until you said what you just said how disconnected artists are music artists are from their fan base and how disconnected the fan base is from the musicians themselves i don't know that i was fully aware of that you were talking about these 33 bidders you were talking about all of the additional things that you were planning to provide them right so it's this new bridge this new uh you know connectivity layer but i guess like when we go through the history of of the music industry there was a time when record labels kind of dominated right and then then came napster then came you know uh spotify then came youtube but that whole layer right now this but that whole like web 2 layer just uh became a set of rent-seeking intermediaries and still created this this this bridge this chasm between between creator and and fan right so web 2 and everything that the internet has it provided a lot of distribution for musicians working for creators work but it installed a new set of uh technical middlemen essentially whereas with this this is like direct to consumer right exactly it's direct to consumer and it's going the tools are still very primitive we need to develop we need to develop more tools that make it easier for fans to interact with this stuff but it but it's but it's coming right like we've all known this moment was coming it was just a matter of time and that's why i've remained independent my whole career waiting for this moment i wanted to own my rights i didn't want someone else to own them so what's the statement that this is making to the music industry and maybe it's not just the music industry maybe it's like the spotifys and the pandoras and all the rent seeking intermediaries it's making a statement too the statement and and spotify actually is not you know there are different levels of bad guys who are into intermediaries and i would love to walk through that with you and then i'd love to walk you know what let's walk through you know who who are the bad guys and why what statement this makes to the bad guys and then where i really see this going which we haven't even talked about yet um which is what i'm really excited about as it applies to me so let's talk about agencies and managers first they are the least bad guys um i know that sounds crazy people are like why do you need an agency artists shouldn't negotiate on their own behalf no one should um an artist is meant to have a emotional relationship with fans and with their audiences and managers and agents actually serve a really important role in guiding a young new artist to success um i would not have been able to accomplish what i accomplished without my management team they flew in from new york and from one was in new york and one was in new mexico the day after the la it happened they flew to vegas and we were doing team meetings all week just like how to do how do we deal with the next steps and if i didn't have that support system there's no way i could have accomplished what we accomplished and i think managers are the least rent seeking even though they do take commission their commission is well earned because they provide a team it's almost like if you think about the first four hires at a startup like your first four employees are your team they get equity in the company right and that they are incentivized to be on your side of success and the same applies for management like management is incentivized they receive commission but that is their incentivization to you know represent the artist to everyone else in the world who wants to talk to the artist and it's so important and i actually think there's going to be a whole new wave of digital artists that that don't have management and i actually think digital artists need management because they're going to have to deal with taxes they have to deal with business management they're going to and like an artist should just be an artist right an artist shouldn't have to worry about all those things so in in the levels of rent seeking middlemen managers are the least um culprits uh you know of of of the existing system i think they will always need to exist and i think they're the most important variable and i think that digital artists will need managers to represent them in negotiation and to represent their you know finances and for for an artist to maintain that creative clarity like i need my management team in fact one of my managers i had to fly back to new mexico to get a vaccine shot and she's actually coming back today like just to be here all week with me guiding me through all these opportunities and helping filter what's important and what isn't so managers are super important if you're a digital artist that's listening to this find a great manager you will need them because otherwise you will be flailing in the wind as you try to journey through this insane world and i'm actually um you know i i'm working on more specifically joining a management team that is focused on low commission structure very reasonable commission structure to provide many services for new digital artists because i think they need those services desperately i mean fionacious is um 18 and has made millions of dollars and like has to understand how to pay taxes and i'm very glad that they found a great manager and my manager's name is andrew but felix has found uh is now working with shawn mendes manager um another andrew who is going to guide them on you know all the complicated stuff that an artist shouldn't have to think about so management agents agents typically negotiate deals outside of the scope of like the internal day-to-day of an artist so my management team only negotiates deals on my behalf that are like music related and brand related but my agency represents me to the world of live music and my agent found me when i was 19 years old in nashville and i've been with the same agent to this day hunter williams he was he had his own private agency and then you know caa actually purchased that private agency and so he became a member of caa and he and i have worked together for 10 years and he's one of my best friends and he commissions me at a very reasonable rate but adds so much value to my career so agents i i also think as long as they are acting in the best interest of their clients there's a lot of value to having maybe not for a digital artist to have an agent um like someone who's just making visuals i think they probably only need a manager but for a musician my agent represents me to the entire world from a live performance standpoint and is able to negotiate those deals help me with production of the show the staging the performance it's hard for a creative to conquer all those things so agencies are typically heavily criticized but when the commission is reasonable they shouldn't be they add a lot of value let's keep going down the list of who doesn't add value record labels record labels are well actually before we get to record labels we'll go to spotify um spotify facebook instagram are actually at the middle of the list because while they rehypothecate data and you know basically monetize content without the artist you know really seeing much benefit they have improved an artist's payouts to an extent so youtube has increased my revenue substantially because when people use a song on youtube i do get a royalty for that and without youtube i wouldn't even be able to monetize my music in that way so they do pay out royalties spotify the same because i own over 80 of my master recording rights um prior to the world of spotify no one was buying music they were stealing it now they pay 999 a month to get access to all of it it's actually better so my revenue growth in 2015 my revenue in 2015 for music was like 10 grand in last year was maybe 500 000. so that's only because though i own my own masters right when you own your own music the payouts from these streaming platforms are actually significant but their mistake is they don't share the data right so while they've improved the actual monetization of content um they kind of steal the data which is something that i'm not a fan of and maybe there's a platform like audience who i'm an advisor to that you know provides that data to artists and i think that those services are going to grow in popularity and artists are going to gravitate towards those platforms because artists should control their own markets in their own data so and that's what allows you to communicate with your fans that data is that missing link exactly like i can't communicate with my spotify listeners but i can communicate with my audience listeners at le at least in the future i won't be able to just messaging right like even being able to send everyone a message that's not filtered by an algorithm is really powerful let alone like being able to talk to them on a discord server right so i would say managers agents platforms worst actors record labels absolute worst not indie record labels there are some indie record labels that cut very fair deals that provide immense value to artists that otherwise like don't have the capital to even get started but traditionally record labels really only provide two resources liquidity for someone to pursue their dream right capital and distribution because they have a marketing arm they have a team they can get the music out there in 2021 you don't really need any of those things your distribution is the internet your capital can be raised from your fans and we'll get there in a second that's what i'm quite excited about um so there are some record labels like monstercat mike darlington is a really good friend of mine like they do right they cut fair deals they help artists that have little to no following who have good music they help them get started they're an incubator they're like yc like imagine a record label as a yc like that's cool right that makes sense but the major labels that take that give these advances that are recupable against royalties so regular label will say here's a million dollars we're taking 80 of your music and by the way after we we don't pay you until our million dollar loan is recouped and then we get 80 of everything after that who the would cut that deal i wouldn't it's crazy but artists have been trained to do it because otherwise they don't get the distribution come on that has that has to end and it's going to end i'm telling you and that's what i wanted to prove so spotify still has a place in the world instagram facebook they will always have a place in the world centralized platforms are necessary but the record labels the ones that are predatory they're we're coming for them and my next ex thing that i'm excited about is enabling fans to actually fund music to invest in music to invest in master recording rights so imagine a record deal but with your own fans where they can participate in the upside of the music now that's a security it's a security but who's to say that if it's done compliantly that can't happen in the next six months and that's the project that i'm most excited about to let fans invest in my album and get a what what we would call an snft a non-fundable security token but labeled as an snft where it represents their contribution their financial contribution to the album and accrues royalties it just has to be compliant it's not that hard to make a compliant reg cf reg d reg s non-transferable for a year having you know and after it is transferable having a compliant platform that collects kyc aml you know like this stuff is not hard it's just expensive to execute the legal fees are insane to execute all the paperwork to be compliant so my goal after showing how these collectibles work creating value in art is actually to give participants you know an equity stake in the ip of my art and that is where this is going this is just step one and this has been my dream like for 10 years but then when when i learned about distributed ledger tech it gave me the idea of like okay my dream for 10 years has been how do i go direct a fan and give them a stake in what i do blockchain technology is like oh this is the way to do it five years later we do it and the next 10 years of my life are gonna be dedicated to figuring out how to create products for artists that don't require high legal costs that are totally regulated regulatory compliant that enable them to raise capital from fans instead of a record label and reward fans for investing in their creativity early on and that is my vision for the future and now i can shut up okay so there's there's so much to talk about and i i want to talk about and everything at the end of the day goes back to the power behind tokens and what tokens offer and tokens for can offer anything to anyone so long as you can code such a thing and for what we are seeing with fan with uh you know creatives like you uh digital artists musicians they are using the power of tokens specifically the erc 721 standard to produce an nft that all of a sudden those fans really want but what you're talking about after we went down the list of uh middlemen who do or do not add value or are on some spectrum of uh costing costing and then returning value to the uh what is ultimately the value of the creator what you're saying is that the record labels are the the worst ratio of value returned versus value extorted or value captured no and not all record labels not all record labels just right right like there are record labels that do add immense value there's no doubt right um but there are also the big guys that you know it took two and i don't even give like at this point in my life i have a lot of friends that work at universal music that are good people but  universal music right as a whole as a whole right like there are people that are good people that work for these legacy companies and i don't want to tarnish their names because they're great and they're doing great things and they a lot of them believe in this they'll probably jump ship at some point but the fact that it takes three years to pay someone i mean come on right like it's it's just wrong wow we feel the same way about banks [Laughter] me too i mean quick story i have to send a wire for a real estate investment with bank of america five years ago right around the time that i was introduced to bitcoin a little bit after and because someone didn't have high enough authorization at the branch it took a week to send this big financial wire but it's my money why should it take a week it makes no sense right so bankless david you're muted thank you so i want to go back to what we were talking earlier about nfts as a way for you know direct creator to fan engagement and how and the powers that go with it but that it's that investable layer where you're talking about with a security nft a security token which this the the conversation of securities has totally plagued the crypto industry but that's also largely because the products that these security tokens represented were also just terrible products and that's completely different when we start talking about music and art because it's the the product is much more legitimate but i think the cool thing about a security token nft is is we are establishing the meaning the emotional relationship between artist and consumer but with a security token nft we are turning that into a loop where the artist creates the value the fans consume that value but the fans can also create more value by describing a secondary market value to that security token nft and so all of a sudden your fans go from a consumer to a producer because your fans are like well i just bought into the security token nft which represents future cash flows of a blau album and i think blau is the hottest  on the world and his music is going to dominate and i think he's under-appreciated so i'm going to purchase his security token nft because i want that cash flow because i do believe there's upside and then i'm going to go and shout from the rooftops yo everyone go listen to this music and that this feedback loop of incentive mechanisms because of the power of tokens i think has a lot of dormant power under it can you talk about that i mean everything you just said you just described my vision completely and by the way this can be done with fungible tokens too like fungible tokens can represent shares in something or it can be done at like the actual technical backend can be done in a couple ways you have a fungible token that's limited that there's no inflation on that represents a share of ip that's like a simple way to do it but what i like about the security nft is it helps you tier loyalty of fans so let's say i want to raise a million dollars for my next album you get a certain type of nft if you make a hundred thousand plus contribution and that nft has other functionality outside of just the cash flows that exist and it can also be traded um so let's say you spend a hundred thousand dollars you get like the platinum nft for my next album right maybe that also gets you backstage access and all these other things and also entitles you to cash flows pro rata based on your investment so that's one way to look at it the other way to look at it is you just own a number of fundable tokens that represent like that are like more like a dow token right that that's wrapped in you know one nft that represents the whole album like there's lots of ways to structure it from a uh financial engineering standpoint we particularly like this idea of an of an snft because it makes more sense to consumers than fungible tokens like this idea of having point zero zero zero zero one of something is really complex to people and so just having one thing that that is tangible to me is just an easier way like you can do it both ways do with a fungible token or a non-fungible token but having something that says you contributed a hundred thousand dollars that that nft has that metadata and thus accrues royalties because of that the metadata in that entity that represents your pro rata share like that to me is just easier for a fan to understand than a fundable token right um and so then they can get access to a discord server because they got the platinum one because they contributed over a hundred thousand now someone might have contributed 130 000 they still have the same style security nft but the metadata shows that they get a larger pro rata share of the royalties right so each snft would theoretically have like other metadata associated with it that represents the share of the total um investment that fans have made so this is just like it can be done in a lot of ways like the idea of an nft representing 100 of the rights of the song and then wrapping that in a dow token is interesting like a dow record label is interesting there's so many interesting things the issue is regulatory law regulatory compliance if i were to do that on my own compliantly there's infinite possibilities of how it can happen on the back end the issue is less like the technical back end and more like how do we make that make sense of this to fans that's like that's my number one goal because in the in the history of crypto which is still you know what only what is it 14 years now the history of crypto we have not seen this kind of mass market movement to the decentralized world to the decentralized ecosystem and so we have a responsibility now as people who have believed in this stuff for a while to build the tools that make it easier for people to use and guess what some of those tools are going to be centralized the way coinbase is necessary and that's okay we need an on-ramp to transition people from the fiat world to this new world it can't just like can't just expect everyone to like believe in this like every all of us have to buy bitcoin at some point or accept bitcoin as payment at some point we have to do that conversion and so we can't ignore that that conversion needs to exist right i don't think there's an alternative so we need to kind of balance our heavy focus on decentralization with the centralized world to find that bridge and i think nfts are that bridge i'm excited to be an active participant in that ecosystem yeah so okay so it's super cool right so um one thing that you said earlier is basically the record labels are the ones who traditionally provided capital but now in this new crypto world you can get capital directly for your fans so like the record labor they're done right this is totally disintermediates them but i want to get back to some of the subtlety of what you're saying right so um basically if i'm a super fan and i love blau right and i want access to his materials i wanna access to his collectibles but i also want upside into the things that you're doing in the future justin right i can buy a collectible and erc 721 a nifty and kind of get that upside right so it's similar to a beeple piece of artwork um in the early stages of people before he makes it totally mainstream his art might be worth less than in later stages after he becomes like the you know the new mona lisa essentially so you can i'm never selling my people i'll tell you that never sell your people right hold f hold for life 969 could have gotten 170 no so here's what's weird to me is is existing regulatory and security law right so it's fine to for anybody in the u.s to buy a collectible and then to resell that anybody can do it i could do it you could do it my kids could do it totally legal right but where somehow things get weird in the u.s with securities laws is if it has a cash flow attached to it then it becomes this thing called the security and then we have all of these specific laws where you have to be an accredited investor so you have to have a million dollars net worth or you have to have a certain amount in in salary per year in in order to even invest in this thing right and people complain about wealth inequality yet yes that's like the most i mean they've changed you know reg cf from 1 million to 5 million and most people probably shouldn't be raising more than 5 million for their creativity i probably don't think so i do think that that change in rex cf should be helpful um but accreditation laws are literally the reason why the wealth gap is so large more than taxation more than any other reason the opportunities are not provided to lesser you know lower class individuals who they're stuck because they don't even see the investment opportunity so for me the two most important things to change to create a better wealth balance in the world number one accreditation laws are  dumb and need to go away completely although although there needs to be a line right like we we need to then educate the masses on financial literacy and the fact that primary education in the united states doesn't have a focus on financial literacy is insane why should we learn about the boston tea party when kids don't even know what compound interest is let's just be  real like insane it's insane that we don't teach younger generations about how to pay their taxes but we teach them about a historical event you know decades centuries ago like what the right a more financially literate population will invest with financial literacy and with an educated mindset not always in a speculative mindset and thus create more value because they give new entrepreneurs the opportunity to create tools to create more value and it creates this positive feedback loop so why not give the public more i i envision a world where i've got two choices i've got starbucks and in las vegas i have mad house coffee shop privately owned open 24 hours i go to mad house it's an extra five minutes away i love the coffee it's better i want to check out with my coffee and invest a dollar every day add a dollar to invest in that company in that local business why can't i do that i should be able to do that right like it's so obvious so that's where well that's where crypto comes in right um the legacy payments world of visa and like sending wires and all this it's so inefficient if i have a little digital wallet i check out do you want to invest in how much do you want to invest if was your experience great click a freaking button you can look up the agreement later on what you're actually signing how much shares you're getting what the valuation is right you should be able to see those things but we need to teach the next generation to look at those things people people need that kind of financial literacy to continue to create value in our universe and we saw it happen in tech right the tech boom i mean changed our lives in an insane way just the fact that clubhouse exists the fact that we can zoom and have a conversation across the world you know the same thing will apply to investing in all other types of companies but we don't want that investment to be you know exclusive to the already rich we want that to be available to the mainstream and robin hood is taking you know take has there's some problems with robin hood but it is taking steps in the right direction enabling access would you believe that there is a connection between the disintermediation of things and then the people becoming more educated because that means the disintermediation means that then the powers back into the hands of the users and therefore the responsibility is back in the hands of the users and that just kind of promotes learning and engagement all right guys one last break in the action we've saved the best parts of the interview for last we bring up the conversation of art synthesis when so many different artists are so good at their specific type of cultural creation type of art blau for instance is a musician but there are other types of artists that are doing different things 3d rendering 3d art we bring up the conversation of what's it like to collaborate not just with other musicians but with other artists of different skills and where the future of art is going when we integrate all of these different things into some sort of digital expression medium that we are seeing in nfts i think it's the probably the best part of the conversation don't go anywhere we got to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted it's really a fantastic tool that lets you use ethereum for what it does best which is holding and managing your financial assets but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of device so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to and your deposited

legacy and the crypto worlds because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on unit swap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips but with monolith so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop go to monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa card synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.org where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics justin i i want to turn to uh turn the conversation back to nfts and specifically the art side of nfts and this is a a theory that i have on nfts specifically the the revolution in art that they offer and in in uh just just the music world people will get hyped on a collaboration between like their two favorite artists oh like uh you know rac and blau doing a collab together but rac and blau are both musicians right and so you guys are taking turns or or like if it's a rapper you guys are taking turns rapping or taking turns making music or whatever but in this new nft world what i'm seeing is possible collaboration between different artists in their expertise and so we have blou the musician paired with people the digital artists well i'm sorry climb is is my partner in crime yeah that yeah so talk about how like this new revolution in digital art can be not not just two people of the same medium but different media but different artists of different mediums coming together to create something new talk about that 100 and this is a great place to end the conversation as well um art is always about experience and as an artist i create an audio experience for people but experience is broke broken down by the senses it's visual it's scent it's smell it's touch it's all these things it's 3d right art has been kind of homogenized in different lanes you have visual art you have music right you have live performance there's no reason why more experiment more experiential worlds can exist when you combine all art forms it's like so obvious right but it just hasn't been done that much so when you combine visual art and audio you get a deeper experience than just seeing one or listening to the other and that is so powerful in itself that's why slime sunday night we have our next drop on nifty gateway um coming up this friday and it's all unreleased music from me and unreleased visual content from mike he actually has been working on a music video for this drop since last november so there's a full-length music video when you start combining that with the physical world and you create real world experiences that makes that mix visuals and audio now you're adding another dimension of both touch and aura and the future of that is just so insane i mean that's why i love experiences like edc you know you just get this like hyperdrive of sense and and you get this appeal to all of your senses and one of the best conversations i've had um in the past week there's been a lot of celebrities that have reached out that want to do this but i'll tell you the best combo i've had was with pascal rotella the creator of insomniac events and he was like i don't want to rush this i'm not looking for the cash grab not he didn't say i'm not looking for the cash company i don't care about the money i want to reward the fans that have been buying tickets to my for the past 10 years how do i get them a free nft and what can that nft do like these are the questions that pascal is asking me and i'm like dude you are thinking about this the right way at your festival you can create a scavenger hunt let's say you go to see an art exhibit you can get a proof of memory from that art exhibit right you can get proof of memory of a set that you watch by scanning a qr code it goes right to your wallet like there's an infinite number of possibilities that exist when you bridge the live experiential world with the digital world and that call with pascal was my favorite of all because edc has a special place in my heart it was like what what i've obviously played four times we'll be playing a fifth when it happens this year if it happens this year or next bridging those worlds and creating experiences that are like the most memorable for people the experiences they remember when they die and have having more than just a photo of that experience having something that explores more dimensions than just a photo or a video is is so powerful and i i think that's like from the art standpoint where we will see this thing going just hyper experiential digital art that explores all mediums not just one um and i'm just excited for it guys thank you so much for having me i hope i answered most of the questions and uh you know let's definitely do this again it's been a blast blau thank you so much uh we we appreciate it super excited to see what you're dropping next any uh any hints on what's next for you here yeah so we've got nifty gateway on this coming friday march 12th um slime sunday and i did a complete music video and we also have three open edition pieces that are visualizers that he designed with full length unreleased music that i've been working on for four months we've literally been working on this for four months and we actually thought that the album drop was gonna be like the the warm-up for for this one so it's gonna be tough but uh this one has taken us a lot of time we're really excited about it i'm happy to share give you guys a little uh sneak peek in the chat of uh what's coming out uh and uh it's gonna be gonna be dropping this this friday uh with our alias our alias is called uh ssx blough it's just slime sunday times plow and uh i think you guys will enjoy the assets and uh i think everyone else will will be taken into a different world with some of this content we spent a lot of time on it so wow this this link that you're sending can we share this with uh with the audience no not yet privately okay bankless nation we'll have to keep it private for now but that this is coming uh and the artists are coming to this space it sounds like wow is there going to be a stampede of new creators and artists coming to the nft space as a result of what's going on here you heard it first but rob gronkowski who's a good friend of mine is launching his first nfts tomorrow on openc i'm really excited to be helping him with that um halsey's gonna be doing some really cool stuff millennium's gonna be doing some really cool stuff i know calvin harris is gonna be doing cool like everyone everyone and i haven't signed any ndas so no one can punish me but uh everyone everyone is coming and it's up to the community to decide what feels authentic and what doesn't and there's going to be a lot of inauthentic let's just be real but there are also a lot of people like disclosure who made a song on twitch and tokenized it to zora right after he made it for his fans i mean there's infinite possibilities here and i'm just excited for the artists to explore new creative mediums wow thanks so much this has been awesome bankless nation of course uh risks and disclaimers everything we talked about can be risky eath is risky crypto is risky so is defy nfts can be speculative assets as well you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless podcast thanks so much thank you guys we
