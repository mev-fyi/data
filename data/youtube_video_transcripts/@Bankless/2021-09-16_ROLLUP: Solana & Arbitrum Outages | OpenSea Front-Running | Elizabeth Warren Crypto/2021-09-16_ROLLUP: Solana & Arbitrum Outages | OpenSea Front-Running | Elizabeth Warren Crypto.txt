[Music] hey bankless nation happy third week of september it's roll-up time david this roll-up's coming a day early you are off on a trip somewhere we're releasing this on thursday instead of friday so you guys get a jump start to your roll up this week david where you headed uh first to denver for mcon coming in a day late but gonna have a fun time hanging out with our all the people at meta cartel and also all the denver homies uh denver home of eath denver always feels like home for talking to all the defy crypto ethereum bros and then after that going over to maine in new york for a whole another week at missouri main net which is also going to be fantastic new york has a fantastic crypto scene uh and i'm there for a whole week pleaser dow is throwing a dog dog party uh there's gonna be a bunch of parties as well so i'm looking forward to it yeah i got my bags already packed as soon as i'm done recording this i'm off to the airport that's awesome man well enjoy yourself i'm glad uh you know you're getting out there i i'll be holding the holding the home front i know you will [Laughter] that's how we roll all right um guys this is an episode where we take you through markets releases news takes what you're excited about we end with the meme of the week so make sure you stay tuned to the end david i think there are two major hot subjects this week what are they yeah we got a tale of two outages both solana and arbitrum went down actually i think within like the same few hours of each other and also at the same time ethereum also had an unsuccessful attack and so this weekly rollup is going to be a lesson in distributed network consensus and uptime and why uh some things uh should not be tinkered with uh in addition to that there's an open c employee front running the customers so there's a lot of drama there and then of course elizabeth warren has some hot takes which i think are hilarious i think which will come towards the end of the show she's making a lot of the roll-ups lately i think she's saying washington well-deserved elizabeth warren you were definitely saying things were uh worth talking about at the very least yeah all right guys uh we are gonna get into the markets let's start there david what's bitcoin showing us this week bitcoin started the week at forty six thousand five hundred dollars fell down to the low low price of forty four thousand dollars and is currently at the high high price of forty eight thousand two hundred and fifty dollars eyeing that fifty thousand dollar bitcoin level not quite there yet but looking real strong what are the traders telling us david this is ben cohen who i know uh you're a fan of um what's uh what's he saying he's saying a hundred week sma is this some sort of movie movie right yeah bitcoin so the sma is the uh simple moving average i think yeah right as opposed to the exponential moving average so it's the slower of the two moving averages and it's just he follows it up saying the price is noise and when you you know do the simple moving average the bitcoin price just kind of looks like a wavy line going up into the right uh i thought this uh tweet was pretty interesting a nice perspective you don't really see uh like these not very alarming there it's right like slithering up like a snake like naturally when you put the price into a simple moving average of course it turns into a line that's what the moving average does but it's just a nice perspective to have that like the more you zoom out the more bitcoin just looks like an up into the right chart well we talked about this in our episode with the ledger when he was teaching us a little bit about uh ta we mentioned i think it was a death cross at the time but now the bitcoin golden cross has arrived just a few months later what is the bitcoin golden cross right yeah so it's the opposite of the death cross ledger reminded us that this is a lagging indicator so all this is saying is that uh one simple moving average which is the the faster of the two with the the blue one here versus the the orange one has crossed and so now we are going and our local uh price has moved up faster than the long-term price which indicates bullishness uh and uh it's if anyone was listening to that ledger show and they were calling the fact that this was a a fake out or a bear trap uh congratulations this i guess now proves that you are right um but bitcoin yeah uh the simple moving average or the short-term moving average which i think is the 50-week again we're not traders here are is now above the 200-week moving average which i believe is what the golden cross is yeah it's funny we had him on just after the death cross was crossed right and he said it could mean something it might not mean anything but um you know it could mean bad things and here we are at the end of the summer we've just hit the the golden cross looks like bitcoin is gearing up for another run maybe all of crypto that's what we've been kind of talking about the last couple of weeks this is really interesting the wrapped bitcoin bot so this is wrapped bitcoin on ethereum they just meant it uh 2 500 bitcoin that's one uh 113 million dollars worth of bitcoin on ethereum you don't see that every day impressive amount of bitcoin continues to be tokenized on ethereum yeah a bunch of wbtc liquidity coming to d5 this is more bitcoin in a single minting transaction transaction than all of the lightning network which is kind of puts things into perspective it does all right let's talk ether uh price of ether this week we are higher on the week what's what's going on here yeah absolutely we started this week at 3 dollars hit the low low price of three thousand two hundred dollars and we are currently at the high of the week at three thousand five hundred and sixty dollars overall up three point five percent on the week this is the death rattles of the crab market in my opinion david i really think we're we're due for a breakout we'll see whether that remains true but people are bullish people are bullish we're getting into that that season that fall season um what about the eve to bitcoin ratio what's that telling us this week yeah each bitcoin ratio 0.07 mostly flat with a slight note of up on the weak but largely flat largely flat how about locked total locked in d5 on the d5 pulse index we're at 90 billion this week still haven't hitting that hit that 100 billion mark which is the next major threshold up but um you know not down on the week what's going on here yeah currently clocking in at 90 billion locked in d5 that flash crash that we saw about a week ago where there's a bunch of cascading liquidations now just looks like it's deeply in the rear view mirror kind of almost looks like it never happened and again eyes are on a hundred billion dollars locked in defy eyes i don't feel like are on d5 tokens themselves maybe they should be i'm not sure what's the the dpi showing us this week david yeah dpi coming in at 398 right now start of the week at 365 hit a low low price of 324 in the middle of the week and is currently coming in right below 400 we got a nice uh 12 rise in the week in d5 token so that's looking okay but the test of whether it's d5 season versus 8th season is right here in the dpi to eat ratio david uh we are still under 0.13 my friend but up a little bit on the week what's your shot i think roughly up maybe 12 on the week since we last talked about it uh i want to have hope but i've learned my lesson so we're gonna we'll go ahead and wait and see for this one to uh start to have a meaningful breakout it is still in a very long descending channel that has started ever since march um but again like i feel like a bull market would really set off some d5 tokens you kind of wonder whether we're going to have another east season first or a d5 season first if you had to guess what what do you think each season or d5 season next season yeah season which maybe maybe means how about the bed this is the combination can't go wrong on the bed index because this is a combination of bitcoin eth and defy tokens a third or third a third and we are up on the week this chart likes to go up yeah last week was the first major like not up week i think we were down eight percent and we are up five percent 5.5 on the week overall over the full month we are up also 5.5 on the month uh the all-time chart for the bet index again looks fantastic the bet index the best crypto index there is do you know speaking of fantastic i think these are the numbers of the week right here look at that and this is what we've been waiting for man we all knew that that was going to come we called l2 summer uh earlier in the summer we're not the end of summer so it's like l2 summer fall edition we're starting to see it david a little bit late but better late than never uh arbitrarium 2.3 billion locked i don't know last time when we had arbitrary on the podcast a week and a half ago it was like we were celebrating 30 million or something 50 million something like that suddenly we're at 2.3 billion dollars in value locked on ethereum's largest layer two right now and that just exploded from like friday up until now uh super impressive here what's going on overall all value in all l2s has been up 300 percent over the last seven days which again it only it seems to be up and to the right because because l2s are really in their infancy right so like value can i kind of only flow on there there's no value to flow away from there but yeah arbitrary dominating the week this week that's because they went live last week so that's like you know obvious um and so like now it's up to the open permissionless world of development developers and aprs to get a bunch of value into arbitrary they are up over 3 000 of value increased when they finally opened up and removed the white list and allowed you know the open source community to start tinkering now we should say some of this volume is like in fact a lot of this volume the uniswap and the kind of the balancer and the more sustainable d5 protocols a huge chunk of it is actually in kind of a meme farm token is this a nyan cat meme another one we've got it going on in layer two right now this is two billion dollars uh flowing into arbitrarium from the nian cat meme token i haven't even looked at this man what is it yeah no it's exactly right it's a it's a yield farm based off of a meme and like when we talked about the whole layer two summer meme we meant yield farming i kind of thought i kind of thought yield farming with like you know unit swap and balancer and ave like not necessarily memes but hey like me like yield farms on our yield farms right and like the dollars on the uh uh the value that's been sent to arbitrary has been in ether i think there might also be these nion cat tokens too but like it's because a lot of ether has also moved over to arbitrarium to farm this token uh and so like i guess carray we had a meme pull a bunch of ether onto arbitrary at least there's ether now there look man a year ago that meme coin would have been on uh main net now it's on right now it's on layer two which is kind of where it should be right um so it's a good place to experiment it's also like permissionless i mean it's almost complaining i saw someone complaining about this on twitter david like what like another meme token on a layer two it's just like yeah we can't control like it's just they're all memes they're all memes anyone can build whatever they want so no surprise that um you know this is one of the first uh applications i don't think it'll stay the dominant applications for uh for but um anyway it's good to see some some traction there certainly these kind of experiments are happening on other eath killer type chains as well um let's talk about this too david the burn are you feeling the burn layer what's that like what's going on here yeah so we're getting a lot of economic activity going on on optimism and now also arbitrarum and in over the last 24 hours they have both themselves shown up on the eastburn leaderboard on ultrasound.money so optimism came in at burning 138 ether yesterday and arbitrary burnt a hundred and fifteen ether i believe that puts that at arbitrary number seven and arbitrary uh optimism number seven arbitrary number nine on the 24-hour east burn leader board which is letting us know that there is enough economic activity going on on these layer twos that when they actually make a layer one transaction there's a lot of activity going on there and they're burning a lot of ether l2s are alive nice that was on uh september 11th and september 12th i don't know if they're still in the top 25 that's a few days ago okay do you remember when we talked to you uh the arbitration folks we asked the question of like how long is it going to take to see layer two on the leaderboard and they said end of the year right right well now we've already got a glimpse i don't know if they'll be on the 30-day leaderboard but at least they're on the the one-day leaderboard and i think there will come a time david when essentially the entire ethburn leaderboard most of the economic activity and transactions will all be layer two that is the plan for ethereum essentially to scale its execution layer on layer two and so a whole bunch of these layer tubes will be burning a lot of eath we'll pack our bags we'll migrate we'll be living our lives on the layer twos in the extended uh universe we won't be on the main net anymore like getting out of manhattan we're moving to the suburbs that's what's happening here right and as a quick lesson for people who want to live on layer two it is the uh arbitrum or our optimism like contract that is making that transaction on the layer one on your behalf and so all of your assets whenever optimism or arbitrary makes a transaction on the l1 to update this date that's you not making a transaction yet still making a transaction on ethereum you get the transaction benefits of having a transaction but you didn't pay for any of the gas magic all right we're burning a lot of eth uh let's see ultrasound awakening this is the ultrasound.money website and i think we passed a couple of thresholds here the first is 300 000 eth burnt in the last hour at the time of recording so this is wednesday 15th at uh 2 p.m pst we just passed 300 000 eath burnt we also passed another threshold in u.s dollars this would be one billion dollars worth of have been burnt in the past what six weeks or so uh incredible no all time oh yeah six six weeks six weeks yeah six weeks since it launched it's only been alive for six years so every six weeks you burn a billion dollars worth of eat right it's gotta do something to uh to supply more economics there it's gotta add a little bit of scarcity right it's just just a smidge it's more ether than i have that's that's for sure yeah um all right well in what's going on here so i think the the bridge protocols are doing some cool stuff too and interoperability protocols this is connects which connects reporting out i mean we're overall just seeing an absolute blossoming of the whole entire layer two ecosystem we see money moving on to arbitrary optimism and once money's on there uh the l2 bridges it's now it's their turn to have a bunch of value flow so connects just announced that they uh had a 500 million dollars of cross-chain transactions has gone through their protocol since they launched their vector their v1 i think maybe six or eight weeks ago or so uh and so like i i think we're just going to start seeing these milestones just start flying by as more and more people move on to l2s and then want to do stuff on other l2s yet don't want to be bothered with the l1 transaction they're just going to use the cross l2 bridges these flows like 500 million dollars like it's just nothing right it's just the the numbers we're talking about in d5 are absolutely tremendous and guess what a year from now i think these numbers are going to look tiny like super tiny yeah remember when we were celebrating 1 billion locked in defy and now we're almost at 100 that was less than a year ago by the way really yeah i can't believe that man i can't believe how fast this space grows and let's talk about this 7.5 billion dollars are locked inside of bridges or have crossed over from ethereum to either an alternate layer 1 uh or to a layer 2 or to a side chain something like um something like polygon and this is a chart on dune analytics that shows all of that activity the vast bulk of this this is looking like is on polygon but there's some uh bridging too healthy a healthy amount elsewhere too i would say yeah um a healthy amount elsewhere too and you know things like arbitrary of course are like um quickly moving up if you if you look actually in the past uh 15 you know 30 days it's a much more distributed amount here actually uh avalanche too um kind of interesting that the model for ethereum being sort of the uh you know anthony susano has called this like uh the economic nexus right um we've called this before the the chief settlement layer for crypto and so all of these assets essentially ultimately settle on ethereum but they're being bridged to these other chains um in uh you know for use inside of those ecosystems too and it's kind of interesting that you can see all of this on chain totally um any other takeaways from that or should we talk about git coin decoin doing their their brand round 11 number 11. i remember like number one a long time ago now and uh some pretty interesting stats here david what are they yeah greg yeah get coin already on day one this is their announcement i think uh at the time of recording we're at day like six or seven or something so when you are hearing this you only have a few days left to deposit or to donate any money to any of the grants that you see fit on gatecoin but since then on the first day they've already had over 4600 contributions from 350 people 36 thousand dollars coming in on the very first day and so you can go to get coin and donate to your favorite grant project of what you want to see funded fund fund public goods that's important all right david we are going to get to the releases next and then we're going to talk about the news but before we do guys we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing defy too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitram if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrom so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrum and join their discord all right guys we are back with the hot releases of the week david let's start with this we've been talking about the tracer dao for a long time now the tracer dow is launching their perpetuals product it's not out today i think it will be out by the time you listen to it a pretty cool product that i'm personally excited about and tracer dao is a friend of uh the begla show and has sponsored us as well but like what are they releasing yeah so they're releasing a brand new d5 primitive which i think people will be familiar with similar products if you know index co-ops fli tokens these are tokens that track the price of btc or eth in a leveraged fashion and so that's kind of a novel concept right and so it's a single token that moves in a leveraged fashion to our to the actual like underlying right uh and that's nice because of that uh people like leverage but then they also like composability and you're getting that as well and then also people like liquidity pools in providing liquidity and gaining yield on that and so this is kind of a hybrid product a liquidity pool a leveraged liquidity pool which this is uh produced perpetual pools is what they are calling it and this is a brand new product coming out of tracer dow which if you are a trader and want to try a brand new d5 primitive this might be for you yeah it's kind of cool too because people also like low gas fees and this is deploying not first on mainnet but it's deploying first on um arbitrum so another win for for the arbor trim chain and i think like in my head this is sort of like a you know it's got perpetuals like dydx to get an eth perpetuals product um and then it's got an element of like um it's got an element of like uniswap because you're you know you're sort of trading uh with a pool and uh then it also has this fli component almost like like set where you actually have tokenized versions of these perpetuals so it's kind of a cool blend and uh excited to see how it does particularly on arbitrum um david a new podcast is coming to the cryptosphere as well this looks like maybe an ethereum type of podcast i haven't listened to this one but um first episode with vitalik i'd listen to every single vitalik episode and also carl flores from the optimism team where they talk about retroactive public goods funding what's this podcast about yeah it's just i think it's a podcast he uh he only put out one single tweet about what it's about um but any podcast that has their number one episode with vitalik buterin and carl florsch is something that captures my attention so it looks like it's going to be a little bit of a cryptoeconomic technically focus podcast i think we have to wait and see if for this podcast really take shape but i'm always excited to see new podcasts come into the crypto sphere we support crypto media this one is called into the byte code we'll include a link in the show notes for you as well um this is cool too a roll up already expanding this is an fyi from optimism on the release chart they just doubled the throughput limit on mainnet we always knew these rollouts were going to roll out in kind of this uh this great like graduated fashion right so not like completely release the governors and all of the valves day one now they're starting to uh increase the transactions per day so 200 000 transactions per day is what optimism is now set at so that's doubled stay frosty stay optimistic is the message there good to see the roll-ups increasing in transaction throughput in a cautious way yeah weird it's kind of interesting to see people cautiously roll out scale onto their chain i'm sorry we'll get to that part later that's a good move um zapper they're releasing our terminators cordially invite you back to the zap reverse so this is a new season of zapper uh i'm actually not sure about this one david i haven't read all of the details what's zapper up to here yeah the first season was all about that uh they started to gamify their application right and so you would go and do activities and you would level up uh and i think that the seasons is just referenced to like seasons that we've seen on like you know diablo driver 3 has these uh overwatch has these whatever competitive like game has these they have them as seasons uh but then at the end of the season you reset and go back to level one so i think what's going on here is that they have reset everyone uh and setting on a new bunch of quests onto the zapper metaverse if you will uh and now there's a bunch of things to do the entire speculation about this whole thing is that you are giving zapper provable active use of their application that could be something that they leverage in the future uh with stuff so maybe i don't know i don't know anything i don't know anything either i don't know anything what we have seen in the past is retrospective retroactive airdrops for usage so you're gonna say it out loud i'm not gonna say that with respect to zapper because i have no idea david but i am saying that could fit a trend that we've seen elsewhere so do these quests because they're fun um but do them to learn defy do them to gamify and and do them because you never know whatever to happen in the future um all right let's talk about raises this week coinbase they don't need money but they're raising money david because money's free these days i guess uh what's interesting is how they're raising it and who they're raising it from this is a 1.5 billion dollar offering from coinbase for for debt essentially bonds we call these in the market like junk bonds so coinbase is raising i think they're doing this they their stated reasons are uh m a activity like acquisitions basically coinbase wants to go buy a bunch of things it's super funny because you know of course microstrategy and michael saylor has used the same the same tool in the bond markets to go raise funds at a very low interest rate and then he goes and he buys bitcoin right it would be so hilarious to me if coinbase just turned around and bought some like crypto with this why the hell not like i mean the money's so cheap right and they could definitely do that i'm not sure that they will they'll probably get exp you know use this money for other things get exposure into other things but this is a pretty good showing and i i gotta say um you know even bloomberg is reporting this this shows that crypto is really going mainstream because the bonds didn't just like sell they sold out in a flash and there was a ton of interest in these assets and it was very easy for coinbase to do so people are seeing this as like coinbase uh the market's not afraid of coinbase's position with respect to regulators the sec this is kind of a show of strength and another 1.5 billion dollars added to the war chest coinbase do it again i dare you [Laughter] start dollar cost into crypto with it as well buy back your own stock absolutely hilarious um all right billionaire steve cohen just raised uh just invested in an nft startup recur it's called 50 million dollar raise here what is recur up to this is like an nft platform of some sorts david right i had never heard of this nft platform um but it turns out they're doing some interesting stuff every recur um uh has just like like you said raised 50 million dollars not only from steve cohen but steve cohen was participating for a valuation of 333 million dollars which is pretty high for an nft platform that i've never heard of before hasn't been launched maybe uh yeah which is kind of interesting um but i mean we all know that nfts are something that you know resonates very very well with non-crypto people so like maybe this is like the nft world has hit some escape velocity where like non-crypto there's a non-crypto side of nfcs that we just don't know about anyways uh recur uh is starting off a product which is kind of like nba top shots in the sense that they like snapshot moments from instead of nba uh collegiate football so we are now nft moments from college football which is a very very big ecosystem if you're if you're not inside of the united states or you don't care about football college football is a very big deal it's a very big industry um and so we are now kind of doing the same thing we're doing with nba top shots but now we're doing it for college football and apparently steve cohen really likes that idea to the point where he would help this nfc startup raise 50 million dollars it's interesting because we've gotten to the stage where we're like just past the billionaire uh legendary investors investing in crypto assets and now they're like down the nft rabbit hole right like we're at that point in uh krypto saturation he's you know totally sold on that um interesting to see what will come of that uh david another raise this week this is in the nft side as well immutable x just raised 60 million dollars in a series b funding this is an nft exchange minting trading platform that is all based on ethereum's layer 2 so they use zk roll up tech so it's lightning fast um cool to see that they have raised a bunch of big names in this investment as well you know galaxy fabric uh who else apex capital even gary vee it looks like got in on this with with his uh fund what do you make of this yeah this has got to be the last raise that they make before they issue their token because they are also going through a coin list token sale for the imx token and i'll be honest i've been like typing imx into coingecko every now and then just see if it shows up it hasn't yet um but uh everyone's kind of waiting for this imx token to come out uh disclaimer me and ryan are seat investors in imax i think we were in the last round one of those one of those rounds i can't remember one of those yeah all right uh jobs hey this is your job we say this every single week but if you don't have a job in crypto go get encrypto i mean get a job it's so fun it's so fun start working for a dow do something in crypto so some hot jobs of the week even daos are posting jobs are dallas hiring other dolls too guys are hiring dolls dows are hiring people uh hiring is happening needs to grow yes and everyone's getting jobs and everyone's getting hilarious jobs and you're missing out some derivative of that original statement here's the job like even if you don't have technical skills uh pick up this community lead role from popcorn so this is god buy protocol community lead role this would have been my dream job like at one point in time uh go check that link out all you do is make memes and chat and discord like it's the coolest job ever senior software programmer as well that requires a bit more tech skills right take a look at that too that's from popcorn as well senior front end web3 developer that's tracer folks with the new perpetuals product looking for that too these are all featured on the bankless jobs site it's included as a link in the show notes go check that out and some of the other positions that are listed there um all right david are you ready man oh my god i'm so ready i know you're ready for this okay so the headline here is a tale of two outages there have been two outages this week in crypto chain outages uh one the solana chain which we'll talk about and the second is arbitram which is a layer two uh that we'll talk about as well so why don't you take us through a tale of two outages let's talk what happened with solana this week yeah so solana had a peak load of over 400 000 transactions per second which is a lot and then the at solatus status twitter account says um solana main beta encountered a large increase in transaction load which peaked at 400 000 transactions these transactions flooded the transaction processing queue and the lack of prioritization of network critical messaging caused the network to start forking this forking led to excessive memory consumption causing some nodes to go offline engineers across the ecosystem attempted to stabilize the network but were unsuccessful and so as a result of this a bunch of validators had to coordinate inside of a discord channel i believe to coordinate a restart of the network and then uh as a result of that uh the solano was down for over 18 hours i think of something like 18 to 20 hours uh and then one some sort of con like coordinated consensus mechanism to restart the network checkpoint and restart the network again i'm not a distributed systems developer but they were able to get that solana network started up and running again uh 20 hours later so it was down for over 20 hours which is kind of crazy 20 hours down and when you say down we're not talking about degraded we're talking about like dead down there's nothing exists your transactions aren't going anywhere no one's listening to them like your money's frozen like there's no withdrawals right no yeah right nothing nothing frozen the state is frozen and what had to happen is they basically had to eventually reboot the thing and i think it required like the support of 80 of all of the the validating stake validating nodes and that was kind of the coordination that you're talking about um we'll get to some takes there but like i will say never in my history in crypto have i seen a chain worth like 40 50 billion dollars tens of billions of dollars be down for 20 hours like that's pretty unprecedented has never happened at that level of value people have tried to compare this to the ethereum shanghai tax in 2016. we got to talk about that one i don't think the comparison is apt but before we do let's talk about we said a tale of two outages a second outage happened at just about the same time and i put outage in kind of quotes because it's kind of an outage but also kind of not but tell us what happened to arbors from david yeah so arbitrary the layer two to ethereum had their sequencer go down so another interesting thing like i said at the beginning it's interesting that both of these happened really really closely to each other i think within the same like hour or maybe two hours and it had both had to do with the sequencers for both um uh arbitrage and uh solana uh one of solana's big claims to fames is it has this like natural sequencing built into the l1 ethereum doesn't have that a sequences things it allows whoever proposes the block to sequence the transactions as they see fit um but arbitrarily has a centralized sequencer a centralized sequencer almost kind of is what a rollup is and that part broke down uh and so um the report from arbitram says all transactions that had been had been accepted by the sequencer were included and not reordered uh transactions uh accepted by the sequencer between 10 13 and 10 14 am were reassigned a time stamp when the sequencer returned online at 10 59 a.m and so arbitrary was down for about 45 minutes and they say that the root cause of the downtime was a bug causing the sequencer to get stuck when it received a very large burst of transactions in a short period of time almost very similar to what happened with to solana and then the issue had been identified with a fix and had been deployed uh and so there are some takeaways that that we should we should talk about with uh the whole arbitrary being out um yeah i'm actually glad i'm kind of glad david this happened at the exact same time this is great this is such a great test it's it's a great learning lesson i think for the ecosystem so we can say exhibit a what happens when a layer one sort of has a complete outage and requires a restart from a coordinated set of validators and then exhibit b what happens when a layer two goes down as well so maybe let's talk about the the you know the contrast here one interesting contrast is when our the arbitrary outage was a little bit different so you know sending layer two transactions was not possible so you couldn't transact on layer two but ethereum wasn't down right so you could actually still get some transactions through on arbitrom in sort of a a roundabout way as i understand why don't you take us through when arbitrary fail how did it fail right so when arbitrarium failed the arbent arbitrament sequencer stopped listening to incoming transactions and so all the benefits of the l2 all the scale all the throughput all the low gas fees we lost that we that that's what we lost the sequencer stops hearing transactions and start stopped writing them to the arbitrary blockchain the arbitrary l2 but the whole point about rollups is that there is a natural fallback to a rollup that doesn't require you using the sequencer and so because of the roll-up design users could just make an l1 transaction and update the state of the alt of the arbitrary l2 themselves using the main chain it's like a user only back door to arbitrarily if for whatever reason you the sequencer is not listening to transactions maybe they're censoring you specifically but not no one else it doesn't matter because you can just go through the door that is on the ethereum l1 so your funds are never at risk this is why people like l2s and so the the moral of the story is that when the arbitrarium layer 2 breaks the worst case scenario is that it just returns to being an ethereum l1 smart contract that you engage with on the ethereum l1 so all you got to do is have some ether on the l1 to make a transaction to the arbitrary smart contract to say hey your shit's broke excuse my language give me my money back and then because ethereum operates by that code because of the nature of rollups you get your money back and so you are never ever your money's never frozen i i kind of get this visual david where like i you know thinking in terms of like imagine ethereum is just this bubbled city in the cloud right and then arbitrary is another bubble city in the cloud right and but it has this bridge this bridge that just essentially cannot be destroyed unless ethereum the city of ethereum is totally destroyed too so if arbitrary goes down if arbitrary's on fire if there's chaos in the city then that bridge cannot be destroyed so you always have the ability to like withdraw funds um you know do some some kind of transactions across that bridge as well and exit in the case of solana like there's no bridges right there that are enforced by solana so like solana's down the entire solana network is down this is not the case with layer twos layer two just fails gracefully back to ethereum so it's kind of a question of like was arbitrary totally down right uh and i think um daniel from the arbitrary team actually makes that case like practically speaking kind of was for the average user but he says if i want to get nitpicky and pedantic i could also argue that it's not and he gets very nitpicky and pedantic in the whole thread and we're not going to go through it but what's the tl dr here yeah the tldr is that there are three ways to get a transaction uh in out of arbitrum uh one of them is like the normal case where like as a normal operating l2 you send your transaction to an uh the sequencer uh and then the sequencer updates the arbitrary state it gives you a little receipt and then yay we can go beyond our merry way um we are actually going to have to scroll down because i'm going to have to read the the second way to get in but this is going to be just a little learning uh learning lesson uh and so uh here he says meet the sequencer that's that's the thing that orders the transactions accepts the transactions right to the arbitrage chain uh but the case number two is that when a message from the ethereum l1 can also be included into the sequencer and so you can actually write to the uber trump sequencer even if the secret sequencer is still live by writing a transaction to the ethereum l1 there usually you wouldn't do this sometimes there are some specific scenarios but the transaction gets added to the delayed inbox and the inbox is like the thing that is where all the transactions go before it gets added to the arbitrary chain um and like the most common case here is like when you just straight up add money to your arbitrage account that's when you make an ethereum l1 transaction put it into the arbitrary inbox within 10 minutes it shows up on the arbitrary l2 uh and that's when one of those cases that you would do that and then the third case is what we were exactly talking about uh is that if a message has been sitting in a sequencer's inbox longer than what is the code for max delay which i believe is 10 minutes any user can call a function called force inclusion which pops out the message out of the delayed inbox and puts it into the user's account on the l on ethereum l1 and so this is a fantastic thread if you want to go into the in more nitpicky details about how a layer two roll up is constructed but because there's three different ways uh and the worst case scenario is always the fallback of like there is always user sovereignty if the sequencer isn't doing what they say they were that is why rollups are so magical there you go all right david let's get some takes around the the crypto twitter sphere to to round this picture out so this is a take from hudson jameson i i first want to maybe read the take from anatoly before you do i do want to say that what we are talking about with solana versus arbitrary it is decently apples to oranges in the sense that solana is a layer one and arbitrary is a layer two so there is that difference there uh and so we are actually going to go into a scenario about like well what if we were to talk about layer one to layer one to talk about apples to apples so let's go into hudson's take yeah so anatoly said this he's the the ceo one of the co-founders of uh solana um basically comparing what happened to solana in that 20-hour outage to the um shanghai attacks the shanghai attacks essentially ethereum was uh ddus attacked for like a series of days like weeks and had to like uh implement some emergency patch to to mitigate the uh the threat of this attack and ethereum was not down during that time but it was effectively like unusable or very hard to use because you couldn't get your transactions through and so hudson jameson is a former eth coordinator former ethereum foundation um community community manager community manager and um he's he's saying essentially that this is not at all comparable to the shanghai attacks david why don't you read parts of his thread yeah so hudson says what happened today to salon is not the same thing that happened during the ethereum shanghai attack so in 2016 but i understand why people think so so a thread hutton says both attacks were dd dos attacks meant to halt block productions so that is similar the big difference is that ethereum blocks never stopped producing during the attacks because of a multi-client design that ethereum has i believe there were two major ethereum clients at the time of shanghai attacks i think there was a third but it was more insignificant there was parody and death and geth was the one being attacked during the shanghai attack so if you had a guest node you would have a real hard problem getting a transaction name but if you had a parry node it was fine it looks like blocks still uh were being produced hudson finish uh continues and saying i do not like the rhetoric and comparisons to ethereum that uh uh yokoshi uh how do you pronounce his name again anatoly anatoly uh the the ceo of solana labs basically the ceo of solana and others have made throughout the day on twitter because it feels disingenuous and feels like it minimizes the issue solana faced i also don't like some people in the ethereum community are bashing solana for having to manually restart ethereum could have just as easily been in a similar position if the emerge had a bug all that being said i hold hold no ill will towards solana and wish them the best so the important differentiator is that ethereum's multi-client design which has saved ethereum multiple times and also has caused bitcoin to have to have to to roll back due to an inflation bug back in 2011 or 2013 because ethereum or bitcoin also only has a single client design solana like bitcoin only has a single client design and the whole point about having a multi-client design is that it promotes decentralization there's more than one way to interpret this spec of ethereum and to apply it and to have consensus with other clients and so worst case scenario is that making a transaction on ethereum just becomes difficult also because of ethereum's multi-client design the shanghai attacker had to spend a ton of money a ton of ether to continue to ddos the network dollars millions of how much money that's worth now right yeah it got billions and now it would have been a billion dollar attack right so so long as the blockchain keeps on working attackers keep having to have economic costs to attack the blockchain and then multiple spec design which ethereum now that the uh ethereum one chain has four specs uh with four different specifications and then the ethereum two has i think five or six largely done one of them clients right excuse me yes clients um uh and one of them being prismatic which is very significant but it has like five more other ones as well having multiple clients is anti-fragile and it is a significant difference uh measure of decentralization that ethereum has almost over every single other blockchain there is no other blockchain that has the level of client diversity that ethereum has which is directly representation of the decentralization that ethereum has yeah so i i think like hudson's point is like that's a false equivalence you can't compare like but but he also makes the point that uh you know to be fair something really bad could happen to ethereum one day right and some sort of social coordination might be required um i just imagine it would look a little bit different than getting a group of validators into kind of a discord channel and and having a conversation rolling out an update but i'm also i'm not not ready to take that point hudson says like this could have had this could have happened during the merge or this could have happened it hasn't though and that's a very important takeaway it has not happened to ethereum hasn't it hasn't and ethereum like if you put a big asterisk on the shanghai attacks as in like it was going to be really difficult to get your transaction in other than that ethereum has had a hundred percent uptime even during the shanghai attacks it was still producing blocks there has not been a day that has gone by where ethereum has not been up look man even the shanghai attacks like network value of ethereum at that time i don't know it's like uh 300 million dollars right right 500 million dollars right like you know in the first year of its birth i know solana is relatively young i'm like three years old or something like that but like it's worth 50 billion dollars right right it's a different beast it's a different beast uh there's another argument that was put forward i think um from people and i i felt like this was sort of a little gas lighty as well uh so this is kyle simani saying hey it's just in beta that's why solana's in beta this sort of thing is to be expected it failed gracefully no catastrophic problems like i don't even know what to do with those three points right it did not fail gracefully it fell over and died it was it wasn't honest with it absolutely catastrophic this is the most catastrophic it's as bad as it gets yeah i mean barry maybe inflation bug maybe maybe that's worse right but this is pretty close and then saying it's in beta if you're in beta you don't get to have like final product level valuations in my opinion right like beta product beta valuations right so like it's hard for me to justify uh the valuation of of solana when like when you see something like this right i mean just personally right like this is not uh i tweeted at the time by the way i think a lot of people were um you know knocking solana down when the engineers and validators were hard at work trying to restore it right and you know at that time it's just like hey everyone hold on like let's just let the dust settle a lot of talented engineers are working hard to get this blockchain back up let's wait for the hot takes and critical takes until that's done right well now it's done and i think the crypto industry needs to have a serious look at what happened uh and like the why it happened i mean uh and and really like take a hard look in the mirror at how we're valuing these various chains are we valuing them like what level of decentralization are we valuing inside of these chains what level of maturity are we valuing these chains uh and like this should really this is new information so it should reflect how we perceive uh the market i think this is a big incident and i think this is totally underplaying it from kyle here what's your take yeah i think kyle's being one of the most uh irresponsible people on twitter over the last week or so because like this is the first time i've ever heard him say that solana is in beta and like we should expect problems like this that is absolutely ridiculous especially when people are putting meaningful amounts of their money and investments into this thing saying it failed gracefully it's just i think it's completely irresponsible and i think he is putting a terrible branding on this on the whole entire industry yeah well absolutely i you know it's um i i think the response from some people on the i guess the solana side has been what's uh what surprised me and look this is the bottom line for me actually gavin wood uh from polka dot uh actually nailed it to me right so if you could take sort of one thing away from this incident to me it's this he said events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralization and well-designed security make a far more valuable proposition than some big tps numbers that's transaction per second numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers if you can't run a full node yourself then it's just another bank if you can't run a full node yourself then it's just another bank i think sometimes people are critical uh of us even david calling us like maximalists of one shape or another right like guys the show is called bankless okay we are here to escape the banks one vector of attack is a blockchain a group of validators a group of crypto banks can become the new banking system for you i personally don't want crypto to evolve in that direction so i'm going to fight for principles of decentralization if you can't run a full node then it's just another bank if you don't have a copy of the ledger then you are trusting somebody else with the ledger it's just to me david some of these things are like um you know unnegotiable right so call solana maybe it's a fintech platform that's cool right like paypal's a fintech platform venmo's a fintech platform it's kind of a new open fintech platform model it has not reached the level where it's decentralized enough if we can't run a full mode then it's still a bank it's still fintech it's not quite d5 so i think the events of this last week have um have shown this maybe to more people i don't know that that's going to be reflected in the immediate market price because look the market price is in narratives it doesn't necessarily price in fundamentals but this is something that if you are in crypto you absolutely should be paying attention to anything else we should say on this david yeah i i definitely want to there's been a just a growing frustration out of the ethereum community lately who has like said giving out warnings about something like this we've seen so many chains just like fork ethereum or like do something similar uh except what they would do is they would just increase the block size and increase the throughput calling just earlier this year finance train halted avalanche halted so far every single chain that has like tried to become an ethereum killer by just increasing throughput has halted at some point in time and there's a reason why we don't just beef up the l1 because like like gavin wood says here uh where he says um a more just uh a well-designed excuse me events in today's crypto just go to show that genuine decentralization and well-designed security make a far better value proposition than some big tps numbers we get big tps numbers from arbitrum and optimism our optimism just doubled their capacity our arbitrage is instantaneous we get big tps's on layer twos and we have the decentralization and security of a extremely conservative and consolidated and efficient base layer l1 that we can all run the nodes on and so so many of the in the ethereum community members especially when the sole price is just pumping through the roof and it's really really hard to like tell like teach these lessons no one wants to have their bags they're that that are performing really really well get knarked on by quote-unquote a bunch of eth maxis except that everyone is coming into all the ethereum people and saying like hey you guys are just being eth maxis because you don't like any other chain it's not ethereum maximalism it's decentralization maximalism and so i tweeted out earlier i said anyone who labels a decentralization maxie of which i would call ryan of which i would call myself instead as a toxic maxi just for not talking positively about other chains that have sacrificed decentralization is actually the person being toxic right especially if you are promoting a chain that is actually not decentralized as the base chain and you're just calling them a toxic maxi it's just wrong it's just wrong you have to protect decentralization that is the whole reason why we're here this whole industry is built on decentralization no shortcuts guys no shortcuts why take shortcuts we don't need to i mean just wait a little bit uh your cryptography magic is coming all of this stuff is going to happen in time let's not take shortcuts in the near term i think that's the message david here's what's ironic uh while this was going on ethereum was actually being attacked right there was three attacks it was crazy yeah so like uh p people don't know this because um nothing happened actually nothing happened and part of the reason why is actually one of the nodes um one of the smaller the nethermine ethereum client eth1 client node was taken down uh i think this was some sort of a ddos attack right so somebody was mining empty blocks for 550 blocks which had invalid proof of works and then they published them all at once right and so blockchains they operate by going on the longest chain somebody was mining secret blocks published them all at once in order to like get ahead of the actual ethereum chain that caused some clients uh some nodes who were on the nether mind client to go off and start propagating blocks on this new fake bad chain uh and so again another lesson in client diversity and even with uh client diversity not even all of the nodes of net never the mind client with went with a new blockchain right and so this is what happens when you have really talented client developers hyper focused on security and decentralization at the base chain attacks don't work it's great uh yeah absolutely that's what happened nothing happened essentially when it was being attacked uh and that's a good thing i mean attacks are going to happen uh you know cross your fingers knock on wood attacks attacks should happen ethereum that's the whole point is you can attack it as you see fit like i can't go attack wells fargo but like that's because of they have centralization as their security you're supposed to go attack ethereum have you ever tried to attack a bank david yeah i started this podcast with you we're attacking it on the meme layer guys all right enough said a tale of two chains a tale of two outages that was it david um let's talk about some other ethereum stuff ernest and young top four accounting firm like big name the professional services realm they have just selected polygon to scale their enterprise blockchain products here's what i think that means so people are confused about that e and why they're big ethereum proponents big crypto proponents as well they've been working on like some zk technology specifically enterprise technology for like for for enterprises in the in the privacy space as well so their whole thing is hey a lot of enterprises can't use the public chain because they want their valuable information transactions to remain private so they went off and they've experimented with some kind of zk roll up tech now they're folding that into the polygon family so polygon has not only its proof of stake chain that's its side chain but it also has a zk chain which is polygon hermes it also has a plasma chain and now they're adding this ernst young chain into their kind of their api suite uh polygons kind of a swiss army knife i suppose for all of these various side chains and l2s and i think what this could become david is like an enterprise roll-up chain right that ernst young is rolling out so excited to see how that develops and a really cool partnership in the making here this reminds me of the goldens goldman sachs what was their what was their private blockchain called quorum quorum right it was a fork of ethereum it was enterprise for just for goldman sachs and their customers they did their own kind of internal testing there was also like the ibm hyperledger as an enterprise blockchain and now we have the eui enterpr enterprise blockchain also with privacy built as a rollup on top of polygon this just reminds me ryan of the protocol sync thesis everything gets layered on top of ethereum and the benefits of plugging into a public open network can be as wide and large or or not as you so as you see fit um now eoi can tap into main l1 ethereum as much or as little as they like they have full control and they don't impact any of the other l2s or the ethereum l1 they get to do it yeah absolutely this is like the local area networks like the internal networks plugging into the wide area network plugging into the internet that's what's going on here uh vitalik buterin was named one of the top one one of the 100 most influential people of 2021 according to time magazine he was named that by alexis ohanian he is one of the co-founders of reddit and alexis gives some reasons why he uh he nominated and named um vitalik as the 100 most influential people in 2021 glad to see vitalik getting some recognition here i think it's going to be kind of a legendary name in fact we have a podcast with vitalik coming out next monday that's a fantastic podcast where we talk about among other things the importance of being able to run a node for yourself so tune into that podcast congrats to vitalik also i believe this is the uh the senior editor uh no the the president of time magazine president of time magazine right with a dot eth name uh retweeting saying congratulations to vitalik bearderan for being named 2021 top 100 influential people so president of time magazine with a dot heath talking about east stuff so that's pretty cool yeah very cool um what's this let's talk about the second news of the day so we're in nft land moving from ethereum to nft land um why don't you talk about this story it appears like it's a situation where an internal employee of openc has front run the best openc nft deals the deals that we're going to appear uh to appear on the front page what happened here david yeah so this all got kicked off by this one twitter account uh zoowoo tv he says hey openc why does it appear that nate chastain who is the head of product i believe senior product at open c so pretty senior position has a few secret wallets that appears to buy your front page drops before they are listed then sells them shortly after the front page hype spike for profits and then tumbles them back to his main wallet with his punk on it so going back to the reference between behind identity and nfts uh everyone knows who your punk is uh and so then uh this account uh did a little bit of more due diligence so if you want to find out like the analysis behind this how this was discovered it's available to you and apparently this was legit because it got picked up by the block which in the block writes openc confirms executive used insider knowledge when buying nfts so this is a reminder that openc is not a defy application it is a company built on ethereum and so nate chastain has been accused of front-running drops and from profiting some eth by first buying and then selling right into the hype um yeah that's uh that's a not a good one i mean it's not a good look credit has um has responded and said that they're taking this issue very seriously i'm not sure what immediate actions uh they will do but it's an important reminder that any place there's an aggregator in these systems you have the opportunity for insider information insider knowledge the ability to front run and put yourself with an unfair advantage what worries me a little bit david is this is exactly the sort of thing regulators will point to you and say well crypto's unfair right and we need more regulation maybe stringent regulation to come down on the space and my worry is not that like um my worry is more that dumb regulation will come down on the back of this right so like one example of smart regulation david would be like if you are um an employee at openc maybe you have to like publicly declare your ether counts right that trade any nft activity right so it's all public it's all visible right something stupid that could come down the pike is like no uh nft or anyone who creates a d5 product protocol is allowed to have an etherdresser is allowed to trade on these platforms right or has to declare every single trade like or openc has to become a broker or something openc has to become a broker exactly right so um there are good ways regulation could influence this but there's also some bad ways but i think this is potentially a clear case of front running and uh you know could could make the could widen the case for why regulators actually should get involved in this space i'm a little bit worried about that yeah so i guess as a psa to all people with positions of power around defy apps or companies like yo we as an industry are getting looked at we all have a responsibility to not have the shadowy super coder branding actually fit and instead be good stewards and self-regulate and be responsible like like if like nate gets his day in court metaphorical metaphorically in court no one's actually taking him to court um but like dude come on man we got a lot to lose dude you're letting us all down yeah and i think every company should get serious about disclosures use the transparency of the chain uh to to make this stuff out in the open um certainly so hopefully lessons learned in d5 in this we'll we'll see how it goes um david what's this uh what's happening here this is an nft on arbitrary right yeah so kind of a coincidence little uh announcement or release uh right after this is that um this uh somebody says uh somebody tweets out arbitrary needs an nft market now completely unrelated to what was going on with openc so um so they've decided to build one called small puddle s-m-o-l puddle which is a erc721 which are nfts mark it on arbor trump with a decentralized order book and 99 client-side power so it's a decentralized nft marketplace on arbor trump so funny little timing uh in in on theme with jpeg summer layer two summer and the need to have a decentralized nft marketplace look at these rb punks do you have one of these yet david i do not have an rb punk are these like uh complete clones yeah those look like those have got to be complete clones yeah uh-huh so because like look you can buy one for .01 eth which is how you know that's how you know that's what's being listed on smallpuddle right now other things in the future i'm sure also this david sotheby's is getting more into nfts a collection of board ape nfts just broke sotheby's estimates with three days to go i guess 19 million dollars worth of board apes via sotheby's have um have already been achieved that's the that's the current bid might go higher than that man sotheby's these art houses they are all into nfts like it's over it's done for them they've jumped down the crypto rabbit hole and they're here to stay no that's exactly right and this is coming right on the heels of steph curry and the chainsmokers putting board apes as their profile pictures uh and man like christie's is doing nfts they were gary vee nfts on chrissy's this week he's got a punk jason darillo oh god i remember though i haven't heard that name in a while uh but yeah i got a red-haired uh uh earrings punk so that's pretty cool oh and it goes more celebrity sightings uh let's talk regulation really quick apparently fidelity is really pushing the sec for bitcoin etf approval uh telling them that it is time when you have a major bank like fidelity an insider telling the sec that it's time for a bitcoin as etf yeah i wonder if that's going to actually move them um ralph paul said bitcoin etf in october so he said this is back in august i don't know what he knows but it's been time for a long time i just don't know that the sec thinks it's time and gary gensler has been increasingly critical of crypto at large without extending any olive branches to this industry so i guess we'll see what happens yeah gosh i remember asking hester pierce um her thoughts on like every day that that the sec doesn't approve a bitcoin etf but the conspiracies about this becoming a about protecting the dollar and not rewarding crypto becomes a little bit more valid and i'm going to go ahead and say that like if this and a bitcoin etf doesn't get launched by the end of the year i think it's here it's got to be this year one is the year it's got to be this year or it's a political statement by the sec they're making some political statements right now david uh we should talk about that in just a minute uh i guess before we do we should note that microstrategy has dollar cost averaged into bitcoin again hey it's been a while since we've done one of these like a week you mean two weeks did we no it's at least three weeks i think i don't know dude you said it so many times every month at least uh microstrategy michael's sailor dollar cost averaging they bought another five thousand bitcoin adding four percent to their treasury in bitcoin terms small purchase 5.1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin they hold now where do they get all this money from i mean they bought some low but they're just like they're raising it junk bonds baby that's the way to do it it's arbitrage opportunity crazy um let's talk regulation again so there are some hearings on uh in the senate elizabeth warren gary gensler um talking about crypto david you want to pull out some key quotes from this exchange yeah yeah gary gensler and elizabeth warner eyeing coinbase and uh elizabeth warren says um uh has criticized crypto's claims to financial inclusion saying we hear a lot about how crypto is all about financial inclusion oh glad you finally heard this elizabeth she said i want to test out with you if crypto is an improvement over the financial system so like i think what we're actually witnessing is like elizabeth warren doing her own little flavor of going down the crypto rabbit hole um so yeah yeah and then she also says that uh you know go ahead go ahead she's very she's very concerned it appears to me about um gas fees on ethereum so like the fact that she's knowledgeable about gas fees now indicates that she has gone a little bit further down the crypto rabbit hole she referred to defy exchanges i assume something like uniswap in air quotes like defy exchanges right as if d5 doesn't actually exist um she was very upset with gas fees the fee to swap between two tokens on the ethereum network last tuesday was more than five hundred dollars um i mean her i think her takeaway is like this is not for retail this is price gouging gas fees are too high maybe regulators can fix this maybe d5 is a false is a farce maybe like this whole thing is rotten i don't know what she's getting at it it's i think she just doesn't understand the gas markets right like complaining about ethereum gas markets is kind of like complaining about the price of a barrel of oil right it's a commodity it's a function of supply and demand you don't like the cost for a transaction don't do the transaction or try to find another chain another like centralized exchange where you can do a similar transaction it's just a function of supply and demand it's not no one's price gouging and the d5 i don't know why that's in air quotes like uniswap legitimately is a decentralized exchange if you don't believe that try to take it down right like i don't know what's going on here david but it's this is the eye of sauron i think starting to to veer it's it's uh it's i on the defy industry and i'm not sure what's going to happen next yeah no complaining about 500 gas fees is complaining about decentralization like i don't want to pay it either but like i also want to be bankless and i think elizabeth warren just has a bunch of dots that she hasn't connected yet another article that came out was in business insider which was also going going on about this where elizabeth warren says advocates say crypto markets are all about financial inclusion she said to gary gendler so this is two articles about the same subject then elizabeth says but the people who are most economically vulnerable all the ones who are are the ones who are most likely to have to withdraw their money the fastest when the market drops does this sound like a path to financial inclusion to you and like i'm just so confused it's like i run i watch like gas bikes up and down during market volatility and like i have no need to actually like run and go do something the only people that need to go run and do something during times of market market volatility are traders who got scared or people who are over leveraged which we shouldn't even consider that as like typical financial activities that's also just another form of trading and so like elizabeth warren i think she thinks this is some sort of like run on the banks like oh no like the the sky's falling i gotta go get my money out it doesn't work like that your money's always there that's the point uh and like so she's worried about like these blips of like really high gas prices and like people not being able to access their funds elizabeth warren banks are closed 80 percent of the time and so like just because like you can't for a brief moment in time where you're priced out of the gas markets like at least ethereum is up on holidays right unlike the financial system and at least it doesn't have according to a quote from i will quote kathy wood an unhinged monetary policy uh which is another like barrel which i won't open today yeah absolutely and uh the last thing i'd say i know elizabeth warren listens to the show on a regular basis last thing i'd say to elizabeth warren is like hey we're we're working on it right the entire you know blockchain scalability thing that's what ethereum's been working on for the last five years right so arbitrum the roll-ups that we're talking about you know zk this is all being worked on and we're trying to scale this industry so come help us don't stop us it's gonna lead to more financial inclusion we've got some shared goals here i hope they can see that maybe david there's a sliver of hope for me that her trip down the crypto rabbit hole actually she finds something interesting here and she finds something that that she's aligned on uh and you know we'll see if that happens or not but at least she's getting educated on it i just i just don't know kind of kind of it's like it is education she's saying the words like crypto marcus defy gas fees but they're just like the most un informed takes about those things right and like it just she just ex what she's saying to me is just exuding bias like she wants to hate this industry yeah it's uh it's definitely unfortunate uh we'll see what happens though all right guys we will be back with the takes of the week and the meme of the week as well but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans unit swap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the una swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless alright guys we are back with the takes of the week david let's start with the take from you and this is a perspective of your apartment like i never get to see this is pretty cool what are we looking at here yeah we're we're saying my apartment from the other angle um but my tweet was actually my best tweet ever i'm surprised how much this blew up but i tweeted out attention all right click savers which is basically another way to say nft skeptics why isn't my punk on your wall then and i'm super stoked that i got like this 48 by 48 uh metal metal uh punk right right over there uh and i think it's awesome ah no i'm losing it oh okay well okay there it is um and it's on my wall and i one of the cool things about nfts that we've been talking about over and over and over again is that nfts are the new form of art right and like well it's kind of weird to have a pixelated character on your wall as like art is like it's not really art um but it's like something that i care about and i value and so i put it up on my wall i feel like this is more than art though this is also like your digital identity it's become your digital identity right so it's also um you know tied into like you know a typical art piece that you might put up on your wall is not who you project on your social media so this is like deeper than that is this like having a picture of yourself inside your apartment yeah it's a picture of my metaverse self right yeah so like uh i i was painted as a crypto punk and now it's up on my wall but no the the more important thing is that if like we keep on saying crypto's taking over cryptoculture is taking over crypto culture is tight and i can't wait for other people to put their fidenzas on their wall or their chromey squiggles on their wall i think the high value nfts because like you know the the proportion of what that metal print cost me versus the actual cost of the crypto punk is minimal right and so all of a sudden there's some decently large incentive to just like take all of your high value nfts which you know are net you're never going to sell put it up on your wall make crypt crypto art real art can i ask the the literal question of like why isn't the punk on someone else's wall then like couldn't someone else just put this on their wall right or is that just like uh doesn't pass the social legitimacy test so you're you know like total pose and they'd use and they wouldn't do it feel free to put my punk on your wall i ask you to please do that i think it would be really cool if you put my punk on your wall but the thing is passing your punk right advertising that punk but also though like the real really the reason why somebody wouldn't put somebody else's nfc on their wall is because like you don't have the incentive to do that unless you actually own the damn thing right yeah that's that's that's the difference for people who are curious about how you did this like how did you do this um the mechanics of ordering this shinyprints.com uh which they are going to get a ton of business from this tweet there you go shinyprints.com is how you do it let's go to this take from scott lewis the ethereum community needs to do three things number one embrace side chains number two embrace roll-ups number three build that's it that's it i think scott lewis is saying like everybody chill right right um don't attack the side chains don't attack the roll-ups heads down build focus on that that's it ethereum success um is almost guaranteed if the community does that without distraction and i somewhat agree right like uh i don't know what you'd add would you add anything to that david no i yeah the only thing i would add is i would i would say that like i've always kind of thought that more or less ethereum's design philosophy and also ethereum's values is what protects it um the you can't fork those things those things are one-of-a-kind and people with those values gravitate towards ethereum rather than gravitating elsewhere uh anthony cesano does follow up with a nice addition where he says well can i embrace you scott and i think that's kind of funny because i think the other part about that's missing from this is that we all gotta hang out in real life and establish cryptoculture in real life and hang out uh which is exactly what i'm doing when i go to denver in the next two weeks right exactly that's exactly right um how about this take so this is from tiger swamy this feels like a turning point for ethereum eat the asset and crypto at large what david hoffman tressel state and myself ryan adams have been preaching for years is now becoming widely accepted the genie is out of the bottle this is in response to our kathy wood podcast and it's cool that the community is is is seeing that too i feel like our podcast episode with kathy wood from arc invest was kind of a major milestone not for bankless so much i mean it was for us it was pretty cool yeah we're happy about that the asset though right so like we've been preaching the same thing for the last two years three years eth is money ethan is an internet bond eip 1559 is coming should have a monetary premium as a story value d5 is going to eat the banks d5 is going to eat the banks laughed at derided right like just like it couldn't possibly be true it's so small it's never going to happen right now we have a 75 billion dollar fund manager on the bankless program telling us those things like saying those things right and like i remember my reaction was being surprised when kathy woods said hey the banks are scared i was like what are are they and so hearing that come from the other side uh is a turning point i think for ethereum and for the message of eth and i almost feel like hey man um not that our work here is finished but like a major first chapter has concluded i think on this on this path for defy legitimacy and bankless legitimacy so super gratifying to see that i couldn't be more excited the banks are about to be hollowed out by defy one of my uh out of the youtube comments ryan which i usually don't go to that place but on this particular episode the youtube comments were absolutely fantastic and tyrion on the youtube says at exactly the one hour mark in the podcast ryan had the holy this is actually finally happening moment it's always sobering to talk to someone outside of your circle that would generally agree with you and here are some fresh takes but when these outsiders are saying the same things with a wild conviction it is a whole different feeling altogether and that was really like the takeaway this whole episode it's like kathy wood is telling us that the thesis that we've had is actually happening banks are feeling the loss of revenue and she thinks that it's coming from defy because dfi's sucking up all the yield away from the banks that's why we have a podcast called bankless it was absolutely crazy and the fact that they discovered this kind of independently as well um is super cool david why don't you take this last take of the week yeah anthony cesano coming in with my favorite take of the week and i alluded to this earlier and anthony said i'm actually pretty tired of trying to play nicely with other c ecosystems or trying to not be quote toxic or in parentheses whatever that means these days anthony continues solana going offline for 10 over 10 hours and the ceo is on twitter just flooding ethereum as some sort of damage control ties it off with saying it's pathetic and i agree that's why i was saying like i am a decentralization maxi and so if i don't like your chain because it's not decentralized that does not make me a toxic ethereum maxi that means your chain's decentralized and you need to look inwards let me ask you something david what about the people who say that sounds a lot like bitcoin maximalist talk you sound a lot like a bitcoin maximalist how do you respond to that yeah i was actually talking with eric connor on dms about this like yo bitcoiners they are correct in principles they are in my opinion wrong in execution but their principles are absolutely correct small blocks uh decentralization running your own nodes of being able to run your own nodes a lot of the significant principles that bitcoiners have are right for some reason they're just applying it to the wrong execution in my opinion uh and so like if if if i sound like a bitcoiner because i'm like promoting decentralization and i'm not accepting centralized chains like i'll take that and run with it because like hey there's a reason why bitcoin is the number one asset in in crypto to this date and that's because it's proven that this market values decentralization above all others uh and so fine so be it yeah absolutely david that that's why i would um whenever people ask me are you a bitcoiner i would say yes right like i'm a bitcoiner because i have these bitcoiner values i think decentralization is incredibly important i think bitcoin maximus have missed the boat on this whole d5 thing but like the principles are right moderate bitcoin values is how vitalik has described the ethereum community it's how i would describe it as well all right david uh that's it you ready for meme of the week or actually before we get we're gonna ask you what you're excited about yeah what are you excited about uh well in about 15 minutes right after we finish up this roll up and i get it uploaded i am yielding myself onto a plane to denver gonna go hang out like i said with metta cartel and all the real life in real life with all the only met in discord channels people who i only know as their crypto punk avatars uh all meeting up in denver gonna finish up mcon and then go on a hike on saturday and then on sunday i'm going over to mainnet new york we're gonna uh shake hands with ryan ryan selkiss over at massari and attend all the conferences in there and then of course go to the pleaser dow dog party uh there's a party that uh leighton cusack from uh pulled together told me about uh and overall just have a good time in new york which at the end of the day like while new york's not really my city it is kind of the crypto capital of the world so it's a fun place to be uh and then i'm also excited about my crypto punk that's awesome man that's a lot of excitement from you this week well there's always a lot to be excited about so speaking of ryan what are you excited about i'm just going to narrow mind to like the fact that arbitrarium hit over 2 billion in total locked value is is hugely gratifying within like two weeks of launch uh and uh super exciting i know last week i said i was excited about layer two this week i'm also excited about layer two but more specifically seeing layer twos like meet those thresholds um layer two beat right that is the new d5 pulse we're gonna watch total lock to value on d5 just grow and swell and get to the hundreds of billions uh and i can't wait to to look at that every single week on this show i think it's going to be i think it's going to be really cool to say so arbitram 2 billion mark looking forward to 20 billion then 200 billion and then 2 trillion and haven't even launched optimism yet and so when that comes online it's going to have you're going to be able to do this all over again it's going to be great absolutely name of the week david it's better time it's time with this what what are we looking at here uh this is a tweet out of joseph de long and this is a picture of i'll pause for a moment and let the viewer look and try and figure out who this is it is it's donnie kulichov of ave along uh with paris from ideo and i actually don't know who uh the girl in the red is but they went to some sort of masquerade weird party in a field somewhere and stunning like a mad hatter vibe like alice in wonderland something it's a little it's a little um uh not cypherpunk uh uh what's the what's the branding of things that like are in the wild wild west but they're like steampunk it's a little very very steampunk it's steampunk-ish and uh estani's got this crazy hat i think there's a snake on top of it maybe a dead snake it's wearing a pinstripe suit there's a bunch of the crazy costumes here okay and so that's that's the context there's like three people crazy costumes stony's looking you right in the eyes and joseph de long tweets out this photo and says you apply for this loan this guy walks up and locks eyes with your girl what do you do and the point is is that well maybe i don't know if this is cryptoculture but this is a crypto guy doing cool things and so i'm going to go ahead and say my the thing that i always say which is that cryptoculture is tight there you go guys of course none of this has been financial advice on the rollup you won't hear that on bank lists at any point in time eth is risky defy is risky so is bitcoin you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope
