welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we're doing this video live so i can see you've got a big smile on your face man what are you smiling about yeah it's just funny to actually see you read out the intro i've never seen you ever seen you read oh whoa whoa read that was memory dude i've never seen people remember i've never seen you do it from memory but yeah you guys we are doing our first uh video podcast and that's because we brought on melton how did you pronounce your last name debeers damier's oh that's simple we brought on melton demir's who brought the receipts she brought the trans gifts she brought the trans control god she brought the tables she has the data and so we had to do this podcast in a video form so that we can see what's going on and so if you are listening to this on the regular podcast that's totally fine you're not going to miss too much however do know that there is stuff to look at on the youtube as well if you want to follow along this was just a fun conversation i mean like for americans at least it is a holiday week when we're releasing this so it's a good one to listen to during the holidays because it's uh it's kind of fun and we start maybe i don't know if we start serious but anyway we start with this whole macro case and uh melton brought the data as you said brought the receipts brought the slides to making the energy and the energy to make the case that everything is new again and this is something we've talked about on bankless and we probably like the first part of this conversation it was probably like a hundred percent alignment right but then the second part of this conversation is where things get a little fun things get a little spicy because there were some points where uh we we disagreed on and uh she was happy to like call us out on things or uh disagree with our perspectives and then we pushed back and i feel like we got to a really interesting conversation that the community doesn't often hear from somebody who is not milton is not a bitcoin maximalist but she's definitely a bit more team bitcoiner right you know whereas you know bank list kind of uh bridges the gap here for sure and we are uh we like bitcoin we're bitcoiners but we're also very ethereum friendly there are some things we didn't agree on yeah yeah i think the way they characterize us is we are bitcoiners when it's bitcoin on ethereum if that's not if that's a fair take which is you're you're you're a bitcoin on ethereum maximalistic yeah bitcoin on ethereum maxwell that's a good way to put it um and that we did get into that difference with meltdown where she thinks that you know the the bankless nature of bitcoin is actually possible in ways that we don't necessarily have optimism for here on the bankless pod so there's there's a perspective there in addition to that melton is just a bundle of energy and she really is having just just living her best life helping people like us produce awesome entertaining and really informative content and while doing so with a smile on her face in a very joking manner and so uh in addition to seeing the receipts and watching the charts and looking at the data there's she's also just a very expressive person so maybe it's worth it to watch the youtube for for that purpose as well yeah absolutely it was a hilarious podcast so you know whether you agree or disagree with all of the perspectives you're gonna have fun you're gonna enjoy listening to this so david we should get right into it do you want to talk about our sponsors yeah well i think i have a video of myself recorded talking about our concepts sponsors all right hey guys the next sponsor is ledger and ledger is running a 40 off black friday week sale so if you haven't gotten your ledger yet you are in luck for the week of the 23rd through the 30th you can get 40 off of all ledgers on the ledger website so if you are still using a hot wallet or you're just looking to get a backup maybe for a multi-sig or just for some more redundancy now is the time to go get that ledger there's a link in the show notes that can get you that 40 off black friday deal if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stable coin and wire will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well bankless nation we are super excited about this podcast we want to welcome elton de mears to the show melton is the chief strategy officer of coin share she's the former vp of the digital currency group she's done angel investing she's even testified on behalf of crypto to congress because satoshi could not make it before she was bitten by the bitcoin bug she had a fantastic background in treasury management corporate finance so brings that side to the table as well but this conversation is going to be a little less serious maybe we're going to introduce some data but i think we want to find out melton wtf just happened this year right we're in late november and a lot of things are happening melton's got the data she's got the receipts we're going to go through that how are you doing malcolm welcome to the show thanks guys i'm excited to be here it's an honor to be on bankless um what the happened is every conversation i've had since mid-april i think people in march and april would say stuff like oh when we go back to normal right and i was like i don't think anyone understands that that doesn't exist anymore all concept of normal has sort of gone out the window and look i think the more important thing we we can talk about facts and i want to get into it and i did bring receipts because i love charts and data and i want to always quantify and qualify what i'm i'm saying i think it makes us so much better at being advocates for crypto when we bring evidence and we bring facts and data to our conversation it makes everyone smarter and just elevates the discussion but i think one of the really important things that happened that we don't talk about enough is a decade and actually maybe four decades of mental models around how markets work and how economies function have been shattered to bits and we are now trying to pick up the pieces but all around the world allocators of all size of all type governments regulators policy makers central bankers everyone who operates in the world of markets and money is trying to figure out how to grapple with this new reality and it's dark but every ending is also a beginning and so as this era of markets comes to an end i'm so excited about this new beginning that we have in the crypto space and um so i think what we can do is maybe talk about like where we came from the past i take a lot of inspiration from history where we are now like what happened and what's going on and then we can get into all of the cool  that people are working on that people are building that i think is going to completely change the way the world of money works um and it'll be fun what do you guys think it's going to be a ton of fun and my question is meltdown is like when you ask a question like what the just happened uh one of my questions is like well let's get some time parameters on that like in what time period are we saying what just happened and also why are things dark like why are things so dark explain where this darkness is coming from okay why don't why don't i walk through some of my receipts real quick all right so let's do it all right and guys guys if you are listening on uh the podcast stream this is not the only way to to see the visuals so you can also hook into our youtube channel and meltdown's gonna be showing us some data here too so here's what i want to talk about i think there are there are four really important um sort of macro trends i think one of the challenges we have in in crypto especially but that a lot of people have is we view the world through these very narrow lenses and typically the way we view the world is informed by our own experiences our own expertise our own background and where we spend our time right if you spend all of your time talking to only defy chads and degenerate gamblers on the internet that's going to be your version of reality but there are a lot of different realities out there and i think um we can talk a little bit more about how reality and mythology and stories get constructed and how that informs what becomes reality because i think a lot of what becomes reality is what we want it to be like this idea of manifesting is not new um but there are four really primary forces that i think about and that i look at when i look at what's happening in the world and they are as follows number one is technology number two is economic forces three is cultural and social forces and four is political forces and when you take all of these trends and you put them together you can start to mash sort of these different reality layers on top of one another and start to at least get a sense of you know what's happening what might happen next and how these different forces that are acting on our world might sort of collide to make certain things happen make certain potential future realities more probable or less probable right and really what this is like right now if we look at the future anything is possible but certain things probabilistically speaking are more likely to happen and so really what i'm trying to understand as an investor is based on what we're seeing based on the information based on the the trends out there what will be likely to happen in the future and then placing chips on the table around those potential outcomes and doing my best to try to make those outcomes happen right that change melt and that change we were talking about earlier right like the wtf just happened everything's different the last 40 years all four of like there there have been changes in all four of these factors that sort of shape that entire paradigm shift right yeah and it's not just the last i think people really like to focus on the last three months or the last 10 years since the great financial crisis but actually this trend has been going on since about the end of world war ii and i think it's interesting to think about these longer secular trends and the shorter cycles that sort of happen within these larger multi-generational trends right but if you think about the length of a human lifetime i'm a big fan of a horizontal history where you look at lifespans and the lifespans of influential schools of thoughts or influential thinkers and where they overlap and intersect we are so influenced by what we experience during our own sort of horizontal histories that it's very helpful to sort of think about this in the context of a human lifespan which has gone from 60 to 80 years and hopefully the three of us will live forever but yeah okay so let's talk about it economically speaking um wealth in our world has become much more concentrated over the last few decades and we see this trend this data is from this time last year i'm working on updating this for my big trends report this year but one interesting fact there are three men in the united states of america who have more wealth between the three of them than the bottom 50 of all americans and the the crisis we've gone through over the last two months has only accelerated this trend and in fact we now need to add uh elon musk to this list he's actually wealthier than warren buffett right now he's about to become the second wealthiest man in the world surpassing um bill gates i believe but if we look at what's happened with equities as well right the rotation into of wealth and the rotation of inflation into equities and home prices means that this wealth gap between those who are affluent and own capital and those who have labor and work for capital that wealth gap has only continued to grow and while we're not seeing inflation as a result of money printing showing up in cpi or the consumer price index where it is going up is in these areas where people invest their wealth for growth right and if we look at growth areas housing prices are rising at the fastest rate in 40 years and it's not people buying primary homes it's people buying second homes people buying investment homes the other trend that's really interesting is what's happened to equities equities ownership is highly concentrated in the hands of the top 20 of americans who own 80 of the stock market and i think this is another interesting trend you know we look at the pandemic tech stocks are trading at 500 x 800 x forward p e multiples where inflation is getting priced in is in growth expectations around tech the other force i want to quickly talk about is meltdown i have a i have a quick question on that so is your take that this wealth gap this wealth disparity uh gap that's been increasing is largely the result of monetary policy intervention sort of like cantillion cantalon effects if you will no i think there are multiple forces at play here one is a generational force if we look at wealth disparity a lot of it is tied to economic opportunity and the fact that real wages have been stagnant since the 1970s the boomers right have captured the majority of wealth creation in this country and if you look at where wealth is stored again most people store their wealth in a their homes which is the largest asset they own typically and b in their 401k is their retirement accounts if you look at all of the stimulus that's gone on in the united states politicians realize the most important population to appease is the boomers they have the most wealth the most influence and they run this country they also turn out in large numbers to vote and so it's been very important to number one buoy stock markets and keep 401ks inflated and two to buoy home prices right at this point um the mortgage industry has largely been nationalized so i think there are these really important trends and policy again all of these things fit together policy props up this wealth disparity and further exacerbates it shifts in the labor force are propping up this disparity and exacerbating it and then forces in technology the fact that the opportunity for new jobs right there are a lot of 1099 misc workers or gig workers uh particularly in younger millennial gen z populations and most of the salaried like white collar jobs um are held by boomers they're not going uh they're not transitioning their roles to younger generations right the average ceo has gotten older over the last 20 years because all of the boomers have been playing a game of musical chairs rather than bringing in younger people to run these companies and so what we're seeing is this incredible incredible concentration of wealth and even on top of that what we're seeing is there's a massive massive liability that the government has if we look at the u.s deficit today it's roughly let's say 22 trillion dollars but in fact there's one important aspect that we don't account for when we report that number which is unfunded retirement and entitlement benefits which are unfunded and unreported liabilities on the fed's balance sheet there are about 122 trillion dollars of unreported liabilities in the form of social security pardon medicare and medicaid and on top of that there's also a massive shortfall in private pensions which are underfunded by a factor of 30 to 50 percent so you take all of this together and you have just this massive massive behemoth problem which is we have this population of people who have accumulated most of the benefits of technology growth and of economic growth over the last 40 years they now are consuming money at an insane pace and require an incredible amount of federal support but we're operating in an environment where our economy has been decimated and more importantly we have no ability to generate enough revenue to make up that shortfall so what we have is this massive snowball as a result of a shifting labor force massive wealth concentration and a massive massive funding gap in these entitlements that we supposedly have in in this country so these forces coming together in my view create a perfect breeding ground for a new asset class cryptocurrency so so melt them like just just to go back there right so like um this can't last forever right obviously that's got to be obvious because of the demographics of the boomer generation right so like how um how old is the youngest boomer at this point it's like mid now 60s i think in the mid 60s mid 50s to early 50s okay so like there's this feeling that as a result of all of this i think among younger generations like millennials for instance that um we're getting screwed like the millennials are getting totally screwed out of this bargain right because the boomers kind of god bless the boomers my parents are boomers love them um but they are kind of like taking the ladder on their way out they're they're sort of like optimizing everything for them and then where they're gone like when they're gone like what happens do things totally fall apart well ryan what you're articulating um if you read between the lines there you're being very political about it i'm not gonna be so nice about it what we are setting up for is a generational war right and this is a cultural war it's an economic war it's a political war it's a social war what this is about is we have a generation of people who will do anything and everything to keep the status quo intact they're trying to stop technological progress in order to keep the status quo intact because change is scary people don't like change but what this is going to result in is a massive amount of social unrest and it's already happening in many countries around the world we've watched this happen time and time again throughout history there is now more wealth concentration in this country than there was in france before the revolution so i think people forget we are humans are not stupid everyone sees what's happening and it's only a matter of time until someone a leader is effectively able to catalyze this discontent into some form of action and a shift in power and if we look at what's happening i actually think cryptocurrency is a huge part of that story because look at the three of us like i'm in my 30s how old are you guys 27 yeah 30s yeah right so yep and look at us right like we are building a new monetary system for our generation the boomers are trying to cash in on crypto but look this is a movement by young people for young people who see the world and say i did not i do not subscribe to this i believe in a different reality and we are going to use technology economics a social movement right bitcoin is first and foremost a social movement and political influence to make this happen right so i feel like melton that the boomers what you know i i tweeted this out recently but like that's what it almost feels like to buy stocks these days it's like you're buying boomer bags basically because they have totally pumped them up right wait i need a shirt that says i love boomer bag mean that's like that that's what it feels like from a millennial perspective and i think that message is is going out and like it's like when you choose where to store your assets or park your wealth as yeah someone in the younger generation do you want boomer bags or do you want like this whole new crypto thing that's i think probably the asset class like the transformation i would love to sell boomers some of my crypto bags true they have way more money yeah so if they want to you know bag hold some like xrp or whatever it is they're  have at it sorry no notice texts or feet but like i see people online like they're like xrp is going to a hundred dollars like okay like maybe it's a little quieter lately let's use math well at that at that price right the market cap of that asset would be over a trillion dollars like i think again people forget math is hard math is hard for people exponential math is hard yeah it's very hard exactly um and again i just think when people say these things they're not really thinking about what they're actually saying that's why again um you know i want to use math and objective reality or as close to it as we can get because objective reality doesn't actually exist but let's get as close to the truth as we can and actually try to use data and facts to inform our perspectives okay so then i want to touch on another really interesting trend so i think we've talked a little bit about economic first what's happening let's talk a little bit about where growth is right you look at this world and you're like wait a minute it's scary what do i do how do i invest in progress okay let's talk about the things and let's talk about what's happening with tech generally right so 10 years ago i left college no more than 10 years ago oh my god i'm old but 10 years ago the world i lived in i worked in the energy industry and at the time you know i was working with some of the largest companies in the world 10 years ago the largest companies in the world were energy producers and manufacturers makers of physical things and banks that financed that physical activity today the largest companies in the world right microsoft two trillion dollar market cap microsoft has a market cap that is larger than the economies of most nation states right google facebook amazon right i'm of the mindset that we are moving away from the relevance of the physical world and the physical state right like we belong to a digital nation state i identify more as a crypto person than i do as or as a bitcoiner i should really say i identify more as that than i do as like an american or where i happen to be born right and i think if you talk to people in our generation the way we define ourselves is not by our physical jurisdiction the way we define ourselves is by what we believe in and what communities we're a part of and we spend all of our time in this really amazing really fun bubble that is its own alternate reality which is crypto twitter right it has its own personality its own characteristics its own internal memes its own communication style its own beliefs right we have our own and we have our own language our own lingo right like ape together ape strong rug pull blue chip defy coins like i love it it's great it's the best cult i've ever been in it's awesome but at the same time i think people looking at this um from the outside in sometimes forget like how powerful that is and the shift from the world of physical things to world of digital things this is really about the battle we're facing now it's a battle for control and i want to quickly talk about the politics okay cool so here we are right um cyberspace is the next frontier and this is really what i was talking about with the evolution and the shift from the world of the physical to the world of the digital um and so as we think about this new frontier and like quick sidebar i love reading sci-fi if you go to my website meltingjammers.com i have my favorite sci-fi books on a sci-fi reading list there but sci-fi is actually humans creating mythology to try to predict the future based on history right and so sci-fi is such an amazing genre to read because you get to time travel and experience all of these different potential versions of the future which i think is actually really important as a technologist and an investor and someone who's trying to predict what's going to happen in the future and make bets based on that right sci-fi is predictive in a way because it's based on um our understanding of the past so big plug for sci-fi books if you ever want to read like hit me up on twitter i'm all about it all right we talked a little bit about our digital overlords the digital economy is growing what's crazy so this chart about the percent of the s p 500 by market cap last year the five largest tech stocks made up 17 of the s p 500 as of today a year later those five stocks make up 27 of the value of the us stock market 27 over 20 percent of all stock market gains over the last 20 years can be attributed to a single company do you know what that company is is it apple it's apple and here's why i think this is interesting they're in the world of investing right people are always like oh cryptocurrency is a bad investment icos are bad investment because they're scammy guess what a lot of public companies are scammy as and they are terrible investments and do not make money and i think in the crypto world and even in the investing world we have this idea that like institutional investors are super professional and they don't fomo into things they 100 fomo into things number one and number two there is a lot of shady stuff that happens in the world of regulated finance just because you can afford a lawyer that is good and just because you can afford to file some paperwork with the sec does not make your project your company your idea worthy of investing in it hires me to no end when people confuse the status of being regulated with the quality of the investment those are two very different things so i just quick gripe on that but let's talk about what's happening on the political front because this is so important for what's happening in crypto and i think is going to inform us about the future what is happening right now in the u.s is our government is spending an absolutely insane amount of money pivoting america's defense system from being physically driven buying fighter jets buying tanks buying weapons to being digitally and technologically driven we are no longer going to fight wars with guns and steel we are going to fight wars with information with memes and narratives the narrative war the narrative war but also the cyber war so right now there's been a big battle going on to win some really important department of defense contracts they are procuring technology services on an unprecedented scale and in the next few years the federal government expects to spend over 100 billion dollars on cloud computing services and by the way they're also spending money on cryptocurrency companies and cryptocurrency services right they're trying to understand what's happening in blockchain networks if you pay attention darpa the doe the dod they've all um done massive massive rfqs um they've given out a couple of grants four different projects to try to better understand the use of bitcoin as a private telecommunication network the use of blockchain technology national security instances like there is a lot of money that is going to get spent here and this is actually going to shape the political landscape but digital space is now becoming our new political frontier and this is also playing out with international politics and the politics of nation states and the reason i want to talk about nation states is bitcoin at its core is an attempt to separate money in state this hasn't been attempted since julius caesar first stamped his face on a gold coin about three millennia ago so it's very important in my view to understand what is going on with the evolution of the nation-state because i'm not 100 certain that the construct of the nation state survives the separation of state and money you know what that's a huge theme we've actually um we brought it on bellagi uh recently we talked about that very thing also um a political philosopher to talk about that to you i i i'd be interested in your your thought on this because when we were talking to uh bruno um who is a political philosopher just yesterday when we recorded he pushed back on that a little bit right so his pushback and he knows crypto he's studied kind of game theory of politics and geo like nation states for a long time he's got a great perspective on america china all of these things and his pushback was like yeah but if crypto's successful then governments are just going to ban it essentially right like you can't separate money from the nation statement okay so tell us why bring it in what okay hold on let's get into this okay so right now there is a bill on the floor of congress it's sponsored by mitch mcconnell and lindsey graham who are absolute ghouls my favorite okay not so much i'm pretty sure their inspiration on how to govern is 1984. yeah there's a lot of that going around yeah i do not prescribe to that philosophy but let's talk about this build it's called the earn it bill if you go to eff.org that electronic freedom frontier has a bunch of great information about uh the bill and how how you can contract contact your local representative encourage them to vote no on earn it i already sent my letter by the way to senators congressman you've got to do it melton's absolutely right this this bill kills encryption basically in the u.s encryption is under attack um and and not only is this bill on the floor of congress right now the earn it bill basically what it seeks to do is similar to what the government tried to do with the clipper chip in the 1990s so if we go back in history right in the 90s when um rsa or you know state of the art encryption was first introduced this is really what made payments on the internet possible by the way before we had um rsa and and securing encryption on the internet it was very difficult to remit payments on the internet because communication was not so secure and so um the government actually ruled for a brief period of time that encryption was considered a weapon or a munition and could not be imported or exported so people would actually print out t-shirts with rsa code on the front and wear them around like they would make themselves a weapon and then when the government realized that you couldn't ban math or code what they tried to do was they worked with telecommunications companies and mandated that all physical equipment have something in it called the clipper chip which effectively gave the nsa and the intelligence agencies a back door that they could use to spy on communications now here's the problem with this approach to governance in this approach to trying to pass policy let's say for example that we look at a house right and bad things happen inside of houses sometimes and people can lock their doors basically the approach they're taking is nobody can have door locks anymore because once in a while bad thing happens in a locked house and therefore we decree that nobody can lock their door but guess what also happens in that situation when nobody has locked doors bad things that happen outside the house start happening inside the house and anyone can come and go as they please not just the government and whoever wants to get into houses to see what's happening so this is why this policy is so absolutely stupid back doors are typically used not only by intelligence agencies and quote unquote the good guys and we can talk a little bit about how messed up the whole idea of like applying a policy in this sort of way is it can be used by anyone and in fact we already see so much software so much hardware that we consume particularly that from china already has backdoors in it that's used by nefarious actors we see this time and time again and so i really just think that people making policy do not understand how technology works they do not understand how the internet works and so what we end up seeing is this really ridiculous approach where right now they're trying to a ban encryption which is math and b they're sponsoring by the way these competitions for mathematicians and cryptographers to try to break encryption which is so mind-bogglingly stupid that i can't can't deal with it and melt him you're saying it's mind-boggling it's mind-boggling because it puts the us or any country that adopts this sort of anti-encrypt philosophy and approach it puts them at risk it decreases their defense capability worldwide not only does it destroy freedom of speech but it's actually a negative from a security perspective for the country that adopts this that's what you're saying it's also futile well the other piece that i think is so important so let's talk for a minute about why people use encryption right the reason we use encryption is because there is a belief in many countries many western democracies uh in particular that people are imbued with rights right um the right to freedom of speech the right to freedom of assembly the right to freedom of religion there is uh there are these these rules that have been put in place to preserve the ability for people to have these freedoms now what starts to happen that's really interesting is today our communication mostly happens over our phones our computers etc and our communications already surveilled and monitored that ship has sailed that ship sailed in uh the early 2000s after 9 11 with a bunch of the the actions that were taken then that allowed our own government to spy on us without needing a warrant there's this whole philosophy of something called lawful intercept where typically you would need a warrant to listen to someone's private communication that went out the window and obviously edward snowden other whistleblowers have had had done this country huge service and you know people in our industry great service by sort of exposing what was going on there the next layer of privacy is privacy in location right so i am a physical human being um and as i move around this world both in physical space and in digital space i typically have privacy and pseudonymity not full anonymity but i have pseudonymity right i could be a twitter egg i could be an anonymous person i could be a no name posting something on a website right and the ability for people to have pseudonymity allows people to uh to engage in activities that could potentially be risky right to expose things like the nsa wiretaps that were going on so privacy and location both in physical space and digital space is really important and then lastly the place where we have privacy today is privacy and transactions so the best way for me to engage in a private transaction today is to give you a dollar right physical money and physical exchanges of value are a great way to retain privacy but now we have new ways of maintaining certain degrees of privacy and transactions through cryptocurrencies right and what i think is so scary about all of this imagine a world where we have a digital dollar that's tied to your identity you have no privacy of location in either your digital realm or in your physical realm everywhere you go every service you use you're required to identify yourself right it's like some minority report style you're required to identify yourself and you have no privacy in your communication everything you communicate everything you do is monitored and surveilled by a ministry of information let's say for example that i'm having a private conversation with someone and i say something that could be deemed unpatriotic all of a sudden the government has the ability to freeze my assets to prevent me from transacting to prevent me from moving around in physical space and in digital space and to prevent me from being able to communicate so that what you're describing sounds like china and i think that's what bruno's point is right he's like that's the future and that's why like add on to everything you just said that dystopia uh government bans crypto if you're found citizen with crypto you will be thrown into jail that's what bruno is effectively saying so why is that here's why it's because you're giving governments way too much credit look at the staggering incompetence of the us government it is staggering how incompetent governments are and what i described to you with corporations becoming wealthier than nation states what i describe to you with the separation of money and state i don't think governments are future rulers corporations are well do you think that's also true for china right because the chinese government doesn't appear i mean i don't know but i would guess that the chinese central government appears to be more effective than the american central government because we have some like values that we tried to uphold that get in the way of a central government you know enacting rules and results and the chinese don't the chinese government and chinese leadership doesn't really have those constraints is that is that true for china well i think that the difference there is right uh the style of government's very different in china there is one source of power one source of control and everything flows from the top down but recently i wrote a long medium post if you're interested in it you can find out medium um about the politics of the internet and the role of crypto in that future and what i think is really interesting is what china has the us doesn't have and that europe certainly doesn't have is an unlimited amount of political will and an unlimited amount of capital that they are willing to spend for absolute dominance right and that's not what we don't have that in america we don't have that we barely have that we barely have the capability to do semiconductor r d and chip fab here in the united states and in fact our government's now trying to invest in bringing those capabilities back on shore because we have recognized that after two decades of exporting our technology and exporting the production of technology that's been built with ip originating here in america we are at a major disadvantage europe doesn't have a leg to stand on that's why they're having to use huawei right to develop their 5g infrastructure the us i think in one smart move hit huawei with ricoh charges would kind of have stopped that 5g effort but the u.s is in the progress of implementing an explicit american firewall and and that by the way like when you're on the internet right we don't actually think about where internet comes from just like we don't think about where power comes from but like internet isn't this magic ethereal substance and one thing it's not in the air no it comes from physical things right there's physical infrastructure that supports the backbone of the internet and the sports it you know getting to your router and then being available in your house but also there's routing logic there are protocols that dictate how traffic gets routed on the internet and as traffic is being routed through this network topology that makes up the modern world wide web right which is in fact many different webs that are highly localized that have been stitched together through shared protocols and through this routing logic there are a lot of different interaction points where people can sniff that traffic can interrupt that traffic can do things like man-in-the-middle attacks and replace information in that traffic with other information and so i think the area that crypto needs to go next and what i'm really excited about is we need to come a bit out of this esoteric highly intellectualized digital realm and start thinking about the physical infrastructure that supports the backbone of the cryptocurrency industry this is why i think bitcoin mining is really interesting we do a lot of research on this we spend a lot of time on it but also the physical infrastructure supporting ethereum the physical infrastructure supporting these new protocols like all of this is really really important because if we don't own this physical infrastructure and find ways to secure it then attacks on bitcoin become possible but so long as we can find ways to secure this physical infrastructure and minimize the ability of all world governments to collectively take down these networks by taking all of the nodes offline right there is not going to be a feasible way for governments to shut this down okay so we've kind of answered like that that i guess objection um and you've you've laid out this this backdrop melting of like the wtf just happened we've got this technology change we've got this economic change with wealth disparity we've got baby boomers getting older their stocks have inflated we've got these political changes and then we've got this cultural change which is kind of like the millennials you know almost almost rising up and shifting the asset class somewhere else bitcoin just hit all-time highs as far as market cap um ether's price is hold on let's make a bold unsubstantiated prediction because i want to manifest a little shot here too let's do that let's tap 20k by uh before thanksgiving this is like my goal top 20k before

monday yeah before thanksgiving because if we don't then if we ship it after we could just go in and edit like and we've got to verify this on the blockchain obviously or else you know who knows we are we are the propaganda we are the politburo for bitcoin and ether and for this industry like let's get better at creating narratives and creating mythology i think sometimes we get way too internally focused like i don't need to to proselytize and like preach to people who are already in my version of reality because we're all already here i need to get everyone outside of this industry to believe that what we're doing is reality because in that process it becomes reality right i think that's something that by the way um because you know david and i dabble a lot in the ethereum community right that's something that the ethereum community that's something that the ethereum community needs to learn from bitcoiners because i think bitcoiners are just absolutely and at this at meme propagation and at the social layer of the stack and money itself and finance itself is so much as we talked about like a social social movement here right right like we all need to raise the flag and get better at this if this is the future we want meaning it into existence is part of getting to that future but i don't want to actually i want to be careful here there has to be substance backing it up yes right which which i think is there memes are based on reality exactly right um and i think what's interesting you know there are a lot of different um types of ways you can make different realities sort of appear and come into fruition and i i do think the ethereum community needs to get better at creating a larger vision that's that's more inclusive um but i also think like this ra weird feuding between bitcoin and ethereum like it has to stop why do people care so much about what other people are doing like i love that i love the bitcoin community and in my heart like in my heart i am a bitcoiner i wouldn't say i'm a bitcoin maximalist right i call my i used to call myself a  coin minimalist now i don't know if i can say that any longer um because i do think that that there are real things happening on other protocols and we're kind of reaching this point where like some of these things we've been talking about are starting to become more real um but at the end of the day like we need to stop fighting each other this is exactly what's happening with politics in this country right like the democrats and republicans are so busy fighting each other that we forgot to fight all of the corporations who are trying to control our minds and i sound like a crazy person that's a little bit of an exaggeration but they're so busy hitting us against each other that we forget the bigger battle that we're fighting same thing in the crypto industry like ryan david i don't agree with you probably on fifty percent of the stuff you say mm-hmm arguing over the fifty percent of stuff we disagree on like there are a lot of things we do agree on yeah and we both agree on a future where cryptocurrencies have a way more prominent role to play in our society and our culture in technology and in infrastructure and while we may disagree on the details of that if we agree on the same direction then we should focus on finding ways to move the world in that direction because it's too early to be fighting about details right well and i don't mean to point fingers or to place blame um and because that's antithetical to the exact type of like culture that we want this is a good opener yeah it's yeah it's interesting it's like you're about to say you're making an excuse for something you're about to say the most extreme of so like i view bitcoin as a the bitcoin culture has a bunch of concentric circles right and like the innermost are like the extremists right the most extreme bitcoiners like the the dan helds the pierre richards uh the people that think anything that isn't bitcoin is a scam right they kind of force the conversation into being an adversarial conversation because if you believe in anything other than bitcoin you are by definition like a coiner or a scammer or wait hold on why do you care what these people say or think because they will because they dominate the bitcoin conversation they what they don't i think about what version of reality are you living in well here richard who is fantastically smart and has some of the best ideas who's also an extreme hardliner about bitcoin uh is one of the most listened to individuals in the bitcoin community uh and so i'm in the bitcoin community and i don't feel that way at all yes and i that's and i agree with your distinction between bitcoiner and bitcoin maximalists right and so like if you move out from the concentric circle of extremity you i find people like you and nick carter and people that use data and math and are a little bit more uh moderate in their extremity about about bitcoin and the move the more you wait am i still an extremist though i can't i can't figure out where i'm am i getting categorized in like which you should okay you should categorize yourself yeah so you're not a maximalist so if pierre and dan are like in the ninth circle of bitcoin maximalism like what's circle like to use a dante allegory intelligent here we read books what circle am i in would you say well i i think maybe that answer the question the answer to that question comes from like what do you think the second largest market cap cryptocurrency can be in relation to bitcoin like do you think bitcoin is going to be 80 of the world of the market cap of all crypto assets combined or is it gonna be something more moderate or like where does bitcoin do does bitcoin suck up all the value a little bit of the value how much error does bitcoin suck up i think answers that question oh but but also like this this conversation is kind of a silly conversation to have if we don't attach time scale to it sure right so one of the interesting questions that came up on twitter and a few people had sort of mentioned this when i asked people like what do you want us to talk about one thing that people wanted us to talk about is like why do you guys get so triggered talk about bitcoin in public treasury don't though yeah that came from i can't remember wait if you if you can dish it you gotta take it so like let's let's take it a little here um i love criticism i think it's a great way to highlight flaws in your own thinking and by the way like people criticize me all the time being a woman on the internet is hilarious because everything you do is subject to like 10 additional layers of scrutiny and i've gotten a lot of criticism over the years it's actually been really informative because it has helped me realize that there are places where like i haven't examined my own thinking and i've had to ask myself some hard questions and like i think being open to changing your mind is one of the greatest skills you can have and unfortunately i think a lot of people in the crypto space instead of being open to changing their minds just double down yes very much you have to be open to changing your mind so here's my view on all of this right bitcoin right now is the dominant asset because number one bitcoin is really unique like i do believe that in a pantheon of all cryptocurrencies bitcoin occupies an extremely unique place uh there's so many things about bitcoin that are just impossible to replicate and this is a lot of what i talked about in um the testimony i gave last year when i had the opportunity you know to be one of the representatives of our industry and hopefully try to make us look you know intelligent and practical i don't know if i achieved it i tried but i think um you know bitcoin really is unique and in terms of knowledge right and in terms of understanding bitcoin by far has the largest mind share of of writing of um data right like the ability to analyze the bitcoin network the ability to understand the economics of bitcoin mining the depth of the bitcoin market um the depth of the options market the derivatives market the depth of just intellectual gravity that is going into bitcoin is very very deep and bitcoin is the topic like i come from the commodities world when i first started learning about bitcoin i got it right away right because bitcoin in so many ways everything about it resembles uh a commodity right it's a digital commodity in my view i think other things like ethereum the surface area is so vast and i think even within the ethereum community like there is really no consistent narrative that's really easy to latch on to it's going to take people much more time to understand where in their mental model something like ethereum or another asset fits bitcoin is right now much easier for people to place and this goes back to mental models right when i think about the world like i have all these different little categories and in each category there's sort of a dominant category leader that comes to mind that occupies a lot of my mind share so like i think about electric cars what comes to mind when i say the word electric cars tesla it's always tesla tesla when i say space to you what do you think about uh spacex yeah right yeah i love that he made the rocket look like the rocket emoji yeah i know like the man has style and i am so into it style is underrated by the way we need way more style he does a great job memeing his own success into existence speaking of mimi and i know david wants to answer your question but i want to ask you a question to like um figure out what what circle you're in melbourne so would you say for instance this is my accident well david has his acid test but so my asset test is would you say that eth is a coin because i think ninth circle people yeah definitely say that right but like what's your answer to that uh no i mean i don't think ethan's a coin um i have ether in my portfolio and i i'm perfectly happy you have queens in your portfolio yeah they're all on my website okay so what's your definition of coin then because to me a definition of  coin is something you don't have in your portfolio look i think the word  coin gets thrown around really loosely um and maybe you know i myself have really enjoyed using this term i believe that about a year and a half ago you know i brought a toilet onto stage and and through gold coins remember that i have no apologies i'm again you know what we started the pre-podcast with is like i have three rules in life right number one i wanna make money number two i wanna have fun and number three i wanna learn something but also have more fun and all of those three things are kind of related so um look yes there were a lot of pointless garbage coins that have no reason for existing but i think that um money right makes it possible and like resources generally speaking beyond just financial capital but like social capital and intellectual capital can take things that start out as not meaningful not interesting and give them depth and gravity and they evolve right again and things change over time nothing is static and nothing exists in a vacuum and what i think's been really interesting to watch about ethereum ethereum has really found a really interesting use case with everything happening in d5 um i just spent the last three days hosting the coin shares crypto credit summit it was awesome and a lot of the conversation was about what's being built the financial applications and financial products being built on top of ethereum so i think again you know um as the as things mature as people find these different narratives and draw out these different narratives and build on these different narratives as financial capital flows into these ecosystems and allows people to build more there's sort of this relationship right or like you start with an idea and it can be crazy idea and then a little bit of capital flows in and that capital allows them to produce things and then more capital pours in which allows you to produce even more things and there's sort of this recursive wheel where more capital facilitates more building which facilitates more capital flowing in and i think that's what's going on with a lot of these newer projects that i maybe a year or two ago would have called coins right because at that point like they were ideas and they were trading at ridiculous valuations the other thing that i think is important to keep in mind is i think we have an obsession with price in this industry right and we always talk about price like price points like we need to stop it's hard to not think about price right and my rule number one is like i want to make money like i'm not doing this out of charity i love working in this industry i can't imagine working anywhere else but like let's be real all of us are also here because we think we can make a livelihood here and like be successful here but i think what's what's been interesting to see is like this obsession with price um leads to this environment where people are trying to justify the price for something and here's a really interesting thing if we look at the stock market today like look at the stock of zoom or even the stock of tesla right tesla produces less cars than any other car manufacturer in the world yet their valuation based on their stock price is higher than every single other automaker in the world combined now if i looked at tesla's stock price as a rational human being using a price driven sort of fundamental value driven investor model like benjamin graham style value investor i would say tesla stock is way too expensive it's way too overvalued but we don't live in that world anymore right this is the mental model shift that's happened so this is where i think this obsession with trying to rationalize something whether something is cheap or too expensive or under hyped or over hyped is so stupid because there is no way to put a price on on this right and we don't live in that world anymore because value investing has gone out the window it went out the window like 12 months ago totally great so my second follow-up question to that so if ethan's not a coin do you think that it is possible maybe not likely but do you think the possibility exists that ether as an asset could accrue some sort of a monetary premium at bitcoin as bitcoin so clearly has yeah uh look i see a lot of discussion about this like is ether money um there are a few people who are like every time i mention ethereum they're like ether is money is that you david i i don't think it's me in there okay so um i will be very candid um right now i don't i don't view ether in that way and like i said i hold in my portfolio i use ether um to engage in in different activities like in the world of d5 right and it's been a really useful form of collateral because it's highly useful in this defy universe right um i think time will tell whether or not ether becomes a store of value but i don't treat my ether in the same way that i treat my bitcoin like i i don't really sell my bitcoin i don't really trade most of my bitcoin i just hold it because to me bitcoin is savings technology now five years ago i did send bitcoin right i had like the first uh bitcoin credit card the shift card and i bought stuff with it and i was like i tried i i did an estimate recently of like how much money i spent trying out all the different apps and like getting built on bitcoin over the last five it's real sad and real looking at those numbers yes and no i mean i ended up investing in some of those companies which i've gone on to do very well so hopefully that will make up for it but like it's kind of scary i don't view ether in the same way i don't have the same like feeling of hurt when i spend ether that doesn't mean that won't change but right now in my mind not yet and i don't know if it will be and that's okay i think that's totally okay mm-hmm milton what do you think though wait hold on what circle am i on ryan i so so you are definitely not in ninth circle right that is pure maximalism that is pure everything else besides bitcoin is a coin i think that um vitalik is a scammer like bankless pot like bankless podcast sucks and by the way we love bitcoin on bank list just like let that be known and we say it all the time by the way but um so you're not there you're clearly not there um you are seem open to the possibility that something other than bitcoin could accrue a monetary premium you find it unlikely it hasn't yet for you you wouldn't say is money so you're look you're a bitcoin you're like you're not a maximalist you're somewhere in the outer perimeter i would say it's awesome in my opinion yeah me too but look here's the thing right again let's go back to where we started this whole podcast like my view of the world is informed by the reality i consume and this is why i actually want to talk about a topic that is really important it's really important to have a circle of people around you that influence you that are different from you in every sense of that word right like different life experience live in a different part of the world speak a different language have had different life experiences have a different view i love listening to people who when i listen to them i'm like oh  that like no because when you have such a visceral reaction to something really what you're reacting to is what that person is making you feel and typically when someone makes you feel something so extreme and so visceral it's because you recognize some truth in what they're saying and that truth is incompatible with your view of reality and so in order like and again like part of this is also understanding that in order for you to grow as a person you have to have the flexibility to change and evolve as the world around you changes and evolves and i think i unfortunately when i started working in crypto professionally i worked in a place where there was a view that ethereum was not worth spending time on i did not share that view but i spent three years in that sort of mentality which had i think um when i left that environment i was like wait a minute like i don't know why i believed these things i don't agree with these things it was part of the the reason i left that environment like i don't share these world views i don't share this philosophy and in my view like my job is i'm an investor right and as an investor if i don't have the ability to change my mind as the world changes and as new information emerges then i'm not doing my job because i'm going to miss things by being intellectually inflexible so i'm not arguing one way or the other what i'm arguing for is like openness pragmatism and like take time to consume different versions of reality take time to understand someone else's view of reality because if you don't you're going to miss a lot of things milton have has anyone have you has anyone pitched to you at the bankless thesis uh i actually pitched that same thesis yeah uh but i don't call it that okay wait so what's the bankless thesis to you okay so here's my thesis a lot of people spend a lot of time on like oh i want to make bitcoin institutional like i want institutions to adopt bitcoin and i say no bitcoin is going to change institutions and bitcoin will have to evolve their models to function in a world of cryptocurrencies right of bitcoin and so my view is like instead of having these monolithic institutions where you know they own your assets and you have the privilege of interacting with your assets when they allow you to you will engage service providers to provide services to the assets that you own that you hold when you choose how you choose in the way you choose um so the way i sort of uh verbalize that is trade where you trade what you want with who you want where you want clear and margin where you want settle where you want okay so a world without intermediaries right a world that's in the hands of the individual yes right so is that is that the same thesis yeah that yeah that's it's that's different from how i would how i would pitch it but yeah that's the gist of it the the what what me and ryan really focus on is like bitcoin is fine fantastic digital scarcity is is a wonderful new invention um however the bitcoin blockchain the actual technology layer is relatively constrained and uh what we are worried about is that those constraints um push people out to the margins of bitcoin rather than being able to be inside bitcoin right uh and so like engaging i want to be inside of a bitcoin how do i get it let us know what that [Laughter] so like so like if people if bitcoin becomes the world's currency uh it's it's not it's i don't see how people can engage at the l1 layer like they i will have to send you my bitcoins via coinbase via paypal and that's not bank list that is using an intermediary to settle transactions off chain and then i don't agree with you okay i don't agree with you at all okay look we've just spent this whole time talking about like evolution right an evolution of ideas um look where bitcoin is at now is a function of where our culture is at where our world is at and like what our behavior is right it typically takes one to two decades for humans to change their behavior right this thing came out 12 years ago your iphone you're pulling out your iphone you should you should upgrade milton [Laughter] it's not 12 years old is it wait hold on look i still have one of these the ones with one camera on them oh my god was that before you were born david oh my goodness when the iphone started right i didn't really know what to use it for because the app store didn't really exist the app ecosystem didn't exist like iphones weren't a thing but now i have a super computer in my pocket and i do all sorts of stuff with it right i think where bitcoin is at right now is partially a function of like our mental model and how much change we can absorb right and we can't absorb all of the change all at once like we're just now getting to the point where people are even willing to contemplate that something other than the dollar could exist like we're just at that point we're just like getting started right so i think this this narrative that bitcoin can't scam bitcoin can't do this is a little bit short-sighted it's the same thing as someone saying like oh ethereum can never be money right no if i'm willing to entertain that i think you should be willing to entertain the possibility that's because you're handsome i do think bitcoin can scale i do think that bitcoin can achieve its maximum banklessness potential and i think i see the the easiest path for bitcoin to do that the way that the water flows downhill is by doing it on ethereum because ethereum offers all of this uh intermediary free uh financial infrastructure that bitcoin wants and so i think bitcoin on ethereum is the easiest path for bitcoin to scale right like ethereum is pushing the envelope on scaling technologies ethereum is pushing technologies on disintermediated financial infrastructure all the cool financial uh innovations that's based off of cryptography is happening on ethereum and there's no reason why we can't just take the bitcoins hold on no that statement is categorically false oh boy let's get into it okay saying all cool cryptographic innovations happening on top of ethereum is false yeah that was that was uh uh uh what's the word unsubstantiated and bold claim yeah i'm gonna get in there i'm gonna bring some receipts all right categorically and correct right and that's fine we can agree to disagree that's the thing i'm not here to convince you that my view of the world is correct and you're not here to convince me that your view of the world is correct i'm kidding good luck but i think what we are here to do is find where our visions for the future are similar and like we have the exact same view for the future right we just disagree on where it's gonna happen what it might look like and who and where and how and why and what which is all important but like i totally i totally agree with that right so the same vision you know pro pro cryptography pro self sovereignty right like this is core stuff and 100 aligned the the the disagreement or the question is like how do we get there but i want to ask another acid test question malcolm so is unit swap cool or is it really stupid and does it suck what do you think about uniswap wait is that a real question that's a real that's a real question yeah yeah unislop is so cool why is it cool all right tell us why it's cool okay we think so too we agree no okay so uniswap actually proves out something really really interesting that blows people's minds when i explain it to them like traditional finance people who are accustomed to like trading on a venue right what's so cool about uniswap is anyone can list anything and trade anything with anyone right that is cool that is so cool i don't understand people who are like that's not cool like the token and all the dan held about this then we don't have to get into like okay you know what kraken should spend their time building a better trading engine that's spicy spicy whoa sorry but like some spicy takes spicy emoji but look it's v but why are we spending time like ripping other people apart i know why because it's really easy to do and i'm guilty of this myself from time to time like sometimes i really rip stuff apart and afterwards i kind of feel bad and then i'm like okay we all do it right because it's easier to tear things down than it is to build things up all right if it's confession time i may have said some bad things about lightning all right not lightning excuse me also lightning but that came to mind but litecoin yeah confession time i've said some bad things about it i mean i don't think anyone's coming to you after you go on that one though okay okay so so why does litecoin exist i'm sorry why is it pumping in this bubble market still okay i think because retail's coming retail is here david's excited about that and i just it makes me so sad to be honest to see litecoin pumping in this but here's my thing like can litecoin and like be cash whatever other dumb assets have like somehow survived the last five years can they just like drop out of the top 10 or top 20 just because random ogs lots of money still own these things can they just like go it's so stupid i'm like we need it i want that for hat yeah i i i want that that's okay of defy tokens defy tokens needed let's talk about defines the only blue coins okay so let's talk about d5 so and the pink one the one pink one uni we'll laugh swap unit swap is super cool right um how about d phi writ large cool scam super cool i've like written a lot about d5 talked about a lot we do some cool stuff with with d5 i've been investing in d5 projects like super cool huge fan of zapper i'm an investor in that like love what zapper has done crazy cool um huge fan of uniswap obviously huge fan of like hedgic and yifi i uh don't own either hedrick or yifi but i think what they're doing is super cool like what i like about the d5 space they're pros and cons right like first of all d5 is super immature right it's it's all experiments and like oh some of them are not good and there are rug poles and i think there are people who are like poorly intentioned there's a great meme there's two great memes um i'll post them on twitter but there's one where it's like someone whispering in someone's ear saying defy and then a picture of like arms uh hair on someone's arms standing up it's one of my favorite means like defy so hot and when you say the word d5 people are like oh dude i love d5 i've seen that happen to david in real life actually yeah i think it might be his uh this is a mutual it might be his favorite promise to never say that like if i whispered your nipples get hard you could try it wait a second i need to turn off my camera the second meme that i love is like this giant um like vat of water has a hole in it and there is a guy who just slaps a piece of tape on it and is so we are d5 so like all these random like coins that don't do anything are now trying to become defined they're like we're defy tron is d5 baby we're big believers tron's what about wait what about cd5 that's oh that's my favorite yeah yeah centralized defy that's we're relevant finance look all of these things like this again is kind of an issue of semantics right the way i view d5 is like i think defy has opened people's eyes to the possibilities of what can be built using blockchain networks and assets on blockchain networks definitely um the practical realities are that defy and its current substantiation has some challenges right and some of those are being worked on some of those challenges are you know going to be very difficult to resolve and that's that's fine right and and we'll see what happens in what direction it evolves in um so my view is like again as an investor if i'm not looking at d5 i'm not doing my job if i'm not like you like i love yield farming yield farming's super cool we actually had to rewrite some of our internal policies to allow people at coin shares to yield farmer i think that was fine that's that's got to go with like you know number one rule number one is make money right yield farming is a great opportunity to make money but just like i was spending bitcoin back in the day right like trying out all these different bitcoin apps like if i'm not using these products and services if i'm not like engaging with them at that level if i'm not yield farming if i'm not trying to like do jenna lp and like figure this stuff out i'm missing things i am i am going to have fundamental gaps in my understanding and you can't be dismissive of everything that doesn't conform with your own very narrow view of the world so like i tried out twitch a few months ago like the bitcoin cash or like the bsv thing it's like their social messaging app and everyone on twitter was like did they pay you to tweet that like you i can't yeah that's the bitcoin maximalism that we don't we that we don't enjoy here you should see my dms people were like you are dirty coin i was like sure they were pleasant that's terrible so so so melted how do you get to a point where you are so limited in your thinking that someone even engaging with something that like turns you off right it inspires that type of reaction like it's wild to me that people are that crazy yes you need to relax yes because according to the inner circle of bitcoinerism like bitcoin is a jealous god right like you you play in a different ecosystem and then you're committing blasphemy right no no but here's the thing we're now finally getting to the point where people recognize like bitcoin is not a personality hmm it's just a technology it's just a it's a subluxation you have to be a person like right just tweeting like i'd hate these people just like tweet random about bitcoin like michael saylor's tweets drive me nuts i'm just like it's so chattish i'm like this is so stupid so michael sailor's done for bitcoin but i'm just like please stop like bitcoin's not a personality please be a person first and foremost like bitcoin can be a huge part of your identity but you can't be a bitcoin your final form is not becoming a big when i evolved to my final like spiritual form i will actually become a big become a bit yeah wow are you an etherean an etherean um i don't know look i don't i don't feel the need to identify myself as anything i'm melting right right but you want a big quality i'm a bitcoiner mm-hmm i'm a melton bitcoiner yeah okay a part-time uh troll i i do think but actually not troll shitposter i prefer that term um i'm really good at memes i have been dropping some dank memes lately they slap i'm into that love it love love the dank memes that's how we propagate all right so we do that that's how we spawn our friend our friend pomp uh come on the show pop why is it wasn't pompous show anyway he would say that um all this cool all this stuff on ethereum is going to be basically pushed ported to bitcoin and bitcoin will basically you know build its own unit swap build its own defy ecosystem what's your take on that perspective yeah look um that could happen um i don't see that happening right now or in the near future though just because there's some like just really fundamental challenges that that make that difficult um but look again i have a lot of respect for pomp i actually think he's super consistent and he does a great job getting people amped up with like very simple messages and he's just consistent like bitcoin fixes this the virus is spreading like he's very good for piffy one-liners and people love it right so like kudos to him much respect everyone is entitled to their perspective everyone's entitled to their views i don't have to agree with everyone but like me disagreeing with you ryan and david doesn't mean that i don't respect your perspectives as a person right you disagreeing with me as malcolm doesn't mean that you disrespect me as a person right and again i think people and people on the internet generally have a hard time finding this line right i can disagree with someone i can disagree with someone politics i can disagree with someone's views on on crypto i can disagree with their views on what the future will look like but it doesn't mean that i deny that person the right to believe what they believe right like we are not judge jury or executioner the whole point of cryptocurrencies is permissionless financial innovation and so to me what's so ridiculous is how statist people will be they're like oh my god you rug pulled like called the sec i'm like why are you here why are you here trying to be judge jury and executioner you can't say out one side of your mouth we want to be permissionless financial innovation and then in the very same breath like call for financial regulation those are two ideologically incompatible views and i don't think people recognize their own hypocrisy i recognize my own hypocrisy i have a lot of incompatible world views but i recognize them and i work on them and i try to understand how i arrive at a place where like my worldview can be more consistent it makes sense but i think a lot of people just never take a step back and ask themselves like does what i am saying actually makes sense i think we solved it i think we solved crypto tribalism here and now we just solved it but it's really fun like spectacles are fun i believe in bread and circuses right so that's what's going on in this country right now we have a circus it's called the trump presidency right and we have bread they're just gonna give money to people like bread and circuses are a great way to keep the population from knowing what's actually going on and over time the spectacles will just get bigger so people are here for the spectacle like come for the bitcoin stay for the drama it's all good that's exactly what michael saylor did absolutely so so melton uh like bitcoin is uh pushing up on 19 000 like the the all-time highs are in sight meanwhile over the last three years the industry has built out the infrastructure that is going to make it really really easy for institutions to access bitcoin right like back in 2017 that didn't exist it was hard for an institution to wait hold on before we go down why do we care about institutions i really want to stop stop talking about like white boomer dudes buying bitcoin like what should they have a lot because they have a lot of money though that's why we care a little bit and i would love for them to buy my well i'm not selling them my bitcoin they can buy my other best but like it i don't understand the obsession with institutions um because what people are saying is it would be really cool if like ray dalio bought bitcoin and then took bitcoin and put it in a vault at b y melon and got a little paper receipt for it that's what we do in banking today like that's not cool that's stupid oh yeah i mean we're totally totally i would he should buy it and put it on his ledger is what he should do i mean he shouldn't like he shouldn't put it in the banking system that's probably a little dangerous for for ray not financial advice but nothing on his podcast is financial advice by the way nobody should take it's not even advice it's not even advice at all it's banter it is somewhat informed banter but also david making a lot of unsubstantiated [Laughter] i think where david was going with this question it's less institutions but like more like where are we headed next right right so we just we're hitting these all-time highs already yeah it's not the end of 2020 the decade's getting crazy you outlined all the macro stuff for us what's next in 2021 and beyond okay um so there's two ways to interpret that question what there's what i would like to be next like my version of reality that i'm trying to manifest over here in my little corner of the world and then there's probabilistically speaking what is more likely to have to happen right okay which one do you want to do first let's start with your your version of the future okay so my version of the future is a like i think cryptocurrency at this moment in time and really bitcoin and i apologize for like really focusing on bitcoin but right now bitcoin is just at a very interesting point and the bitcoin narrative was made for the the world we're living in right now right in this minute right um i think we're at a point where people all around the world are looking at our financial system are looking at economies are looking at assets and well what i go back to is like my experience working corporate treasury right at exxon mobil which when i worked there was the largest company in the world no longer is like not even close right as a corporate treasurer um my job was to optimize um the the cost of capital a right keep the cost of capital low so make sure that we could access debt at zero cost basically and two was to maximize the opportunity cost of capital meaning that you know if i have a hundred dollars sitting here i can earn return with that hundred dollars so how do i optimize and get the best risk return adjusted um sort of profile for those assets right i don't want to put them in something super high risk where i might lose all my money or i might 10 exit but i also don't just want to leave it there when i could be earning return with it and so uh in 2013 swaz i could make a pretty good clip two to three percent trading short term treasuries basically very low risk return that doesn't exist anymore rates are zero in some places rates are negative fully one quarter of the world's sovereign debt is negative yielding and that number will only increase we are in a zero interest rate environment the way we allocate capital has to change and investment committees don't respond quickly right like if you've ever been in an investment committee meeting or in a risk review meeting with a large bank or a large investor it takes them 18 24 36 months to make changes because it takes a long time so people are like in march people are like oh my god bitcoin is going to boom because inflation i'm like things don't happen on that time scale like in november or in april of next year they'll have their annual risk review meeting they'll have their annual allocation strategy meeting and they'll talk about maybe allocating right but it doesn't happen like the very next day i think what is happening what's very real is people look at the world around them inflation target is 2.5 meaning every year my dollars buy me 2.5 percent less my risk-free rate of return is zero and will be zero forever for the foreseeable future so what can i do with my money that will allow me to at least keep pace with inflation and potentially earn a return because there's no way that the government's gonna fund my retirement i know that for a fact so what do i do with my money and i think people are looking at bitcoin because there aren't a lot of places left to put the absolute load of money that is out in the world that needs to earn return people are buying pokemon cards right a few weeks ago logic the rapper like bought the most expensive pokemon card ever people were buying classic cars people were buying houses people are buying wine people are buying like these esoteric assets people are buying nfts right people are trying to find places to stash cash that will help them at least keep pace with inflation but also potentially earn a return that opportunity is going away in a lot of places and so again i think this is where bitcoin is such a beautiful beautiful story because bitcoin has the capacity to absorb significant amounts of capital the markets are really liquid and robust the infrastructure available to institutions is very robust so i'm very excited and then that's what i was saying you said the institution word look but this is this is the practical reality right this is the practical reality like what you said ray dalio is not going to sit there with a ledger and like type in his eight digit passcode do you really think that's gonna happen like he probably doesn't he probably doesn't even write his own emails right like he has people who do that for him the man is extremely wealthy like he's not gonna sit there with a little ledger and like unbank himself why would he do that he would definitely lose his private keys at least once wait didn't peter shift lose his private keys i think that was a new idea stunt to get engagement out of bitcoin i think he's been doing that for years he's actually my my favorite no coiner i kind of like peter schiff being in the space like now that nouriel roubini believes in bitcoin we don't have anyone to like hate wait wait yes muriel believes in bitcoin yeah nouriel roubini is now a bitcoiner did you no he's not that well yeah i miss i missed that memo how did i miss that when did that happen like we're talking about the same guy like american economist you know testifies in congress like how i feel like you know you're praising i'm kidding no niryangi like um has a lot of degrees and qualifications he has a lot of pieces of paper um yes what made him change he bought some bitcoin yeah he's friends with a lot of bitcoiners um yeah but but look uh people are gonna change their minds i don't know where i was going i'm starting to ramble i'm to stop talking yeah so we're headed you know yeah but but look at the same time what is going to happen is i think there's a massive crackdown coming um look at the end of the day like what governments want is control and governments are losing control in many ways um and we're in an interesting part of the cycle where like the mob has started to like government's no longer rule mobs of people rule right and so um governments are losing power we're seeing the era of the nation state i think the experiment of democratic nation states certainly like sort of reaching a natural denouement or ending point um and something new is going to emerge the question is what will it be i have a lot of hope and a lot of optimism around that being you know more technocratic society where cryptocurrencies particularly bitcoin play a greater role but again there's a lot of uncertainty in like how that might evolve but look there are a lot of glimmers of hope and as i've said before right every ending is a beginning and i think um there are going to be a lot of endings over the next decade and when things end we need to be in a place where we can build new things that are more inclusive that are more open uh that are more egalitarian and when i say egalitarian i mean a quality of access right equality of opportunity um i can't make people who make poor choices make better choices i can only give them a quality of access and then if it's like leading the horse to water right i'm like hey bitcoin at 200 like you should get some bitcoin they're like no it's too expensive and then i do it again at 2000 they're like too expensive and now they're like oh my god why didn't you tell me to bitcoin to buy bitcoin i'm like i can't help you because you refuse to help yourself all i can do is show you the door and give you the information and encourage you to walk through it but i can't make you do it and so i think that's kind of where industry needs to go is like let's build things that make it possible for this world we want to exist that's more egalitarian that provides a quality of access and let's take governments and companies and regulators and people to place where they can walk through that door but if they choose not to right like we can't force people to right and this is this entire realism is uh unless we can enslave people and like some crypto citadel and then they have to i don't know i'm sure somebody would be interested in that i mean this entire industry is based off of uh empowering self-empowerment and self-responsibility right and so you can you can you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them buy bitcoin you know i was going to say if you have a big enough stick maybe we want to thank you for coming on the bankless podcast and also for being a part of our first video podcast everything else is usually not done on on video so again if you guys uh watched or listened to the podcast you missed out on some of melton's graphics and infographics that she shared in the in the beginning so don't miss that but before we go meltem uh do you you have a price prediction after all of this reflexivity in bitcoin and institutions come and buy all that bitcoin and ray dalio gets his ledger where is where's bitcoin's price wait david david david hold on you're asking the easy question we want to know where bitcoin is but we also want to know where where ether price is yeah that was gonna go that was gonna come next yeah okay so uh i i'm a big fan of um howard mark's the investor um at oaktree and uh he has a great saying which is you either name a price or no date or you name a date and no price and that way you're never wrong so i'm gonna go with i'm gonna take that advice my price target for bitcoin is a hundred and fifty thousand dollars not gonna attach a date to it my price target for ether is twenty five hundred dollars i'm not going to attach a date to it okay but is that in one cycle or is that cheating on the whole date thing i have no comments okay fair enough i plead the fifth while we still have the tip that would have plead it because i'm pretty sure in the future we won't have it anymore okay melt him if there was if what should the listener so is you you've kind of given a few call-to-actions like like uh right to your senator to to make sure that we preserve encryption so elect better representatives stop collecting boomers what's what's the lowest hanging fruit that a listener can do to help this world forward uh just get get involved in like whatever capacity feels comfortable to you i think the biggest thing is like have an open mind and be open to the idea that your experience of reality is about to change in a radical way that has never led me wrong super cool great advice meltdown this has been a really fun conversation uh like really fun did you expect that or were you like  well when we were coordinating you on the podcast uh the email that you sent in response i i messaged ryan is like oh yeah she's she's coming in hot yeah so and you did it's it's been a lot of fun and i think people don't usually get this kind of conversation between different um communities and crypto talking about what they hopefully we now at the end of this conversation maybe we've moved from a we agree on 50 to 51 percent that was like the true goal of this conversation that's enough for consensus that's enough it depends on what protocol you're talking about in some instances you need 66 or maybe even 80. you've studied up you have studied up you've prepared that sounds like staking talk to me like i i have interests outside of just the narrow realm of of bitcoin although the realm of bitcoin is actually quite expansive and like really infinitely interesting there's a lot there and i think we agree on the overall bankless thesis let's say let's get the banks and intermediaries out so that is good so maybe milton's bankless maybe that's right i'm working on it it's very hard to become bankless in america though uh it's not very easy uh the last thing i want to say to everyone listening um if you disagree with anything i've said and you want to argue with me feel free to dm me on twitter i am at melt underscore dem open invitation i have open dms and if you want to you know alter my perception of reality please come and be my guest i love it how much time do you have never engaging with people in your dms who want to argue with you that's something i try to avoid i know i find it fun and you know what the thing is like with most people you can find something to agree on i always like to start by finding things to agree on and then i think it makes disagreements like less scary well very good guys and and mel would you be able to share those slides that you put at the beginning is there a link that we can put in the show notes somewhere yeah there are a few links i i do like a lot of different presentations so i'll share with you a few different links where people can check stuff out um yeah all right guys here here's the thing uh action items of course you can dm melt them at your discretion in particularly really if you disagree with her david might be doing that after the podcast i don't even know uh we will also include a link to some of the coin share slides that she shared in the show notes go check those out we also of course always appreciate 5 star reviews on itunes so make sure you do that get us top of the charts last thing risks and disclaimers none of this was financial advice i hope we expressed that sufficiently maybe it wasn't even advice yeah no it was neither a solicitation buy or sell securities i just want to make that very clear not a solicitation not tax advice please talk to a lawyer do your own research if you have any questions i am bound by the coin shares disclosures and disclaimers which are linked in my twitter bio guys never work for a regulated company it's the worst you took you took the words right out of my mouth uh of course with crypto you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey for everyone thanks a lot take care does the wagon have a door we're mixing metaphors here we can't stay you can slip in the back i think this podcast's over guys i think we're done here you can lift the little flap and like is that a door is a flap a door it's a flap do we need to have a podcast on this but i need to i need to delve into the history of doors
