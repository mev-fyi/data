bagless nation welcome to the first weekly roll-ups round i am ryan shawn adams i'm here with david hoffman my host and we are doing a weekly roll-up david why don't you tell the folks what roll-ups around are going to be yeah the the crypto world is insane it moves way too fast and so we don't really have enough time to talk about it and so what are we doing we're rolling them up we're rolling them up we're going to bundle everything that happens into a week into a 30-minute episode we have five categories that we're going to spend five minutes on each and then a little bit at the end of what we are excited about but we are trying to get as much information into injected into your guys's brains as fast as possible and that's exactly what roll-ups do and so hence roll-up rounds so if you want to catch up on the week that just happened in crypto tune in on fridays that's when we're releasing this we're actually doing a simultaneously simultaneous release on both youtube so you can catch us there we're gonna have graphics we're gonna show you graphs that sort of thing it will also be published on the podcast on friday morning for you podcast listeners so you can enjoy the everything that happened in crypto for the previous week on friday morning with your morning coffee roll-up round and morning coffee sounds pretty good to me absolutely let's get right into it what are we rolling up first ryan all right well so we've got five categories right so we've got market what's the market saying we've got releases what got released we've got news what's happening in the news we've got some hot takes and then lastly we're going to end with what you are what we are excited about so uh first we've got market what is the market saying david we've got five minutes i'm gonna start the uh the timer in five minutes to keep us honest here and let's talk about the first items which is bitcoin and eth price yeah bitcoin is at 11 500 ether is at 378 dollars kind of being relatively flat i would say but there are some really cool things going on behind the scenes uh namely uh along with this uh is the bitcoin hash rate is at an all-time high and so while you know prices this is the first time bitcoin has really sustained above ten thousand dollars which is bullish in of itself but you know it's been here for a while it's being pretty flat but hash rate is at an all-time high and historically what's something that's interesting about miners is that miners tend to be really good traders and so when when they sell bitcoin and when they don't sell bitcoin has historically been really strong signals as to what's been about to happen next so no lack of conviction on behalf of the miners david why should we care about hashrate it's always been like a metric that's like kind of close to the the bottom of my list of of things i personally look up i like to look at like minor revenue and that sort of thing but hash rate matters right why does it matter yeah hashrate is like the shield around bitcoin right and also around ethereum during its proof of work phase right it's the height of the wall that any attacker has to get over right and you know you are as a miner compensated for being a part of that wall right adding a brick to the wall and and also what what hash rate is a really good signal of is skin in the game bets right so like nobody has more at stake than uh with regards to the bitcoin price than miners do right so miners are the most convicted party in bitcoin's system right and so paying attention to what miners are doing is really important and what miners are doing are accumulating more mining hash power which is why hash power is at an all-time high so miners are bullish so we've got bitcoin price above 10k around 1100 uh 11 11 500 we've got eth price at 30 uh 380 so they're both kind of hanging in range but like haven't had a precipitous fault lately pretty bullish i would say at least they're hanging in there through some of this market uncertainty let's talk about total locked value that's another metric that we like to look at particularly in d5 so you can look at it in two ways the first is total locked value of us dollars we're at 11.3 billion right now this is like super close to our all-time high total locked value in d5 protocols what does that mean yeah i think the total was the the peak was 12.2 or something and you know then then d5 took a big tumble but the fact that we are still at 11 you know 11 plus i think is so bullish uh you know yield farming seems to have taken you know a back seat all the liquidity mining mining's paws people aren't like cropping up farms left and right yet the total value locked in defy continues to just march up a goddamn mountain it doesn't it does not seem like it's the mountain you see this yeah this is crazy like if you zoom out and see the the one year on this it is charging up that mountain yeah and maybe i'm biased but i think that if you know we can just extrapolate that what that that slope looks like so much further many many more months into the future so i'm excited for win uh d5 us dollar value locked and d5 breaks 100 billion uh in 2021. all right so that's hanging in there even though defy assets themselves have experienced some some um decline recently some as high as 50 or more also eth locked in d5 is hanging in there too so there's 8.7 million eth locked in d5 you know that's around like seven eight percent of all of uh ether supplies is now locked and that that's hanging pretty steady i would say that's bullish for our thesis around economic bandwidth wouldn't you absolutely and you know i'm going to be really interested to see what happens when staking goes live i don't think it'll have much impact at the start but for some reason i feel like you know eath staking is actually going to add more ether into d5 because of the yields that are possible to be able to be extracted by d5 based on the fact that ether staking offers yields in the first place we also have tornado cash which is doing more and more this is a private um solution for private transactions on ethereum they did 2.7 million in volume last week that's pretty that's pretty good right so what we're looking at here is how many people are using tornado cash in a 24-hour uh you know at the 24 hour level right uh so it was 24 hours not uh 2.7 million in 24 hours wow okay right yeah yeah and so like so there were 66 transactions that you put 100 ether into the 100 ether batch in tornado cache which means that you can get you know you can hide in a crowd of 66 other people uh in with a hundred ether and then come out and come out of that crowd like totally obfuscated uh and you know that that you can stay in that crowd for as long as you want so like it's 66 people the one day and then it's gonna be 120 the next day 180 the next day but the crowd in tornado cash is really strong and so this is a a privacy tool right like we need a lot of ether and we need a lot of people in tornado cash as this like thing that can help people enter and exit in a private manner david we just hit our time for the market section one last thing i'll throw out is in the bankless newsletter uh ben published ben ben benjamin cohen published a brilliant piece on when bitcoin move moon that sort of predicts the the longer term of bitcoin using his predictive models and data science fantastic piece check that out we'll include it in the show notes today let's get to the next topic what got released this week we've got five more minutes on that what should we start with i think we should start with uh the protocol sync thesis which is a uniswap on tradingview i'm not sure this is kind of an atypical protocol sync thesis take but i think it fits i'm counting it are you counting it i'm counting it but what is trading view for people who haven't used it yeah tradingview is kind of the go-to place to look at charts right and they have charts from all different markets all different assets and like are definitely leading the world with cryptocharts and they integrated their first decks right with uniswap so now you can use uniswap or use tradingview to chart things on uniswap right so you know i i've noticed a ton of traders who have gotten into the d5 space in the last three or four months i'm sure they are absolutely stoked about this release yeah like this is a mainstream kind of trading uh you know graphing and analytics uh piece of software that that everyone uses if you're trading stocks if you're trading bonds no matter what you're trading it's like it's like universally used and it's absolutely fantastic and now they're integrating unit swap so if you type in uniswap colon you get to see all of the high i think this is rated by um the most liquidity of markets on uniswap right it's like it's like just like a uh an exchange that just as they would incorporate a centralized exchange now they're incorporating uniswap i'd say that's pretty uh that's compelling evidence for the protocol sync thesis which basically states that these incredibly neutral protocols will kind of sink to the bottom and become the basis of a lot of other things um what else should we talk about in the the new releases what else happened something that's pretty cool is that uh wifey and balancer governance or has been added to maker collateral or i think there's a governance vote for this and so if you are a wifey holder or if you're a balancer holder and maybe you are also an mkr holder you should go vote in the maker governance to get your wi-fi or balancer integrated as collateral in maker dao it's good to see those capital d5 capital assets in there instead of like something like usdc which is like a centralized stable coin that's pretty uh i'm glad maker is moving in that direction now the better assets are on ethereum agreed all right um danny ryan's got something so bounty program for eth2 what's what's that about yeah so this is the this is an open uh invitation for people who want to try and filibuster eth too and so if you can if you can i don't want to to stop these two there is a bounty available i believe there's a 50 000 reward for a a critical bug discovery uh and so there's a bunch of different things that you can try and figure out how to how to poke holes in ethereum and there's a bunch of financial rewards to do this right and so really really good to see this out and running this is starting to to generate that honey pot where it says like i dare you to to crack east too like yeah you can't do it i dare you hopefully we iron those things out this is a good way to do a bug bounty also this was huge man a meta mask the wallet i like everyone in d5 everyone on the bankless journey uses metamask they just exceeded 1 million users not just users monthly active users that means there are 1 million monthly active users of d5 protocols that's pretty huge that's huge and this i think this is a much better metric than the uni airdrop right so the uni airdrop happened to like a hundred and fifty thousand wallets uh you know which means like a hundred and fifty thousand people interacted with uniswap but i had more than one wallet and so like we should probably cut that number in at least by half but this is different this is monthly active users and so you know not fewer people fewer people have like multiple computers that they use metamask on and most people just have one and so you know i'm going to go ahead and call this as like pretty accurate data for you know how often people use ethereum or excuse me how many different people use ethereum so you know fantastic numbers showing by the metamask team yeah absolutely they're also rolling out a swap which is pretty cool hopefully we're going to talk more about that next week we've got two other things david but we've got like 30 seconds so i'm gonna cover this one really quick this is the the zinc and test net this is the e2 test net that rolled out without a hitch which is a good sign that eth2 is going to be coming i guess the next thing we're we're really waiting for is a release date from the eth2 dev team so uh bullish there also you wanted to talk about the block and their new metrics that they rolled out what's cool here yeah the block just rolled out their on-chain metrics page really stepping into the world of data like chain visualizations and chain data so they have bitcoin and ethereum they also have like and i think they're really leading the game here they also have like stats on you know stable coins stats on like on chain lending stats on on amms and dexes and volume and so i think this is gonna maybe become like my go-to spot to see like data about ethereum yeah i need to totally dig into this this is fantastic we'll include a link in the show notes all right we've done market we've done releases we're doing okay on time we've got five more minutes maybe four ford news what's in the news where do you want to start i think the big thing is grayscale grayscale just reported their biggest quarter ever which is a piece of news that we are coming to be used to from grayscale as this is the third quarter in a row that they have posted their biggest quarter ever right uh and so they they have experienced over a billion dollars of flows into their crypto currencies that's a really big number that's a big number ethereum market cap is 40 billion dollars and so like 140th of ethereum has flowed through grayscale in just one quarter of a year right and so what i think the numbers that stood out to me is that every week on average 55 billion dollars gets put into grayscale into the bitcoin trust and 15.6 million dollars per week gets added to the ethereum trust every single week that's how much people are buying of these assets using grayscale as like a i don't know what to call like an intermediary yeah i don't love grayscale because of the fees but i do love that they are on boarding basically the institutions people always talk about one of the institutions coming well they're here they're doing a billion uh a quarter into into crypto money protocols i think that's uh that's super bullish um you can buy grayscale assets of course in your fidelity account so it's connected that way so it's a it's a decent it's not bankless but it's a decent way to onboard into a at least central bank bliss uh monetary system so bullish news there let's talk about something distinction i like that distinction yeah well so let's talk about something that's maybe less bullish which is um the the the dog so the department of justice released an 83-page crypto framework i haven't read all 83 pages have you i don't i don't know i have not and i don't intend to however the very the very front page is worth reading uh and also jake schravinski uh put a great tweet thread together which really distills down the whole thing so he read it and he did the the legwork for you so we recognized that tweet thread to go understand what the hell they're talking about absolutely and um you know we had jake on i guess a couple weeks ago um on state of the nation he was fantastic like listen to that episode yep and uh we talk about those themes but i i just want to maybe pull up one of his tweet threads here um this is kind of the takeaway so this is j jake is um he's optimistic but he's also i guess uh understands the risk he you know works in dc understands the risk of what could be happening and he said sort of on the back of some of the actions of the doj um i fear we're heading for a world where withdrawing crypto from exchanges to self custodies restricted as a means of attacking privacy that means you wouldn't be able to withdraw from your exchange without that exchange being aml kyc identified that would mean we'd have two separate crypto markets one for clean coins and another for dirty self-sovereign runs the bankless coins and the the clean coins that are regulator approved that is not a world that i want to live in that feels very authoritarian um that could be the case if our boomer lawmakers who don't understand this stuff get their way so that is something that jake and crew are fighting against uh but we have to be vigilant on this yeah anything else you'd say on that yeah just to put an image into people's minds think of like you know what what they are proposing is that you know bitcoin ether these assets are here but we can still gate how people use them right so imagine like coinbase or paypal they let you buy and send bitcoin but they only let you buy and send bitcoin to people that also have a paypal account right right and that's that's what jake fears uh is and that's just ruins the whole point of crypto right and so uh there let it be known there is a war coming that we are going to have to fight in this industry yep absolutely and i do think the d5 protocols are the uh the surest bet we have the best hope we have of that of this system not becoming totally banked um hey we've got 30 seconds for this last one uh china is doing an airdrop what's that about they're air dropping their their fiat to some of their citizens yeah and and i let it be known that like you know everyone loved uniswap when you swap airdrop them their currency so like this is a really strong move by china the first one to get out the gate with a central bank digital currency you know one thing i read about in a book recently is how you know the west doesn't pay attention to the technology going on in china but china absolutely pays attention to the technology going on in the west and so we are at a huge disadvantage with informational asymmetry between like what we are doing versus what china's doing china knows what's up and we're not watching them china has a central bank digital currency that's going directly to its citizens phones which i mean bullish for crypto bullish for adoption also really bullish for authoritarianism right like that which isn't like you know what i'm worried about is like using china using this airdrop money or like you know the mmt that's inevitably coming as like a tool for compliance yeah i mean so you just open up your wallet right they make it super easy you press a few buttons and you get an airdrop free money from the government right to your account just for adopting this new digital um it's it i wouldn't call it a cryptocurrency it's uh it's a digital money but it's completely centrally controlled by china they can freeze your account um obviously it's you know the the chinese currency so you know central bank controls all of that definitely not what we mean when we say crypto but in a way they're they're very smart for moving in this direction david okay so we've gone through news those are the top news items we have less time but uh some hot takes what's on your mind yeah the what is on my mind i think the first thing that's on my mind is uh what you and i are calling the tweet heard around the world fantastic and very illustrative tweet ryan you wanted to give us a sit rep with this one yeah you know pomp um pomp like tweeted something out like anthony pompliano who has a podcast is fairly well known in the space big podcast me you know um and he tweeted something out and basically said uh uncle uncle jeff could shut this whole thing down this whole thing meaning ethereum jeff bezos and all d5 if he wanted to because he was infer implying that all of d5 was somehow hosted in aws i don't engage with those types of tweets because you know possibly pop is doing it for engagement himself so i generally don't respond to kind of trolling but someone tagged me and it was like hey ryan is this true right and i felt like that individual earnestly wanted to know so um i said no it's not true in fact it's right um and then pomp kind of replied and thread and sort of challenged me on that and he was like hey if the government threatened to arrest hayden who is the uh court like the founder and a primary developer of uniswap you don't think the government could shut it down um and then that's when hayden popped in and he said this and he totally ratioed uh on the tweet that means he got more tweets than pomp on this it's an immutable smart contract on ethereum i have no ability to turn it off i could try tweeting can everyone please stop trading though but that wouldn't work obviously yeah so people who aren't in twitter culture to ratio someone means that your comment to their tweet out does them in likes and like when you are commenting below them you are de-prioritized by twitter because you know it's a thread uh but so that means when like you get more likes than that person like it's a big deal because your comment was so good that it ratioed that person and pomp's tweet has 53 likes and hayden adams has 2 300. she's nice that's brutal i've never seen that most brutal ratio of crypto yeah it's uh yeah so i mean what that means is a lot of people like saw hayden's tweet and we're like yeah that's true and um and retweeted it so i could imagine this happened in like the bear market in 2018 that would have never happened no it was a mac it was a maximalist agenda it was lots of different lies about things and um yeah that would have never happened so you know uh people coming back baby yeah and we're people waking up exactly people waking up it's it's a good sign to me all right let's talk about the next thing um speaking of waking up yeah how to take this i'm i'm super bullish by it in a way but i'm also like like question mark so we just talked about the uh the oppressive uh government uh cracking down on things and this is the cftc chair uh attending a conference that you just attended as well and you spoke at but he said uh let me basically say how impressed i am by ethereum full stop this is chairman heath a cftc chairman he said this in a an ethereum investment conference hosted by coindesk um if you play the video a bit more he also says he's super bullish on defy actually he actually thinks it could have the potential to disrupt finance um so like what do you make of this right it's here cftc they just came out with an action against bitmex but a chairman saying i am super bullish on defy and ethereum is the next internet bitcoin was a one-trick pony ethereum is the next internet what does this mean yeah that's literally well as a bitcoin that's literally the last thing you want to hear i am cautiously optimistic but more on the optimistic than the cautious side i think i what i'm hopeful and optimistic that heath means when he says that he is impressed by ethereum is like exactly the opposite of what bitmex is right cftc just took down bitmex for being a black box that trades against their customers right and also violating the bank secrecy act which also i guess d5 doesn't really solve but what dfi does solve is it's the opposite of a black box it's completely transparent and it can't even it doesn't even not trade against its customers it can't trade against its customers so i'm hoping that heath is seeing that value proposition in d5 saying like oh they're the you know you know where google had its tackling don't be evil defy has its tagline can't be evil right i think that's what he's referring to and why he's impressed by ethereum yeah it is bullish i do think we might have an ally in the cftc we'll see if we have an ally in finzen which is the the the group in the government that uh you know provides more regulation uh to like anti-moderate money laundering and and see what um kyc type of things all right last thing what i'm cautious about is that you know heath sees the transparency of ethereum as like a really easy tool to regulate people that's my bearish take on this yeah yeah and that could be the case which is uh i wonder what he'd think of tornado cash in that case and also aztec dude we should jump on that real quick so scaling solutions are coming out like mad there were like three that just announced last week we don't have time to talk about them all in fact i don't have time to fully grasp them all it's going to be sort of a survival of the fittest all of these layer two roll-ups on ethereum are gonna compete they're probably gonna compete not not with ethereum of course but directly against the so-called eth killers and other layer one solutions but here's the graph with the scalable state channel layer two on ethereum here is uh matter labs this is curve plus uh zk sync and here is aztec the one i read the most about and most excited about which is a whole layer two scalability solution yeah that also but there's also all the transactions are private right um and there's some way to actually use um like privacy on ethereum main chain i haven't read the details need to investigate more in fact maybe we'll ask italic next week when we talk to them but yeah these these these layer two solutions the scalability solutions are coming out like crazy what does that mean well yeah and all what's also interesting is that there seems to be every single defy application has its own like chosen scalability solution which kind of makes you think like what's left on the main chain i think what's left on the main chain is just like packets of settlement of settlements yeah right like not any like it's no longer uniswappies like 70 of the main chain now it's just like the the settlements between these applications are what make up the main chain so that's really interesting and i think that's going to be a really interesting conversation that we have with vitalik who's coming on the podcast where we talk about a roll-up centric version of ethereum yeah absolutely all right that's takes let's end with this david what are you most excited about what's going on in your mind that that's super exciting these days well since it is friday when you guys are hearing this what i am excited about is the eth online defy summit we are experimenting in the world of virtual conferences uh how to pace them and i think eath online is doing a really good job of doing you know they have their uh fridays so one one day a week they have you know a slate of topics picked out which is nice to instead of just like bundling everything in four days they're spreading it out over a month uh it's a really good job there's a bunch of cool talkers who i'm going to be attending i'm probably just going to sit in my chair and watch it all day tomorrow i'm pretty excited about that ryan what are you excited about i'm excited about the ethon line when you click the radio button you hear this like super chill music and it's just relaxing so you just pop up the browser and just listen to it yeah but definitely trent behind that one i'm gonna go yeah but but more seriously i am excited about um like tokens defy tokens in general right we came off of a crazy quarter last quarter and lucas campbell a bankless analyst put out a fantastic q3 report of d5 tokens so you got to check this out it's published on bank list right now um 27 x increase in revenue right all right okay so we're not talking about height price increase blah blah blah this is revenue so again d5 tokens what are they they're uh future capital assets right and what kind of revenue are these capital assets generating well 108 million last quarter okay that was a 26 26 uh x increase from the previous quarter yeah some of this was from uh yield farming mania blah blah blah you know etc but that kind of growth is absolutely massive and it's not it's going to go down next quarter but it's not going to go down completely we're going to have a a you know a higher low if you will so that means what do we have in d5 well we have capital assets that are actually producing cash flows seems super investable if you're a wall street analyst and you're looking at this space so check out the report read that i'm bullish on that i'm bullish that we've created on chain capital assets and we're actually seeing them like 108 million in revenue in one quarter um like that's that's on track for half a billion uh annualized it's not bad ryan i think you might have jumped the gun on uh it's going to go down next quarter i'm not too sure about that but i will say that q3 2020 looks different than all other queues different this this is definitely a quarter to remember and we'll see about that all right david we're at time anything else you wanna you wanna leave with with uh excitement anything else you're excited about yeah the the last thing i'm excited about is seeing what happens to the ether price as the execution risk of ethereum 2.0 starts to dwindle right so we are in the very final stages of the test net for phase zero uh the spin alda test net is up in live which is the the the mock trial for the deposit contract uh and we are expecting the deposit contract to get announced any day now and basically what has to happen between now and phase zero um launching is basically nothing it just needs to continue as planned right so things need to not change in order for phase zero to go live uh and you know when when a lot of investors who have always been bearish about eth2 saying east 2 is never going to come here you know we're going to start you know tearing down that wall every now and then yep sentiment is going to reverse uh the the the common motif is that e2 will never ship well what happens when it shifts when it ships we're about to find out i i need to find out that is on the horizon david you can almost taste the capitulation you can almost taste it absolutely and we hope you are enjoying it tastes like victory we'll see though you know let's let it launch but you know we're going to celebrate hard oh yeah when that launches oh yeah um david this has been awesome our first episode of rollups around we hope you are enjoying your friday morning we hope this caught you up on all of the market releases news hot takes and what dave and i are personally excited about so once again we will release these every friday morning on youtube if you like it in video form and also on the podcast for audio uh thanks for joining us i think we've kept it time we've done a pretty good job of course none of this is financial advice uh this is the journey west as we've said be careful about these d5 protocols and crypto in general you could lose what you put in this is not for everyone but you're listening because you're on the bankless journey thanks for joining us and also people listening on the podcast there are plenty of visuals on the youtube as well so do know that do note that with that we're signing off
