the only frame of mind I have to compare this to is like 2008 when we use that as our Anchor Point and we talk about households going through pain how much pain we talking I was the average U.S economy worker going to feel over the next like two years I expect the U.S to lose about two to two and a half million jobs next year that will bring unemployment rate up to roughly five and a half to six percent which is pretty high unemployment rate for the us but if you think about it in historical terms it's not Skyrocket High nevertheless we're at three and a half percent now to move up to six in one single year it's quite a lot of pain
