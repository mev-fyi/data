hey bankless nation it is thursday september 15th the day forever that will be the merge because david we have successfully merged it happened last night we're here to discuss it this is the ethereum merge post game david who are we going to have on what are we going to talk about and what happened last night yeah three long time youth community members along with your yourself and myself who have been waiting for this day for so so long i i definitely think it's fair to say that this is the biggest event in crypto's history um i mean you know there's bitcoin that was created but wasn't really an event right that was that was you know only a few people knew about it the whole entire industry showed up here there was already a quarter million views on the ef live stream video that me and superfiz and anthony were on last night and so we're bringing the boys back bringing bring the guys back in town to do uh what is a gonna be a six hour later recap of uh the merge so far their reactions with what the community's saying how the merge went uh and yeah man it's a great day how are you feeling i'm feeling good i think i'm feeling better than you david i think you got a pretty rough night of sleep you had some obligations for the stream last night um and uh what i did was actually like probably around 11 o'clock i got like two or three hours of sleep you lucky lucky man and then i woke back up at like you know 1 30 right before the you know things finally but you stayed up that entire time did you not yeah yeah i did yes i did and then i couldn't really get to bed until like 4 30 and then i woke up at like 7 30 i'm running like three hours right now all right so bankless nation you are looking at some exhausted eath community members but we're also uh exuberant as well um just a few quick announcements before we get in the first is remember to pick up your consensus commemorative nft you still have some time left to claim that i think only two hours and 17 minutes at the time that this is streaming click a link in the show notes we've been talking about that for the last two weeks and then also there's a conference coming up the converge 22 conference that is happening in san francisco september 27th to the 30th a lot of familiar faces there including serena williams i never thought to pair serena will and williams and vitalik at the same conference yeah that's going to be a fun conference you don't usually see that anyway we've got tickets for you at discount on tickets for you he's like 200 off uh or so maybe a little bit more if you click the link in the show notes and use the code bankless so david we're about to get into our conversation with dc investor anthony cesano superfiz as well i think that this event is um you said it was the biggest in kryptos history i think the context for this is really interesting too because many in the ethereum community have lived in a world where there have been a lot of critics who said this day would never come that the problems couldn't be solved that the devs wouldn't actually be able to ship this that they were underfunded not motivated enough that even if you did ship it that the apps wouldn't migrate and early this morning we just migrated a 400 billion dollar economy decentralized economy and it went flawlessly no hiccups no hiccups and there were did you say a total of 250 thousand people not concerned yeah 270 000 people who watched this uh some portion of this stream uh in the early hours of this morning east coast time so this is history that's just been made we both we all think on this call that ethereum is just getting started we're super excited to talk about it a little bit more we're going to bring the guests back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is special graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3social rocketpool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eth in rocket pool and get r eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocketpool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you're getting an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your node to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there arbitrarium is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbistrom as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you

secure and fiction free hey guys we are back with the ethereum post merge post game hoping to get some post merge clarity here with some members of the ethereum community we've got superfiz of course you know from eath staker community we've got anthony cesano as well daley guay and dc investor long time eath bull you've seen all three of these guests along on the bankless podcast previous times and of course in the ethereum community how's everyone feeling how are you guys doing everyone i am doing uh yeah good good is an understatement uh very very have good gone to bed yet i have laid down i have not successfully slept nice anthony you're pretty good on time zones right like this was this like ideal time for australia this is time for me i am it's what 11 p.m now but like i'm usually up till 2 a.m so i'm still i'm still okay for a few hours but it happened at like 4 p.m my time so yeah just perfect and dc you're feeling fresh right this morning you just i'm feeling fresh because i slept through the night because i knew i was going to wake up and everything would be working i love that's exactly what happened that is the long time horizon dc investor that we've always come to know just uh you know it's it's gonna work out okay um can you put our yourself can you just like tell a story like when you wake up did you did you do the classic reach for your phone see if like oh yeah yeah and i woke up at like 5am so i was up pretty early i think i woke up a couple times before that i was like i looked at the clock i'm like have we merged yet how do you check first first thing yeah exactly what do you check first is like discord do you go to twitter or do you check prices i'll typically check twitter um then discord i don't usually check prices that often to be honest so um and i didn't check the price this morning but looks like we're kind of just trending trending flat which is more or less what i expected you know well why don't we just catch people up and talk about what happened last night i'm gonna start by uh sharing this this tweet from vitalik uh that i couldn't believe the engagement on this tweet and some of you guys are on twitter even more than i am i mean how impressive is the engagement here anthony it's 145 000 likes right now that's by far the most like uh likes and retweets and engagement that an ethereum tweet has had i think i have not seen anything close to that before it surprised me because you know obviously if it's like a lot of followers but i've never seen that before so yeah pretty crazy i'll read the tweet out and we finalize this is from vitalik happy merge all this is a big moment for the ethereum ecosystem everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today did this thing just go flawlessly i mean super fizz anthony david you guys were on the call like what was yeah i mean what were the kind of expectations and how did it go it was i was prepared to uh you know it's never i never want to generate a narrative or spend anything like i want it to be honest and real but i was prepared for the unknown and everything just went step by step um you know i was prepared for an hour after um ttd to just kind of hang out and and stall until we got finalization and it just came it was it was great it was really obvious really quickly that it was going well yeah it did not take long at all to instill a ton of confidence that this thing is the thing is going well what do you think anthony yeah the funniest thing for me was like the surprise on some of the core debs and researchers i think that they obviously expected it to go well but i don't think they expect it to go like near perfect and by near perfect i mean i think there was only some very minor issues with uh some minority clients but uh other than that everything went really well i mean you could hear it in danny ryan's voice it was like well we're you know proposing blocks it's all going well and we're going to finalize at this rate and it's like okay well we're going really really well this is exciting so i saw danny ryan he seemed to be like he was in a room full of a bunch of developers is that it were these um like client team members or like where was danny hanging out at this time yeah oh that was boulder yeah tim baker was there it was it was the ef office in in boulder i think trenton fan apps were also there yeah like there was a there was big there was a fair the basement it wasn't it wasn't like offices it wasn't like empty space like uh did you can you share the picture that that i shared in the uh in the chat it is um and and that to me is the most iconic picture of the whole event it almost i i don't i don't want to uh minimize it i mean it can look like kids playing yeah i was thinking i was actually going to make the joke it looks like there should be like a an n64 and then playing like smash bros and there's literally controllers here yeah yeah yeah we've got danny ryan here we've got tim baker here i'm not sure who's on the phone is that that's that's trent okay amazing and this is um this is literally where they were what were they doing here are they setting up for the for that was at the moment of the merge i think possibly um when that was taken there's another view i think it's from austin griffith and it's a different view of the room and you can see there are actually about 30 people in the other side of the room but this just looks like kids playing in a room this is kind of the like the ethereum development ethos right it really is i think it surprises people that this type of a team this type of a structure without kind of the centralized top down corporate control a bunch of devs kind of playing and like posting things on research forms could actually accomplish what it's accomplished i remember do you guys remember back in the you know 2018 era there was this kind of famous back and forth with um like fred wilson uh notable venture capitalists and he said i i i can't remember his exact phrasing but it's basically like ethereum has dropped the ball they failed to execute they need more structure the ethereum foundation and the way that kind of decentralized coordination uh is a complete fail they need to get some real operators in there remember he said all of these things at a uh a multi-coin conference i believe uh and i think a lot of us in the ethereum community felt it a little bit it felt like no one was at you know in 2018 no one was really stepping up and taking the ball to go bring this thing called eth2 across the finish line that was in in 2018 and i think it's stuff like this like if you come from the traditional world this is not how software gets shipped yeah and i think i mean a couple of thoughts on that because i i we've heard a lot of that over the course of the past few years and i actually wrote a tweet this morning just kind of commending the the builders and talking about how insanely hard it is to have multiple client teams working together um to create and update clients on a common spec like this moving a network that's securing tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars onto this new consensus mechanism and the three people who are in that last picture are the or three of the people who really have worked the hardest to make this possible you know danny kind of being that lead um project manager if you will helping to coordinate all these disparate teams which is no easy feat tim doing the same thing on what was the legacy ethereum one clients and trent who's done just a tremendous amount of community outreach to make sure everybody's informed i mean the fact that this all went off without a hitch and like i said i slept easy because i was like i know everything's going to go well you know we've gone through several test nets and every single one we learned a couple things but all of them at the end of the day went pretty smoothly and those learnings were definitely applied into this one so you know it's just an incredible moment for for ethereum and for decentralized software development quite frankly the fact that we can do something like this still i think is incredible like the there's so much in this i think this photo's gonna just like be one of those photos that you always look back on and ryan to what you were saying about how this like this vibe is like so foreign to people that don't really get ethereum or crypto it's because like you know where's where's the tie where's the button up suit where's the high production environment like where is where's the fancy lights where's the boss where's the embassy like coordinating everything and like when you realize when you go and like learn a little bit more about like what really makes crypto tick like all of the fact that like the marketing and the production value of ethereum is completely unoptimized it's because these people have optimized for the technology instead right and so like we're doing the bare minimum of just like webcam on zoom with like a 70 dollar microphone because i know what that microphone is that was my first microphone uh and like it's like that it's a yeti yeah so yeti nano is like the little one it's like yeah we don't need the production value we have the ethos in the community who are optimizing for good strong tech so like when i see like this low production value launch of the merge and the merge went flawlessly i'm like yes this is this is what ethereum is anthony i i know you remember these days too um this uh i saw this last night and this picture really uh stuck out to me this is uh raul jordan from the prism team uh and his tweet says when you meet on reddit and four years later reduce the world's electricity consumption by 0.5 percent he's of course talking about ethereum's transition from proof of work to proof of stake and all the proof of work energy consumption has been eliminated this is uh raul and preston uh in preston and they're showing kind of the activated merge and i remember the moment that raul and preston kind of stepped up when it seemed like there weren't any eth2 client teams that were going to be implementing sharding and these two uh stepped up i i can't remember where raul came from but i know preston quit like his incredible silicon valley google tech job and he was like i don't know if this is going to work the spec isn't even fully developed but we believe in this ethereum mission and we're gonna go build even though we don't have the funding is not secured even though there's no like token reward at the end of it we believe in this technology and ethereum's mission and we're gonna go build it and they started prism which um i think was the first major eth2 client that really started to develop and remains an incredibly important client to this day do you remember those days anthony oh i remember them very very clearly because i remember how i felt back then about this like i obviously was super excited when teams like this started coming together and started actually building this stuff out because i'd been around since early 2017 and obviously it had been talked about even earlier than that but it kind of like felt in 2018 such 2019 that we weren't really going anywhere as you mentioned like it was kind of like a bit of a directionless uh kind of feelings to it but then people like this stepped up and as you said like there was real you replied to this and and basically said there was no guarantee of funding there's no guarantee of success or anything like that the you know these people were literally taking a huge gamble so to speak a huge risk doing this but they believed so much in the mission of ethereum and they wanted to contribute to that mission and they believed so much in what we were building that they did it anyway and it's not like you know they're coming in now where it feels like the ethereum roadmap is actually very very uh fleshed out and we actually know the direction that we're going they came in when we were going in all these different directions still trying to decide where to go and they shaped that and they had a really big part uh to play in that along with all the other teams that stepped up as well so yeah i i just remember how dark the times were in in 2019 but these people made it brighter and got us through and we obviously the last two and a half years have just been up and up and up only really when it comes to not maybe oh there's sometimes the price but i i'm more talking about i guess like the tech and community i uh i have so much respect for the people in these pictures that that we've shown i just you know um there are so many behind the scenes that like i just don't know the names of that put their blood sweat and tears into this thing and so to all the developers that i'm sorry i don't know your name but tip of the hat to you for anyone that put their effort into this thing to make this thing launch because he's speaking of history i've got a tweet that i just sent to the chat from xiaowei wang who is a researcher at the ethereum foundation this is basically like a history thread on the merge itself and basically it links to a bunch of eth research posts on how the merge came together do you guys remember when we were actually going to do like checkpointing with the eth1 chain um and like we kind of like scrapped that idea and then we did uh i think we evolved it once uh once more sorry evolved it and then evolved it once more after that and that's all actually linked here by xiaoweiwang so i really liked this thread yeah and actually for for some of those guys who were around back in like 2016 2017 time frame proof of stake seemed a lot closer on the horizon before uh you know there were various re-architectures of the design to make it more decentralized and so on but you know i remember being back in 2017 and be like oh we're gonna have proof of stake in like a year maybe two and then it kept getting pushed out but over time i've come to appreciate that approach because we've developed a much more diverse client base we have a much stronger community and ether as an asset has been distributed even further which makes you know proof of stake a lot more potentially resilient so i think it was the right move doing some of those rear architectures but that's one of those things where fred wilson's like why has all this taken so long that's like look sometimes you've got to follow the circuitous path in this kind of decentralized software development because this is not like shipping a new feature in gmail this is um a million times more complex than that well jumping on that um we had kind of this this false start um was this my years are getting blurred now i guess that's just you know a symptom of being being in crypto for too long was in was it in 2018 or 2019 that we were supposed to ship the first it was it was 2018 and 2018 read it and said hey guys um we're changing the design the 1500 each deposit contract has been scrapped and it was it was a uh a morning because and that's that i quit my job in 2018 because i sincerely and people think that this is a joke i truly believed that we were going with that 1500 east deposit contract design and at that time many of us believed it was two or three months away uh and it's so easy to look back now and say oh my gosh you were so naive yeah and while i was we just we didn't know and seeing that post from danny i remember that day like that that's the first day i was like he uh he's just such a a powerful leader and i love looking back at those other two pictures uh when you look at um you know danny and tim and trent and then if you look at raul and preston these people are they're not trying to prove anything they're not trying to be they're not trying to be more than they are or look look like something they're not to convince you to buy into their product they are just really bright guys who are having fun doing what they're doing can we talk about the just for people who don't remember this super fizz but the original design of staking that that you mentioned okay it's like there were some pretty wonky parameters right in height it was nuts it was they were i'm just recalling off the top of my head though but they were implementing the entire staking mechanism in a smart contract as a contract one on main net well i yeah i feel like it was one contract okay i think so on on main i don't think there was going to be like a separate beacon chain or anything it was never literally going to yeah upgrade the existing changes in some ways in some ways right and but but um there was this requirement was it was it 1500 some east rather than 32. because i i spent months like you know not not just for myself but also for my friends like helping everyone like be ready for it because i i you know i'm a staker i was ready right so i mean multiply that was the plan was that it was going to be this proof of work chain we were going to leave proof of work but then this ethereum this proof of stake secondary layer would checkpoint it as anthony said earlier and then like once it was checkpointed then we could reduce reliance on proof of work because once it was checkpointed by proof-of-stake it had proof-of-stake level security but for something like seven or eight 15 minutes or so it was a proof of work header on the lead leading part of the chain and then it was a proof of stake tail with 1500 eth staked which is just like totally asynchronous from where we are today yeah it was using casper ffg right as a finality gadget which is what we use today but it was planning on using that um you know to checkpoint as david mentioned instead of replacing the whole thing uh yeah i remember that like wow we were naive to think that that was coming and and also like 1500 each guys like 2.4 million dollars to run about then not not not then but like i mean it would have been eventually or maybe it would have been even higher than that i don't know i mean let's be honest if if what we well we you know i don't i'm not much into the price but if if our ex if our assumptions are realistic um then we're we're likely to unfold a similar future with what we're dealing with now um we are going to talk about the price i think that's important but one person i also want to talk about who is not in this in this picture uh is this guy right here vitalik buterin all right so um we're talking about the engagement on this tweet though right 150 000 of likes something like that i i'll tell you i mean i think all of us uh are impressed with vitalik um consider him an important force uh in ethereum i'll tell you one thing i'm very impressed with which is his ability to stick with this project out of all of the original founders of ethereum how many are left and yet i just i just felt like this the sense of like here's an individual who started a vision for something it wasn't quite there made some promises commitments let's say of what this thing could be capable of it took longer than he thought but he kept with it and followed through and i'm not saying vitalik is the only reason uh we're here there's like you two to your points earlier there are hundreds of other developers that um like built this and yet vitalik is also the only reason we've made it this far and i'm just impressed with this individual's ability to stick with ethereum uh and i can't say enough about about vitalik i mean he's just been been with us from the beginning and he's remained here and he saw proof of stake shipped in spite of all of the critics and all of the haters all the people who said it was impossible he's still here uh and he delivered it this is a big win for vitalik in my mind yeah i mean yeah i was just gonna say i think it's just as important what not just what vitalik did but what he didn't do over that time frame which has really made ethereum successful because you see a lot of founders with a lot of ego come in and they want to control how things are unfolding i mean vitalik has surely been a critical part of ethereum since the beginning and a part of its vision but the way that he leads is very this is coming from someone who's studied and participated in a lot of corporate leadership over the course of my career just the way that he leads kind of effortlessly more by influencing certain ideas or sharing certain ideas at various points in time versus trying to dictate how things work i think that's just been remarkable and even for ethereum too to be honest i mean vitalik played a key role in some of the research around it with like people like justin drake um but he's a lot of people are like oh is vitalik writing the code it's like vitalik doesn't do that really you know i'm not saying he doesn't look at code but he's not writing the code for these clients he is kind of coming up with these research ideas and other people are writing them and some of his ideas fall flat and people don't implement him and he can't force anybody to do it so i think it's just important as we look at vitalik's unfolding legacy to think about all those things that he didn't do which actually are what has made ethereum really really successful well how did he do it though like i i i yeah anthony i'm curious your thoughts on kind of just his leadership style because i think we're used to to the mode of some great individual in history who creates some new systems some new platforms some massive innovation you know like like a henry ford or more recently like a steve jobs or like even like even though it's gotten dark recently a mark zuckerberg and the structure there is ceo founder control governance decisions here's my vision you do what i say and i push it down the organizational stack whereas vitalik he's not a ceo of ethereum it's just this leadership style that i think is new it's like it's like open source it's like it's like um crypto ethos which is like no one has to do anything vitalik says they just choose to because it's a it's a good idea i i think very much of you know we talk about dao so often these days but like ethereum really is a dow it is a decentralized organization that is somehow partially led by vitalik through sheer legitimacy and through sheer good ideas that he comes up with what do you think about this leadership model i the thing is is that it really does amaze me how unique of a person vitalik is uh just for all the reasons that have already been mentioned uh and he's actually had a big impact on my life not just with ethereum but like just to give some context here in 2017 when i first got into ethereum like obviously i followed vitalik's work and i watched all the videos that he did and i followed him on twitter and stuff like that and the amount of criticism that was lobbied his way back then with very little support that he had around him because there wasn't that much of an ethereum community back then right i mean most of the ethereum quote-unquote community were just speculators buying into icos so vitalik was dealing with all of this criticism and he just powered on he basically ignored it and was like oh well i'm just going to keep building i'm just going to and at the time i thought that was the most amazing thing ever because i had never seen anyone do something like that before first hand i know there has been obviously other examples of that but that was amazing because that's him just still leading still doing what he wants to be doing uh while facing all of this criticism and then since then as i followed him through the years and obviously listened to everything he's put out and read everything he's put out he just has stayed the same like he has the really unique ability to separate i guess probably his emotional state from things that he knows needs to get done and he has a lot of people that he's very aware of how many people are following his every move so to speak uh and he's very aware of his his potential influence on ethereum like you did mention that he can he can't force anyone to do something but he has a lot of influence just simply by virtue of being the creator of him and having a lot of good ideas so i think he purposely limits himself which is actually ver a very unique thing that not a lot of people can do is he purposely limits his own abilities in order to allow other people to take up the kind of i guess uh leadership or other kind of roles in place of him like he could probably do it if he really wanted to but that goes against what he's trying to build at the end of the day or what he wants to see built in the world and especially over the last couple of years he's taken a massive back seat in ethereum he really is just deep down in the research and he's let people like danny ryan and tim baiko uh do everything else and and i i don't even i don't even think the term let them do it is correct because like he didn't force them to do it or tell them to do it he didn't back off so that someone would just step up but he they did they stepped up and he's he's just kind of been like okay well i'm gonna do this research thing all these client teams can develop all the all this stuff and and tim and danny and all the other people that want to do coordination can do that so that is very unique not just in crypto but i believe in the world because as you mentioned there's a lot of these ceos out there that have these massive companies that they've grown they all have egos they all love the centralized control and they just want to keep uh accumulating wealth keep accumulating as much control as possible and they don't give it up whereas vitalik i mean he has a very little percentage ownership over the network it's a tiny percentage ownership he could have given himself so much more uh and he and very clearly doesn't care about money which is extremely unique as well he hasn't gone and bought lavish super mega mansions and super yachts and super he doesn't buy any of that all he does is travel with a backpack which he wrote a whole blog post about how he optimizes his one backpack and he travels the world right to do ethereum stuff not to do holidays and and luxuries so just taking that all together he is one of the most unique individuals i have ever met in my entire life and i don't think i'm gonna met many meet many people like that in my life and i think ethereum is extremely lucky that we have someone like him and not someone like dokwan i'm just going to call that out i completely agree yeah and well said anthony you know another thing that was going uh through my head last night in the wee hours of the morning was uh how strong the ethereum community seems in fact i would say last night i have never seen ethereum in a stronger position and what's interesting i think about everyone uh in in the show today is we all started with bitcoin i'm remembering my history like all of us were originally uh bitcoin holders at one point in time maybe not david sorry not david um dc and anthony and superfiz i know you came from from those backgrounds and as did i and it's been interesting because ethereum has always been somewhat living in bitcoin's shadow kind of the younger brother sort of thing and you know number two always number two it's when people talk about crypto they talk about bitcoin people don't know what ethereum is uh for me last night was a milestone in that it was the first time i could clearly see ethereum stepping out from under bitcoin's shadow and starting to take the lead and i think that is only going to accelerate i think in the future when people talk about ethereum or when people talk about crypto it will be less about bitcoin and it will be more about ethereum even proof of work was kind of like aping the older brother right you know the way you do a cryptocurrencies the bitcoin way and that's proof of proof of work with ethereum's migration to proof of stake it's charting its own course it's inspired by many of these bitcoin values but the little brother has grown up and is no longer in bitcoin's shadow what do you guys think of this i think personifying these networks is actually kind of useful um there was a conversation i was having with one of my friends about like by by definition bitcoin's nature was like very like cut throat and even though bitcoin was young and still had a lot of growing up to do if you like dropped off bitcoin in the middle of a dark alley it'd be fine and ethereum by its also very nature a little bit like has more like uh you know chinks in the armor has more like a surface area for attack and so it needed big brother bitcoin for protection for a long part of his life and i think as we've seen especially in the last bull market where ethereum has done some unique things that bitcoin could never have done like d5 really took off nfts really took off this is ethereum like growing teeth growing claws so that if every anyone comes to attack it it can actually start to defend itself i think to what you're saying ryan like this and that's all in the app layer really but like you know you know part of ethereum but not really a part of the core protocol and this does the merge with proof of stake finding its own security mechanism aka its own weapon against attackers that is extremely powerful that bitcoin doesn't have that ethereum created itself is a theory of being like i'm ready to take on the world in new ways that bitcoin's not ready to take on the world with i agree i agree with that you know as you were talking david another dimension of that too is not just swapping out proof of work and consensus for proof of stake it's also like monetary policy right you know the the whole the holy grail the way to go bankless to get away from the central bankers is to have algorithmic code-driven monetary policy and bitcoin did and does it's 21 million fixed cap well now as of this morning ethereum has switched to completely code driven algorithmic monetary policy issuance so this is not only a big upgrade and a departure from from big brother bitcoin in terms of consensus it's also in an upgrade and a big departure to ether the asset versus bitcoin uh and its monetary policy i think uh dc you had um a tweet that um on from hasu on this topic that you wanted to comment on what are we looking at here yeah and you know my take on this and i read this tweet this morning and it kind of struck a chord because i remember the bitcoin of like 2013 i remember a very dynamic community um of of people with an entrepreneurial spirit really who are trying to build a different kind of world and bitcoin was a platform that people were actively trying to build on in different ways back then i think that divergence started this diversion started long ago before the merge but i think the fact the merge kind of highlights how different these two assets and communities really are at this point and hasu kind of hit this from the perspective of you know being able to do a merge like this is a really big deal being able to not only technologically implement it but have social consensus to the point where we actually like you know we can talk a little bit later about this proof of work fork if there's going to be one i haven't really seen what's happening with it right now but 99.9 or 99 of participants have moved on to it this ethereum proof-of-stake network and they're viewing this as the real ethereum and i think that is remarkable um that it had that kind of support moving into this but i think the fact that we were able to make that kind of transition you know reality is bitcoin is probably just an ossified network at this point i mean i do think they're gonna yeah it is what it is i think the hard fork at some point to implement tail inflation that's just my point of view because you're gonna need it when the security subsidy runs out but no one there is really pushing the bar forward like they were for a long time back in the early 2010s and all of those people or a lot of them have moved on to ethereum and also to other places from there and so i think that's just where we're at and but i'm glad those i'm glad these forward thinkers are in ethereum that i don't think our work is done quite yet on layer one and of course we're building on subsequent layers also good muted ryan and this is hasi making the comment that uh he said the merge has only convinced me further that the intellectual state of the bitcoin community is truly in shambles the high quality people who remain bit max research are mostly covering ethereum now i still love bitcoin very much and hope for a restorative movement and hasu of course big bitcoiner uh and i think in some other tweets i read from him this morning um he talks about how he sort of you know abandoned bitcoin because they the community wasn't interested in being intellectually honest with the problems in front of it uh and now it's interesting he's kind of joined uh the ethereum community and other other blockchains in fighting mev uh and being very explicit about the mev problems that that faces in the future um there's another element that i think we can bring into this conversation of like bitcoin and ethereum but also like energy reduction um i think anti-pro synthesis uh uh surfaced this in uh you know somewhere in his timeline i saw this i had no idea but this is a tweet from hal finney of course uh very involved in the early bitcoiner days i mean some people think he was actually satoshi this is 2009. this is a tweet from january january 2009 yeah 2009 hal finney uh who has passed away since um says this thinking about how to reduce co2 emissions from a widespread bitcoin implementation in january of 2009 hal finney one of the chief architects maybe satoshi himself who knows involved in the team something like this was thinking about how to exit proof of work or how at least to make proof of work less energy intensive and what's interesting to me is 13 years later i think we just did ethereum has really taken some of the torch from bitcoin in pushing this industry forward uh anthony do you have any thoughts on this oh i mean for sure i think you know it's kind of funny because the way i think about this industry obviously bitcoin came first but i don't think that it has to be bitcoin right i don't think bitcoin has to be the thing that is the number one not in terms of market cap just market cap but like in terms of the flag bearer of the industry just because it was first i think that big what bitcoin brought was the idea of uh a network like a bitcoin like an ethereum like or whatever else and then we battle those ideas out in the free market right networks battle it out and then communities battle it out too uh not literally but you know on twitter and stuff like that right uh and we just kind of have the best technology in the long run that that wins and one part of becoming uh one of the i guess best technologies in crypto would be doing something like this and and hal saw this i mean january 2019 like was it was like basically at the start of bitcoin at the start of this whole industry and he was already talking about this like there was not even any concern over energy use of bitcoin um because like it wasn't even like it was nothing right uh your toaster would use more energy but um he was already thinking about it because he could see in the future that if this thing got big it would result in these massive mining farms that we see today right that use so much energy and then contribute so much uh kind of like so many uh co2 emissions so for him to have that foresight is amazing but i think that it doesn't just you know apply to bitcoin it applies to the whole industry and i think that bitcoin's just that idea that really kicked it all off um but as enterprises says in another tweet ethereum is the execution right bill that the tweet is uh bitcoin was the idea ethereum is the execution and that tweet is just so good uh because there was this original idea that like if it's a good idea it will eventually become built on bitcoin and that idea is slowly becoming true this is what the roll-up centric road map to ethereum is is it a good idea just plug it into ethereum because that's what a roll-up centric roadmap is for uh and so like ethereum is actually executing on that like so many of the original ideas that bitcoin has can i talk about the role of leadership in all of this that satoshi was um ahead of his time and reading his what he was writing on on bitcoin talk at the time reading what he was talking about to the community was uh technology first it was forward moving and uh for whatever reason whether hal was satoshi or not satoshi took a back seat and said the community's gonna have to do its thing and you can see at that time bitcoin lost leadership and it kind of just never found the right values and it it i mean for all intents and purposes it it became a dumpster fire and that's i don't mean that disrespectfully but it just it it didn't evolve uh but and then you have a leader like uh vitalik who he he he didn't choose to be a benevolent dictator he chose to be a guide who gives um gives the ethereum concept away every day every day he's he's giving power to other people uh and empowering them while still guiding the community he he doesn't have any any real control but he also didn't disappear and let the community um crash and burn and so that's that's the real difference that uh we have we have now many leaders in ethereum who have grown in the in the in vitalik's vision of like what ethereum ought to be so rather than one leader disappearing and saying you don't have any leadership we have one leader who who grows other leaders so that we have lots of community leadership and lots of positive direction for our community uh absolutely well said it really reminds me of kind of that archetype uh archetype of you know like a george washington type figure who's just like after you know two successive sir terms serving as president successful general if you founder of the country people wanted him to stay even longer and he said no got shot yeah i need to pass the torch right uh i i need to allow other leaders to to kind of step up and i do think to your point all this conversation about bitcoin and ethereum is um the there was a type of fork into ethereum at this at the social layer this was not a hard fork this was not a technical fork ethereum is its own kind of technology and platform but a lot of the original community that embraced a lot of the bitcoiner values and just saw those expressed in different ways migrated and moved to to bitcoin and i think that's why we've seen some of the stagnation uh on on the bitcoin community side there's there's almost been a brain drain but let's talk about this really quick before we uh have to cut to to break and then we'll get to some prices talk this is a tweet from vitalik who is quoting justin drake who says the merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2 percent now i haven't looked at all of the facts and figures behind this i do know that justin drake tends to back up any numbers that he is quoting with with some excellent facts and figures and some sources this is something to dig into there's no question whether it's 0.1 percent or 0.2 or 0.5 percent that there's been a massive reduction in energy use from migrating from proof of work there's also no question that energy use seems to be the thing that mainstream cares about most at least mainstream media in terms of their reporting their negative reporting on crypto think of uh the gamers angry about nfts using using energy and you know killing the environment these sorts of things now all of that is gone what do you make of this like what what happens in the aftermath here what do you think dc well i think that it's a very notable achievement because we all know that proof of work is sub-optimal in the sense of it consumes a lot of electricity that is not directly used for um a productive purpose now securing the blockchain is certainly productive but the calculations that are involved aren't necessarily adding any value beyond you know everybody kind of trying to do the same kind of math problem all at once so i think shifting into this proof-of-stake model which is a lot greener is going to have a big impact on the industry but i do want to talk about proof-of-work for just a second because i know this is something that we're seeing more attention on in legislative circles and policy maker circles we've even seen the white house do a report on the environmental impacts of proof-of-work mining and i just want to be clear because i think as an ethereum community it's important for us to think about these things also look proof of work is far from the most optimal consensus mechanism in my opinion but i also don't think the government should be telling people how they can use energy that they're paying for or shouldn't tell people how they should use that energy because we all know that could just be a thinly veiled attack on proof of work as a consensus mechanism and they could come for proof of stake next um you know governments could make running a node illegal i'm not i'm hoping that they don't do that i'm hope certainly hoping the us government doesn't do that but we need to be cognizant of that but i think that that from a narrative perspective a lot of things are going to change for ethereum now because one of the biggest criticisms certainly against nfts from artists and i talk with a lot of artists um and we get into big fights on twitter about like these are non-nft artists who would basically say i will never create an nft because it uses all this energy etc etc and i'd be like well we're transitioning to proof of stake do you want to learn more about it and a lot of them would tell me to go take a hike a couple of them would try to listen well now it's actually happened so i think at least that excuse has been taken off the table now do i expect a big influx of people into nfts and into crypto and artists um now that we are on green proof of stake i think they'll probably find another reason to say they don't like this stuff to be perfectly honest that's okay but i think like you know we've done our part and i think moving to and not only that there's a lot of reason to believe that economic security through proof-of-stake is going to be more secure than proof-of-work also and so i think that's also really powerful and also really powerful is that we created a much better incentive alignment because stakers who are each staking their eth have a much more um tangible connection to the long term performance of ether as an asset and and the security of the network than miners do who are basically mining so they could sell that ether in a lot of cases to pay for opex can i see i follow that yeah i just um what dc said is so accurate that that validators operators have this close connection to the health and security of the network uh and it i i just i can't i can't let go of this message that we need to take that responsibility to heart and not give our ether to third parties um who have no connection to your coins that is you know if if someone runs an ad and says i will take your coins and stake them for you um so maybe you know you give them your ether and they're staking it and you're making money and you're happy but you don't know what they're what they're voting with those either are they voting to censor transactions are they voting uh to to shape the network in a way that that we as a community don't agree with and that inherently erodes the value of ethereum by running a validator in your home by being close to those ether by having them right behind you like anthony does you have an intimate relationship with the network with the security of the network with the value of the network and you're not trying to outsource that to someone in hopes of a get-rich-quick scheme i think really the this energy consumption is another just symptom of centralization right because if we have these pockets of energy consumption what that really means is that like there aren't individuals there like there are these like centralized parts of this world that are consuming a ton of energy and i i've i've got some lights in my in my apartment and whenever i like have my ac and the lights turn on my circuit breaker pops there's no way i can like host a mining farm in my in my apartment that's just not going to work uh and so the combination of like deleting the energy consumption uh as part of the consensus mechanism is synonymous with like adding to the decentralization of security uh and so like now i can take part in network consensus inside the comfort of my own home and not pop my circuit breaker uh and and i think that's like a an important thing to draw i was like one of the main reasons why we're doing this whole like merge thing in the first place right you said like yeah and like we all are witnessing like mainstream media talk about how there's this ethereum upgrade that's going to reduce energy consumption by 99 and like they're totally right but like that's what they're talking about and all the ethereum people are like yeah but we're also like reducing issuance by 90 like you guys forgot about that though but like it's it's just the thing that the mainstream media like latches on to the most and i haven't really seen people talk about this connection but i do find it interesting that the timing of this is ethereum is reducing global energy consumption by 0.2 in the middle of an energy crisis in europe like that juxtaposition is really interesting to me no one's really drawn that connection but like of all times to kill energy energy consumption like this is kind of a nice time to do that uh and so i'm wondering if i ever see any sort of like mainstream media uh draw those two connections um so guys i i wanted to actually turn this conversation um back into the world of proof of stake and where ethereum is going next and what this really means for ethereum at large and also we got to get into the charts and the prices because i want to talk about my eth btc trade and a few other things as well uh so we're going to pull up some charts next as soon as we

by that or is that kind of what we expected here anthony what's your take uh i'm not surprised at all uh i don't know i've seen some people on twitter say they're surprised and they're like you know in both directions some people were expecting some like sell the news event right and other people were expecting some kind of like uh immediate pump because of all these things that we've talked about like the issue introduction and stuff like that but i've personally never shown up to like that i personally always said that it is a longer-term thing i mean we're all long-term guys on the call here uh and we try to kind of bestow that upon our own communities uh but i think that when you look at i don't know traders and stuff like that they're probably disappointed because traders love volatility because that's where they make their money and there wasn't really any volatility so they're probably like oh okay well what do i do now right like what do i do with my hands there was no volatility at all the thing was like as solid as a rock do you think if the earth the merge had like hiccups or had like gone wrong whatever that means do you think we would have dumped um [Music] i don't know maybe maybe it would have been an attempt at a dump because the traders would be like oh i'm just gonna market sell because you know we'll create a narrative of this panic and then they'll liquidate some shorts and things like that but i think we're just in such a deep bear market that there really isn't anyone left except the same old traders who are just like trying to outsmart the other traders and it's kind of like if you're sitting at a table with all professional poker players like you're not really going to get inch much uh alpha out of that i wish much kind of like uh what's the term i'm looking for uh i guess profit out of that so to speak yeah yeah yeah yeah so um this does seem to imply that um the market was expecting the merge to go well i mean it kind of has to imply that right because we're flat and the market's like yep that's kind of what we expected if the market was not anticipating a successful merge you would have expected to see some sort of price bump but we are just flatter than flat like it's a completely normal day for eth yeah we had already done we already did the merge maneuvers we did yeah tricks we so so that was the market confidence and kind of the run up from there july was was as a result of these test nets and i mean if so that makes me kind of bullish on the market because the market's kind of dumb in crypto generally and that's a very informed market if they're actually watching test nets and pricing that in and just being like yup we expect i mean all of us on this uh on the show knew with thought with 95 percent certainty that x or even higher i think for many of us that the merge was going to be successful but my impression was the market didn't believe that that a whole bunch of people expected this to crash and burn or just never happen you can just see it from like twitter polls and twitter activity that there's a lot of people who would like out there who are just like you know in a different tribe other than ethereum they're in the bitcoin tribe they're in like an east killer tribe and they're like yeah ether is to crash post-merge like granted even though like i mean this crypto's tribal this is how this works it is still kind of hard to imagine that there's people with like cash in hand saying like you know what i'm gonna do buy after the merge like i don't really imagine there's a significant population of these types of people out there i i think like if people always talk about pricing in and where you can see it priced in i think on the 8th btc ratio is where it actually got priced in rather than eth usd because i'll share the chart here if i can get it up it's that one um people should be able to see that yeah let me just adjust this here so you can see evebtc right like when the bear market really started getting going in like may with all the collapse of the terrors and the three rs capital and all that sort of stuff right like this collapsed the btc ratio and it was going down a lot because that's what it does during bear markets right like it's traditionally what it has done but then i think around june julyish like we were doing those test nets right we were doing the shadow fox and everything seemed like it was going really well for the merge and i think the market started pricing it in here on that at that point and also the usd went up but that was just i guess like uh correlation to i think the stock market and things like that right after after we had gone down for so long inevitably it gets to a point where the only direction really is is up so i think that it was more priced in here on the ratio and the ratio is in actually a very very strong position traditionally like historically um rather than the usd price now in terms of like a long term pricing in i mean that like i'm a long-term guy i've always buy eight for the long term like that's just my thing um i i don't think so like as you said david like no one was waiting who was already in crypto and already understood the merge no one was just waiting for the merge to happen and be like i'm gonna go buy all the eth now no what's gonna happen is over time ethereum is gonna grow as a network there's gonna be more participants right the uh the wider participants are gonna wisen up to ethereum's structure structural flow change as hell presses talked about and it'll play out over the months and years but to expect like a pretty you know big price movement like a day a week after the merge i don't think is the right expectation to have but here's the thing anthony what you said makes so much sense and is so rational that i don't trust it you know because it's like crypto doesn't trade efficient like efficient it doesn't price in the right information i mean maybe but maybe maybe it's starting to maybe that's the lesson that we're kind of learning during the bear market where we we've just had a blow off the top and most of kind of the the crazy narrative traders are sort of out right now maybe this is um a smarter market kind of reacting to these these fundamentals if so that's bullish but i almost don't trust it if i want to put on my the market is dumb cap maybe we could actually say like we're actually too soon like there's a lot of people in crypto who you know they get their identity tied up in crypto i'm one of them uh but like other people have their identity on the anti-east side of things and to watch ethereum go through the successful merge and really one of the most bullish things about this whole event is that it is the largest thing that ethereum promised that it now actually has delivered and so at this phase in ethereum's life cycle the onus of ethereum doesn't ship now is on the responsibility of the people that don't think ethereum can chip we shipped eip1559 we are shipping scaling on layer twos we've shipped proof of stake like what do you think like data sharding is the last thing we haven't shipped are you really gonna get against ethereum now and so i think like of some people are just gonna dig in and they are just gonna be in their crypto tribes forever some other people are going to take a moment to reflect and reconsider ethereum's commitments to his promises and its ethereum's roadmap and this doesn't happen uh the seven hours after the merge this happens a few a few days maybe a few weeks and i think that actually does align with a little bit of like the the merge has never been this like god candle inducing catalyst event it's always a slow burn like every single day ether doesn't get sold now as a result of proof-of-work and so as the day goes on like we like today we'll add on 13 000 eats that doesn't get minted and sold and tomorrow we'll add on another 13 000 each that doesn't get minted and sold and the decks next day we'll do it again uh and so like that doesn't show up on day one that doesn't maybe that doesn't even show up on month one i hope it shows up at least on year one but maybe even not at that point but like looking at the crypto market cycles like the way that these market cycles have always worked is like you have a bad bear market maybe you have a flat phase and then you have a year of like up only but it's the quiet up only it's the up only that no one's paying attention to unless you're in the crypto market to begin with and that year of up only starts to crescendo into a bull market for the next year after that and i think like i think it's rational to say that this is the start of the quiet year of up only uh dc we want to get to want to get to you in a way in but first i think fizz has to say goodbye he's got some family obligations and he's been on the streams for what seems like 24 hours straight so thanks for joining us this morning i was so glad to be here i literally told my family i was like tomorrow morning i'm taking a break well okay i'm taking a break well this i hope is the last one and i've heard that you've got some like well-needed uh vacation like some yeah step away from the screen ahead of you so i'm uninstalling like i'm i'm ready to go offline um cold turkey so i love you guys i'll miss you guys and i'll see you guys around november all right we'll hold down the december maybe tomorrow yeah november november 1st is my target return but you know i can't do it i i mean i'm ready it's okay david that's totally fine a role for this decentralization activity and i want i want to leave a gap so that other people have an opportunity to fill it uh so that's that's my six week plan nice that's great oh enjoy sir all right bye um dc would love your take on kind of price action one one other thing to include a data point to include is we have been ultrasound since the merge it's one of my favorite websites ultrasound dot money uh supply chain since the merge negative 76 eth i know there's some question of this of whether we would actually be deflationary post-merge or not given the gas prices it looks like we are deflationary but what do you make of the um the price talk we were having earlier so a couple of thoughts one i think um on ether usd so um and we've talked about i've talked about on banquets before we're obviously in a bear market right now to be honest if the merge had launched during the middle of a bull market it probably would have pushed us to like 5k 8k 10k who knows you know but launching and launching in more bearish conditions i think the market the fact that the market isn't reacting kind of still tells me that we are in a bear market because if it had been in a bowl you'd have seen more of that reflexivity but i think that's okay i mean and i'm also i'm also heartened that we didn't dump frankly because i thought there would be more people trying to play this proof of work trade like trying to get free coins to dump and some people probably did it probably isn't going to be that profitable i think so that tells me two things one the market priced in um the quote technical risk around this upgrade and and and marked it as very low two it's also priced in that this proof of work chain is not going to be worth very much most likely because if you were trying to do that trade just buying ether to get those four coins to dump you probably would have already sold so i think the fact that we're mostly flat just shows that we're there's not much remarkable to say there um and i think we're we are still in a bear thing pricing can always get worse but i don't think that's a reflection on the fundamentals that proof-of-stake has improved i think the e-btc chart is actually more interesting as anthony had up um because it kind of i think it's too early to use words like regime change but the fact that ether has made those kinds of gains against bitcoin during a bear market is actually extremely unusual unprecedented you don't really see that very often so i think that's what's saying is what the market is saying is it's expressing a preference for the types of innovation that ethereum is bringing and for the long-term value that ether is bringing to the ecosystem um so and going back to this um the burn chart if you will um and i think that's ultrasound dot money where you can view that um but it kind of shows how much ether has been burned since um since we moved into and not just sorry it's not how much ether has been burned but so first things first in the new consensus mechanism proof of stake issuance to validators or to stakers is about 1 8 of what was being paid to miners okay so you're having one-eighth as much ether being paid out to those stakers as we as being paid to minors number one number two at least for now those stakers can't sell because transactions are not enabled on the beacon chain right but eventually they will be but miners were dumping a lot of their earned rewards so not only have their awards declined but right now they aren't being sold on top of that but irrespective of that as most people know through eip1559 we introduced fee burning into the protocol so for every transaction that a user submits the transaction fees that are paid to the network actually get burned rather than being paid to the the miners and now the stakers and the stakers are just getting paid out of new issuance so when you have more transaction volume than ether that is being issued that results in this negative um burning if you will so right now we're pretty equivalent it's not like a ton of it's not like a ton of ether is being burned but the fact that we're not issuing that we're net net not increasing i think is actually really important too and i think over time this mechanism is going to ebb and flow ryan as you know you know sometimes you're going to have more ether that's being burned sometimes it's going to be less ether that is being burned but it wouldn't surprise me if we never really meaningfully go above the current supply of ether ever again if you assume you know normal network operating conditions so basically ether has implemented what is very likely to act as a hard cap or even a deflationary mechanism without the restrictions and the difficulties that a hard cap introduces i don't think the market is going to be able to price something like that in yet i think like even like the talking heads on cnbc they probably don't understand this yet but like when a year passes and the supply of ether has not increased they're gonna be like oh what happened and then they're gonna look back on it and they're gonna be like oh we've got this mechanism it's actually more sustainable than a bitcoin style hard cap so i think the narrative is really going to take time to evolve it's not an immediate price driver but over like one year five years and 10 years we are i like i wrote some tweets this morning talking about how i think this is actually the birth of ether as a global macro asset to be perfectly honest i think it's that important i think it's that important that this is going to turn ether into a really desirable asset that people are going to take a hundred times more seriously than they did before the move to proof of stake i remember when i was pre-cripped my pre-crypto days i would hear something about like bitcoin on the news and then about like uh four uh like six months a year later i would hear another thing of like oh bitcoin just crossed like one thousand dollars for the first time uh and i feel like this is going to be one of those moments for ethereum where people are gonna people a lot of people right now are hearing oh ethereum just merged and it isn't reducing energy and then fast forward one two years later and like ethereum breaks all-time highs and then like oh that ethereum thing that i remember did that thing that one time that's gonna be like a lot of people uh and because i just that's kind of seems to be like the pattern that works out and as we come to the the entail of this of this livestream and anthony and dc thanks for thanks for sticking around i kind of want to put that that cap on where we we've joked about how like we've we will be able to show our kids and our grandkids like hey look at my like eth pow my my proof of work ethereum transactions look at my transactions that go and date back to ethereum proof of work and like this is of course a new chapter for ethereum but i really think this is a really a new chapter for the crypto industry at large right because i mean ethereum's number two by market cap but number one by economic activity uh and that's really the bigger thing in my mind and so i just want to get your guys's takes on like what this means for crypto at large like how does this mean what does this mean for an industry and to me it's really just like it feels like we're now actually at the beginning it's like we can finally get started now like things this is actually a starting pistol more than it is like the finish line uh anthony what's your just perception or overall uh gist on this by the way anthony with your grandkids right here they're asking about the youth emerge it definitely will be um i think i i totally agree with that i i've called this the new era of ethereum right a new era under proof of stake we're shedding our old proof of work skin and coming out as a proof-of-stake network which is the foundation for the rest of the ethereum roadmap because ethereum is basically almost halfway done if you take vitalex word on it we still have plenty of things left to add to the network obviously there is uh data sharding there is uh the the other things like the verge the splurge and things like that like there are plenty of upgrades coming to the network so proof of stake basically uh the merge lays the foundations for this and i think from my reading the merge is the most complex uh upgrade that ethereum will probably ever do right so the rest of the things that we have coming while complex and difficult are probably not going to be as difficult as the merge because the merge is the literal foundation and then we're building everything else kind of on top of it from there in terms of it changing the maybe public perception of crypto i think it's going to take it's going to have a big impact we talked about the energy use narrative look that is a huge thing for it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong i don't really care about the arguments all i care about is a narrative in this context and i don't think people realize just how bad the narrative is against proof of work outside of crypto like it's it's terrible it's to the point where literally people you know absolutely hate crypto just because of that now there are you know probably some of those people who are just using that as a mask because they hate crypto for other reasons whatever it is but i think the fact that ethereum no longer has to fight that fight anymore it's really on just bitcoin to fight that and ethereum can just move past that and focus on other things is a huge boon for us and it means that we are not put in the bitcoin camp as we said before we have kind of shed our skin of um of bitcoin or shed ourselves of of our kind of like connection to bitcoin and i really do think ethereum and bitcoin's paths have diverged more than they ever have before and they're on their own you know very very different trajectories so that's the most bullish thing for me of the merge is the fact that like we have this new i guess error that we're going into it's going to be very very different to pre-emerge but it's still going to be ethereum and that's what i'm most excited about dc when you look at the post merge version of both ethereum and crypto what do you see so my thesis around what would happen as we move to proof of stake has basically been the same for the past five years i will say that i think that starting today we are in what i'm going to call the ethereum age where as a civilization we're going to be paying a lot more attention to decentralized value and look i think you know bitcoin definitely kicked all of this off and bitcoin has provided a lot of value to people around the world and still does but bitcoin has limitations um and certain restrictions on what you can do with it right i do want to talk briefly about like the history of when ethereum started and ether back then as an asset wasn't really viewed as a focus of the network it was kind of something incidental that was needed to manage the capacity of the network so that you didn't have more transactions than capacity for the network but over time as more investor types got involved and frankly people like us alongside those developers who also shared in that vision of decentralization but also viewed ether as an important asset it started to become more and more important and over time i think especially in the past three years both developers and holders of ether realize that there's this productive symbiosis especially as we move into proof of stake where literally the value of ether is now securing the network right if the value of ether plummets to zero then the network no longer has security so now the value of ether is something that we actually need to think about and we don't need to optimize only for it but we need to make sure that we are thinking about it with respect to network operation i think that within the next few years ether is going to be viewed as the most important decentralized asset in the world in certain and the most important programmable macro asset in the world and that programmability going back to what differentiates either from bitcoin is so important because ether can be used as this collateral asset in these cops smart contracts as we all know and it can be done in a trustless way that's going to power all kinds of new economy um and we no longer have this specter of oh infinite inflation no supply cap because now we're going to have data which shows that the supply of either is staying flat or is declining and it's going to be very hard for people to argue in the face of those things it's going to be very all these arguments of oh they can just change the inflation rates like yeah but if you think about the incentives no one is going to do that without a really good reason unless it's necessary to secure the network and i think you know ether is now going to the staking rate is not going to be viewed as that low risk benchmark return for the entire crypto industry and that is going to completely change the conversation so to say i'm excited about that is kind of like an understatement i think this has been like either is about ether and ethereum about to undergo a big metamorphosis um and that's only going to make the network even more important amazing well uh dc anthony eth it's been amazing to have you and to celebrate the post-merge ethereum with you this morning september 15 2022 the merge happened ethereum the network got the biggest upgrade it's ever undergone ether the asset got the biggest monetary upgrade ever and i think the eth bowl thesis is playing out and we've had you guys on as a repeat episode every six months or so and this is what we've been talking about and now here it is it is playing out and we're entering as you said uh dc the ethereum era the next chapter of this network's progress it's been a lot of fun to hang out with you guys and thankless listeners thank you so much for watching and for being with us on this historic day appreciate you thanks guys thank you guys thanks everyone wrist and disclaimers of course gotta tell you even though we're bullish so are these bowls eth is risky price could go up or down you never know all of crypto is risky so is defy you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west as always this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot you
