danker advice this guy super German always wears a collar so I took the photo with Dan graded Robbie last night it's so great to see all the builders around this is like a big brain researcher behind prototype by the way guys like knows crazy polynomial math and there's like Rave lasers in the background crypto is great man even though it's the bear market and people are sad about the prices and my metaphor for these markets is like in the bull market is like a bonfire but in the bear market like the fire starts to dwindle but the fire at Devcon is really strong
