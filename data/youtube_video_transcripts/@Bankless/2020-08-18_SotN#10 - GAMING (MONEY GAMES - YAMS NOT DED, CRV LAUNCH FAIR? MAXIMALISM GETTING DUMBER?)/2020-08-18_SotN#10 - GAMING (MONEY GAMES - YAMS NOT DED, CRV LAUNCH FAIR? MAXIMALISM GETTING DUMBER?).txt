and we're live all right hey everyone welcome to state of the nation this is episode 10 and david this is the first time we are live streaming this pretty exciting how you doing sir pretty good pretty good breaking out my live streaming skills uh turns out they it's not so hard so yeah we are now going to a live stream the state of the nation so uh we're going to get a little bit more consistent with the time so i think we're doing 7 a.m pacific 10 a.m eastern time every tuesday so make sure that you tune in to the bank list live stream to get that done you can find it on twitter but honestly we prefer you to go to youtube uh because the youtube comments are just better there and so uh you can wait wait did you say youtube comments are better than periscope comments yeah oh okay yeah yeah we just want everyone to be in the same room so if you're watching this go to the youtube also while you're there subscribe to the youtube so you get these alerts that we are live streaming awesome very cool yep super exciting this is starting about 10 minutes late just because we were going over some technical issues but we will work to start this promptly at 10 a.m east coast time i think that's 2 p.m utc if you're international and tuning in that way as well um all right what do we do in state of the nation we talk about what's happening so in particular what happened the previous week we try to relate it to some of the big picture themes that we talk about in bank lists every week and we always like to show you some visuals to drop some insights and to drop some action items um a couple of quick announcements we had kane um warwick on live ama last week you've got to check that out that's now published in the podcast feed so take a look at that we're also publishing a part a podcast today with charlie noyes so uh make sure you you grab the the bankless podcast feed and subscribe there the charlie episode is just fantastic we talk a lot about eth as a monetary asset why it needs to be a monetary asset um charlie works at paradigm which is one of the i think the most interesting cryptic funds in the space we're also dropping tactics so tactic on why earn today and then some killer articles later this week that you're really going to like so get on the program david before we begin we should talk about our sponsors you want to tell folks about god's unchained yeah yeah god's unchained is gonna be really perfect for this particular state of the nation but god's unchanged is a game and it's a game very much like magic the gathering or hearthstone or pokemon it's a it's a trading card game and everyone loves magic the gathering because it's like a very social game and you play right across from another person and you play with like physical cards like you own the cards physically kind of like owning cash physically and then hearthstone is that same game but in a computer form but blizzard the company owns your cards like you purchase the cards from them and then they give them to you and you can play with them but you don't own them they can take them back from you you can't trade them there's no marketplace gaz unchained is the perfect marriage between a physical card trading game and a digital card trading game because you own the cards as tokens on ethereum which is really really cool uh and other than that it's just a fantastic game to play like the the game graphics are just super sexy i have a fun time playing it i've put like 50 60 hours into it so you can check them out at godsunchained.com and the greatest part is when you win games you get packs and then tokens show up in your wallet and it's fantastic uh somebody has actually made play by playing gauze and chain has made the minimum wage more than the minimum wage in their home country of brazil i think which is a pretty fascinating story oh yeah we we did an article on uh crypto gamers and how how much money they're making um there's some really interesting analysis on that um i think anyway we'll include in the show notes but uh you can make money this way um also want to tell you about our second sponsor um this is ave so ave is a friend of the show has been doing incredible work in the lending and interest space so it's a money protocol that allows you to deposit a crypto asset into an erc20 or eth for example die for example um you know link or usdt or usdc any asset on ethereum and you receive interest back on the amount that you deposit you can also borrow from it and this team the ave team is just like iterating on their protocol so fast last week they just announced a v2 of ave which i think is going to be absolutely fantastic like uh amazing i feel like bit by bit we're taking pieces out of the existing banking system and we're moving it from like a bank in a building and you know thousands of employees to actual code that's what ave is doing they're also like blowing up the d5 leader board charts so two comma club congrats ave well done um they are at a billion in locked value in the ave protocol so are they the second right isn't that three comma club three comma three comma club you gotta get pierre to come and audit your comments bro yeah yeah so now there's actually i'm looking at um defy uh pulse right now we've got maker who reached over a billion they're leading right now ave number two and curve number three so anyway check out ave um super easy user interface that's at ave dot com aave dot com we'll include it in the show notes david i want to ask you the question i always ask at the beginning of say the nation what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation is gaming we are all gaming i am literally gaming last or i was literally gaming last weekend when i was playing hearts uh playing gods unchained but also even earlier than that i was gaming by farming some yams and playing these money games on ethereum which we all seem to start to kind of get a little bit more there's just a lot more exposure around these things and people are starting to realize that they are much more like these massive multiplayer online money games like it's a new genre of games and it's all about wealth maximizing and that's basically what has happened over the last month of of the d5 world uh and so we're again like kind of how we're stretching the definition of a nation when we call it the bankless nation we're also stretching the definition of a game by calling it like a money game it's a different type of game different rules different players different win conditions uh but i think it's a fascinating concept and we're gonna we're gonna go into that into this in this episode yeah i saw a tweet from um haseeb who we actually are releasing an episode with uh he's from dragonfly he's an investor at dragonfly and he said something to the effect of i knew crypto gaming would come um but i didn't know it would take the form of yams right it's like for it's it's always it's for a long time it's been a meme that like one of the biggest use cases is going to be gaming in crypto and um i believe that's true god's unchanged is an example of that but also so are these money games so it was all of the kind of the yield farming that that's going on um the stakes are maybe a different like a little higher and a little different but these are absolutely games that we're playing so uh maybe we should start there with topic one david because you wrote a fantastic um like kind of you've written a few things on money games like um and you wrote a post yesterday that sort of summarized what's going on a little in in some of these things maybe maybe you could get into that so the post is called ready player one and i'm going to bring it up on screen and yeah talk about that for us yeah so this came out of a very early article i think i wrote in last november called ethereum the money game landscape again i always use ethereum as a referred to it as a landscape like it's a physical plane of existence uh and there's different options peaks valleys different tools different parts of the landscape that do different things and so as a money game and landscape there's different constructions to be playing different games right and so i think maker dao when the thing that kind of brought the d5 world into existence is the first example of a move that you can make right the when single collateral die was issued there was a move enabled like there's a new valid move on the board and that that move was to deposit ether and mint die and you had specific rules and parameters for making that move but that move is now available and over the course of the bear market what we've seen the growth of d5 what we've really seen is the explosion of the growth of possible moves right there are more things for us to do and each move offers you some sort of strategy to create right and so all these people that have been like especially the people that have made a ton of money now they've been practicing their games their gaming they've been gaming for the past like two years in d5 practicing their moves learning how to make moves learning what moves work and what moves don't and as the d5 ecosystem gets larger and more complex because there's more like different boards there are more total moves and now some people are really good gamers and other people are not so good gamers but the cool thing about ethereum is that you can pick your level of difficulty it's it's largely you largely play against yourself like there are other people that you have to compete with but it's really mostly a single player game inside of this like mmo universe yeah i think that so um if you if you want to play on easy mode right we've talked a lot about sort of this is not financial advice but we've talked about portfolio construction a little bit right easy mode in crypto is you buy the reserve money assets you buy eve and you buy bitcoin right um and if you do that it's pretty passive basically because you can benefit from all of the the upside but harder mode right is when you start playing these money games with each of these particular protocols and you um you talked about four valid moves right and it's funny because all of these well i guess synthetics is um has been around for for over a year but um the other three are relatively new moves that just came on the board and almost like they were inspired by synthetics but um comp and compound for instance i mean that just came out in in may right can you talk about each of these um new valid moves david yeah and so each each uh game speaking of these protocols as games each game kind of makes moves and they're similar but also different right and as you said synthetics kind of did the yield farming before was called yield farming right that's why kane in his bio on twitter has the father of modern agriculture because oh he does together which is true this is true he created he created the concept of like issuing rewards from the protocols in order to uh sponsor certain moves because then set synthetics as a protocol wants you to do certain things right wait wait wait don't don't you think uh satoshi should be able to claim that title though yeah you're right yep you're right but no no good until he does though until he does or she or they or she or they right or it or whatever um and and so so kane and the synthetic steve like made this very prescriptive statement saying like okay we are going to uh encourage this type of move by issuing these rewards right right compound and comp with yield farming kind of expanded that and said okay you can get rewards by supplying any asset or borrowing any asset so they kind of expanded the horizon of how you receive protocol issued rewards and then it also included the governance module and the governance module over compound from their native comp token is important in the game because that is the thing that is really incentivizing uh cash flows at its very essence right because it governs over the cash flows then ample forth brought this rebasing mechanism very simple and with it came this massive game that was just played around this one move and basically ample fourth is a one move type of game it's like you buy and then you sell and you do that and because it's speculative because it's a non-dilutive asset it's a game of accumulation but it has this like reflexive repricing thing that makes people play it differently right and then and then urine and yiffy came around and it made this scavenger hunt where there's a bunch of different moves but they're elsewhere not in not like comp where it's in the protocol but it's elsewhere and then and then i think what was really cool was that yam and yams and and all of the uh activity around yams was really a collection of all of these moves and so yam created this brand new game that was a collection of all these things these games uh inspire each other someone in the comments called it uh the money farmville and that's basically what they are because they're they're also um games that you play socially there's this this whole social dynamic around things like yam or ample forth or snx or comp and i i i want to get back to you um the comment i just made about satoshi right because um some people i i think don't recognize that uh bitcoin is a scarcity game in itself right the most simple it the most simple like it's almost um yeah people don't like the term uh ponzi game right but you know to me that's different from a ponzi scheme so you know a ponzi scheme is something that's non-transparent you know the centralized planners of the scheme are you know taking siphoning money um they're they're giving false numbers out in order to trick investors basically a ponzi game is is simply a it's simply a scarcity game where those that get in early are uh rewarded disproportionately relative to those that get in late and that's what bitcoin is right the entire the entire um i guess motif the entire you know operating line of thought and social layer is like i'm gonna buy my my portion of the 21 million bitcoin and i'm going to hold nothing's going to shake me from from holding like that is the original money game and if you think about it that's what backs like those types of money games are the things that back the entire like value proposition of the bankless decentralized money space the fact that people are playing the game makes the game real right right and and it's harder to see with bitcoin because oh now you know goldman sachs is saying you should have a little bitcoin in your portfolio right and uh big investors has become institutionalized so it's become like socially accepted but it wasn't when it when it started it was a game that that most people in the mainstream completely dismissed as a scam as a scheme as you know nothing that would would become the movement that it has so at some level like all of crypto is backed by these types of games with one like degree of of credibility uh or or another when you say yeah absolutely and it's it's all bakes down to a wealth maximizing game and that's what bitcoin is in its essence right it's it's a wealth maximizing game that is also a game of chicken right and we see bitcoiners playing this game when like bitcoin takes a dip and then they all go to cash app and they buy some bitcoin and then they take a screenshot and then they post it to twitter they socially signal they usually signal and then they say i'm never selling and basically what that's saying is like the in this the game of chicken if they're both if two bitcoiners are driving straight at each other 200 miles an hour each car then they they're signaling that both they're going to run right into each other because they're not ever going to leave the game of bitcoin because they're never going to sell and that reinforces the game because the price floor of bitcoin is determined by how many bitcoiners are committed to buying bitcoin and never selling it right and so that makes the game valid for other people because if you are as an investment firm see like this army of bitcoiners that are all buying like .01 bitcoins on the cash app and then signaling that they're never going to sell you see the available supply of bitcoin becoming less and less available to you and so that as an investment thesis it turns it goes from a game to an investment thesis and the investment thesis of bitcoin is that everyone's going to be playing the bitcoin game well some people are like uh but david and ryan like you you just made the entire space seem super scammy just now by talking about it in those terms um and i just go back to that's exactly what gold is right like gold is just a a ponzi game with much more history three thousand years of history right so that's where somewhat lots of players that somewhat legitimizes it but it's the same sort of game that we're playing there's a scarce amount of gold and we're betting that other human beings are going to use it as a store of value but there's like there's very little of the value of gold there's very little of that that's actually like utility value commercial value that sort of thing and um in in another sense uh fiat is the same sort of money scarcity type game it's very much based on a belief that a particular nation state will uphold the scarcity of the asset not inflate it away so like money as a social construct is is a scarcity game at least that's what i've come to believe right i don't know about you i mean maybe this is like a new thought for the world and the rest of the world thinks we're crazy but i think that this perspective and understanding this perspective is a very useful thing to guide your decision making in ethereum and so maybe this is a new thought for the world and that's fine but you know this is a new industry for the world and to whatever degree that this perspective helps you in your understanding of how these systems work that is a useful thing to know well let's talk about the rules there are a few rules right but let's talk about rule number one maybe that's all we're ready to talk about today what is rule number one david yeah rule number one i think we could chalk that up as the only real rule because all the cool thing about ethereum is that it's infinite and all rules are possible but rule number one is the rule and that is the rule of keeping yourself in the game right so you you can play the game really safely by buying ether and then keeping it in cold storage or never touching it and that's really safe or you can do more crazier stuff riskier stuff by going like leverage like 5x leverage long on dydx with all of your supply and that's really risky that's breaking rule number one because going 5x long on ether is putting you in a position for you to lose all of your resources right so like imagine you're playing zelda or like diablo or like world of warcraft and like you take all of your armor and your swords and all of your like consumables and then you you gamble it right like you try you try and 5x all of those things well if you lose all those things then you have no weapon you have no shield you have no armor you have no no health potions like if you lose all of your stuff you're out of the game right yeah you see a screen that looks like this right you're trying to avoid so you can do risky stuff like going 5x long on ether but you shouldn't do it with your whole entire stack because you need to stay in the game right you should do it with a responsible amount of money that keeps you in the game yeah absolutely um david we should talk a little bit about uh these games in general right because um you've compared these to conway's game of life because all of these games on the ethereum if ethereum is sort of a canvas for these types of of money games you have all of these protocols all of these money games going on simultaneously and they're kind of competing right they are also like obeying the algorithms of their code and their and their construction and it almost starts to resemble like living organisms can you talk about conway's game of life and you know how that relates here yeah so conway's game of life is a pretty interesting computer science experiment and what you see on the screen right now is and again if you're watching this on the podcast go to youtube because that's where you get to watch us look at things while we talk about them but conway's game of life it's a grid right it's like a it's like a it's like your graph paper in you know elementary school and there are certain certain cells are colored white and certain cells are colored black and then there's a set of rules for like if you have exactly three uh white neighbors and if like uh two black neighbors then you're if you are a white cell then you will switch to a black cell and then there are certain certain rules for if you are in one state and your neighbors are in that state as well or a different state then you will switch states and so over time you can create these patterns of cells that will change based on their surroundings based on the parameters around them and so as people created this game of life they found out that using a specific construction of types of of patterns of cells either a one or a zero black or white uh will create something that uh lives that that does things uh repeats and and recycles and and creates something that um doesn't die like there are these things called gliders that can that just move forward there are these like things that interact with each other and make gliders like a like a factory contract on unit swap is is how i um uh illustrate that but the point is is that it's very much like a chess board a checkers board and then there are updates to the checkers board and that's very much like the state machine of ethereum because ethereum moves in this very serial manner like one block two block three block and each of these blocks is a time for people to make moves or not and when we collect coalesce all the applications on ethereum in d5 we create this like ecosystem of combining patterns of cells that all interact with each other and what you see on the screen is some guy who had a lot of time who made out who made this massive diverse ecosystem of uh just organisms using conway's game of life and it coalesces into an economy right and so each of these individual little like uh patterns are part of a larger whole that is itself if you take this metaphor to the end is itself ethereum right all of the activity in these like different patterns of organisms becomes ethereum so these are all money games basically that we're watching this is like money-making or an organic economy is kind of what we see that's why i love um we brought it up in the last um state of the nation but that that picture of like um all of the different money protocols you know like where where as unit swap was like pac-man eating the others at certain times some some of these organisms will become more dominant and start eating liquidity from others um but this is very much how it looks it's sort of this organic you know set of money games this is this gets pretty complex too wow yeah and i think i thought maybe i don't really know the guy that made this video how much hours he put into it i'm assuming that's a lot but a lot of that complexity must be emergent right like he is like he's like the central planner of the initial state but the state grows in its own way from beyond that so some of these things happen automatically absolutely well very interesting all right so let's relate that to as we promised to something that that has been going on currently or something that happened last week and that is yams so we talked about this in the last state of the nation um but like and that was really the day yams launched so i guess just to get folks up to speed if you've been uh on vacation the last week right like you have it's just i i tweeted this out the other day like you know you take a day off and you you you miss eight yield mining opportunities right it's just like this stuff is happening so quickly but anyways if you if you missed it uh yam was a kind of a derivative off of the the idea of ample fourth basically where you have some sort of an asset that rebases in yams cases rebasing every 12 hours um to a um to kind of meet its its market cap so if it was above a dollar the supply would inflate if it was below a dollar supply would deflate anyway the details the intro um we can you know check out the last state of the nation episode nine anyway what happened was um yams got absolutely bonkers crazy right so this is a a contract that was written in 10 days basically it was a fork of a synthetics contract but unaudited right completely unaudited um but the the d5 gamers someone call them degenerates um deposited an incredible amount of funds inside of the yam contract in order to earn that that gaming reward of more yams so the way it works is basically um you have all of these farms that are set up i'm not going to unlock my wallet you have all these farms set up and you can you can basically deposit in different assets so you can deposit in wi-fi or eth or all of these different assets and based on the amount that you deposit and some other parameters you get a return you harvest yams basically so we got to a point where there was over 600 million in value 600 million in value deposited into these yams farm the yams farm and the market cap of yams as well um you know i i wasn't tracking it's difficult the tracking places don't have exact metrics on on yamm but i believe it got to like 750 million like close to a billion dollars in market cap um before the whole thing the whole thing started to uh collapse david maybe you want to take it from there like so what's what happened with the collapse because everything i talked about happened within about you know 48 hours right and then something started to go wrong you want to take it from here yeah yeah it was it was a 48-hour game uh and before before i finish off the the story of yams i do want to talk about how like yams presented different difficulty levels and i think one of the reasons why yams was so popular is because it had a very accessible easy mode because the easiest thing you could do was like submit ether into the system then you get yams right and it's also important when we talk about the safety and security of these systems because as the listeners probably know yams blew up but the whole thing didn't blew up a specific uh contract of the yam system blew up and so the people that deposited their 600 million dollars of value into yams that part was uh extra secure super secure because all the the place that you submitted your value was just a bucket for submitting value like it didn't do anything with it it was very very inert and so vetting the risk of these systems takes nuance and understanding because the part of the yams that blew up was unrelated to the place that people submitted their capital so the submitted capital was never at risk right not not from the way that yams blew up so the way it blew up my understanding is you know all of that 600 million that was deposited it's completely safe but where it blew up was its governance module so what yams was trying to do was take you know 10 of its rebases on the upside and put that into um a stablecoin reserve of sorts and it was that stablecoin reserve portion that blew up and the idea was you know yam holders would be able to govern like you know the protocol to some degree and be able to determine what happens with that that reserve so it was that stable coin reserve that effectively like it it blew up in such a way that um yams could no longer be governed is that about right yeah the treasury could yeah the the governance module broke and so there was an interaction between the treasury uh and the governance module and the rebasing system so those three things created a result that was like a it was like a mutation that didn't go well like it was it was a bad combination and that's that's uh that's as a result of probably the hastily generated game that had like a faulty game board like instead of instead of the path of the game like going to finish line it like veered off the edge and so what happened was that you know uh governance needs to have a quorum of yams but yams rebased and so the supply of vms changed and so all of a sudden the quorum got really really difficult and finding quorum and uh was needed to have needed to happen in a certain amount of time and then it did happen which actually really cool story is like enough yams did reach quorum to fix the issue but turns out there was another bug behind the bug right so the governance module rebasing and treasury link between those three things didn't link up and so as a result yams turned into something much closer to just a a much more inert thing like ample fourth but it also had a 10 tax because that's how the treasury was filled but the treasury was being filled without anybody to actually make a claim on it right and so that broke now here's where things get interesting because this was a game and the game ended except i think my claim is that the game is still being played but it's being played off-chain and we saw this happen by by people still flooding the yam discord but there being a ton of energy and discussion about yams in the amp discord and most importantly in the course of i think like 70 hours a hundred thousand dollars got donated to fund an audit of the yam v2 system that is supposedly coming out right and so yam the yam community and also all games on ethereum require community because you need players there's a lot of players who are playing the yam game that want the yam game to continue right they want to remake the board in a way that the path of the board doesn't veer off the edge but it finishes right it does what it's supposed to do and so it's a chord it's now a coordination game it used to be a money game which was also to some degree a coordination game but now it's completely a coordination game where all the yam players are trying to figure out how to get the game restarted right and so there's a generally assumed path where the yam v version 1 token is going to be redeemed for a yam version 2 token and the yam version 2 token is inert it's just a normal erc20 token which is this placeholder for the yam version 3 token and that token is supposed to in theory comes out after the audits after we have successful audits and and with patience um and the game currently is now speculating that that is going to happen right yeah and so this is not the game is not over and it's still a highly risky game perhaps the most risky game on ethereum but if you want to play the yam game you are now speculating that the yam game will continue or not so it's now a different game in a different part of ethereum now it's off chain and it's a speculation will the game make it back on to the board like will we make it back onto ethereum and let's be perfectly clear what the game is right like i can't use any clear language than this this is a ponzi game right it's a game of basically buying low before everyone else and selling high right or holding if you want until yam becomes the global reserve asset of the world but it's a similar game right so it's a similar game as the um the bitcoin game only with far less legitimacy but a very interesting distribution mechanism in that it's not going to vcs or like being like quote-unquote pre-mined um anyone has access to a a yam farm who has some capital now it's still a whale game to be honest because the the people with uh large amounts of d5 capital are going to disproportionately get more yams of course right um however it's different than the the whale games of of venture capitalists and sand hill road in silicon valley in that it's accessible to anyone um and i do think that is an interesting distinction in this type of a game but it is that's what you're playing if you're you're making a bet as the as david said that yams will um be resurrected in some sort of second level second version and you're also making a bet on the ponzi game but um i thought yams may have been dead as well right because it was quite a quite an epic ascent and then descent and even the developer was like one of the developers was like i'm sorry guys like that's a bad idea um but now i like if you look here it's not only social coordination going on off chain but it's also there's 370 million dollars still locked in this thing that's 370 million dollars worth of farming that activity that's still happening so um someone's betting on something here and then if you look at um okay so yeah market cap right now um i said earlier it got to like 750 million something like that um i'm not sure that ether scan is updating this correctly right so this says market cap of vms right now is 25 million but i'm not sure that that this total supply is correct because supply continuously rebates yeah is that right ether scan is not equipped for rebasing uh it was not equipped for rebasing with ample fourth and it's definitely not it's still not equipped for rebasing like rebasing is this very creative mechanism that infrastructure like etherscan is not yet equipped to present yeah so what you have to do is you have to sort of calculate the um scaling factor of yams um i actually was able to figure this out from from somebody before we we came here up here that's where you see this would be the correct calculation of what yams are right now the market cap at a price of 55 cents be about instead of 25 million fully diluted 31 million so again quite a descent from from its highs but it seems like people are still playing the money game david um we put out a thread on friday which i knew would be controversial but it was basically like hey d5 hey ethereum hey bankless community do you love or do you hate yams and i'm talking specifically about these types of ponzi-esque money games speculative munzee money games and again ponzi not the ponzi scam but ponzi the game you have to buy early and speculate um and i feel like the community is somewhat divided so here's a comment saying yam is the symbol of everything wrong in d5 um it doesn't do anything right like this is not like peak insanity this will end very badly like the ico craze um others like had a divided opinion right um excited that this kind of game is possible in a way that was never previously been possible but also like it was hastily launched and you know maybe the game is is sort of um not correctly informing noobs as to as to the risks and speculative nature of it what's your take on yams good or bad these types of money games good or bad yeah um money games absolutely good and specific iterations of money games also very good like yearn and yiffi good money game i would also bucket yam into the good money game category largely because it was a fair launch with uh good intentions uh i know two of the five people uh on the the am team one's dan elizor the others will price i've met dan in real life and i've met will online and so me maybe because i know more people in the space than the average person i have like privileged information just from knowing these guys but i trust them like dan's a nice guy i i trust his morals and so from that perspective for me yams was a good game and very much in the same way that in 2015 and 2016 icos were good the best the early icos were like auger uh and and uh golem and gnosis excuse me gnosis and the ico mechanism was a great way to receive funding and distribute your tokens and then it became bad right and then it got milked and milked and milked at the cost of retail so i understand when people are seeing like this is the worst of the worst of defy is because like maybe maybe there is something here and maybe the people that are hating on these games aren't seeing like are there are they're kind of not seeing the good parts because they are seeing the future bad parts coming and that's totally fair and if we do think that we are on the cusp of this bull market with a bunch of new entrances i think what we're going to see is we're going to see a lot of money games that are very bad money games that are really set up to benefit the people that designed them because they know how they work and in order to milk retail right and that's kind of ways that's what we saw with the ico where the ico was initially good and then people found out that they could milk retail with it and so that's what i'm worried about also what about the charge that like these games aren't really doing much for the for the world right so a bunch of early whales like get rich who cares right aren't we here to go bankless what about that charge yeah so going going bankless and and leaving your uh nation state taking your capital and leaving your nation state putting out ethereum is is a subject that i think is relatively separate from money games uh because you can like take your money and put it inside a compound and earn an interest rate and like technically the way that we are describing things we therefore state that you are playing games and the user may not think of him like that think of it like that like they just may think that i'm trying to receive an interest rate on my money like i'm not playing a game and that's totally fair that's totally fair like the the bankless uh nation is a much bigger thing than just these money games the only idea the the reason why we call these money games money games is because we are thinking that it's an appropriate way to view these things and understand these things right um go ahead yeah yeah no i i agree i i guess my take is so um ethereum is an open um permissionless platform these things are going to come and some of the games as you said david are going to be scams and and toxic um and some of them are going to be a bit more transparent uh speculative ponzi games and i feel like our job as the bankless nation is to um educate folks on the game that they're playing so they know right like if you were playing the ico game back in 2017 it was not a game based on any sort of fundamental cash flow right so the game you were playing whether you knew it or not was a game of selling to the next guy right who who buys it at a higher price it was completely speculative there was nothing really backing that's similar to honestly what the yams game is um it's a it's a speculative game that you're just trying to sell it for higher than you bought it for essentially and i feel like if people are clear on what they're actually buying i think a lot of people bought icos um in an uninformed way they thought that success of the project might be correlated with value of the token they thought that the um like the token itself was um like the project itself was real when in reality it hadn't shipped all sorts of things so i feel like the best place to be is to stay educated on these topics and uh we hope to play a role in like informing you about these various money games so if you choose to play them you know the game you're playing you know that like there's someone uh there's not someone behind it who can bend the rules in their favor right um yeah i think it's important to think about where this could go right and so we we always discuss like if you if you take a day off and defy like you're behind i think we are just at the beginning of that uh i and we saw this evidence by the creation of yams which was the integration of like three or four other mechanisms from other protocols that we just the creators of the yam system found out like hey what if we took this puzzle piece and this puzzle piece and this puzzle piece and put them together and that's yams right i think that compounding possibility of possible valid moves is about to explode like we are on the cusp of that and as more valid moves are created more and more possible experiments will result and so we are just seeing the basic primitives like the rebasing invented by ample forth is a primitive right that is going to be recycled and reused over and over and over again and maybe it's one small component of a massively more complex thing that we create as the developers of these systems get better at developing them and so going back to that video that you showed on your screen ryan of um of conway's game of life we are in the very small uh very um very might like the the smallest version of conway's game of life we are in a very primitive state but as that game grows it becomes more and more and more complex right we in in two to five to ten years we are going to see some of the most insanely complex and fun games on ethereum and they're going to come out of experimentation that we are seeing in d5 today i totally agree 100 agree these experiments are are net good for um here everything to come in the future we're building up primitives here david speaking of money games we should talk about our next set of sponsors uh do you want to kick it off with ample fourth yeah ample fourth uh father of modern rebasing uh ample fourth created the food phasing mechanism and is responsible for a lot of the creativity that we see on ethereum today so ample forth is a base money experiment you could call it a base money game very much similar to bitcoin in that if you own one percent of ample tokens you will always own one percent of ample tokens but instead of having a fixed supply and variable price like bitcoin ample forth has a fixed price variable supply right so it's inverse right it's not a stable coin even though the unit of ample force tracks 2019 over time uh the volatility it comes from the volatility in the supply right so you purchase 100 uh ample force and then you will see that ample 100 ample force go to like 200 amplifiers or 50 ample fourths while the unit will always be a dollar and when we're seeing how successful of a mechanism this is in the way that people are copycatting it and using it in their own protocol so check them out at ampleforce.org they have their own liquidity incentivization mechanism called the geyser if you supply ample fourth and ether to the uniswap pool you can get a little extra bonus of ample fourth tokens and so yeah that's that's ample fourth all right i also want to tell you about a poly market so the quest for prediction markets on ethereum and using d5 protocols continues and poly.market has a really interesting take so if you go to poly dot market you can bet on your beliefs this is like an information market so you can see some of the market categories they have coronavirus crypto uh you can even create your own markets this is an interesting category we've talked about on on bankless uh one of my favorites is make a bet on will ethereum v2 phase zero launch before 2021 um 64 think yes 36 think no what do you think david just curious uh i oh that i think that's fair odds i think they're odds all right so so david might enter this market uh equally on both sides i guess well that would make him net zero i'm not sure what david would do with this market but if you want to bet on things like that you can they even update it with interesting things like uh amount of yam being delegated so you can go to poly.market and start betting on d5 protocols and if you do this and you email hello at poly.market with bankless in the subject line they will cover your gas costs and give you early access to unreleased features gas cost coverage is a net benefit in these times of you know 200 300 way gas fees so check them out at poly dot market we'll include them in the show notes as well david let's talk about our next uh topic here and then what we'll do in like at the end is kind of turn it over to the bankless community and youtube to to ask some questions and finish this off but let's talk about curve really quick so curve released their token they started releasing their yield farming mechanism for their crv token last week um i was shocked at the market cap at the price of this baby when it launched like so here it is it got up to like 80 billion dollars didn't it yes so here it is on coin gecko at 70 billion they must take a like uh you know like some kind of a one day average or something yeah that's true like 70 million but they're missing three zeros there it was definitely 70 or 80 billion yes it was and when i looked on um yeah in fact i don't think these numbers are accurate well this this is accurate as of now it's a it's worth 11 billion dollars right now um when i looked at this on saturday we were like 130 billion 120 130 billion so it briefly exceeded the market cap of certainly of ethereum i don't know did it succeed the market cap of exceed the market cap of bitcoin uh no not a baby bitcoin's like 250 billion okay all right that would be getting close though right getting close um so an absolutely insane valuation at least at first and the way it launched was somewhat odd right so um the the way it launched was basically the the curve team had put out some code sort of an unreleased version and this guy this person on twitter or organization on twitter um a simple farmer defy chad he was the one who activated the curve governance contracts the curve yield farming mechanism so individual group paid 800 dollars in gas fees to activate this this contract prior to the curve team formerly releasing it so a little weird a little interesting um and there's lots of speculation around that so anyway like back to the fact so it was activated and then curve came out and said since it was activated without our permission our knowledge we're just gonna go with it because we have no other choice in the meanwhile people had started to yield farm curve early right and if you're in early with yield farming you you you kind of uh you get outsized returns you get outsized returns right because because no one else is yield farming so you have a disproportionately large part exactly exactly so there's controversy over the the launch um the the value of the token has fallen uh steeply of course which it had to i mean that's appropriate oh yeah it's appropriate it's still uh 11 billion dollars which seems awfully awfully rich um for a capital asset but yeah that's basically what happened and there's some controversy around it that we could get into but uh david do you have any quick takes here yeah um so there the controversy around this the the launch was that you know we are now kind of used to the status quo of fair launches right like no vc premium no founders rewards but that's the money's still enticing and so the the nefarious malicious uh opinion of what happened was that this defied chad guy who's an anonymous twitter account uh was this was a plan right and uh the plan was to deploy the the contracts under this anonymous account and then from curve they say like oh somebody deployed our contracts but somebody got to like pre basically pre-mine is basically a pre-mine because it was released before anyone knew it right so the the criticism is that this was really done by the curve team and they just wanted to to have the outsize returns i don't know uh that is a thought and there's nothing to back that up i don't know if that's true or not but that is what is uh the the worst the the least generous uh interpretation of those events yeah that's what um i think a good summary of that interpretation of that possibility uh and criticism of the way it was launched is found in this twitter thread by adam cochran so we'll include that in the show notes but it it does seem that um whatever happened with respect to like the you know the fairness sort of people getting in early it seems like this was maybe done to avoid some regulatory scrutiny right it's just kind of like fair right it just kind of like hands off we didn't we didn't deploy this thing somebody else did we don't know who yep um which is which is uh quite interesting as well i don't know if you've got you've seen any crypto lawyer feedback on that like a jake or somebody like that but no jake would never say anything he wouldn't touch it or no uh he wouldn't touch that yeah yeah but that is a good point there are uh unknown regulatory risks with launching these things because there's no there's absolutely zero sort of information about these date of whether these things are dubious compliantly dubious regulatory issues it's unknown and so it's it's fair to assume that like these people that are kicking off these yield farming events are trying to to disconnect from that that's that's fair yep and um we will include a link to where that yield farming can be done just in case you're interesting um interested again like the earlier in these protocols you start yield farming the more risky it is yes so this again is maybe not quite yam on the spectrum of risk right but um it's pretty close going through the door first is risky right and i would also say even the design of curve is this is this is not an easy mode game this is a hard mode gain and uh largely it's because of the gas fees right and so i actually started to farm curve at the very beginning uh because the returns were ridiculous at an 88 billion dollar valuation uh you could make just a ridiculous amount of returns it was something like five fifty thousand apr for like on an hourly basis right so right so i'm like okay like i'll i'll go into yield it's worth the risk at that point yeah um now i'm not like the the biggest defy whale and so i got burned on gas fees going in and out of the pool so it cost me 0.5 gas to get into the pool and point and 0.5 ether to get into the pool and 0.5 ether to get out of the pool and i and i farmed 0.35 ether worth of curve so i got burned yeah and and so this is not a game for everyone and this is kind of why it's advantageous to be a whale in the space because you can pay for those gas fees because it's more efficient right and so when you are making the calculus as to what moves you want to make or not like i i messed up and i lost that game because i have less money than i do now and so therefore i lost right and so you messed up because of gas fees i messed up because of gas fees right and by the way what do you deposit and curve it's like uh some sort of a um you're like a stable coin right like you deposited a die or you could deposit a usdc or something this is also why this is not an easy game because it's a two-step game where you deposit stable coins your preferred stable coin usdc tether die and then you get the y die y usdc y tether version of that which is the interest bearing version and then you submit that to the y curve dao governance uh portal which is then where you get your curve tokens that's where you start farming right and so it's it's a two-step process whereas yams with a one-step process and getting in and out of the y the y curve stable coin pool is really expensive really expensive yeah and just like converting what you said 0.5 eth into dollar terms right so like i don't know 150 twice so i spent a whole ether in gas to receive a third of an ether and farmed okay so four hundred dollars he spent two hundred dollars to receive how much ether point three four yeah so net loss right and net loss and two thirds of an eighth yeah and that is why um i think they're you know i think some within defy are starting to um get upset and a bit jaded at these gas fees because the argument is um hey like if gas fees are 300 grey then the only people that can afford gas fees high gas fees are folks that are dealing in large capital pools right so like to make that trade worth it basically what you said is like i'd have to have at least a thousand dollars or so right we're actually not sure how much for occur yeah okay so i'd have to have and that was when curve was sky high right right so if i was depositing curve now then like you know different story i'd probably need like i don't know 30 50 000 or something like that before it's even worth it um so that is the criticism what do you think of that criticism david i think it's totally fair and that's why this the current gas markets is not good um i mean it's good for ethereum because fees are good but it's really crowding out a lot of you know smaller players that that want to play games but the it's it turns out like the current games on ethereum are like you know five thousand dollar minimum poker tables right yeah like like that it's just not suitable for everyone and so a lot of people are on the sidelines like watching all these like rich whales have a lot of fun it's it's not the the best environment i'm not going to say that i'm happy about it and yeah not only have a lot of fun but also make a lot of money right and then sometimes dump that right on less savvy right players of the game basically yeah so like somebody who might not understand how to vet games very well might look at like okay yield farming i don't really know how to do it it sounds risky the gas is really expensive you know what i'm just going to do i'm going to buy the the curve token and if you did that on the first day you bought a curved token that was valued at 88 billion dollars when uh ether it was valued at like 40 billion dollars so that also wasn't a good move either so really you were kind of just forced to sit out right and if you didn't know how to evaluate the game you might have made the mistake of buying curve at an 88 billion dollar valuation yeah yeah you know it's interesting in our podcast with hasid which is coming out next monday we talk a little bit about that like d5 in layer two uh d5 and eth2 right and how the main chain basically is shaping up to become a settlement chain right the original ethereum 1.0 main chain is kind of like a manhattan basically where things are going to get really expensive and not all transactions can be done in manhattan it will become like a town an area a district for the wealthy and that is the economic reality that i think eth1 becomes a settlement layer but that's why we need layer two solutions that's why we need to to create some more space some more geography some other like haze calls it yes yeah other suburbs other other farmland that where gas fees aren't completely prohibitive we get some more room to breathe i'm pretty i'm pretty bullish about that in the long term but i think in the short run it's going to be tough but we are seeing things like um optimistic roll-ups layer two i'm i think that'll start showing up in in fall and that uses the security of the ethereum main chain for things we're also seeing things like xdi for instance this is just a side chain it's not even it's not like it doesn't use the security of ethereum but you can run dye for instance in xdi and it's reasonably secure right like it's it's almost like a crypto bank level of security so there's lots of different things that i think are gonna scale this out but i don't expect an immediate fix here i think um yeah i think it's going to be some you know 200 to 300 great prices for quite some time yeah it's not going down yeah the important thing about all the development and scaling solutions is that there are many different paths to go down and it's really all about optionality right like sharding creates options l2 systems create options like rollups create options xdi creates options and these options compound upon each other right and so we we don't get linear scale in many different directions the optionality of being able to scale multiple things in multiple different ways is really how uh you know small fries got people with like less than 100 eats less than ten thousand dollars can play some of the similar games as the big guys right uh and it'd be because of that optionality also i do want to bring up um how yearn and yiffy what andre built with yearn is a gas optimization mechanism because anyone that is yield farming with their capital is making a bunch of transactions on ethereum and they're all doing that but instead if they just deposit their capital into yearn into this automated thing if you know 500 people were all making 500 transaction transactions each trying to maximize yield and instead they put it into yearn that's one transaction for 500 people that does the same thing and so that is also this internal scaling solution which just makes things more efficient and this is how bitcoiners actually think bitcoin is going to scale if you played an xbox 360 game in year one and then you bought an xbox 360 game that came out like a decade later the graphics were like orders of magnitude better it looked like a different system and that's because the developers just learned to be more efficient with like the graphics of that game and i think that's going to also become true about developers that you know not too long ago gas prices were one guy right like two two or three or four months ago but gas prices were one way so developers weren't really incentivized to figure out how to be efficient now developers are really incentivized how to be efficient and so we're experimenting in efficiency in all different directions and that efficiency compounds and having optionality in how you scale is really important for having that compounding scale yeah i mean i mean look at a city like manhattan right i mean there was a time where it was relatively like flat you've been talking 150 years ago and what did they do to scale partially well they built up they built skyscrapers right that's kind of how um it could emerge and they also build down more efficient with the subway yep more efficiency through each unit of geography more efficiency through each unit of block space and you're right the economic pressures will sort of force them into that um i was listening last thing and then we'll turn it over to uh the folks in the bankless community for questions um i was listening to the peter mccormick vitalik interview with uh samson um did you catch that david yeah uh it it pissed me off man i i had to turn it off last night and this is one thing i'm concerned about with vitalik because i wanted vitalik to take the offensive because he wouldn't vitalik is very very peaceful he's very pacifist and samson was being a [ __ ] [ __ ] he was being a bully he was being a bully and and he was just being a wrong bully and vitality wouldn't call him out on it because of how nice vitalik is and like it was the most distant don't you think david like that came through to anyone who was listening i was just like so sure man i am not so sure because peter mccormick's audience are a bunch of bitcoiners that hear things like what samson mouse says as like gospel i am not so sure yeah i mean what one of the things that that kills me with criticism is like things like and this is back to relate back to our question uh our earlier conversation is um you know kept pressing metallic on gas fees that sort of thing bitcoin has the same freaking problem when bitcoin is in high demand bitcoin block space is in high demand transactions become too expensive to use only you know what they do to scale bitcoin is it scales essentially on crypto bank infrastructure on side chains like coinbase and binance and that sort of thing right whereas ethereum has a slew of other options i just find a lot of the criticisms aren't equally applied to both to both networks absolutely one thing in the um the interview uh i don't know if you noticed but um vitalik gave a couple shout outs to bankless oh i must have turned his job before oh dude yeah get there so he talked uh twice about uh conversation bankless podcast that we did with him and then he also used the term economic bandwidth he did i did i did hear that i did yeah yeah that was pretty cool yeah you know so the part the part that pissed me off the most was uh and to to continue your conversation of how bitcoin scales bitcoin is going to scale on ethereum and that's going to be how it scales without having to succumb to crypto banks if you want to use a bitcoin expressively it's going to come to ethereum bitcoiners got really excited about the micro strategy purchase of like 21 000 bitcoins well there's 43 000 bitcoins on ethereum like that's twice yeah yeah so converting that to monetary terms it's 250 million versus like something like 500 million right right so microstrategy purchased 250 million bitcoin and there's already 500 million tokenized bitcoin on ethereum right and so ethereum is going to scale we are currently scaling and bitcoin is going to scale by coming over to ethereum and what you know what what really pissed me off the most was that samson mao uh said to vitalik to his face on the podcast lying through his teeth that people in defy are preferring to use wrapped versions of bitcoin instead of oh dude it offered a stronger foundation is that where you turned it off i was like this is this is absolutely ridiculous it's a lie the the the belief is that bitcoin itself is a is a found a very sturdy foundation and that you you build big structures on sturdy foundations and ethereum isn't that dirty of a foundation that's a fair criticism and that's the criticism that was baked into that argument but what samson mouth forgot about is that in order to get bitcoin onto ethereum you have to have trust in something like run btc that you have to make sure that protocol works or wrapped bitcoin you have to make that bitco is going to do that correctly or tbtc like they haven't gotten out the gate but he didn't tbtc you actually have to have eth to make the trustless yeah bitcoin work and so he just glossed over this massive trust assumption that this is just going to work because he wanted to spin the narrative of just like yeah you know people in d5 want to use wbtc which is just abjectly false yeah oh got it riled it just [ __ ] riled me up it me too because i think that is the um the deception that's going on right like um to be honest the bitcoin story is is simple to understand but like when they lie about the ethereum story it frustrates me here's the thing is the other thing samson was doing it pissed me off is i consider myself a bitcoiner right all right same like if you ask me but i'm not samson bitcoiner right right like that like bitcoiners are right maximalists are wrong right you know like i can be a bitcoiner and also be an etherean right right i mean that's what the bankless nation is it's optimizing for the most bankless money system wherever it exists and so his i think his painting of bitcoiners as pure maximalist is um it's just not going to age well you know i don't think that's why people are entering the space for you know what i think he's doing what i think he's playing the bitcoin game and the bitcoin game is to get everyone to buy bitcoin and so he's playing a game where he is trying to brainwash people by lying in order to get them to play the game because when more people play the bitcoin game bitcoiners the people that have have already been playing the bitcoin game win right and so i think it is a and also but samson now comes from block stream which is an attempt to build a expressive side chain for bitcoin on ethereum or bitcoin btc on bitcoin and there's no bigger stronger competitor than ethereum to block stream it's not it's not bitcoin versus ethereum it's block stream versus ethereum like no [ __ ] samson mao doesn't like vitalik and what he's built because his ethereum is going to make block stream completely redundant and unnecessary and also by the way uh james presswitch who is a very great developer on both bitcoin and ethereum discovered a bug in the block stream liquid network that is where this bitcoin gets its expressivity that would allow someone to steal all the bitcoins and like he's talking about how ethereum is like this shaky foundation while his own liquid had this bug for months that no one discovered because no one [ __ ] uses it excuse me i'm using the f-word look man i i think you're right i mean full circle here right samson is playing the game however i have a massive problem when you're playing the game unethically when you're lying about it right and by the way that's not the game i'm playing right like i i want i want a money system to actually be good for the world right i don't i don't [ __ ] care if like bitcoin gets to trillions of dollars but all we're left with is a banked money system that doesn't restore self-sovereignty to individuals like that's why i'm here and um i do think the tide is shifting a little bit david like um i think people who listen to bank lists and then tune into the mccormick interview are like oh wow is this really the kind of the intellectual mecca of maximalist because it's empty it's like a dry cause of the cause of skeletons there's like nothing there there's no organic material there's no substance there so i'm that's what that's why i continue to listen to the episode because i was just like wow this is the best you've got yeah it's man i what i want to see a debate of is honestly is like an etherean um debating on like ether you know i feel like we could make the argument a little bit better right as to why ethereum might fail yeah um absolutely that was not it that was not it was not it no that was a a bag inspired uh uh conversation from from samson mao and that's kind of why like vitalik's such a nice guy like he means the best he doesn't really want to get offensive but i would love to see a world where vitalik like brought out the teeth because he could vitality's very witty very valid vitalik is really clever and i think if he wanted to if you if he practiced at it he could destroy samson now yeah i know he's just um he's too nice he's too nice he's a better human to be honest yeah he's better than all of us that's for sure yeah so anyway um all right we went on a rant there at the end but hopefully you guys enjoyed it let's turn it really quick to you any questions so i've got one what's your guys's take on staking on a validator node versus yield farming i have my answer for this one ryan what's your answer um okay so it's a risk return answer right so um i commented earlier on twitter that um all of this yield farming in defy is preparing us for the greatest yield farm in the world which is staking our eath bonding our eat the initial bond offering of ethereum now it's different people replied and said oh yeah show me where the like the 1 000 uh apy per day is on ethereum it's not there um so staking ethereum in a validator taking a wreath and doing it there is going to be a much lower risk not in the early days right because e3 is new but eventually it's going to be a much lower risk place to put your money so um you know how in the like regular traditional world uh people people call the the risk-free rate that's basically like the fed rate for uh returns on t bills essentially that's what staking heath is going to be it's going to be the risk-free rate of the ethereum the d5 economy essentially so much lower risk right um because in order for each staking to fail the entire protocol has to fail just like with with t bills right in order for t like the us government not to give you your money us government has to go away right like foundationally it's gone so it's a much lower risk way to get a steady return it's not the wild cowboy stuff of like a thousand percent per day but honestly a portion of uh my funds personally i want to be in the crypto equivalent of the t-bill asset class right absolutely and it's important to like so the question like framed it as like returns on e-state converse returns on yield farming and actually i think you can categorize as eat staking inside of you farming right you are farming yield and the best thing about staking is that it is designed to be as easy as possible right it is supposed to be like the tutorial for people coming into the ethereum game right like the basic most simple and most trustless thing you can do is you can stake your eth right and again like you said each staking when phase zero goes live is going to be hard it's going to be expert mode and it's going to be high risk and but the the idea is that the ui and ux around the clients for staking your eth and and also other systems for for doing it for you will make this easy right the goal is to make this like the 101 game right like yeah and you enter the game you go through the tutorial and that tutorial is taking ether because the reason why we want that easy is because staking is supposed to be supposed to enable maximum decentralization so it has to be easy if it was extremely difficult then ethereum wouldn't be decentralized yeah exactly and i guess maybe one other thing of course is because of the super fluidity as dan elizer would say of these protocols who's to say you won't have a way to essentially take your tokenized staked eth and then also add some risk add some return to it and start yield farming with it there will definitely be ways to do that in the future so maybe you can have your cake and eat it too so here's a question from a youtuber uh what do you think about chains like polka dot fusion or other interoperability chains for scaling and i'm going to use this opportunity to show our coming episode with haseeb which is coming out next monday uh haseeb gave a pretty interesting classification of polka dot where you know ethereum is supposed to be like manhattan and its suburbs and its farms polka dot the way uh haseeb uh classified it is as like a one city per application right and so that application has its own domain it has its own realm and that allows that application to scale up and so you know i'm not an expert and so i can't really comment on like the more nuanced designs of polka dot uh but that categorization was interesting to me yeah yeah i think my take is similar like so my take is probably in that hasib episode a little bit so i think um that probably this is a thesis that probably in order to have a main chain a settlement chain the reserve asset behind that settlement chain has to be money because any reserve asset that becomes the money has trillions of dollars in economic security there's there's no better way to get security than to be memed into a money to to be used as a money right um that's why gold is worth you know trillion seven trillion and silver's like not even a trillion right because it has a money meme attached to it um so i think there are probably some power laws to that where not everything can have that um and ether certainly has a head start as a main chain with economic security polka dot i feel like a polka dot is kind of discluded from the race there a little bit right so part of the reason why is because uh first uh there's governance almost a plutocratic governance so if a like a majority of of uh dot whales decide to change issuance or make some decision to the protocol they can vote and make it happen right that kind of governance on chain governance can't happen in ethereum and that sort of on-chain governance i think is not probably conducive to a you know a monetary system underlying like so how shitty would it be if uh facebook and all the facebook stockholders essentially had the ability to like owned the the governance of the uh global reserve currency of the world it would be it would be very bad because then zuck could do whatever he wants with it at any time right so like we're here for a more neutral monetary system anyway for reasons like that i think that polka dot and other things like it um become a a side chain to stronger more credibly neutral settlement layers like ethereum but they all work together at the end of the day and by the way could be wrong about some of these things it's possible that dots or atoms through some roundabout way starts to accrue monetary premium but that's my take right now anyway yeah yeah and i think that's the correct take for the information that we have today and i think we'll when polka dot goes live and inevitably interoperates with ethereum because what else are you going to do um we will have to update that take if anything changes right because then we'll have more data um but i think for now until we have more data that that's the right approach to evaluating these things that are not quite live yet very good david should we do one last question yeah do you have one i cannot find another one well i've got one that's super easy when when bankless merch when i think the people want these t-shirts man i think they do want the t-shirts i think that's true so we uh we're working on it guys so i have a box sitting over there actually with some bankless swag with some bankless t-shirts um we did our scarce swag launch season one first so that's out there but that's a more kind of scarce premium um the the eathscape sure is more you know premium product we're going to get some normal uh merch like this hopefully i'm going to say within the next month because i feel like you know i've got some economic bandwidth to do that um but we're working on it guys we're definitely gonna get you guys some swag i really want to walk into my wells fargo wearing a bankless hoodie [Laughter] i told you i did it i did a wire from a bank in my etherscape shirt it's awesome yeah it's like so that'll be fine it'll be fun all right and all right man in in
