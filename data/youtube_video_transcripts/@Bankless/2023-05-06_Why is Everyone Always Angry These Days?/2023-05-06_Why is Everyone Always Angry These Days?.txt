why does it seem like everyone is always angry these days for lots of reasons social media tribal Media stuff like that but I think an even bigger reason is that the anger is loud and broadcast over lots of channels which makes it feel like there's even more of it than there is people who aren't angry with each other are not often screaming it from the hilltops about how not angry they are while people who are we are much more likely to do that so I think it's a combo of those two things
