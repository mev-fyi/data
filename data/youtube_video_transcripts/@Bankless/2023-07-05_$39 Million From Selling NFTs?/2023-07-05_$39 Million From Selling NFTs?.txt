azuki what happened sometimes nft pfp projects they do further mint because we need another idea let's do another mint I don't know they're doing Zuki Elementals and so 20 000 nfts 10 000 of them were airdropped to azuki Holders the remaining 10 000 elementors were sold out at two eth each year 38 million dollars was raised that's a big it's a very big number and so on the left these are the Genesis collection and if you swap to the right these are the Elementals very similar they are the almost identical and so as a result of this the azuki Elementals minted at two are now trading below the two eath mint the community well not happy
