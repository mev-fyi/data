now ethereum is going to become Uber now ethereum is going to become decentralized Twitter and it just never seemed to kind of Click for me we made some progress we did episodes with like far caster for example and lens cautiously excited about those and bullish on on those when I when I started seeing them but the question is always how do we get Mass adoption friend.tech and this experiment again I'm not saying it's going to be friend.tech guys okay don't hear me this is a this is a POC okay this experiment showed me how it can work in the same way that cryptokitties showed me how n of T's can work bankless Nation happy third Friday of August David what time is it it's the bank this Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious never yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier how are you doing Ryan I'm doing fantastic I'm excited to talk about friends how you sell your friends this week because that's what you've been doing yeah and then you sold them right after it that's right it's this app called friend.tech that hit uh I think Friday after we recorded the last roll up and everyone on crypto Twitter was using it uh I used it it's kind of interesting we're going to talk about that number one friend.tech this new app is it a fad or is it a new paradigm what else we got David coming up next we got SEC back in the hot seat after six law professors a16z and Paradigm who both employ lawyers I'll voice their disbelief about how the SEC ought to approach crypto and proposes something new uh in lieu of that also SPF is on the Move uh it seems like David you might now be neighbors with Sam bankman freed that's exactly right this is a factual statement after that we'll talk about PayPal Visa all making moves into crypto this week and then coinbase Futures coinbase getting some Futures what does this mean how is this changing coinbase's International strategy if they are allowed to roll their own Futures here at home all of this is coming up as we get into this episode so make sure to like subscribe rate and review wherever you get your podcast so we can get the Good gospel of crypto to the top of these iTunes charts or Spotify charts or YouTube wherever there's an algorithm give those five star reviews so we can push it up to the top guys before we get in want to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at safe they have a message for you safe of course is the wallet that everyone in crypto uses it's one that I certainly recommend David what are they rolling out yeah so safe is proposing their modular open source safe core protocol as the standard way to move forward for the wallet transition to Smart contract wallets if you all ever caught my talk at Devcon there's just Universal consensus in the world of Wallace and in the world of ethereum that we are going to all have Smart contract wallets by default but that is not the way things currently are that is the future that we are trying to get there safe like I said is proposing their safe core protocol as the standard and so they want you to check it out it features an unopinionated core standard as vendor agnostic High component reuse and robust security this is how we prevent bugs while also maintaining interoperability and smart account diversity so there is a link in the show notes to get started with safe core if you are a Dev they also have a safe Con coming up in in Berlin Germany so if you are in around Germany or around the European area they are doing a safe Con in September so check out the link in the show notes to get started with that con s in conference by the way all right not con as in like a con job I hate that we have to specify this what is this this is crypto David let me introduce you um there have been some cons in crypto yes they're in this agenda actually multiple we have multiple cons in this agenda one of them is living down the street from me as we just said and what if it was a conference but first markets want to thank Kraken for showing us the market charts today and I gotta ask you David what's cracking with Bitcoin price I figure we're never gonna do there were two in a row on this one uh 29 500 is where we started we are currently experiencing some red candles coming in at below 28 000 are we below 28 000 right now this is a moment where I'm gonna have to ask the bankless nation to please pull out your price checker app uh to check out the prices because they're probably outdated 2 twenty seven thousand seven hundred wow uh these numbers have updated in the last like five seconds uh we are currently dumping uh down below five percent negative five percent look at this red candle why are we dumping on the red candle I don't know but all right sellers and buyers all right well at least it's not flat in the past at least four weeks yeah uh ether doing the same thing this looks like an equivalent chart yep yeah yeah so either when I put these numbers in was that 1740 we are now at 1730 so we are down six percent six percent all right I might have to find out um afterwards also the ratio uh down ratio is doing normal no it's flat okay pretty flat uh total crypto market cap we're still above a trillion 1.16 trillion uh tell us about Layer Two beat though okay so this is the total value locked um tell me this number's going up at least that number is going up we are at 10.1 billion dollars tvl on Layer Two with AV activity the activity uh past 5x eth layer one so combined uh ethereum through put on this layer two is if you want to hit that activity tab right uh it is now 5x oh we're down to 4.92 it was five earlier we approached we breached five for the first time we are now at 4.92 although I'm X of what of ethereum remind us so ratios of ethereum's throughput to the ethereum layer one so layer twos are doing five ethereums collectively versus the ethereum layer one uh bass is now included I believe in all of this tvl and activity which we'll talk about in a little bit how the base launch has gone so far uh but before we get there I want to talk about the Trad markets for a second oh boy this is this is the thing that caught my interest this week this is the Atlanta fed and you know when I say Atlanta fed the FED is um has all these different I'm going to call them chapters they're not chapters but you know Geographic you know Banks the Atlanta fed apparently has a model which predicts uh GDP for the US and their model is currently predicting 5.8 GDP growth in Q3 uh it seems wildly optimistic uh and yet that's that's annualized over the year right 5.8 percent annualized over the year but just in Q3 right okay gargantuan that's a big quarter okay you have to take this with a grain of salt uh because it's a prediction model and as more data comes in it will probably go down all right but a lot of the market indicators of GDP have been up including industrial production uh print which showed Factory output uh jumped one percent in July so it looks like GDP ain't too bad I don't know if you ever look at this chart David but let me show you this is um on the St Louis fed they keep track of a bunch of the GDP numbers here yeah this is GDP over time look at that so you see covid right down 30 percent on a coil in Q2 2020 that was a bad quarter negative 32 so he popped up but we did pop up uh to positive in Q3 2020 I'm positive from the previous anyway this is where we are right now and maybe I'll Circle in on uh yeah let's zoom in yeah up into the right chart right wow now um so I guess the the end of the story is uh GDP is not looking so bad these days and uh yeah it is insane actually like that are you surprised by this this is why I put it in here because I was like oh I haven't been looking at GDP for a while because you know other numbers are more interesting but these numbers are better than I thought they'd be yes this is I I will call this a flash as in this is a single point of measurement uh it's it really matters with if this thing continues this is a this is a one of these charts where it's actually the area under the curve that is the big thing rather than the single point of reference um and so the longer that this is sustained the better it gets but man we're coming in at 5.8 percent that is crazy where is all this Genie where are we getting this GDP from uh what couch cushion did we look under yeah that's probably a subject for an entire podcast but what's interesting is um I don't hear the r word recession being said very often these days and a year ago that was a kind of a different story um all right well let's let's uh actually talk about what bass is doing because uh no recession in layer twos either and base launched recently was that last week the week before okay last week uh how's it going what are we looking at uh I would say I said on Twitter this is one of the takes I gave is that this was the best protocol launch that crypto has ever seen wow zero hiccups bridging was seamless like no one has had any problem this is UI ux of interacting with bass is great you know transaction fees are super cheap because they're still here too as we know uh failed transactions no one's talking about any failed transactions anywhere and there's a ton of apps there's a ton of things to do the first the first time I went on base I ended up minting like five nfts inside of two minutes really and I redeemed one for a hat which is sitting on my wall over there it says on chain nft a utility yeah I minted an nft and then I went to like a stripe checkout page and then it was connected my wallet and had the nft in it and the 30 hat dropped to zero because that's what the nft does and then I bought the hat and all within like five minutes it was great and you actually received the Hat it's not a client you want me to go show you it's great yeah I'll go grab it and after I spit off some some facts uh tvl almost uh over 230 million dollars so closing in on one quarter of a billion dollars averaging averaging almost nine transactions a second over for 24 hours uh site which makes this the second most popular Layer Two behind the zksync era which has got 10.2 transactions per second although I bet you the ratio between like users doing things that I was doing like and then bots on ZK sync is probably different um transaction volume all time high on August 10th with a record of you ready for this 136 000 active Wallets on the network what yeah 42 of them were all first time based users 42 000. not 42. um yeah so a whole total number of 142 000 unique wallets I've already bridged assets over to base and claimed the bridge to base nft this is going to be one of those nfts can you I don't know if you can pull that up if you have that pulled up the bridge to base nft maybe you want to search Google for it um uh bridge to base nft yeah this is going to be one of those nfts where like you're going to show your grandkids like one back in the day I used to I used a bridge to get on to base and I'm into the nft and it's one of yeah one of these things yeah press the mint button bruh like with a wallet that I've bridged with or yeah metamask coinbase wallet fantastic I gotta go find a wallet that I've bridged with yeah yeah that's cool or you can Bridge it takes two like two seconds yeah yeah yeah so some great success out of Base I'll go with my hat yeah I can't Bridge live on the episode David all right he's getting this hat one second on chain hat hey there it is okay oh wait uh zoom in there it is it just has on trains it just says on chain yeah I like that that's a great hat that's all there were other colors there was like white on white there was white on black but I got the red on black because it matches my bank was hat yeah that looks very that's very bankless of you um of course the best analysis comes uh from poop man one of my favorite Twitter Twitter accounts right now poop man defy bro there's that listen to the show man yeah I know they had they need to respect poop man they need to know too David thank you what is poop man telling us about race analysis it is it's pretty good put in a great tweet about bass okay so bass has been earning 3x more Revenue than ARB or optimism arbitrum or optimism while only incurring 50 of batch submitter costs compared to the others interesting so like this is the cost of actually being a roll-up you submit uh the bashes down to the layer one comparing the daily fee margins from transaction fees between optimism arbitrum and bass revenues in the last week I think uh 1.25 million optimism Revenue 424 000 optimism I did say arbitrine but I stopped because I thought I didn't arbitrary Revenue 424 000 optimism Revenue four hundred and four thousand what makes this more interesting is that the cost of batch submitters on Base is almost the is the cheapest among all of these so I submitter cost for base 522 000 an arbitrum submitter cost 950 000 and optimism submitter cost 1 million what do you mean submitter costs is how much you pay ethereum uh yes yes yeah exactly right um and so like this is the this is one of the cost of the protocol I remember so the profit if you want to calculate the profit you take those fees the 1.25 million base revenue and you subtract largely the base submitter costs 522k we're still left with what 700k in profit that's right hey and like this this is the coinbase uh coinbase gets 85 and then the op Collective gets 15 is Wall Street noticing this no probably not probably not um so he continues if this data is correct base is likely the most cost effective and profitable Layer Two right now thanks this is probably uh from the fame from coinbase bass has been able to leverage this network effects and popularity to drive immense on-chain activities and volume potentially create a positive feedback loop increase volume attracts more users more users in turn build more projects on base um and you know rinse and repeat uh and then also like we have this new friends Tech phenomenon which I bet you is one of a nice healthy chunk of the volume on bass right now we'll talk about that a little bit later in the show bass is going to be a growing part of the content app permissionless I think I said this last week but me Ben Jones from optimism Jesse from base are on a panel at permissionless where we're going to talk about some of these details all about the base layer 2 and its relationship to the optimism Collective um and since we're talking about permissionless this is a PSA for all bankless citizens out there we are throwing I'm a citizen are you you're a citizen yeah wait do you pay for it with a company credit card or a personal credit card up I think a personal credit card because I've never deactivated you're not a citizen I am I but I pay with a company credit card all right anyway what if you are a bankless citizen we are throwing a party how big of a party 500 people who's coming you if you're going to permissionless and you're a bankless citizen you are invited and literally everyone who's at permissionless who's also been on the podcast before so like all the speakers that we invited and basically all of our friends and and you know people that we like to hang out with in the space and also all the bankless citizens uh so they're in the Discord going to the Discord say and there was there will eventually be a link that we're going to hand around to our citizens uh and so make sure to come it's going to be very very fun Ryan will actually be there is that a bar so Ryan and I will have drinks I'm gonna sit right there uh well yeah I mean we won't talk to each other the whole night right we don't hang out and realize one thing I should say is okay there there's a place for 500 right um we might not be able to give everyone who is a bankless citizen uh ticket hopefully I don't know how many bankless citizens are showing up to permission it's while availability last yes yes as soon as we have 500 we uh you know fire code says we can fire code nation state regulations preventing us from Gathering more than five right yeah yeah they were pressing the bankless nation but we're not there yet so uh stay tuned for that link if you're a bank with citizen it's gonna be fun what do we got coming up next David coming up next we're going to talk about friend Tech the phenomenon that has swept through crypto Twitter passing fat or new paradigm if it is a passing fad is there still lessons to be learned we will talk about this uh SBF my new neighbor we're going to talk about how that happened uh and then we are also we Bank lists are dropping in app to help you hunt some airdrops so all this is coming up and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially Kraken the actual organization who's going to give us all free drinks at

in D5 download the uni swap wallet today on iOS there is a link in the show notes friend.tech swept crypto last week it's a new application on base okay explain this one to me what is friend.tech and why does why is everyone flocking to this app yeah it is an app built on base but okay so it's it's an app I think it's for iOS only um because it's not it's not an IOS app but it okay I see what you're saying yes okay it only works on iOS devices right yes okay so they why why are we like hung up on this one little point because of the IOS app store charges is 30 fees to all apps so friends.tech did this workaround where Safari on the the native Apple browser that no one uses has this ability this native ability in your iPhone to actually take a website and then turn it into a little widget Square just like a normal app but it's not an app it's just a dirt an icon right it's just a direct to a specific website and so using that it turns it and it behaves like an app it's kind of clunky but it's the workaround so that they don't have to pay uh the Apple Store they don't have to go through the iOS permission it's just like the internet used to be David remember you could just spin up an app and everyone who typed in the URL could access it we didn't have to go through Gatekeepers we didn't have to pay any app fees it's like that yeah and it's a little bit harder right if you're using some kind of kind of clunky because it's okay it's one of the first of its kind they actually but it's doable I the first time I actually used this was to actually turn Chat gbt into an app before they actually release an app so like it was a nice little shortcut right uh but this is actually a core part of how this stack is built then you uh sign in using a code it's like you know they're doing their gated launch to help you know drum up excitement about it so I got a code submitted it opened up friends dot app and I'm given a base wallet and a brand new ethereum wallet that is non-custodial no one that's my wallet because it's built into my phone because it's saved in the little app thing so I have my own wallet I link my Twitter account and so I link my Twitter account to this wallet and all of a sudden I have my friend's profile and then people start buying shares of me uh why are people buying shares of me yeah why I don't know because I'm just such a valuable kind of just a valuable friend to own shares about because they want to sell you and they want to make money on you well they think that other people are also going to buy shares on of me ah yeah and so there's like a leaderboard for this well one step two you actually have to bridge some ether yes right over like point one ether to get myself started here okay it's like you know ten dollars or something you can you can go a very low amount to kind of bootstrap this thing okay so why why yeah why is everyone so excited about this is this just a Ponte game for influencers is this the the only fans of crypto Pros like what I think it is a Ponzi game for influencers part of the incentive is that uh you your account you get five percent of all share trading fees and then the Friends app creators the app the company also gets five percent and then so when you buy a share 90 you uh 10 of the the value of the share five percent goes to the profile the influencer or you know your friend um and then five percent goes to the company and then you retain the share uh and so like me as somebody with a following I can be like oh go buy my shares and then I get trading fees and so I have accumulated 1.4 ether from Trading fees what yes to date and there are let me see there are how many people have bought my shares how many people I'm checking I'm checking I used to be I used to be a shareholder you did you dumped me and I saw it I you I had 45 holders I have 45 holders and then I can't I don't know the supply but like I I own five shares of myself because I believe in myself um I see your pump you're pumping your own bags huh I'm allowed I'm allowed to do this it's transparent right zero X Greg guy also owns Five shares of me goon machine owns four shares tangle account accountant owns two shares altcoin daily i o owns two shares Jairo Kennelly from the bankless Dao he owns two shares with me uh and my current Shares are at all-time highs so all my followers Ryan are in profit what does it take to get a share of David on friend.com one share of David currently costs 0.26 ether 0.26 ether are you kidding me that's hundreds of dollars how much is that that is like four hundred dollars well again four hundred dollars getting less now to get it so like you can sell your share too right and so also I have committed to Distributing all of my trading fees that I accumulate in seven days starting on Sunday to one of my shareholders so on this so you do on this side I'm just going full Ponzi on this this Sunday it's a prize like I said I have accumulated 1.41 ether in trading fees that will continue to go up so every time somebody buys one of my shares and especially as my shares get more expensive the point the five percent of the trading fees that goes into my trading fees earned also goes up so uh 0.25 ether to buy one of my shares five percent of that goes in the trading fees and I am raffling that off to one of my shareholders on Sunday so go buy my shares wow that that that is um worth a disclosure I think David David is benefiting from all of the shares and he is making a commitment I hey you better not refund it to yourself because you're a shareholder I'm allowed I'm I own I own five shares if I win then I get my own trading fees I will do this in a public trustless way I'm trustless trust me bro um but yeah that's the plan what's what's funny about so one question I have for you about the share price so it's basically the shares go up the more demand there is it's just like a unit swap curve yeah so as somebody that's another swap curve yeah yeah it's an x times y equals K kind of thing so as more people buy my shares they get more pricey okay so I think I'm top 20. I think I'm top 20. dang David now you're just I feel like I'm just Ultra show right now let's let's talk about I'm like looking like top 20 yeah yeah let's talk about what um this is doing uh in general so friend.tech on basis generated 650 000 for users for you users they've gone to people like David after launching a beta a week ago users received a five percent chance you talked about with over 250 000 transactions and 23 000 unique users user counts are higher than ethereum's largest nft platforms combined this is a tweet from a massari analyst giving us this info so those are some of the stats that make this happen Okay so I've got this app open it's called friendmex.com uh what in the world am I looking at right now friend Max is a reference to bitmex which is this old derivatives exchange that Arthur Hayes used to run before they got in trouble with the law and but this is just like the the dashboard of friends if you are a Trader so like Bots and people are who are making bets on other people or making money here so like some people have made a lot a lot of money I think I saw somebody people like profiting 30th if you go over to the Discover on the far right side and scroll down about 20-ish people you'll you'll find me again on the leaderboard because I'm coming up you know using my trading fees to pump up my business you have to keep scrolling down trust will say you just scrolled right past it oh yeah my profile picture yeah Mark I have a market cap of 18.8 ether apparently 18 ether uh yeah you know I I think you personally I think you're worth more but I'm also not going to be buying a share uh anytime soon but maybe I should maybe I should maybe you should yeah what's cool about this is um and people are you know maybe asking why we're talking about this so much um this is this friend Max website was just spun up like because all of this data is public all of this data is open and you can create an exchange on top of base on top of friend.tech so um friend.tech is powered by smart contracts uh completely in the background click my my profile so you can see my chart [Music] who are you right there I just click this yeah they can click look at that chart oh that's bullish oh that's so bullish that's a bullish chart that's a buy and you can connect you can connect your wallet right from this app and trade although I don't know it's you know maybe not audited be careful where you connect your wallet here folks okay we're not necessarily endorsing this um you know why I'm excited about this is you know not not just to buy different influencers like David or Kobe or anything else I feel like this is very much a proof of concept uh for a next thing that we've unlocked right you know last week we were talking about um unipig and how that felt like a paradigm shift we just unlocked layer Twos for the first time this to me feels kind of like this this to me almost feels a little bit like crypto kitties did um at you know what it when was that 2017 2018. nfts like we just unlocked some new primitive um this this Twitter poster agrees with me Nicholas friend Tech friend.tech is not a revolution in Social tokens it's the wow moment about a brand new stack pwa Progressive web app that's that's a Safari app we were talking about web 2 login oh that's a great point you can just log in with what your Apple ID your Google ID embedded self-custodial wallet so it's still bankless layer 2 transaction fees so you're not paying like dollars for uh transactions to this iOS notifications it's all of those things combined and to me it feels like a proof of concept I mean likely this thing is just you know it's going to pump and dump it is natively up you know Ponzi scheme I guess there is some utility in in here in that if somebody purchases a share of someone else then they unlock this chat room right yeah we totally forgot the main point of this yeah okay owning a share unlocks a chat room and so like why are people buying my shares I'm actually in there like answering questions that people have directly so like providing value to my shareholders right like there's a room where you can direct access to the influence or that you've you know influencer uh whoever you own a share for you can go talk to them directly and if like they don't respond or they give you shitty answers you can dump them and move on to the next one until you find a room that provides value to you it's cool I think it's very cool and I will say it's uh the most fun I've had in crypto in a while and it felt it felt very much like um cryptic are you still active in there I activated on Friday and Saturday and I was like oh this is cool I see where this is going I'm gonna let other people like do these things but you know maybe maybe look maybe maybe Ryan is underpriced relative to David on friend.tech you know I'm just saying that's a possibility it is it is a possibility yeah so you're taking a bet that Ryan's going to start becoming active rather than the guy who's already acted giving away 1.4 ether to his shareholders what are you doing you don't even have no money look at this see this these are the types of games that like it's basically every Creator is I I suppose incented in like to do something and and I think that the chat room is the first layer of utility but other layers of utility can be added like what imagine if this was scaled out to like Kobe was teasing his followers with feet picks okay right um imagine oh okay so I was right it's it's only fans for crypto Bros so but what happens if you scale this out Beyond kind of like the the um the crypto crowd and you scale this out to like I don't know music artists I mean how much would people pay for like Taylor Swift chat room like a share of that so much you can see how this scales and how the social games like it's just social clout economic games uh meets crypto and it just something about this for me just kind of works or unlocks something that's going to be absolutely big and again I don't know that friend.tech will capture all of this but somebody's going to we're we're in a new frontier here I think really the biggest pressure that I see on this on the future is the progressive web app this is the crypto native application that just routes around the 30 tax of apple and if this becomes standard if like a lot of people start you know providing Services through Progressive web apps that are crypto and so like anyone that wants to do their thing but they can't because of Apple they just start doing this Progressive web app instead it's a bargaining chip against Apple because we just routed around their gate guys it's it's the open internet right because if you if you try to do this on uh the App Store they'd want 30 transaction fee for all of this like it wouldn't work like there their systems are not set up to handle crypto economics in this way and so we it's a big bargaining trip that the crypto industry has to force Apple's hands to either lower their fee or just like crypto in or do something or we'll just you know Progressive web app our way around their gate guys I'm only half joking when I'm about to say this our Ponzi games are going to change the world they're going to change the internet like for real this is going to lead to a more open internet yeah Ponzi games versus Ponzi schemes Ponzi schemes are where somebody's a rug puller Ponzi games is where it's kind of just a collective game of chicken that we all agree to play well I mean some of these influencers some of these influencers on there might be regulars we don't know I mean some of them might be they could watch what game they're playing they could walk among us right now uh what do we got next okay the SEC versus coinbase I feel like this is The Avengers assembling here David because a a set of lawyers uh filed what's called an amicus brief saying the SEC should stop should leave coinbase alone basically should drop the case okay and um what is an ambicus brief you might ask do you have that question David okay I think it it basically is lawyer speak it's basically where a bunch of outside lawyers who have some level of of prestige some level of legitimacy um write their opinion on a Case either while the case is in progress or you know before it goes why do they do this um you know they just want to communicate their position and so depending on the the level of legitimacy I think court system like the court system the legal system will kind of look on this not as a piece of evidence necessarily but um as a you know an element of the argument here and so this is a bunch of lawyers who've stood up and said hey the SEC is out of line here so the law professors are from Yale University of Chicago UCLA Boston University uh and they go through and they School the SEC on the history and meaning of an investment contract both during and after the passage of the original Federal Securities act in 1932 3 the act that gives the SEC their power and what are their conclusions their conclusions are basically that the sec's argument that crypto tokens are trading on secondary markets are investment contracts is wrong that's what their conclusion is I think the significance of this is not just that this you know opinion is being expressed the crypto industry has been trying to express this opinion for years now the significance of this is that it is a band of legal Minds who are putting forth a legal document which is now in the public space for anyone and all to use in any sort of future legal proceedings that they might need to use it so I think like really it's like these Avengers coming together to produce this future document that allows for any other lawyer to leverage the arguments if they ever find themselves in the positions of needing to be leveraged and so it's ammo it's Collective ammo for us as an industry to shoot that's is that fair I feel like I think that's totally fair yeah and and so this is uh a16z crypto and Paradigm also filing an amicus brief that is as similar and their argument is also similar the sec's approach is a significant and problematic expansion of its regulatory Authority and even threatens purchases of Taylor Swift concerts and Teslas oh no Taylor Swift friends shares yeah definitely French hairs David Senator lemus as well has added to uh the voice of the lawyers coming out swinging against the SEC asking the courts to actually drop the lawsuit entirely I don't know how often that happens where a senator like chastises a regulator and says like the court system should absolutely drop the case um meanwhile there was actually some good news on the regulatory front this week yeah coinbase announced that uh the National Futures Association which is apparently a cftc designated SRO has approved a coinbase financials Market as a registered Futures commission Merchant coinbase can now offer Futures Contract in Bitcoin and ether to eligible customers inside of the United States inside the United States that's us that's us big right yeah so coinbase was recently like six months ago or so making a big push to be International because they could not do this because they could not offer competitive products and services that push push so much United States capital offshore to things like binance and FTX so now they are given the green light to do some of these future stuff inside the United States so that coinbase can do it so that's great news yeah cftc playing nice the SEC still not playing nice but uh you know two steps forward one stop back and we'll get there eventually David speaking of two steps forward SPF is now your neighbor what were we teasing in the intro where's SPF right now yeah so two steps forward to Jail the federal judge has revoked sbf's bail for attempting to tamper with Witnesses wall uh so that he has been moved from house arrest with his parents in Palo Alto California to a New York jail awaiting his criminal trial on October 2nd wait because he was tampering with Witnesses while he was in his parents basement yes yes he was attempting to tamper with Witnesses and therefore violated the terms of the bail turns out if you're on bail you're not allowed to tamper with Witnesses okay uh prosecutors so you know mental note for seems race to both but okay uh prosecutors alleged that SPF repeatedly tried to corruptly influence witness and interfere with a fair trial through attempted public harassment and shaming wow okay so um and so he's in New York not only is he in New York he is in Brooklyn uh really yeah so a federal judge revokes uh bail for FTX Senator Sam Aikman freed uh and the crypto entrepreneur was sent to a crowded Brooklyn administrative prison known for grueling conditions as he awaits trial in October what a quote from someone who's familiar with matter says the existence is pretty bleak of the inside of the jail Federal project prosecutors that have alleged that bankman freed 31 violated bail agreements of course uh communicating with a New York Times Reporter about Caroline Ellison his former girlfriend who previously served as CEO of Alameda of course uh and uh and Ellison Caroline has pleaded guilty to multiple fraud charges and entered a plea deal to testify against SPF so we have you know ex-girlfriend ex-boyfriend you know in a prisoner's dilemma together apparently SBF released her diary which he had access to which is just like I mean he's a sleeve ball so it's not beneath him but that's why he's back in jail because he's tampering with with uh with uh Witnesses he's like uh I'll put his the the address of where the trail is in Google maps and in my apartment it's like a 30 minute bus ride it's not that bad that's so bizarre but David I'm not sure if the corruption stops just with SPF so the doj this week released an indictment alleging that SPF was lobbying Congress and high-level government officials this is pretty big news you wonder who else was caught up in sbf's trap here and it it sounds like there's a lot of people on Capitol Hill that may need to provide some answers around this yeah I don't think this is news to anyone in the crypto industry who's been following the FTX case but of course FTX and SPF just like spewed out what the doj is alleging to be over hundreds of millions of dollars to both Democrats and Republicans so quote from this article the defendancy use of customer deposits to conduct a political influence campaign was a part of the wirefox scheme charged in the original indictment and as a part of the originally charged money laundering scheme the defendant also concealed the source of fraudulent proceeds through political straw donations so the doj is on the case which is great because we're going to get some more clarity and we're going to see who turned a blind eye to all that incoming money from FTX David this is absolutely crazy but this actually might make Gary Gensler a witness in this case okay which would mean if that I don't think what is not being charged is that Gary Gensler received money that's not that's not just to make sure that's Crystal Clear it's true we don't know but he might be aware he could still be compelled to testify and that would mean that SPS lawyers would be able to cross-examine genzler under oath at a trial yeah where can I buy tickets man or tickets are pumping right now that would just make my day it would be a complete day but we're dumping instead uh what do we got coming up next though David fights over fraud proofs or are going to talk about this controversy and how you should understand it also get coin partnering with shell the oil company has obviously caused some controversy we'll talk about both sides of that argument as well and also we found Donald Trump's eth address you'll never guess what he's holding all this coming up and more but

statorlabs.com staking protocol today as we've gotten into layer 2 summer the layer 2 Wars are heating up and so this week it was fraud proofs fraud proofs do they matter and so this is a post from Matt buyback ibek uh he says it's crazy how few people are aware of the risks of using optimism and other op Sac Roll-Ups given that they do not have active fraud proofs it's only honestly one of the most substantial risks to the ethereum ecosystem today if the centralized sequencer wants to land invalid output proposals it can in other words the centralized optimism sequencer can settle a malicious transaction that removes all three billion dollars in the bridge to an address of their choosing there's nothing that anyone can do about it it's really just a decentralization facade we need to push these Roll-Ups to implement fraud proofs yesterday uh so that is the the oh my God this is a really big deal people should pay attention to this take number one here's take number two what can I ask though David just just to like set the basis so who doesn't have fraud proofs which chains do and which chain stone is this all in Layer Two beat yeah this is all on Layer Two beat most chains do not have fraud proofs the arbitrum Bold most most Roll-Ups yes the arbitrine Bold um announcement is arbitrary is arbitrum gaining decentralized fraud proofs they they still need that to be um merged into the protocol but I mean the Dallas is going to vote Yes and it's going to happen um all op stack Roll-Ups do not have fraud proofs because including bass which is including maybe why some of this narrative is heating up a bit right so like the reason yeah that's exactly right why is this conversation happening now well I think it's actually just like a normal immune response of the crypto industry sometimes stuff like this needs to happen we are seeing new users and tvl and mind chair grow go to base which is a fork of the op stack a clone of basically optimism bedrock and then also also optimism Bedrock doesn't have fraud proofs because they just haven't implemented it yet and so now the while there was previously some like Grace to given about layer two teams about their state of thought proofs or lack thereof now people are like okay these things are mainnet now yeah like it's only looking for dates and yeah it's no longer time to be not having fraud proofs so that was the first take the second take is from a Martin koppelman who's maybe saying this a little bit more Punchy to be very clear until they add fraud proofs all the three billion dollars that are in the optimism and base Bridges can be taken out at any time and users can do nothing about that not sure under what definition this is called non-custodial okay so these are like the two takes about like yo like red fire alarm sounds we should be very cautious and concerned about this um there is also the other half of the story and I think DC Builder uh said this very well he said tired of seeing take on optimism for not having Canon Live Canon is their version of fraud proofs there there was a lot of fighting on crypto Twitter and so I don't I'm about to read the next sentence and it was not in response to any of the just two takes there was a lot of just like if you're in crypto Twitter you know that gets thrown uh you people should get a life and tension seeking is not what's going to get you anywhere yes Bedrock was a prerequisite for Canon yes Canon has been the main focus of optimism ever since they shipped Bedrock almost two months ago yes all the progress is available on GitHub for y'all to see stop making long threads about why your rollup is better permission fraud proofs live or a ZK system that is as mature as a toddler and with more security surface area than the world's oceans David the kids are fighting and then okay so then uh AJ Warner from arbitrum responded to this tweet which I thought was very very useful and so I'll just read that one as well I'm obviously very bias here so take my perspective with the Himalayan sized grain of salt but I don't think this criticism is because they don't have fraud approach live building proofs is hard decentralizing proofs and making them permissionless is harder if they think they're they the best roadmap for the project was emphasizing bedrock and making all of its components modular before building the prover that is a super reasonable road map I'm gonna unpack that really quick before continuing building Bedrock which is the current implementation of optimism mainnet and also base was a precursor step to implementing fraud proofs you need the Bedrock scaffolding to insert the fraud proofs module into the scaffolding they needed Bedrock first so they could get to implementing Canon so I'll continue on with AJ's take I think the criticism which in my opinion is completely Justified is the other decision that uh have also been made alongside that this stems from my opinion that having some sort of prover with training wheels should be necessary to qualify as a stage zero roll-up this is how I think things have evolved and represents the frustration of many other roll-up teams I don't think any other team or Community could have or would consider pulling off the below a set of operations one if you want to prioritize a roadmap that will take years to build approver you don't have to launch a roll-up the ZK teams didn't and they lost a significant opportunity for market share and land grab two if you launch you don't have to launch a token and massive incentives to use the technology before the prover is built three if you want to incentivize people to use your implementation you don't have to prioritize building out the op stack and superchange so that anyone in the world is encouraged to launch their own roll up one of the reasons why I think the first bullet was acceptable by the community was because the optimism team is trustworthy and nobody thinks that they will steal funds and I 100 share that sentiment but they have extended that trustworthiness to this stack in which anyone can run it and the trust assumptions completely fall over let me try and distill this so the op stack strategy which I'm a big fan of is to try and get as many chains as possible Fork the op stack build your own chain let's democratize access to building Chains It's one of the cool things about this technology which is I think is a great strategy um then AJ is articulating here that that is like the order of operations is bad because if you promote doing that before you solve your fraud proofs module well then you're actually promoting just the right the proliferation of centralized change which I think is can I interject there so it's um not that this hasn't been done before right so it's sort of a market share type of prioritization I also think you can argue that that Bedrock is also necessary first and making that open source and releasing that but there's definitely an argument that that some of um optimism strategy has been a market share type of strategy we've also seen this before polygon launched for years a proof of stake Network and uh that was a side chain and I I remember before a lot of um you know people out you know we're angry about this but I also remember that uh polygon took market share away from the binance chain which to my knowledge has no plan to actually phase into a validium or roll-up of any kind right and so polygon went with the market share approach and they added security and decentralization later and that seems to be a bit more what optimism is doing in this case and so some people are are griping with the order of operations here yes that's right and so like it's a little bit of like damned if you do damned if you don't for the optimism road map like I said they needed to ship Bedrock so that they could Implement fraud proofs what is bedrock it is the op stack and so they simultaneously have the op stack as a precursor to implementing fraud proofs but then once they have the op stack then you have you know coinbase Lyra public goods Network World coin mantle all forking the op stack because they all want their chains so it's like it's kind of just the way that the Universe played out but then I will also say like the immune response from you know the broader layer 2 ecosystem saying hey not having fraud proofs is no longer like tenable in this in you know halfway through 2023 is also a valid take now I'm very well connected to the optimism team I know for a fact that they are all focused on shipping fraud proof that has been the number one Focus since shipping Bedrock because like this like I said Bedrock was a precursor to shipping fraud proofs so we are now in this like this uncanny and now this is this is where we are um and then this of course the Solana ecosystem will tell you that fraud proofs are never coming and these layer twos are going to be centralized forever wrong it's many of them but yeah I um I I agree with that I think we've we've talked about it sufficiently one thing I will do a big plus one on though is um AJ's post right here it's just a just a nice rational post spells it out it's it's interesting by the way that it's not tweet sized you know the old Twitter tweet size of 280 characters or whatever it's actually taking the time to go through the arguments and uh I encourage more conversation like this so all of this is uh is healthy and uh I do think we all as an industry want those red and yellow parts of the pie on Layer Two beat to turn green and uh yeah it's it's good to apply that pressure once in a while David more pressure applied these are things that are breaking out of crypto Twitter maybe in the bear Market but um git coin was on the hot seat as well so what's the get coin controversy this week yeah so kind of an interesting announcement tweet from Bitcoin they say uh get coin tweets out we're happy to share that we've entered a collaboration with shell to accelerate open source Innovation to the energy sector shell the oil company yes together we're driving Sustainable Solutions and making a positive impact in the world let's dive in and then there was a blog post from gitcoin.co about the get coin plus shell partnership oh oh people don't like shell people don't like shell for good reason yeah have you ever read the book um confessions of an economic Hitman Ryan no that that one will destroy it's about the oil industry yeah it's worse than that it's just about the way that like First World countries make third world countries beholden to them indebtedness forever it has to do with the intense international monetary fund it has to do with shell it's all bad so when you think of Bitcoin as a brand you think of like nice wholesome things yeah when you think of shell you do not think those things I think before a station and climate change and like assassinations and Corruption yes that's that's the brand Association a lot of people have as well and that's why this uh this fell pretty flat this tweet fell pretty flat I'd say yeah so I photoshopped in a bunch of just people's takes um here they all are Anthony cesano as a long time fandom user of Bitcoin I have to say I'm extremely disappointed in their decision to partner with shell uh Scooby Troopers I love Bitcoin but this is green washing not green pilling F shell uh hazu quotes the tweet and says quote The end justifies the the means said by Bitcoin 2023 uh so yeah just general WTF response from crypto uh and then here's Kevin owaki who is no longer at Bitcoin he is now at his software company super modular which is built on top of the Bitcoin protocol because Bitcoin is a Proto call now as a doubt and Kevin Kevin was the founder of get coin and as you said yes uh get coin itself is both a protocol and a dow and so Kevin is not you know associated with those things except as a kind of an ambassador for the brand yeah so Kevin owaki uh writes out a tweet titled in all caps oh walkie what do you think of the show Bitcoin which I'm sure is what he has been asked many many times the TLD all over this is that he says I personally don't care for the shell brand I doubt many people will opt in for the optional shell funding pool but we'll see it's a free market I think 500 000 is a pittance especially if you look at Shell's contribution to climate crisis and the brand damage to get coins and also greenwashing is just not okay but then also he goes on and says but the point of git coin is to be a permissionless protocol not to actually pick winners and losers and so he actually he said it better than I did on a podcast which we have a clip for it and so we'll just go ahead and play that because I think this is a hot sign about public goods are relative to the values of the communities they serve some communities are going to want to Dei rounds some are going to think that's woke nonsense some are going to want to fund open source software so I'm just don't give a about open source some people want to fund physical public goods someone to fund digital some are okay with an oil company giving them money and some are not so basically it's impossible to serve all of these memetic tribes at the same time and that's a fundamental tension in what get coins trying to do if you're trying to build the stack for civilizational scale public goods funding all of the tribes don't agree on what is a public good and this was a really profound realization for me and it's why 24 months ago we decided to shut down the company that was get coin grants and turn it into a protocol in the Dow so basically now at gitcoin you have like the Dow contributors and you have their politics you have the pgf work stream which is like the public goods funding work stream that did these Partnerships and then you have the products which are now credibly neutral protocols and so by Design if you think bitcoin's too woke because they're funding diversity Equity inclusion um or that they're taking blood money from Shell then you don't have to take the money but you can still use the protocols and anyone can go to manager.getcoin.com and set up their own quadratic funding ground for their own values we'll also be at permissionless and he will be at the party so if you want to berate him or ask him about his opinions on other things he's trying his best like this is incredibly neutral a protocol folks I I think he's right on there um cow swap speaking of credibly neutral protocols they just released t-wop orders what is a t-wop order David yeah t-wop time weighted average price uh so this is a way to automate your dollars cost averaging in a very short amount of time uh that's probably not the best way to say dollar cost averaging but take dollar cost averaging and compress it down to like an hour or a day or something really narrow but uh there's a t-wopping is like a strategy that if you have a very big order to spread out your order to match volume over time so as more buying picks up your order will be fulfilled faster and as it's buying or so as volume slows down your order will be fulfilled slower this has been harder to introduce into native crypto dexes just because of the logic that is required to make make this happen but Cal swap has done it and so there's a link in the show notes if you want to try it out and you can do it right from the safe wall the the cool thing about this um architecture is it's intense based architecture right so it's basically rather than commit to a transaction you commit to an intent and that's been a theme that we've been exploring definitely and all of crypto has been exploring definitely this summer um so very cool Visa has always impressed me with uh how on top of crypto they've been and this week was no exception to that they are testing an on-chain payment system for gas with a card so they're essentially abstracting gas fees away for blockchain payments and allowing you to complete an on-chain transaction just with your Visa card so the gas is kind of paid via account abstraction in the background just really cool to see like the largest payment company in the world innovating on this and I think this is also related to you two other headlines from this week so metamask has just rolled out a one-click crypto buy button with Apple pay so Apple pay metamask you can get into Fiat you can get into crypto directly through your Apple pay account also cool Ledger and PayPal have also introduced a partnership ship so now Ledger users will be able to buy crypto automatically via their PayPal account this whole chain of things we've got Visa we've got kind of Apple pay and we've got Ledger these feel very much like 2023 things bear Market things that we will have no concept of in 2019. do you remember all the the fake Partnerships that were going around kind of the you know the Ico landscape where somebody would take a picture of themselves a skateboard in front of Google yeah or they'd be they'd advertise a partnership with Amazon and really they're just using AWS servers for some like portion of their user interface I know that that sounds insane and that's what 2017 was like that happened so so many times he has a real tactic that many icos did and what's so crazy is now we actually have these large real hardships this is like going mainstream I mean last week PayPal just rolled out a stable coin how crazy is that ledger and PayPal together so now you can go directly from PayPal to a bankless wallet in Ledger right Visa pushing forward not just like uh we have a blockchain strategy they're looking at account abstraction it's so cool to see this and makes me uh very bullish even in the midst of this bear Market yeah certainly and so it also just shows that we have enough like ux Solutions UI ux solutions to make this some of this stuff easy uh you from PayPal to your ethereum wallet was like that took 50 steps in seven in 2017. so in South America Ryan um Argentina has a apparently a far right pro-bitcoin candidate Javier milai Miley who's won a primary in uh in Argentina uh and there's a this clip going around the internet about him explaining Bitcoin and ethereum to like the news panelists that he's like shoulder shoulder with and so all of all the crypto is like oh my God people are getting it and also being elected into into Argentine offices Argentina of course very very crypto one of the most crypto native countries that exists it could be number one to be honest um why why is why is Argentina so far ahead uh High inflation and high internet uh connectivity and a technically competent population uh and and so like it's one of the most crypto enabled countries that exist so it is no surprise that we are getting crypto politicians uh working their way through um through getting elected uh so Javier's Coalition known as the lat libertad garnered more than 30 percent of votes in the political contest I think the big story here is that crypto is continuing to become a global political movement and uh I don't know very much about this this candidate it's certainly not an endorsement I've heard many mixed reviews in fact many negative reviews from the Argentine community and apparently this candidates track record in crypto has been Rocky he's been embroiled in high profile crypto Ponzi schemes one called coinx which allegedly stole 800 000 worth of of pesos so I don't really know very much about this candidate other than the story that crypto is becoming a political movement and speaking of politics and crypto David we this week got to see what Donald Trump holds in his ethereum wallet do you want to know what he's holding so excited here it is right here uh we believe this Etha dress ending with 22 CE is Donald Trump's ether address ethereum address this is supported by information from his financial statements I believe probably the court system August 14th so this is what he's holding David rate this Pro portfolio what do you think of Trump's portfolio it is just an A plus portfolio it actually is it's great it's great okay what's in it he's got four assets ether he's got 1.5 000 ether worth 2.8 million dollars coming in at number one and then he's got 16 weath 3.4 Matic and 12 usdc so it's 99 ether there you go where did this man get all of this ether why does he have Matic well it's because of the Trump nft sales on polygon he needed the Matic for gas and they were sold in eth so he made 2.8 million dollars in ether um you know Trump is just making money on his nft uh the only thing I've ever heard him say explicitly about crypto was this from a fox business interview in December 2021 about crypto he said I've never loved it because I like to have the dollar you should do this in your Donald Trump accent I shouldn't be reading this I've never loved it because I have always loved the dollar Trump told Fox Business in a December 2020 interview way better I was never a big fan but it's building up bigger and bigger and no one's doing anything about it but I want our currency called the dollar Impressions and for some reason the Donald Trump I'm not completely terrible at I don't know it's pretty good I gotta admit it's pretty good right now he's a Fiat Maxi like I Trump trump declares he is a Fiat maximum it may change though once he gets bags I mean who knows all right moving on here's a headline that I thoroughly enjoyed out of a coindesk uh Fallen hedge fund three arrows Capital co-founders were fined by Dubai's crypto regulator over their new bankruptcy claims Exchange open X uh so you know how much volume open X has done Ryan like how much they they have the okay what is open X it is an exchange for bankruptcy claims coming from the like the ones that through those Capital caused like anyone like Celsius Capital themselves FTX uh Voyager any of the bankruptcy that we like reported on for like almost a year straight uh openx is a an exchange a crypto exchange to trade claims that these guys co-founders Capital yeah yes man man they are just loving that we are talking about this right now and so I'm gonna get to the meat of this whole thing the whole the volume on open X is coming in at a whopping like a couple thousand dollars wow that's it and so is that why they're being fined uh yes they are being fined for like not being up to stuff with the Dubai crypto regulator they are being fined 2.7 million dollars on their exchange that they've had to build from scratch and probably have you know a million dollars of investment in and they've made zero money on it so they are in the hole they are can you imagine investing in this thing though they actually raised money and investors were willing to give them money for this thing that that blows my mind yeah yeah so they they're in Dubai because they can't go anywhere else because if they go anywhere else they'll get extradited to the United States and then thrown in jail and now they're in Dubai and they owe 2.7 million dollars that they probably don't have and by the way David you know we're talking about friend.tech in the Progressive web app the bankless app is also available as a progressive web app you can open this thing in Safari you can set it to your home page and you can actually use it did I just blow your mind right now I didn't know that we had a progressive web app I thought just had an app well you have a you have a progressive web app if you just load it in your Safari browser and you added we had a progressive web app before I even knew that what a progressive web app was cool yep yep we just bypassed Apple uh we're doing it but anyway we got the airdrop hunter that we launched this week what does this thing do okay so the airdrop Hunter what does it do it helps you hunt air drops it's in the title uh so airdrops of course are this meta in crypto and that meta shifts and so we've built this product because we we were writing this as articles like hey there's this like new crypto app they don't have a token they're probably gonna have a token here's how you use this app and then if you use this app you are you're likely get some some maybe for the token airdrops if they ever we don't know and so like a part of the bank list newsletter which is now the bank list website bankless media.org has always been just like here's how you use this defy app like one of the earliest articles in bankless history is Ryan Sean Adams here saying here's how you use uniswa up and then later anyone who did that article got the uniswap airdrop and this in like our articles have progressed we did you know we did dydx we did like a lot of layer twos and so as soon as the airdrop meta has unfolded a lot of these guides like here's how you use this uh here's how you use this defy app has also simultaneously been like and then you do these things in order to maximize your chances for receiving the airdrop and so now we've just turned this because of our team our Chad team we now have a product team and also airdrop Hunters who are filling out like all these different possible protocols that might have an airdrop how to use them what to do inside of them to maximize your footprint for receiving an airdrop and then like a step-by-step process to make this easy for people and so this is part of the progression of the story of bankless I think is like how to use defy apps how to learn about them and then how to grow your on-chain footprint to do the thing that Ryan always loves to to tell you is like crypto pays you to learn it he's mouthing it right now and so now we've just formalized this into a product for the bankless citizens so if you are already a bankless citizen a come to our party at permissionless and B while you're waiting for permissionless I think we have 31 air drops and we're going to just add more and more and more um and I also want to add in a bit about the difference between what we are calling airdrop hunting versus airdrop farming so there's this vertical that's growing out there do you ever remember seeing like the Pokemon go people with like 50 phones all at once there's no but that's crazy that's a that's a thing yeah like there's there's an industry that exists they're all based out of Asia generally but yeah just like there's airdrop fine farming which is like these highly capitalized kind of like just like how proof of work mining is now in the hands of just like extremely well capitalized verticals entities entities not individuals so there's the the era of like airdrop farming is upon us and that is not what we want to promote and that is not what we are trying to instill in this product the product is like first use this application as a real human as a real person to do things that we think are in what the protocol wants you to do things like locking uh like you know deposits rather than just transacting right right like things that are actually truly valuable to the protocol because our job is to try and Guess The Meta of what future airdrop criteria will be and that meta is going to respond to the airdrop farmers and so as like all of the bankless citizens they're humans those are human beings we talked to them into the in the Discord we have Jack guiding like talking about like dgen stuff we have Jack the chief Hunter who's like guiding some of these citizens through some of these apps these are the humans and so we're trying to give humans a platform to stand out against the Bots and that is the airdrop Hunter yeah well said hunt and then settle those are two learn hunt Settle yeah learn hunt settle that's the bankless platform in a nutshell right now so go check that out if um and by the way if you've never considered becoming a bankless citizen I think this is a compelling opportunity to do that so you can check this out so I think we provide one airdrop uh hunt available for uh our free members and then um you get 31 of these if you're a citizen and we're going to be adding more every week so I think we've got another batch of a dozen or two dozen coming and uh we'll of course keep you updated on this the one other thing I want to mention is um beware of phishing attempts okay so this has been something that I feel like it's been plaguing crypto all summer of course it's always been here but has really ramped up this summer and has been sophisticatedness is that all-time highs what do we mean by phishing okay that means like you could get an email from someone you think is bankless and is actually not bankless that's telling you to click a button and connect your wallet and your funds could be drained okay so emails from bankless only come from the app bankless URL and if you go to a third party website make sure it's got the lock the https and it's www.banklist.com and that's the URL that's from us because there are people out there that are sending spammy else to try to get you to click a button connect your wallet and drain your funds so be careful out there it's it's definitely still the wild west and if you need help and you are confused and you just want some guidance or some friends along the journey come into the Discord we'll help you out totally uh David we got one raise this week but it's a pretty large one bitco raced a hundred million dollars uh who is bitco um 100 million dollars why is this significant yeah bitco is a custodian they're actually the creators The Producers one of the producers of wrapped Bitcoin uh because they are the custodians of the Bitcoin that backs the wrapped Bitcoin but they're a Bitcoin and crypto custodian um why are valued at 1.75 billion dollars I'm pretty sure the custodian play is like eventually like PayPal bought a custodian um anyone that any bank that wants to do crypto stuff is probably just gonna buy a custodian and so this is this is being value valued at kind of that 1.75 billion dollars is nice 100 million dollar raise this is their crec congratulations to bitcoin David what do we got coming up next coming up next we are in the early endings of base and there are rug pulls and meme coins everywhere is that a problem we'll talk about that as a question from the nation also a hot take why on chain revenue is the next meta and the main thing that you should be paying attention to right now does it take of the week from Van Spencer we also got a take from Ryan that we're going to talk about as well and of course we're going to talk about what we're bullish on and of course the meme of the week so all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible mantle formerly known as bit Dao is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web 3 space for mantle mantle already has subcomm from around web free onboarded like game 7 for web 3 gaming and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramp so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle arbitrum is accelerating the web3 landscape with a suite of secure ethereum scaling Solutions hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 with flourishing D5 and nft ecosystems arbitrum Nova is quickly becoming a web 3 gaming Hub and social adapts like Reddit are also calling arbitrim home and now arbitrum orbit allows you to use arbitrum's secure scaling technology to build your own layer 3 giving you access to interoperable customizable permissions with dedicated throughput whether you are a developer Enterprise or user arbitrum orbit lets you take your project to new heights all of these Technologies leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible faster transaction speeds and significantly lower gas speeds so visit arbitrum.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrary experience web3 development the way it was always meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free we got some questions of the week this one from the bankless Discord from uh someone calls themselves ZK Jew so the question is in the early Innings with bass it's been Rife with rug pulls uh like bald I guess there was a rug pull called lead I didn't even know that is virtue signaling values really more important than creating a safe environment for onboarding users and what about base all right so some of the things this commenter is saying some of the things that they're seeing are not entirely wholesome over on the base layer two uh what's your reaction to that I think this is just the meta that unfolds when we have something new you need and there's just like the shelling point is for all the Traders and degens and just the attention everyone understands that the attention is on base and so if you are a if you're going to issue a meme coin you should do it on base if you're gonna rug pull you got to go there quickly because that's where the attention is you've got to rug you gotta rug before the attention leaves and so like I I think I gave this take last week but just the all the early and easy things to do are bad and the hard things to do are good good things are harder than bad things and so the first things that you're going to see on any new network are just just because the attention is there just because it's a shelling Point are like all the value extractive things that are just fundamentally unaligned and then we build harder things like there's a reason why friends do not get on base day one it took a little bit I'm sure they were building it prior um but like that's that's kind of my take like early Network stuff is like the worst of the worst and then we improve and iterate and it gets better it's a permissionless network anyone can deploy so coinbase cannot moderate or cannot gatekeep um this reminds me a lot of the early internet in the 90s where um you know early critics of the internet just said the internet's for gambling and porn and scammers right as the 1990s lots of porn on the internet I mean and like they dismissed it as a result so you can't do serious things on the internet and that was a massive mistake but those are the use cases that that pop first certainly um another question here this one from rock3t in the debrief of the Lido episode from earlier this week you talked about how everything eventually settles to layer zero that is the social layer as crypto adoption grows and more people make up layer zero do you worry about the potential impact on ethereum values that the dilution of our social layer could have that's a really uh interesting question I think a fantastic question what's your take yeah that's a really hard question to answer in not a 90-minute podcast we should do a podcast okay so as crypto adoption grows more people make up the layer zero do you worry about the potential impact on ethereum values of the dilution of our social layer could have I actually think that as crypto grows not necessarily do does the layer 0 also grow because the layer zero are like the people on on crypto Twitter the people on The ethereum Magicians forums the people in Discord having important conversations about ethereum if you are just an average user if you're a collector of music nfts and you don't really care about the chain or which protocol or whatever you're on blockchains are designed to be invisible and it's actually a kpi that people go and adopt crypto protocols without actually having to join the conversation we have these conversations because we're nerds and we like to talk about these things and it's important to us and it's philosophically interesting that's layer zero we just needed enough of a robust layer zero to so that we can check our values and make sure that they are doing the right things as we build these networks but it's the networks that's supposed to scale these things the networks are supposed to scale not necessarily the layer zero the layer 0 is a backstop it just needs to be the last line of defense and I don't think it needs to be large it just needs to be precise yeah I I guess I would add maybe two things to that you know one is I I do think that the OG's for for a while will have a disproportionate share of um kind of at least let's say eat steak right why because they bought it in a lower price and they have they have more ether at first so it'll take longer for that to dilute and I think that's a good thing but more broadly I'll say this is a challenge of any social system that we construct so the founders of the Constitution the American Revolution you might say well will future Generations well our grandkids grandkids well they still care about the values that we're trying to embed in this nation state right uh and um they try to document as many of those values as possible inside of a um a protocol essentially an algorithm and that's kind of what we're doing with with crypto right now so I think our constitution our protocols will harden and ossify and over time they'll be less malleable to kind of future Generations who maybe care less about these values and and maybe these future Generations will find new ways to help us live up to the values that that we purported as well I mean that certainly was the case uh in America you know uh expanding the the voter base of you know beyond white males for instance to uh to women to minorities um I think I I have faith I think that once we embed these these values of decentralization into our crypto systems that they'll carry forward uh David takes the week this one from Van Spencer what's he saying Vance Spencer says if you don't nail the transition to on chain who he used a hyphen on chain okay Vance uh okay so if you don't nail the transition to on-chain revenue generation as a centralized crypto exchange you will be left in the Dust by competition in the coming 12 to 18 months it takes an entirely different DNA to succeed on Chain versus centralized different products people and culture basically Advanced I think is just saying that like yo The Meta is shifting on chain and you better go there um interesting speaking of Unchained meta I feel like this is a new Unchained meta for this cycle I said this on Twitter all ethereum competitors want to become an L2 now ethereum won the the thumb war I sort of tweeted this out to get the response not entirely true of course there's still alternative layer ones but um you gotta admit this cycle it's a lot different last time uh you know in 2018 2019 you had a whole bunch of alternative layer ones who are coming to kill ethereum and ethereum's lunch now I'm seeing far more just become layer twos become kind of app chains and so that has been a paradigm shift what do you think about this yeah your your response a little bit uh your reply to your own tweet uh you say okay not all there's still Solana Cosmos and the long tail throwing a flag at Cosmos Cosmos is actually not a chain it's a network of app chains and so ethereum Layer Two role apps could absorb any Cosmos app individually and I think when DOI DX just capitulates and comes back to be a rollout you will know design philosophy of the ethereum I don't know Antonio it's showing all the way around he's showing no signs of capitulation he is all in on uh Cosmos for dydx so we'll see yeah I don't know that they I don't know that they should or they want to I don't know that it's best for the value so layer one of Solana it's imbued in the social contract of Solana that they must be a layer one um like all these people boys are like they think that soul will overtake eth one day and yeah you've been much more involved in those conversations than I have I've just been observing David uh Woody bullish on this week I'm speaking of what I'm bullish on this this week I'm brewing up a piece that I'm gonna write yes um about like some some the differences between I think ethereum and Solana remember my old po crypto podcast yeah of course it was about the differences between Bitcoin and ethereum I think that there are a similar level of depth to that conversation um between Solana and ethereum and I think it goes way deeper than I think most of both camps expect than they think and so I'm both on this article that I'm writing um they is it an article that's going to help us all come together David or is it uh no it's an article that is going to help us all understand okay and uh obviously we'll have my positions about things um it's so I'll tease it a little bit um ethereum and this layer twos layer threes layer fours it's validiums it's like bass Roll-Ups it's Sovereign Roll-Ups there's like so many different ways to construct a roll-up uh ethereum like I say blockchains are supposed to be invisible ethereum's supposed to produce enough networks to permeate throughout the entire internet as well and so when you have all of these different flavors of Roll-Ups we can get into the cracks of the internet because a particular roll-up construction is specific towards a specific use case that allows itself to find itself in the corner of ethereum whether you're on chain data is on ethereum layer one or it's hosted by eigenlayer da or it's hosted by a centralized database the lines between ethereum and the internet blur because of how Roll-Ups are constructed then you have that Solana Vision which is a single Global shared State there's a very firm boundary between what is and is not on Solana and these are two different archetypes which have Downstream consequences and so this article is unpacking that metaphor well I can't wait to host the debate between you and Kyle samani on uh modular versus monolithic David doesn't want to do this debate uh yeah well I'm I'm bullish for your article as well David thank you Brian what do you blush on I have definitely flipped bullish on crypto social media and I think I've been sort of in a I'm not sure this could work type of State well let me let me tell you where I started um I started with being fairly bearish on web3 social media do you remember the early days we created kind of ethereum and people were like now ethereum is going to become Uber now ethereum is going to become a decentralized Twitter and and it just never seemed to kind of Click for me um we made some progress you know we did episodes with like far caster for example and lens and so cautiously excited about those and bullish on on those when I when I started seeing them but the question is always how do we get Mass adoption friend.tech and this experiment again I'm not saying it's going to be friend.tech guys okay don't hear me this is a this is a POC okay this experiment showed me how it can work in the same way that cryptokitties showed me how nfts can work economic social games that's what they did and they they vampire attacked Twitter's Network effect they just vampire did they did do that how'd they do that because I got a message from someone saying oh go check this out right and I was you know someone I trusted I went and I checked it out and I connected my Twitter account and ported some of my social graph over to friend.tech and spend some time on it that is a vamp an economic why did I do that person is kind of cool and partially because of token incentives right I wanted to see how this thing worked that's why everyone did it and then you did it to compete in the social game of the of the leaderboard right we were just talking earlier how like I'm in top 20 I'm in top 20. that means something to you right and so I now I see the path now I see how crypto social media maybe it's Messenger apps maybe it's apps like you know friend.tech can actually do it and I also see a path around Apple App Store Android right with kind of this uh web-based Safari sort of experience again it was still super clunky like half the time when I was using friend.tech the chat didn't work like it was like broken uh it was actually that's actually fixed now they fixed it yeah okay so they fade that's the thing it reminds me of um during early days of Twitter okay I got my Twitter account super early and it's early days of Twitter it was always like fail whale you know the fail whale was this um image that they put on screen when uh Twitter was over capacity couldn't handle the load right the fill like when things break because of overuse it's a really freaking good sign okay it means there's demand that's the that's what you want uh so anyway that's kind of cool it's like hackathon quality right now but it's a proof of concept for things to come and I have flipped firmly bullish on this category of whatever you might call crypto social web3 social messaging like uh considering me bullish and I'm super excited about it and into the meme of the week that we go this is uh Joseph Delong won the meme of the week Trophy this week uh this is this this meme format has been going around crypto Twitter this is the it's a joint it's a picture of a joint and like the first majority of the joints is like you have decently cool and good thoughts and then the last sliver of the joint you start to get real real crazy so this is a Joseph Delong is uh he used to be in charge of a sushi swap before he moved on so the first like three quarters of the joint is just x times y equals K you know the unit swap amm curve and then the last quarter of the joint is I can fix in permanent loss with options which man if you have to kind of be deep down the crypto Rabbit Hole to understand this one but the the to unpack this meme uh impermanent loss for some reason people are lping into uniswap and Sushi Swap and all these amms these x times y equals k a m M's and they're not making money they're all losing millions of dollars and no one knows why there's so much liquidity in unit swap because everyone's losing money and so everyone is is there's like a meme lately a rotation into like oh we can fix LP loss by like adding options on top and like Joseph's of saying it's like you gotta be effing crazy to think that that is one of the mysteries of cryptos why people are doing this not even Dan Robinson knew when you ask someone yeah she's just crazy to me guys that has been the roll up hope you enjoyed it we're gonna end with wrists in a minute but first we disclose David and I mentioned optimism we mentioned arbitrim I think we said polygon uh we are both investors and advisors for optimism I'm advisor to polygon both David and I hold a little bit of Matic tokens uh Dave and I also hold eth and it's our time to remind you we are long-term investors we are not journalists we don't do paid content there's a link to all Bank list disclosures in the show notes at all times and of course crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
