[Music] bankless nation it is the first week of june david what time is it it is a rollup time where we condense an entire week of crypto news good tweets and interesting opinions all into one single episode which we are trying to condense a little bit more this week because last week is an hour and 45 minutes we're trying to keep it under an hour and 15 minutes this week we will see how well we do happy friday morning to you we get this to you every friday either on youtube you can watch it there or on the podcast we go through markets releases news takes what we're both excited about we end with the meme of the week david before we get into this program we gotta talk about kyber dynamic automated market maker that means if you're a liquidity provider want to be a liquidity provider you can deposit into kyber's new automated market maker and receive more fees tell us a little bit about that yeah kyber is one of the og's automated market makers in this space they were in amm before we called them amms and one of uh kyber's really competitive advantage is expressivity and so they have a bunch of optionality with how fees are collected how liquidity is provided uh and they are opening up their yield farm knc rewards for liquidity providers are coming soon so you can can go ahead and front run that opportunity uh by learning how to be an lp inside of kyber today and start accruing those knc fees uh when those fee rewards get unlocked so you can go to bankless dot cc slash kyber and start lp check that out front run that opportunity guys all right david you ready to get into the markets let's do it all right let's start with bitcoin we got to start with bitcoin because bitcoin is still number one market cap who knows look if that changes i guess we start with a different asset huh now it's bitcoin no we don't start with bitcoin we start with whatever's number one that's the best there you go that's the rule bitcoin is number one all right what's bitcoin doing price wise tell us bitcoin 38 500 at the time of recording there is a theme throughout all crypto markets all crypto assets where we had that low on the 30th uh the 30th of may and we have been in a six day uptrend ever since then so six days of green uh which is starting to get people pretty excited um but bitcoin still is still kind of kind of lagging behind the rest of the crypto assets really trying to claim that 40 000 level um because you know 38 the 30 thousand dollar range just i don't think is satisfying anyone right now people people are really looking for 40 000 and above and so we'll see if bitcoin can get back up there david i don't do much ta but i got this email this morning from somebody uh a newsletter i like called rec capital and they talked about this thing called the death cross and they said that bitcoin might be going through the death cross if it if it just hangs out at its current price uh as early as june so i'm not into ta i think a lot of it is horoscopes but this this was sort of interesting to me because this has happened multiple times before uh in november 2013 in december 2017 in june 2019 and the death cross is bad apparently because once it happens yeah like so to get to a death cross there's usually like a 50 to 70 percent off all-time high but once the death cross happens you lose an additional 50 to 70 so if this happens in june right and it plays out the way it has historically then we could see another 50 off of bitcoin back down to 20k prices anyway explain what a death cross even is for folks because i'm not sure i totally understand what's going on here yeah so a a golden cross is when the 50 week exponential moving average and a moving average for those that aren't deep into charts is a way to kind of take out the local noise in price actions and kind of do a lagging indicator uh over time and so it's kind of easier it's a it's a number a lagging number that follows bitcoin price at various levels of resolution right and so the 50-week moving average is uh you know lags behind bitcoin by just you know an average over the last 50 weeks 200 a week moving average lags behind bitcoin or any or any other asset by 200 weeks and a bullish golden cross happens when the 50 week the short-term price action crosses the 200 week the long-term price action that's a golden cross a death cross is the opposite where the 50 week crosses below the 200 week which means that the short-term price action has been bearish versus the long-term price action and so it's in historically in crypto markets the death cross has predicted as you said like a very strong just like deletion of market cap uh and and what uh rex capital is saying is that the 50-week moving exponential moving average is on a collision course with the 200-week moving average and so if it crosses below it if history repeats itself then we lose a pretty decent amount of market cap over the next weeks and months following that yeah so what's your take on this is this like is certain that it plays out because as i said i think sometimes ta is horoscopes but again i'm not a trader i'm like i'm thinking about the long-term fundamentals of these crypto assets and long-term of course the right position has been bullish i think that's the right position now but could this mean something bad in the short term uh for bitcoin particularly if that death cross happens yeah it's hard to ignore precedent right uh and everyone has different opinions as to technical analysis and how legitimate it is how much it actually works to some degree like i don't really believe in technical analysis ryan i know you don't really believe in technical analysis and a lot of other people that i talk to also don't believe in technical analysis yet we are all looking at the charts doing technical analysis regardless because we're talking about it right now we're talking about it right now right and like i got i have my charts up and i like to draw lines on it even though i don't know what i'm doing but to some degree like if everyone's drawing the same lines and coming to the same conclusions it can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy right like that's kind of that's kind of the gut take for you know does so then it does work yeah if if math psychology you know the layer zero if everyone believes it works it kind of works uh we are bringing on ledger from the ledger cast podcast and the up only podcast on the state of the nation on tuesday who is much more informed about these things both with technical analysis and also fundamentals of this space and so i'm really excited to get his opinion on it uh ledger ledger has been just growing it more and more into an ethereum bro and so i'm super happy to bring him on at the state of the nation for i think our first ever like charting and ta themed episode uh we've never done one of those on a bankless state of the nation uh and so we are going to ask ledger all of these questions in a much more informed capacity next tuesday starting two hours earlier than normal so nine a.m pacific time 12 p.m uh uh eastern time on tuesday for the week that week state of the nation so stay tuned for that david i think i'm going to ask him the exact same question like about the death cross so you're probably going to get a much better answer yeah we'll see all right let's go to eth really quick so that's bitcoin story what's what's heath doing to us for us heath is right below two thousand eight hundred dollars spent a decent amount of time above two thousand eight hundred dollars yesterday dipped right below it as of the time of recording we are hovering at two thousand seven hundred ninety six dollars uh and just like bitcoin ever since last uh the the 24th of may sit like six plus days of pretty decent uptrend ever since then uh and there is there is a decent level with which we established on like the 20th and 21st at 2800 then we hit 2850 again on like the 27th and now we are right below 2850-ish again uh but there's this triangle that's forming again here's me doing it it's it's we got a triangle we got a triangle and it's trying to break out of it uh let's so we'll see if it breaks out of the triangle and see you know triangles yay but like the sentiment on crypto twitter and especially ethereum twitter has really picked up steam again uh i tweeted earlier this week it turns out the cat wasn't even dead uh i think if there was a dead cat bounce it would have dumped again by now but we are almost on our seventh day of green greenness and so i'm putting as if i ever took it off but i'm putting my bullish cap back on short term bulk cat back on what is what are we looking at here this is a lot of interesting bars some are red many recently are green what are we looking at david yeah this is the monthly can so every candle in this chart is one a month this is the east usd monthly candle chart going all the way back until like february of 2017. this is linear sometimes when you look at these time frames it's actually kind of best to look in log terms but really the the story here is the monthly candle that if the ether just printed it's called a doji candle which has a massive wick to the top a massive wick to the bottom but it close opened and closed roughly at the same price right and so the body of the candle is very small the wicks are huge uh and so basically it's just telling you there's a lot of volatility but it's just a funny looking candle and we're going to be looking at this candle for basically the rest of time right because monthly candles are a big deal there's only like uh you know five times 12 of so 60 monthly candles and so one of them is this massive doji candle which went from like four thousand three hundred dollars down to seventeen hundred dollars and then back up to is its close at right around two thousand seven hundred dollars you know it's funny as i look at this and i go back in time if you like zoom in there's like a couple places in 2017 2018 where this happened one is uh you know july june july or yeah 2017 right and like if you zoomed in on that it would probably look similar ish but also um 2018 february where kind of the market just fell off um that looks like a similar candle like the highs and and sort of the lows so that's sort of the question right it's like are we just at the midway point of the bull market about to spring forward higher or is this the end no no it's we're a halfway point halfway point we know the answer that we think we know the answer to that look here's a chart that i'm really excited about from a fundamentals perspective to david and this is the percent of each supply on exchanges it's getting lower that means there's less eath on crypto banks as we call them on exchanges more east in d5 more serving its purpose as a self-sovereign money store of value collateral asset this is the bankless chart my friend this means that the world is going more bankless as this as this ratio goes down so super exciting to see that um it means d5 is thriving it means eth is not custodied in third parties um so i don't know it's super exciting i hope we continue to see it hover around there or maybe go lower i'm wondering what custodial staking solutions might do to this ratio there might be a period of time where staking in like places like coinbase or or binance uh becomes very attractive before we have decentralized staking solutions in place but we're going to be monitoring this it's it's it's hugely bullish for me to see and i think hugely gratifying to see that as part of the bankless movement right if we were seeing this thing go up and to the right especially which it would be bad because that means there's more ethroid exchanges and if we saw that during a bull market that would be like really bearishness for like banklessness as like concept right but we had we had this massive choppy like last two weeks right and you can see that chop in both the inflows and outflows there's just a lot of volatility with people putting ether into exchanges pulling ether out of exchanges uh but one of the reasons why i'm pretty convicted that we are just in the second half we have just entered the second half of the bull market is because that downtrend is still following the trend that it was following before the before the the big sell-off right uh and so ether largely price action and price discovery of crypto assets largely happens on centralized exchanges because that's just the way that it goes ether is unique because it can also come to price discovery on uh on in defy but d5 kind of has been following cfi like um and centralized exchange uh you know price discovery because like when institutions come in they're not buying units while ether on unit swap right they're not buying it on sushi swap running the dexes they go to coinbase they go to gemini like they buy and discover an ether comes to price discovery from new buyers on centralized exchanges and so when we are only at 11 of ether a supply on exchanges and falling that means ether price can move really really quickly when there are big buyers coming in and d5 tends to follow c5 valuations and so uh what this really the tl dr is that ether is primed for price discovery as soon as any meaningful buyer steps in it's going up into the right there you go up into the right uh let's talk about eth to bitcoin speaking of other things that's going up and to the right not quite up into the right you know but like uh going up right since recent so so talk to us about this because this is not quite a a local high but it's certainly recovered from its lows a couple weeks ago so again the eth bitcoin ratio uh is a determiner of the strength of eth versus the price strength of bitcoin what's happening here yeah so when there was like basically ethereum flipping week or weeks where everyone was talking about the flipping we hit that high just above point zero eight each per btc um when we had the aerosol capital right like every like all the ethereum people were gloating like uh guilty uh and and then we had that big that big sell-off and ether fell all the way back down to point uh like point zero five seven ish per btc uh and ever since then we have kind of resumed the trend that has been established since like april which is you know we kind of went up too fast we corrected a little bit but we are resuming the trend uh and that's why it's not a dead cat bounce that's why we are in the second half of a very long bull market and that's why your boy is bullish some strength on that ratio absolutely it's it's actually really good to see that let's talk about the strength of defy that's our next section total locked value in d5 is recovered some uh it's its highs were around 88 billion total locked in d5 that's in us dollar terms of course uh now it's back up to 70 billion not doing too bad 69 billion nice locked in d5 uh and it kind of looks like the same chart as both the ether usd chart the eth btc chart and now the tvl and d5 chart uh it went up this long long trend up and to the right went really really fast in may corrected in in late may early june and now is resuming an up into the right trend all these charts kind of look the same let's let's talk about the the dpi index so this is a good indice measure of how well d5 tokens are doing this is looking kind of i've got the three month pulled up it's sort of flat on the three month but if you look at it on the weekly it's also flat on the weekly what's this what's this showing us yeah defy tokens have really lagged behind uh the bigger crypto assets like bitcoin and ether um they have also recovered from their capitulation lows uh during the sell-off and and then uh the the almost again sell-off that happened on the 30th of may um 30th of may had dropped all the way down to 320 but now we are up to 407 dollars per dpi token uh and uh you know recovering but not recovering as fast as ether or bitcoin you know what i i really think that d5 tokens are in sort of the buy zone like there's some deals out there i mean we talked last week about the yfi token its price earnings ratio for may was like 12. you know like d5 tokens are not getting the love maybe that they should be and i'm wondering what layer two actually unlocks for them as far as fees transaction volume revenue remember these are capital assets so if they were priced based on fundamentals they would respond quite strongly to that of course the market is all about crypto markets all about narratives though and right now d5 tokens are not the dominant narrative right but that might mean there's some buying opportunities out there yeah and if we think we'll we'll talk about this later in the role but if we think that we are on the cusp of uh defy summer layer two edition uh you want defy assets because your people are going to be needing to buy assets to farm with them as they did in d5 summer round one uh and so like if you think that yield farming on on layer twos is around the corner you need to start allocating to defy tokens because that's how you're going to farm if history repeats and you want to allocate to the right ones too like which ones have great layer two strategies oh i have opinions on my mind i have opinions oh yeah we should talk about that later okay talk about it later all right first let's get to this because inflows have been really interesting into the dpi dpi of course is an index of itself of many of the top defy token assets led by the index co-op which is a dow but this is lemonade alpha saying dpi inflows are going crazy mostly led by wales he's got some charts here what are we looking at yeah we are looking at the increased uh unit supply of dpi right and so dpi price goes up if the underlying assets go up in price but dpi supply goes up when people have demand for dpi right and so people buying dpi doesn't make the dpi price go up it makes the unit supply go up and the unit supply going up it's having it's one of its largest growth periods in its in its history right now and what he's saying is what lemonade alpha is saying who's par part of the index co-op team uh is that it's primarily led by people that are buying more than 250 uh dpi units right and so if uh dpi is at 417 dollars and they're buying more than 250 units that people are allocating hundred thousand dollar lots at a time and that's more than 50 percent of the people who are buying dpi david just did that math in his head i know i didn't i literally did no calculator no i was oh that that make it into the oh that did not make it to the camera yeah i don't think no this is this is for the podcast people i was you know i was gonna you know i'll cut it out of the podcast [Laughter] uh but yeah 50 and above are are people buying a hundred thousand dollar units of dpi and so whales are accumulating d5 tokens there you go that's the story here all right but what's the story with the dpi to eth index that's another one we've been tracking this is sort of an indicator of how hot d5 tokens are relative to eth and that's staying flat it's staying flat it's right above the the the line that i called the the low at which was 0.13 that's where i called the the bottom of the dpi versus ether we are still above it we are still above it but not by a healthy margin uh and so we are currently at point one four six uh dpi per each per dpi yes eth per dpi uh and it's still in like this kind of long-term downtrend channel-ish since april has not yet broken out of a very long steep like downtrend it's going to at some point uh it is it feels like this yeah summer ish the end of d5 summer right how much higher it was right and and that's the bowl case for defy tokens is a returning to d5 summer levels which is basically a two to three x versus ether uh not in not versus dollars but versus ether uh and like i think it's if there's there's a ticking time bomb until that happens in my opinion versus ether is interesting i mean if they both go up together david then this ratio doesn't move so we'll have to see how that plays out um well let's talk about something that is playing out in a big way that is defy exchange volume dex volume uh just shooting right up like absolutely massive if you include things like pancake swap then the volume was over 300 billion last month i don't know if i i would include pancake swap i'll put an asterisk next to it there's an asterisk there but defy exchange volume is growing of course during the recent uh downtrend defy exchanges were the only ones left standing for a brief period of time they consumed all of the volume they performed pretty spectacularly i would say uh with a 60 to 70 percent drop and just like seeing some super impressive volumes that are absolutely dwarfing anything we saw in 2020 any takes here yeah liquidity providers during the last two weeks got absolutely paid uh and so if you have been learning about unit swap v3 congrats i bet you got a decent amount of fees in the last couple weeks since march so for the last two two months or three months we have 2x dex volumes consistently so march was just below 100 billion april was just below 200 billion and now we are just above 300 billion monthly dex volume crazy crazy crazy yeah this this another cool way to look at dex volume which is the dominance of dex volume for eth or erc20 pairs and this is particularly uh uniswap volume versus coinbase volume look at this david uniswap is absolutely killing coinbase in terms of usdc to eth um 784 million volume on uniswap versus 59 million volume on coin space like absolutely what is that i mean like 15 x or something something close to that eth to bitcoin unit swap's doing more volume than coinbase on ether bitcoin this is of course wrapped bitcoin but same same to usdt unit swap is even even beating coinbase on that right it's like these numbers blow me away dude like i would not have imagined this is possible in 2020 for unit swap to just like start dominating coinbase in terms of exchange volume and we're in the middle of a bull run right like so how does this happen what's going on uh it's the protocol synthesis playing out uniswap is easier to use d5 is easier to use than c5 and if you're a newcomer that that statement might seem foreign to you but as you become more and more use like just used to how defy works all of a sudden like these defy apps are just like the shelling point as to where to go uh liquidity straight up better in defy and usability straight up better and so like yeah the protocol synthesis predicted this and guess who wins when that happens uh hayden adams with another tweet here hyper efficient staple coin trading on uniswap v3 has already resulted in one coinbase pro reducing their fees um by a hundred percent their maker fees and their taker fees by 98 and curve increasing the efficiency amplification across its pools as well so when a a new better more capital efficient d5 protocol machine we talked about these things being like money robots like everyone's all these money robots are at war with each other for liquidity who benefits defy users benefit it's fantastic crypto natives benefit um like keep these wars going man because we're we're just getting better more capital efficient markets and this is why by the way david these these markets are going to eat the rest of the traditional financial world because they're in this like yeah like they're in this like kind of um darwinian jungle here like they're at war and they're like leveling up and getting better and it's complete survival of the fittest traditional finance is outside of the jungle somewhere else but once these organisms adapt right and once they break out of the jungle that they're in they will start eating nasdaq eating york stock exchange eating the rest of the traditional financial world and the banks won't know what hits them right that's the d5 boat case yeah the the takeaway that i have from this is that like coinbase and another d5 protocol had to forgo capturing fees because of the competition that uniswap v3 uh put on the table right it's like oh like the only reason why coinbase was able to capture those fees was because there wasn't really a viable alternative therefore they had the best product and they would charge fees for it they no longer have the best product and now they had to basically eliminate their stable coin trading fees because of what unit swap v3 brought to the table you know what's kind of cool a byproduct of this david is now that coinbase is a publicly traded company the wall street analysts are going to be like looking into coinbase's revenue and be like oh why did we have to reduce maker fees by 100 where oh it's because a d5 protocol uniswap like what is this thing which has a token that we can buy oh my god wow that's how they learn about unit swap and d5 and the token like it's it's all going to play out that way i think um all right let's talk about flipping metrics here here are a few should we just read these out why don't you start let's burn through these there's eight total metrics uh with graphs to go on the screen eth flipped btc in several metrics in may many metrics are now measured in the trillions or are close to it first metric is total adjusted on-chain volume increased by 35 to a new all-time high of one trillion dollars combined with bitcoin and ether and ethers is the majority of that volume like 60 60 40-ish not other staple coins it's ether huh yep it's not either your c-20s all right this is the second adjusted on-chain volume of stable coins increased by 52 to a new all-time high of 766 billion [Music] pretty impressive very impressive okay next uh next up while btc miner revenue continued to decrease by 15 to 1.5 billion ether miner revenue increased by 42 to a new all-time high of 2.35 billion dollars this is the first time since june 2017 that ether minor revenue exceeded bitcoin miner revenue and mining revenue is blockchain security and security is basically the fundamental reason why this whole industry works uh and so ethereum miners are being compensated better than bitcoin miners in this current month david ethereum the more economically secure network now mm-hmm mm-hmm for this month yeah month of may um legitimate centralized exchange spot volume increased by 38 to a new all-time high pretty impressive making it the fourth time this has ever happened wait like oh this is uh on chain volume of eth as an asset is that what we're talking about here uh no legitimate centralized exchange spot volume increased by 40 um uh and so this is just a this is just all the exchanges out there are experiencing more volume so kind of just a bull market indicator it's just the volume and centralized exchange is going up into the right ah that's not related to you flipping at all these these are flippings in general general flipping i see okay so it's not easy to bitcoin flipping it's just flippings in general okay daily average volume of gbdc stabilized at 419 million that's that's really good because the gbtc uh lack of premium the whatever is dying of premium it has been dying but now it hit a floor so far and starting to resume parity which is kind of like people are breathing a sigh of relief on that one thought that would happen i'm glad it is uh what's this next one bitcoin future volumes increased by 30 to a new all-time high of 2.5 trillion dollars in the month of may binance alone traded a trillion dollars in bitcoin futures geez i mean these crypto banks are just crushing it in terms of fees um as for e futures volume increased sharply by a hundred percent almost 100 94 to a new all-time high of 1.7 trillion ether as well becoming financialized as a reserve crypto asset what's the last one however the real story is on the derivatives front continues to be eth options the trade volume of bitcoin and ethereum options in a monthly has increased up to 60 percent uh and so ether ether futures uh volume going really strong up into the right and is now consumed is 60 as large as bitcoin volume uh future volume trading so pretty cool yeah david i i saw that um ether went from like basically nothing relative to uh bitcoin in futures volume on darabit in uh 2019 2020 to to now getting closer to parity and maybe actually flipping there a bit if the trend continues uh flipping on their bit volume anyway lots of good stuff going on david we're going to get to releases in just a minute but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this roll-up possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right guys we are back with the hot releases david we gotta start here arbitrum man arbitrarium is everything i thought it would be after our conversation with them on city of the nation on tuesday i'm super excited about this project about roll-ups in general uh they just launched their developer mainnet beta can you describe what's included in that launch right so arbitrarily has like you know cut the red tape and allowed the developers to enter this new land the new arbitrage real estate the new suburb of ethereum uh and on the suburb of ethereum things go really really fast for really really cheap uh and as far as a user experience goes like i haven't we haven't experienced this ourselves because right now it's developers only but basically this is like um if you've used a polygon bridge much like that but i think even faster as a bridge but you just go into metamask and then once you're when your money is over on arbitrary you just go and pick the arbitrom network and then all of a sudden you're in like the super fast highway that is arbitrary and so arbitrary has already had like a number of projects i think they said over 250 projects express interest in building on arbitrom there are some projects that have already released um the fact that they have finished building and now are already almost ready to open up to users uh sushi swap uni swap dododex alchemy mcdex all of these teams are building on arbitrary building out the rides for all the users to come on right and so right right now it's developers only because developers have to go build the things for the users to use but users are coming like i think to arbitrarily maybe as early as next week i bet i bet you the first thing is gonna happen is uh sushi swap is gonna get released because they are just known for moving really really fast uh ryan we were talking earlier about which particular defy tokens are going to be well suited to a defy summer layer 2 edition and i think sushi swap is at the top of that list just because they are known to just pound out integrations and new products uh and i so i'm i kind of think that sushi swap's going to be the first thing that is available on arbitrum but so many other projects are coming right on the heels of sushi swap and so congrats to arbitrary congrats to all the teams building on arbitrom and congrats to all the users who really have just felt uh sidelined by high gas fees on ethereum congratulations arbitrary may be your new home yeah and this is happening fast like david said the builders are building out the rides but the reality is what they can actually do is just port the rides that they had from another area of the theme park into arbitram when we asked the arbitrary folks how long it takes to move smart contracts from mainnet into arbor trump they're like um copy and paste a few hours yeah like a couple days like you got to test it of course but this is evm compatible which means you can sort of hot swap some of these contracts and there are some small changes but not a lot so super optimistic that this is coming soon david said next week maybe might take a little bit longer but this is definitely a summertime thing this is definitely a june july thing um you know i so super exciting anyway this is great great stuff we're gonna talk more about that toward the end i said i said this last week but the this changes everything about ethereum yeah like l2s and specifically this type of construction of l2s has been like you know anticipated since even before the first block of ethereum was mined uh and so like this is a big deal yeah well we just talked to vance spencer that's coming out on monday guys monday podcast tune into that vince spencer is a uh vc at framework ventures we talked extensively about layer two and what it means it is a major step change so make sure you tune into that episode two four more okay coinbase links its visa debit card with apple pay and google pay so now i'm just questioning like why we need traditional banks like i mean like if i could if i could just use coinbase and defy or gemini and defy that's all i need man sure i don't need wells fargo i can pay my bills like i don't think the banks realize what is coming for them right they don't think of coinbase as a bank they think of it as a crypto exchange and that's their fault uh that's going to be their downfall uh i would much ha rather have my like gusto direct deposit go straight to coinbase that would be fine i can choose coinbase i can choose like do i send it out to like the real world to buy my coffee or do i send it out to aetherium to you let me ask you what's what's stopping you i know you legit have a wells fargo account okay so do you want to jeff don't touch me like that sorry i doxed you bro okay so i know you have one one stop is that a threat i know i know it exists i've seen you at wellspark i know where those checks go there's paper checks um okay but like what's stopping you from shutting that thing down man i know it's not the savings rates that's very true is because like i gotta pay i gotta pay rent and i gotta pay my credit cards but after that like nothing stays in my bank account there you go it's over it's over guys they don't know it yet but it's over anyway rip banks let's go gnosis what's gnosis doing uh nosis partnering with uh the open ethereum client to make a new ethereum one client called aragon spelled e-r-i-g-o-n uh and so this has kind of been an evolution of a long-standing ethereum client uh a fork of geth turned into turbo geth turned into open ethereum which is now aragon uh and so we have a brand new ethereum one client that is uh being maintained by gnosis uh and we have heard some really rave reviews from some developers in this space here's bandag out of the urine team said aragon is so with rios good can you imagine scanning traces from the entire history of ethereum in under five seconds it can do that and so even ethereum one innovation still still moving forward at a solid tick rate yeah i'm glad and this actually means so um gnosis is sort of an ecosystem contributor the public good which is the ethereum protocol they took over the old parity client they're shutting that code base down in favor of this turboget code base because i think it's just better so um really excited about that let's let's talk about what argent is doing argent one of our favorite smart contract wallets now has a more secure and convenient way to provide liquidity to unit swap v3 one button argent user interface is just immaculate i feel like dave the thing that has held argent back this point is not being on layer two but like once they're on layer two they have integrations like this where it's one click into uniswap it's it's over right it's gonna be the really exciting uh user experience in d5 any takes here yeah the other innovation is that there's actually multiple transactions being bundled all into one uh and so that's also really the through line here so you have uh when you lp for unit swap you have to approve two tokens and then deposit right so one approval second approval and then a depositing transaction argent has this bundled all into one single transaction and this is also a story of ethereum block space being consumed more efficiently rather than three separate transactions we're bundling it into one it's it's more less time for the user it's less block space demand by the consumers and so you know people often forget that a very very real way to scale ethereum is to do the same things while finding innovative ways to consume less block space and that's what's going on here do you know like uh your your private keys that sort of thing with the ledger metamask it's still clunky today right people are asking about like what's when's that venmo experience coming argent any sort of smart contract wallet like argent plus layer two plus these d5 protocols right give it a year it's going to be better than venmo yep it's going to be way better than give it two years it's going to be 5x better sure 10x better sure like this is happening so fast i'm super excited about it um vitalik predicted this too when we had them on the podcast in december smart contract layer 2 native wallets okay let's talk about this this is maker's multi-chain strategy this is directly from their governance forms i think it's interesting because maker of course is one of the oldest d5 protocols they've stayed primarily on ethereum to date but now they're looking at a multi-chain future the question for them is how will d5 grow and where will the liquidity go that's how d5 protocols make these decisions what's uh what's the story here yeah maker is actually newly a completely a dow because the foundation has basically sunsetted there are a few people working for the foundation left really just to wrap things up but maker is now completely a non-centralized entity that is uh dow only and the dao is saying hey let's capture more fees uh and so maker has started to have conversations about putting maker dow on different uh chains putting dye on different chains right so not only ethereum and not only ethereum l2 like polygon and xdi but also non-non-ethereum chains like polka dot cosmos and solana uh and so this is a cl this is just a good you know business first move if there are fees out there to capture you should go capture it because if you don't someone's going to capture them for you with their clone of your project so you better just get there first uh and so make or doubt i don't know to what degree are they actually putting a the maker dow facility on solana or on polygon or or on polka dot um but at the very least they are putting die there and die demand on polygon die demand on solana ultimately feeds back to mkr value capture on ethereum and so maker down really pushing the fold yeah it's funny because their preferences for evm compatibility right because they've invested so much and also for uh permissionless decentralized decentralized change that's kind of their preference but they're open to other layer ones at all and what i would say is if you want to truly understand where this industry is going look where the builders are going right like that that's your map i mean at some level like what david and i say or what some other like what a venture capitalist who's pitching the solana layer one because they really want you to buy soul tokens what they say doesn't really matter it's about what where the builders go and what they believe because like builders are making a huge investment like where are we going to spend our precious developer resources next is it on an ethereum layer or two is it on another you know competing layer one um we'll see so read this post it'll give you great insight i think there's some alpha leaks there if you're paying attention david let's get directly to the news my friend uniswap just made cctv that's china uh chinese tv china central television talking about uniswap that's what that is okay so they're talking about it in the context of how to avoid scams right but here's what's so hilarious to me is actually they're showing you how to use uniswap on tv broadcast to like i'm not sure how many millions of people in china um and hayden's tweet is kind of funny on this step one china blocks uniswap interface i guess maybe they have already step two china demos uniswap interface on cctv step three question mark what happens i mean like isn't this just playing into isn't this the nation somebody kind of somebody up excuse me excuse me you think so i think i think somebody had a had an oopsies uh somebody did not think about because like the the uniswap um the uniswap if you look on the screen it says the decentralized exchange what is more antithetical to china than something that is decentralized uh and so i don't think so somebody didn't wasn't informed enough to put two and two together about how this technology is extremely subverses to the state and specifically china which wants to have total totalitarian control something like unit swap is exactly what they don't want and they are accidentally like broadcasting this on their internal like closed circuit television channels it's hilarious it's like the more they say don't look at this don't talk about this don't use this the more people are going to get interested in it so they are propagating the narrative that is the value of decentralization um but there is a little bit of like i guess double speak going on in china i feel like because here is a story that broke about china's digital wan effort and this is a spokesperson for the central bank digital currency that china is building and talking about it potentially being available on ethereum too and i totally understand that because if you're a central bank digital currency you want to invade all of the other economies of the world and by invade i just mean like you want your currency to be represented and to accrue value and to be used as a unit of exchange medium uh unit of account medium of exchange store value in those economies what is ethereum ethereum is just another economy but this story is interesting because i do see that's an inevitability of central bank digital currencies they will absolutely want to be on smart contract networks like ethereum and it looks like the nation state is is paying attention to these developments they see the power of smart contracts and defy and programmable money and they're looking to kind of marshal that as well yeah china definitely wants its yuan to be as close to the world's reserve currency as possible they're very jealous that that's what the dollar is and so naturally they want to claim defy real estate as like the future of economies right if the future economic you know activity of the world is on defy then the digital yuan needs to be there i'm reminded of our josh rosenthal episode where to some degree like it's a lose lose for china either way right because like are they really going to become the world's reserve currency by invading defy not really the only people like not even the chinese want the digital you want it's forced upon them and so if they want to claim that real estate they have to put the digital yuan there but then that means that they give on-ramps and off-ramps to people who are using the digital what you on who want something else like dollars or ether or bitcoin right and so they are giving an exit opportunity to people that use the yuan it's damned if you do damned if you don't yeah you know what long term i think the authoritarian states uh play is whatever state it is whether the u.s goes in that direction or whether it's china continues it's like i feel like it's a it's a state-controlled binance chain essentially so you get the programmable money but you also have the state surveillance and the control over the entire economic system right um they're not there yet that might but like that is the threat for how i don't think at this point um nation states ever turn off cryptocurrency because they can't and they know they can't they know to your point just plays right into their hands but they will try to co-opt it uh and i feel like the finance chain gives like sort of early road map indication of how that might be co-op you just make it super useful right easy for everybody like integrated in your life but oops we have all of the buttons to stop transactions sensor transactions cut you out of the world's economic system make you disappear on chain and then off chain scary okay um ether has a high chance of eclipsing bitcoin as crypto's dominant store of value wow it sounds like something bankless might say this is bank max saying it um look man let's not provide any legitimacy to goldman sachs and their opinions yeah as to what they it's a headline that a lot of people are reading that's the through line here it's like goldman said a lot of people listen to goldman sachs even though we don't listen to goldman sachs they are making this headline available to the world so that's like the takeaway here they must have a position too in order to say that that's usually what goldman sachs is up to all right here's something interesting that happened bit wise so this is sort of an institutionally friendly way to get access to all sorts of crypto assets but in particular in this case defy tokens bitwise actually no this is not their d5 this is their uh large cap crypto index okay excuse me i don't think it counts as a defy token just because it's on ethereum too right on so so uh bitwise has a whole bunch of more centralized institutionally friendly indices where you can get exposure to crypto assets i've long like hated kind of their large cap crypto index not because it's a bad index it's it's nothing they'll take their own they just don't falters just so much garbage in there and there's been garbage uh from the get-go like like things like you know xrp things that don't have a chance to succeed as a um a store of value but anyway um polygon has entered the bitwise 10 large cap crypto index for the first time and i think that's super interesting this is the first number one i guess it's the first of two things number one it's the first layer layer two or side chain i should say from ethereum to be like ported into the the top ten um the other thing is the interesting part of this is the the asset that it kicked out is um from cosmos they're acid adam oh and you know cosmos talked for a very long time about becoming the internet of chains by creating sort of a parallel universe to ethereum so there's some irony here which is like matic is taking a similar playbook and design it's the same same value prop but it's making sort of ethereum as a settlement layer it's internet of chains and there's some irony in it just booted adam from the top 10 slot and he takes here yeah my take here is that this is uh something that we've talked about interesting in the ethereum ecosystem for years now there is a bunch of absolute crap in the top ten of crypto assets uh you know like i don't think litecoin or bitcoin cash is there anymore but they used to be in the top ten uh and then there were very legitimate very real defy tokens that just were in like 50 and below uh and so a big narrative in 2018 and 2019 and even 2020 was that like eventually there's going to be a re-pricing of repricing a repricing between between just the crap like eos uh and litecoin with actual real defy tokens with with cash flows and and this is what we are seeing here is we are seeing ethereum native infrastructure being repriced into large cap top 10 defy tokens um to be honest i kind of wish it hadn't pushed out cosmos because of all the things in the top 10 cosmos isn't is actually kind of a nice asset cosmos has some traction right yeah i wish it had pushed out things like litecoin and bitcoin cash uh but like the comparison between cosmos getting pushed out by something that is basically the same value prop but ethereum specific is interesting yeah it's very interesting um david nft world there's always stuff going on in nft space but i picked this one out this was an article written by our own william peaster in mediversal which if you're not subscribed to metaversal this is a great place to get updates on what's going on in the nft space but he wrote an article about how to get virtual land on ethereum right like in the metaverse actually buying digital property buying digital real estate right so i've long thought about this like okay own cryptocurrencies when is the right time to start buying digital parcels of land and like you can do that on something called sandbox uh decentraland which has been a long time vr type project on ethereum cryptovoxels which listeners may be familiar with um i've not heard much about uh somebody say this insomnium somnium space anyway like i started thinking about when there will come a point in time when it is the right time to buy virtual land right i haven't fallen in love with a vr digital environment yet where i'm like oh this is so awesome i can't not have property here but like there will come a time when i anticipate jumping in to the space here what's your take on this do you own any virtual land yeah i do not own any virtual land um okay i feel like it's the same kind of game as to just nft speculation right like uh to some degree like if you own a crypto punk that kind of feels similar as to owning like a little bit of like internet real estate because of the way that crypto punks are kind of treated as defy users right it's like i have a claim on a crypto punk kind of feels the same it's very very speculative because we don't know if any of these virtual land real estates comes the canonical real estate like the reason why real estate in the real world is so such an easy investment is because like there's not seven versions of real estate like different dimensions of real estate there's just actual real real estate and it can't just be like forked or created exactly right so like virtual real estate which we virtual estate virtual estate uh is there isn't one there isn't one virtual estate there are many many many virtual estates so if you buy virtual estate then you are speculating that that virtual estate comes becomes like the kind of shelling point of virtual estate so i'm not ready to start speculating in that world yet um but it's definitely going to be a thing virtual estate will absolutely be a real thing for sure it's gonna be ready player one right like it's totally we're moving to that world like uh i'm so i'm waiting i'm looking at this i think there are some pioneers who are much earlier maybe these are good deals maybe they're not i have no idea but i'm sort of waiting myself david for that like i i entered this world and like i immediately fell in love with it like oh this is it i would use this i want to come back here i want to set up shop here and i have i can see myself retiring here oh my god this is so weird dystopian future though is something where somebody like some big company like you know facebook or or st or steam or valve makes virtual real estate uh and and that becomes like you know it's theirs like that i could see that happening as well yeah exactly well i'm not buying in those worlds so i think they'll sell them to you is the thing let's talk about this this is the bitcoin news i think we're kind of struggling to find something on bitcoin this week actually there's generally a lot but this week was kind of a quiet week on bitcoin but the bitcoin car is making headlines what's happening here what is the bitcoin car yeah like a bunch of bitcoiners crowdfunded sponsorship of like an indy 500 car uh and and funny funnily enough uh nbc sports twitter account reported that the indy 500 averaged a uh i don't know what tid is but 5.5 million viewers making it the most watched indy 500 in five years because there was a goddamn bitcoin car like all the bitcoiners all of a sudden start caring about indy 500 because there's a bitcoin car uh and then jack mallors who was on the d5 panel with me at coindesk consensus event i don't know why he was there he represents a little crypto bank uh he goes hmm i wonder why the most popular car at the most uh watched indy 500 in last five years arrives at the bitcoin conference tomorrow in miami to donate to bitcoin open source development open networks wins bitcoins wins uh and so like i guess congratulations to bitcoiners here's like the coolest news that's happened in bitcoin in the last seven days is a bitcoin car in indy 500 and it'll be at miami like uh congrats i guess yeah well like so this feels like just um a poor man's version of git coin to be honest because like i'm really excited like i'm really excited that this goes to open source development right and that the community is coming around and like doing something good for a public good which is bitcoin protocol development which is a public good absolutely but like i don't know it feels so weak sauce after you after you know about like bitcoin and quadratic like funding and what's going on in that economy to create self-sustainable public goods it just feels weak sauce right this is this is why we say it feels like bitcoin but at least bitcoin maxies have kind of lost the plot right because why are you so incredibly excited about a bitcoin sponsored indy 500 car when there is everything going on in defy like happening next door and you are purposefully not paying attention to that like you know you have been excited about that yeah like it's from 2015 dude like that would have been exciting in 2015. that's what dogecoin did it in 2014. like those already did this oh bitcoin they're behind doge we're having uh preston pitch on on wednesday oh uh so that's gonna be fun it's gonna be good it's gonna be a good episode i think that uh hopefully it's gonna be open-minded and um we'll we'll both talk about these types of things um i won't mention the bitcoin car though if you don't i might make sure you don't okay no promises all right regulation uh bitconnect remember bit connect bitcoin nice uh all right the sec charged the promoters of bitconnect which includes a youtuber a few youtubers i was not watching like crypto scams in youtube in 2017 but like there were a lot of promoters of bit connect i guess the interesting thing here is they're finally being charged by the sec and one market later like january 2017 that's four years ago it was more than four years ago i think that the take here is that um regulators move slow yeah um i'm glad that they're targeting a complete scam in this case this is actually protecting consumers this is within the sec's mandate good job scc like seriously i legitimately mean that um but like four years right right takes regulators a long time to react to what's going on yeah and and like should have gone to jail should have gone to jail two billion dollars is beside the point they've wrecked people's lives they should have gone to jail yeah but we've got some memes out of it we did get some good memes public good all right some good news from bellagi our friend so there have been some disturbing news going on in india about kind of central bank government crackdown on cryptocurrency but this is some good news the reserve bank of india is directing indian banks to stop the platforming crypto customers that's what was happening so if you're in india and you're using your bank account to do something in crypto they would just de-platform you sorry send you a dear john letter like sorry you have no account here anymore you've been disbanded um here's a letter where like the royal bank of india is saying we need to the reserve bank of india excuse me is saying we need to stop doing that so some good news there and people predicted this i think nick carter really predicted this is like oh yeah you ban bitcoin you're just gonna roll that back in a couple couple weeks or a month or so and that's exactly what happened when you ban bitcoin you actually just ban your citizens from engaging with bitcoin you don't actually ban bitcoin and also there's money to be made for these banks right like are they reading the the coinbase sec filings i hope so all right some quick drive buys as of today this is from anthony sessano the etude beacon chain has been live for six months probably six months cool six months of lindy under the belt uh and getting closer and closer to the merge maybe in five or six months later wow no major events there it's gone fairly smoothly um all right let's talk about this so stable coin company earning record levels of investment this is um circle what's happening here yeah circle raised 440 million dollars uh from from uh uh investors private investments from an array of private equity institutional and strategic investors that's a bit that's a large number uh and this is just indicative of the tailwinds behind crypto dollars in d5 why why is crypto dollars in defy such an awesome opportunity it's because you're getting yields consistent yields above like eight percent and like i'm getting yields as high as 20 on my crypto dollars thanks to like alchemix and yearn right and so where are you getting 20 yields in dollar terms in the legacy world like you aren't uh and so this is a massive opportunity for people who don't really care or want to own crypto assets but they want to have dollar denominated yields which is a large part of the world uh this is what circle's capturing right now uscc is a great product a fantastic product it's still banked but it's a great product all right let's just drake has a call out for us he needs some help what does he need help with david yeah he says that all of these different ether logos ether characters that people use on twitter the uh the the greek symbol z the the diamonds he says they're all hacks he goes east deserves a unicode character in 2015 i helped get the bitcoin unicode character for btc justin drake asks you the listener i need help for a leader to take up the reins and follow the template he already has the template he wants you to fill it out and make your argument as to why ether needs a unicode character if you want to take the reins on this and do something for ethereum which i agree maybe it's just a unico character but like we would all use it uh that can be you so if you are interested in taking up those reins uh go to this tweet in the show notes and uh file that form david justin drake helped get bitcoin the bitcoin unicode character that's the shocking news to me mm-hmm yeah fun fact write that down for trivia he doesn't get thanked for that um all right we're gonna get back we're gonna be back with the takes in just a moment but before we do we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get unit swap to be a sponsor for bank list and you can do the same for your project thank you unisop for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you 3 cashback on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eath so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right guys we are back with the hot takes of the week let's start with this one from koopa troopa he says this crypto literally pays to always be online literally getting paid to be online what does he mean david yeah so the world of crypto in the world of defy has really turned the web 2 model of extraction on its head right and so the way that defy apps compete is by rewarding users and so to some degree the more you have used defy apps the more you have been rewarded the average d5 participant who came in at least in 2020 uh got at least three air drops currently worth at least like forty thousand dollars in uniswap uh one inch tornado cash ample fourth like the list goes on and so uh and that's not the only thing like you there are a more instantiated version of getting rewards basically the more you use defy the more you get rewarded that's the new paradigm we are in web 2 apps they take from you defy apps they give to you you just have to use them uh and i actually used this tweet in the uh bankless article that came out uh yesterday thursday uh because i talked about the dows and the future of work and one of the missions of dows is to lower the threshold for what viable good participation and contributions into dows are good dolls will make that really really easy for workers to contribute uh and it's going to and the bold case for dao is that you just stumble into rewards you just stumble into work and labor uh and that is the future of web3 work uh and koopa has this summed up in a tweet nicely crypto literally pays you to always be online the more you are in crypto the more you get paid there you go good takes there all right let's do this next one long or short civilization that's the take long eath is long civilization long bitcoin is short civilization let me try to parse that out i think what this is saying is that's that's spicy that's a spicy taste it's kind of spicy right so like if you are optimistic about the future of humanity your asset is eth progress like coordination civilization societal growth a community improvement um if you are a long bitcoin it's like being short civilization right short collaboration doomsday you know dollar disappears nation states die we go back to an era of less coordination collaboration where we need this gold-like asset what do you think of that take no i'm not so that's exactly right yeah so like the people who coming from the legacy world will feel weird saying this but but we're hearing this but bitcoin is the risk off asset bitcoin is specifically risk off everything like gold yeah like like gold exactly right like no one can take it away from you you are completely independent completely self-sovereign you don't need to trust anyone you don't have dependencies on anyone else and that's also true for d5 but d5 is much more it's much more collaborative it's like when we come together even though we have self-sovereign money and i have my private keys my private keys are mine and no one can take it away from me we can still create more via collaboration right i mean solemnani has this quote that it's stuck with me where he goes uh bitcoin in times of war but ethereum in times of peace right uh in peace times we can collaborate and build but like if people are in a deflationary spiral or just like times of mistrust that's where bitcoin is an asset the narratives and political alignment behind bitcoin really really shines bitcoin is the i don't need you asset and ether and defy is the let's collaborate ecosystem i think that last part resonated with me probably the most of anything that was said and even this tweet because i also i also do feel like um ethereum is like a network that developers researchers have said is designed to try to survive world war iii right it is a designed to be a collaboration toolset and a money system when all of the other money systems fail uh when the nation state fails even so it does have elements of like an ethereum kind of like citadel that's built apart from the the requirements of the nation state it does live outside of it and yet what you said is also super true which is like the theme of the theorem is all about coordination how can we pull capital together and and do more together yes there's lots of competition but it's not as individualistic which is interesting to me so um i guess i see both both sides of it um i also think that that bitcoin is in a weird way also a bet on technology because it's certainly a bet on cryptography uh so maybe not entirely short civilization bitcoin is like bitcoin is a coordination system but it's a coordination system so you don't have to coordinate with anyone else it coordinates for you ethereum is a coordination system that allows and propagates further coordination and that's really the big difference is like the long tail of bitcoin after after it coordinates for you is that you are done coordinating because bitcoin did it for you ethereum is like let me create platforms and software and applications that allow for further coordination right the coordination extends out into the nth degree yeah i think it's a really interesting take for sure here's another one justin drake again making the recap the roll up twice price affects security he says i think that's the thrust of the argument now he's got a flow chart i would have died for a flow chart like this in 2018 2019 you're making the argument that price of eve is so fundamental to the economic security of the ethereum network and that was falling on deaf ears but what is this flow chart showing us yeah it's showing us all the different ways that if ether price goes up ethereum benefits right and so he has a there's four main uh factors that he has uh one of the the uh oh that part part later uh legitimacy by performance as in if ether goes up and it continues to go up there's some amount of legitimacy about that uh which attracts builders which attracts on-chain activity which attracts more feedback burn and more staking rewards which makes ether money money more sound which makes you know it's taking inflows even better which increase the cost of attack which increases security uh security ethereum security then there's more economic bandwidth same path like then there's you know it's east stake appreciation and also the ef treasury like if if just go look at the chart i'm not going to try and explain all of it but go look at the chart and it's a very concise way very developer focused way of like illustrating the connection between eth price go up and bullishness on humanity which is you know ethereum security you know the the level two analysis here is uh again i i strongly believe that the the winning the most economically secure money system it's the core asset of that system has to be a story value reserve asset because you get so much of this for free if your uh asset is is priced in the justin drake episode we called it like the magic meme uh property where it gets some of this reserve currency monetary premium for free uh so we're starting to see that with youth we've definitely seen it with bitcoin let's do this scott lewis tweet what's this saying yeah so scott lewis is illustrating the connection between the security of a consensus layer and how much you should cost pay for transactions right so he kind of makes up some numbers but he goes ethereum main net fifty dollars for a transaction ethereum roll up two dollars for a transaction that's like something like arbitrary optimism and then it goes ethereum side chain uh 2.002 dollars per so a 2.2 pennies for one transaction if you're on a side chain and that's like matic right and he goes different price points for different levels of security and that's really what you're paying when you pay your transaction fees you are paying for security uh and the if uh it's a good rule of thumb to understand that when you are paying a transaction fee on matic versus versus arbitrary versus wherever that that is a the amount of fee you are paying is functionally an extrapolation as to the security of how secure that transaction is and so uh the actual the real take here that he finished off with is that you know different price points for different levels of security but he says complementary options will make all of ethereum work better and so he's alluding to the symbiosis between all of these things offering different options for the markets like maybe a two dollar transaction on rollup is actually too expensive for your you know super high throughput micro transaction app and so therefore you need to go to a side chain but more economic activity is bestows more economic activity right and so having optionality with its security levels is allows people to choose what they want and what it works best for them both as users and as defy apps yeah it's all great and like that's the thing it's not it's not roll ups versus side chains it's like we're doing them it's not maynet versus rollups we're doing them all and they're they're all going to uh not compete against one another but they're all going to be synergistic right i'm starting to think of ethereum less is just like one main chain and more of like this ecosystem of change the entire economy calls it a nexus yes he calls it an economic nexus and that's exactly what it is but when you say what is ethereum now what is ethereum has to extend to all of the erc20s on crypto exchanges has to extend to arbitrary optimism all of the roll-ups that they create has to extend to all of the side chains maybe at some level it also extends into like things like finance chain that is less economically linked it still uses the evm so what is ethereum it's all of these things it's like this internet of chains i guess we're stealing another cosmos uh meme but um there you go all right what's this what's this take from um suzu yeah suzu talking about the nature of decoupling uh he wrote he writes those who doubt decoupling needs to read more history 99.5 of coins from the previous era are worthless and the 0.5 that are worth something are up 10 000 x since then uh it turns out decoupling it actually has an investopedia page that's news to me uh and so what suzu is saying is that you know decoupling not a crypto term uh i i thought that was like a deca what does it mean to you uh so like ether and bitcoin have largely had similar price action throughout its history and to this day but we are seeing some some decoupling and that's why we were paying attention to the east btc ratio right like each btc hovered between like one eight and point three for years and now we're up to point seven two point zero seven two right that's a decoupling it's when one's one asset takes off and the other either stays stagnant or like dies it goes uncorrelated right uncorrelated assets from a price perspective right yeah suzu is saying that the fundamentals is why things decouple uh and perhaps that's what's happening i think that's such a good take and it's something to remember because this doesn't happen overnight it doesn't even happen in like the months uh timeline this happens over years it almost happens in every kind of narrative cycle but when we see things that have survived like um uh bitcoin satoshi's vision and some like how is that still around right or like even like litecoin uh to some extent how is that still around right um i think what it is is it's survivorship bias because we forget the thousands of other cryptocurrencies peercoin that feather yeah like exactly all of these colored coins like all of these things bitcoin gold bitcoin diamond we don't even remember them but they were a thing they had their moment right but they died they were part of that 99.5 of coins that did not survive he had the previous era do you remember dragon chain dragon i put out this tweet last week 2017 like what's the most embarrassing thing you invested in right and i got all these answers arching dragon chain dragon champions like oh my god really somebody said disney was about it i was like oh i'm not i'm in dragon chain gang um yeah so like anyway these are all the coins that died last cycle and these fundamentals do matter they do matter this is what suzu is saying so make sure you're tracking fundamentals not just the trade okay david you are getting ready to board a flight uh what are you excited about man going to miami for the world's largest ethereum meetup event ever thrown by bitcoin conference twice are you wearing my shirt oh yeah oh yeah shalom this is this is the shirt i got when i uh did my uh triple point asset talk in tel aviv unrelated uh but i got my baptizer in the bag so the bap shirts coming out oh man yeah and so it's it's really funny i i got these no i think i got the right numbers from ck who works at uh bitcoin uh btc media which is throwing the bitcoin 21 2021 conference he said that there are 8 000 people attending the conference and 30 000 people going to miami and so there are there if if you extrapolate and kind of think that like maybe there's more ethereans going to miami who aren't actually going to the conference they're just going to the miami as a shelling point because everyone else is going to miami you're going to go to the conference though right i if it's convenient what are you going to be doing the whole time well i'm hanging out with my friends like it's it's a we're all everyone's going to miami so i'm going there too like that's that's what happened here uh so there is like the d yacht party which is thrown by a bunch of defy teams like slingshot upshot like a bunch of other teams have have a yacht party uh so i'm going to that going to diplo concert uh with with a bunch of like gonna meet koopa for the first time luke is gonna meet lucas for the first time uh and and so uh and luke and so there's actually gonna be three bankless llc uh employees at uh miami uh and uh ryan will you well see you there though no no no i do not i do not like to travel as much i'm the like the team calls me the bankless boomer it's like i'm just you know happy at home um like you guys have fun um screen share me in or something let me know how it goes but like i'm okay so i had heard that you cannot actually talk about other chains while you're attending the conference yeah so is that true like can you wear uh apparel from other chains i'll let you know uh so yeah btc media put out this email that said uh please if if you are attending the conference please keep your conversations on bitcoin themed conversations because this is a bitcoin only conference uh and so it's one thing to like make a bitcoin only conference that's great uh but like yes requesting your the attendees to keep their conversations focused to bitcoin a little bit controversial a little bit controversial well we'll see what happens to you david when you wear that shirt yeah so that's the other experiment and so like bitcoiners like while they're kind of nasty on twitter they're a very loving like group of people but it's kind of amongst themselves right bitcoiners love other bitcoiners uh and like i've been i've been you are a bitcoiner though aren't you sure yeah depends on who you ask right um and i've definitely worn my ethereum shirt inside of a bunch of inside of that bitcoiner event where there was like literally 50 bitcoiners around and i was the one ethereum people and people knew who i was like bankless was pretty big at that time um but that was when the eth bitcoin ratio was like at point zero two now it's at point zero seven uh and so like i'm gonna test the waters to see like are they all that loving as they say that they are like we'll find out hey you know what vance spencer said in the podcast uh guys listen to that one monday it's great the flipping of eth over bitcoin is actually good for bitcoin yeah i'm going to bring that letter i will let you know oh really you're going to try that yeah it's really fun let me know how it goes yeah social experiments left and right yeah very fun all right ryan what are you excited about i'm i'm excited about arbitrary man i'm excited about roll ups in general like layer two is finally here i was worried that when we had arbitrary modern tuesday that they were gonna say something like yeah we released to mainnet but you know it's gonna be another six months before the d5 apps are up and like some complexity here we've just been disappointed so many times right with layer two and throw ups but um no longer no longer it's like really here and i'm excited about that the second thing i'm excited about i sort of picked up in that conversation too is arbitrary is launching with just one one chain right now but they could launch with a dozen chains like they could launch with 30 chains 40 chains you could have a d5 chain an nft you could have so many chains as many chains as you want and all at the same time so and and we we talked about this with the polygon sdk they they can produce a whole bunch of different versions of of side chains right so like now we have all of this additional real estate we have all of this block space and i've you know we talked about um layer two hitting crypto like a tidal wave like i i literally i this is gonna be a wave of new apps that weren't previously possible on the main train that's gonna be part of the tidal wave and a wave of new users we're gonna start talking uh about monthly active users a lot more rather than total locked value and that's gonna be exciting so more people on board and through layer two this is really important for crypto um and i couldn't be more excited we'll have to have optimism on too i think they're launching in in july um but i'm just really excited about layer two summer baby so excited about it and this is what fatale called um expressivity escape velocity right like just make a lit the basement a little bit more expressive and all of a sudden you have an infinite number of options that you can build on top of it and that's what we are hopefully on the cusp of a cambrian explosion of available trustless block space and new possible economic activities like i said earlier like all of a sudden like micro transactions are back on the table like micro transactions used to be a thing like real realty when i used to work at realty we used to send daily rent out every single day got expensive base layer ethereum right back when back when gray was one gas was one gray that got immediately pushed out but like now we can kind of return to some of those crazy use cases that we uh hypothesize about but never actually got to ryan earlier in the show i talked about uh the tokens that i think are particularly well suited towards a layer two uh a deficit two edition what you got i talked about sushi swap right a team that integrates really really fast and aggressively and moves really really quickly was also born in defy summer itself and so it's a defy summer like asset you know born and bred in defy summer the other thing that i have my eye on is ave again moves really fast integrates really really quickly it's already integrated on polygons so already knows what's up with at layer two uh and so i've got my sights on ave yfi if there is a bunch of yield to be had on ethereum urine is supposed to be able to capture it again another another defy summer token uh so like sushi sushi ave and wi-fi that's kind of where i have my eyes on as for for tokens that are going to be particularly well suited to capture a defy summer layer two edition so the theme here is blue chips going to layer two right blue chip d5 uh projects with great teams the good layer two strategies right i'm also curious to see what new things we will see that are actually born in layer two right like new creations new protocols will be born not on the main chain but inside of these layer twos that kind of brings me to the meme of the week david talking about birth let's do it we're gonna get to the middle of the week are we ready yeah i think we're ready all right i'm sharing screen here's the meme of the week by our friend mariano conti what are we looking at for four panel comic uh first is a like a a cgi render of a pregnant lady with a baby inside of her and the baby is crossing his fingers saying god please ethereum please ethereum please ethereum and then next picture is a baby it looks like it just got born and the baby says hello sir where am i and then the next next panel is binance smart chain and then the fourth panel is the baby just like just the look of just like death just like oh no the baby's face oh no i'm born in finance smart chain oh no but look a lot of these new applications new protocols probably the next gen ones will actually be born into layer twos so hopefully they get a good layer too not a bad one that's the me of the week folks david enjoy miami i will find i will um shilling banquet bankless listeners dave's going to be in miami uh we're still going to do the recording so regular schedule next week maybe some different scenery uh thanks for hanging with us this has been another roll up i got to end with the
