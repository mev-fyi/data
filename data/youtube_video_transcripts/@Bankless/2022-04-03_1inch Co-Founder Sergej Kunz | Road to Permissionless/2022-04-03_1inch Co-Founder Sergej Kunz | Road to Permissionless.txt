hey bankless nation we've got a special episode for you today not just an episode another episode in a series called the road to permissionless is going to be a conference is a conference that is happening may 17th through 19th we're hyping some of the companies and projects that are coming to permissionless in hopes that you get as excited about the conference as we are this is going to be the biggest defy conference yet david there's some speakers at permissionless as well who's going to be speaking at that event oh gosh so many and so many that we haven't totally finalized yet but the people that we have chris dixon from the mental models of web 3 episode that everyone knows and loves as well as justin drake the pioneer of ultrasound money cooper turley the crypto nft web 3 socialite jai from oj from rari stani from ave vance spencer from framework jiho from axi and of course the beloved carly riley from overpriced jpegs just to name a few and those are the ones that we have announced not the ones that we haven't uh so ryan there's going to be a ton of fantastic talks and and sponsors and just booths there and one of the reasons one of the main reasons why people go to conferences is not just to get the alpha and the information from the talks but to make the connections from the people at the booths the companies there the the people there and make some friends along the way so it's just uh depending on what you are looking for conferences generally have something for you whether you just want to make some friends or you're looking for a career or you just want to vibe and go to the parties uh permissionless is gonna have it all right so that is why you should go to the permissionless conference coming in may 17th in florida and here is one project that's going to be here uh one inch this is the the largest by liquidity dex aggregator out there they started at a conference themselves we have the the co-founder of one inch on an episode today sergey koons we're going to get to that discussion in just a minute david they also at permissionless they they uh let you and i plan some of the content so we we're gonna have three tracks for you guys um there's going to be a metaverse track it's gonna be awesome there's going to be a defy track and then there's going to be an institution regulatory type track so it's basically all of the content that you've come to appreciate and uh like on bankless we're trying to condense a lot of that into one conference so we jam-packed you across all of those all of those lanes so it's going to be really cool also if you are a bankless premium member did you know you get 30 off a conference ticket i hope you've already got your ticket but if you don't there's still time and the best way to get that is to upgrade yourself to bankless premium membership get a 30 discount you'll see a link to that discount in the show notes david anything else we should say yeah if you go and look at the uh which it's not it's not totally published yet but if you go look at the agenda for the content it's basically just like three days straight of bankless life bankless live as a live podcast for three days so yeah if you know you guys are all listening to bank list so we know that you're gonna enjoy the content and the talks there at the conference absolutely so guys we are going to get right to our conversation with sergey koons who is the co-founder of one inch we hope you're hyped bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to a guest on the road to permissionless series this is sergey koontz he's the co-founder of one inch which is a fantastic decentralized exchange aggregator use it all the time sergey welcome to bankless how are you doing hi hi everyone it's a pleasure to stay here yeah i'm fine thanks we are very uh very excited to uh see you guys at permissionless and um but maybe before we talk a little bit about what you're doing from a product perspective what you're going to be doing at uh at the conference can you give folks who haven't heard or used one inch the summary what is one inch so one inch is one stop access for 4d5 we call it uh because we have almost every liquidity source integrated in one inch so just imagine if you are going to buy an airplane ticket you are not going to emulate to lufanza or to uh like uh alaska airlines you are going to aggregate right to to to get the best best rates sometimes if you have connections between the flights new york frankfurt dubai and so on you need really the best best uh airplane ticket uh also in the right time and this is what we are doing for d5 if you are swapping one token to another token we generate the path the route uh like on google maps but more more complex uh to exchange one asset to another asset in fully non-custodial manner uh in real p2p manner so you're interacting directly with the smart contract without trusting us by by by using our protocols which are multiple times audited verified by the community as well and a lot of security experts one inch network itself started with vanish aggregation we built it on a hackathon over two nights in ath new york uh it was may 2019. um we didn't sleep at all over two nights it was really hard really hard at the end the room behind me started to change somehow and but i i was able to finalize the the the prototype together with andrew booker my co-founder and um some of the guys who i showed this uh product uh they said this is the next big thing and this is really the next big thing for the d5 like uh it makes no sense to exchange the organ and access it makes only sense to use aggregators to get the best best result and punish networks nowadays more than just aggregation protocol this uh kind of order book limit order protocol uh fully permissionless manner and this liquid protocol multiple teams are already joined to to our kind of network we have like 100 contributors around the globe we have independent teams building additionally to under kind of one inch uh like for example decentralized file storage protocol dinette you have maybe seen them um and everyone is uh is welcome to join this is a grand program we know how hot it is at the beginning we were like working one half years with london without any any penny from from like from these products uh just in the nights normal jobs day this overs and we know how it is to to to have a need for for like money to build on something with what is really amazing and uh that's why everyone can join and apply for for a grand one-inch network when i uh when i describe one inch to folks i i usually say something like look it's just it's expedia for d5 right for trading that's generally what it is yeah and for folks like the great thing about this is if you want to actually understand everything that sergey was was was saying in more detail just use it just go to one inch and actually use the exchange you know you can plug in metamask whatever non-custodial wallet you have and and try it out i think sometimes in d5 that's the best way to to learn is actually try it it's very easy to use um why do you think one inch has been able to attract so much market share sergey what's been the key to uh to your success here and how much market share do you guys have now so we actually invented the aggregation in dfi yeah among multiple liquidity sources and one single transaction fully atomically that's why we we have uh the the biggest part of the of the market share uh on the market uh right now there are some other guys who just started to follow us like xerox for example um so they they actually built the autobook limit order protocol um and they came to to the idea of one inch soft really a huge problem in d5 like we combined all liquid sources in a single one by using algorithms and um xerox started to do that pair swap also joined us the competition and we as like we are hackers like hackers as builders on hackathons and the competitions and we love competition and we compete very well uh if you look on the uh miramax metamask is using us xerox periscope and some other liquid sources and we have most of the market share there because we compete much better because we have more liquid source integrated and we have highly highly optimized advanced algorithm which responds under 100 milliseconds this is also really really huge achievement of my of of our team in the last last month um about the market share the thing is if you compare us directly with uni swap users who who are using uni swap directly on the on the ui on the website of uni swap and ask we are on the same level so we need little bit times to to to jump and be the best uh uh defy application in the world um and compared to other aggregators um we we have uh i i don't have right numbers right now but uh we have more than xerox and and periscope together so if you count them together we are we have more than um yeah just the current state and yeah we just we just solved a huge problem and this is the the key uh point of like of success solve a problem and don't try to to teach people that you're right or you or they have to use something of what you have built just show him uh what what you solved as a problem and they will agree on that because you solve the problem so you have to people who agree on what you have built and this is the success of one age i would say so greg i remember uh east new york 2019 where you guys put the first versions of of uh one inch together i remember being being at that conference and i think that's an interesting lesson for for listeners where some people think that conferences are a bunch of just fun games and parties and it can be uh but you can also make a ton of progress and and get a lot of done at conferences especially hackathons like like ethan new york so it's definitely one of the things we're interested in in seeing app permissionless and i'm a little i'm curious with regards to the user base or the use cases of one inch obviously the use case of one inch is to get the best liquidity and the best rates on your trade but when it comes to actually who is using the product what do you see happening the most like what is the most frequent customer of of one inch who's using your product to achieve what goals so we have really great distribution among different trade sizes i would say we have more than one million people already using one inch just on ethereum it's like half a million on buenos mache and six hundred thousand polygon um so we have just dashboard so public dashboard and dune analytics everyone can take a look on that at the bottom of the analytics you can find the distribution uh this chart you can see how is the distribution between small amounts people who trade small amounts people who trade bigger amounts so we have uh really great distribution there are some who trade a lot yeah some who trade really small amount but like in the middle is uh the graphic looks like this um in the middle so they swap like two three ten thousand dollars uh uh it's most of our users who are doing that um yeah and uh i'm i'm curious as we go into the world of layer two does uh does one inch have a layer two strategy what's what's the uh what's the plan for reducing gas fees and and making sure that one inch can be accessible by everyone so we have t1 niche foundation and chemin islands this is fully independent organization from us they still have some vanish tokens and they have a program for guest refund so if you stake specific amount of tokens already from i guess 1000 tokens uh you get a discount from 25 percentages of gas costs every month as a kind of withdrawal yeah and uh if you have 100 not one hundred thousand of one ish token staked so you you get full full amount uh as a refund in vanish tokens every month uh for what you're swapping so it's just like a small mitigation uh to to solve this problem with higher gas costs right now this is not a future problem uh you can see the market dropped a lot and the gas costs are also low right now uh but layer 2 is a good solution so we we were talking with italic as well in the last conferences and he also agreed on that that let's choose a good solution for d5 charlotte architecture ethereum 2.0 it's something for other things not for fi destroys finance because in this central finance you need to execute atomically in our case um we execute like advising with transaction multiple swaps and multiple exchanges multiple markets in between and um and this is this is the benefit and layer two offers uh low base codes uh high security um and uh we have already optimism integrated arbitrary we have integrated and the big big player is coming very soon i was talking it's small inside i was talking with uh with alex from from zika sync in the last days and they are they are working really hard to release zika sync in the main at uh it's already in a test net you have seen it maybe and uh the thing is the difference between zika sync and optimism and arbitrary is that uh everything is already proven on zika singh so it's not optimistic roll up so maybe everyone manipulated something and you have seven days on withdrawal to to claim yeah but it's like i think it wouldn't work yeah everything is proven it's very fast it's scalable um it can be scaled up to 25 000 transaction gps yeah and this is huge just it it offers uh also to deploy like uh applications for banks as well so banks are we are talking a lot with banks around the world and they're they're looking in in defy and and i i guess they will also deploy a lot of things and will play with all the protocols in permission manner for sure we need to introduce kyc for this part this this is a different story uh but also the low gas costs on layer two it's it's a great thing and high high security uh is also very important in this term so okay so i i'm just curious when we think about uh scalability in general like how do you think this uh how do you think this shakes out right so you one inch is very much as an aggregator very much a liquidity aggregator and in the early days that just meant liquidity on one chain ethereum across different d5 protocols now increasingly it means liquidity across multiple chains many chains and many many different layer twos and roll-ups as well and you were talking about some challenges with atomic transactions right the lack of composability between various you know l2s does one inch serve as an aggregator for that sort of thing too like how do you think this this shakes out in the in the three to five year time horizon is there still one user interface where a user can kind of get liquidity from anywhere whether it's a sidechain a main chain you know a layer two or do you think that d5 the future of d5 is a bit more fragmented so yeah we have seen the liquidity move to polygon to bonus match and so on and right now it makes no sense to offer swaps among multiple chains because they are not atomic and this is a huge problem so you you have a risk that the rate can change on the other chain and uh you need to mitigate this risk for sure if you have a kind of a good bridge protocol which can mitigate this and you exchange on the ethereum side to this liquidity pool tokens of this bridge and they are just unlocked on the other side but it's still there's some risks and um it's it's not it's not that easy to to implement and there's not enough liquidity right now uh for bridges i would say uh one thing what you can do is potentially easy already we are thinking about this feature as well swapping on ethereum and moving it to poly polygon for example in one single transaction it would potentially work um we are looking this direction as well but we i don't think so that we will aggregate this among multiple changes in the future would would looks like uh layer two which is uh which is uh highly secure yeah and uh scalable which get the most traction yeah and it makes no sense to to like distribute liquidity among multiple change chains where you have maybe higher fees yeah then in one signal l2 where you have a lot of protocols deployed already and uh maybe like for example polygon had an outage like of like one day or something like they didn't work like one one day and this is insane for the blockchain you know like potentially you have bank applications later working on this and uh and everything stopped because like of one buck and this is really stupid yeah and i guess we we had never such a situation in ethereum that's why ethereum has the most uh most most liquidity for sure we had some forks and so on because of these stories with the hackers uh i don't think so that it will happen again because the community is much bigger than before that's interesting so you think there's going to be a power law winner for in the in the lt wars uh we'll have to see how that uh that that um moves forward but but tell us a little bit about um the road to permission list so we have three months until the permissionless conference you know really excited about that at the time of recording anyway do you guys have any big new releases between now and then or just in the upcoming future future what's one inch because i know you guys are always building things what's on the near term release roadmap so we we have like 100 people uh around the half like 50 people are working on like software things like developing we have multiple fields we have our wallet uh ios wallet we are going to introduce nft support in the next days uh if you have to like that apple approved that nft support yeah yeah it's really great feature it's already i'm testing it already like a month uh so i was showing it on the ath denver a little bit to some people um and uh it's a need you know like in a wallet in a one-inch wallet you need an ft support for sure in aggregation itself we we don't have for yet the solution we are looking all in this direction but it's not on the high priority actually you need the aggregator for for for the nfts because you're if you have a new like like tick tock you know like uh if you have uh like nft which is like high rated then you should maybe buy it yeah and later sell it for high money whatever no financial advice um so uh we are going to introduce android wallet yeah it's almost done there's a extra team waiting for the security audit results it's also important in our case we do every time when we release something security audits um we are working on a new protocol where one inch token is used uh highly as utility you need to stake and ensure okay this kind of insurance we call it uh you stake one inch token to ensure specific part of the protocol um i cannot disclose a lot of things regarding this but this is also game changer we introduce uh a permissionless manner in a specific defy field which is not yet solved by anyone so uh yeah these are things that were coming uh in the next three months and uh we have more in planning so iterative segregation this direction it's it's a lot of work right now and you reduce also options and it's this also a huge topic for d5 from our point of view circa that's all very exciting i'm excited to see the things that come out of one inch in the next three months and i'm assuming listeners are going to have a bunch of questions when they see these products roll out so who from the one inch team is going to permissionless so if people have questions about these releases who can they go ask we have a great community team they are also based in u.s met for example um he's traveling uh between the conferences he did he's right now and tanner for example uh they are they are right now in rio yeah uh and uh you yeah yeah come to our booth and uh we have sometimes uh kind of some gifts uh so chips so like poc like poker chips and some uh one inch tokens on it yeah so you can participate directly in the doll as uh yeah as a contributor kind of uh dow contributor and there are also some other people who are traveling um this also nick for example uh he's more in the field of uh business operations gleb uh he's more with before working with influencers uh and and some other um like um social media guys um also we have natalia also she's also working very closely with the uh with the community and yeah just come to our booth get get a nice t-shirt uh maybe a hoodie and also some one-ish tokens to to participate in the dawn we have a really great doll we have a doubt treasury with already seven millions of dollars collected from the revenue streams from the protocols itself um just yeah to to which should be spent for grants yeah for example but yeah everyone's welcome to participate so who at permissionless are you looking to meet what kind of talent are you looking to have uh onboard it into the dow what kind of talent are you looking to help build out the one-inch ecosystem so if people are coming up to your booth what talent what skills should they bring if they're interested in contributing so we have a lot of uh fields where we're working right now like robert said one other people a lot of teams uh we have teams for for for the ui for the web 3 ui we have teams for android who can like write java code you're welcome ios people algorithm guys for sure we are looking for more people to improve the algorithm also to extend it maybe later for stock exchanges or centralized exchanges as well uh and maybe combine all all together with defy um also um people who are like would love to work with the community itself we need more people who push it push it push this defy topic around the globe yeah and uh for sure we we are looking for business relations as well so if you have maybe a startup and you would like to integrate one inch or you would like to be being integrated in one inch or you just want i don't know um one kind of collaboration uh you're welcome yeah to to come and talk with us so sergey the permission this conference i think is going to be a mix between like industry veterans industry ogs uh but then also a bunch of new people a lot of people's first conference i suspect is going to be permissionless do you have any advice for for people that have never been to a crypto conference before uh because crypto conferences are kind of a beast of their own um and do you have any like advice or rules of thumb or just bits of information that perhaps the first conference goer might uh might find useful my suggestions just uh just do it come to the conference uh so my first the thing is uh when i was like touring also around the globe before 2018 uh was in aws conference for example and some some other conferences around the globe and i didn't have the feeling this is like cool really cool yeah and it's like there are a lot of cool nice people which i can just meet yeah and talk with them directly in crypto conferences crypto hackathons you can talk with anyone yeah just go to someone and ask ask what they are doing and this uh most of the people are really or all people which i met they're just explaining what they are building they are maybe traders uh maybe they're building on startups they have just an idea to build something we're looking for a new for another co-founder yeah so i i like this this um feeling on crypto conference that every fun everyone uh loves to talk with anyone else and just this is great sergey do you have a a you've talked about some of the products that are rolling out in the next three months before permissionless happens but i want to zoom all the way out and just kind of ask about the one ecosystem in like the three to five year time horizon what is the super zoomed out vision for the one inch ecosystem so we will see a kyc introduced in in defy so you will have a permission uh defy and this is not bad um regulators are looking how to regulate and uh banks are looking to join but banks need to kind of regulation yeah so for this we will see a kind of kyc i call it um potentially knowledge proof of technology it's a really good one technology which can be used with smart contracts highly efficiently so we will you'll see um uh under one inch a lot of different products uh uh leverage dirties whatever else is uh is possible to build in permissionless manner uh to just improve the current uh traditional financial system and i i would love to see also banks participating in this and institutions uh who offer everyone to maybe stake some like 100 bucks in a protocol by using potentially also from our point of view also a bank why not bank is a gatekeeper for me uh it's not a kind of it's not uh someone we we have to fight with they are we need to work with them and use them as gatekeeper so they will open the doors for everyone to stake on a specific protocol without having huge knowledge in defy space and they trust the bank and that's fine and the people can earn uh on on the savings right now you don't get anything in europe at least you get like negative interest rate and this is stupid you know like if i have 50 50 000 euros collected in my last 10 years i have to pay like 0.5 percent just negative interest rate this is stupid i i can okay right now i can just buy usdc and with this money and and put in unison for example in a specific price range where i can just generate 10 cpy um and this is nice but not for everyone uh and that's why i would like to see a lot of institutions uh also custodian services working more with dfi and we will have for sure the leadership on the market because i have the best team in the world who are shipping like like beasts like maniacs in good terms yeah uh working the nights in the days uh how i do it with antoine still uh yeah uh well sergey thank you so much for spending some time with us and thank you for building one inch you guys your team has uh one of the shippiest teams in all of crypto and all of d5 you guys just keep pumping out the features and i think that's why you've gained so much of the market share thank you for your insights uh thank you for some of the advice today and we're looking forward to seeing the one inch team at the permissionless conference thank you very much it was a pleasure to participate here of course guys none of this has been financial advice but i gotta say this is kind of career advice you gotta come to the permissionless conference this is the space to be in crypto web 3. we're changing the world we could do that in person too attending conferences is important david has taught me that i'll be there in person as well that's going to happen may 17th through 19th in palm beach florida
