[Music] hey bankless nation this is the fourth week of november it's thanksgiving week if you are in the us listening david happy thanksgiving man how you doing oh happy thanksgiving to you i'm doing absolutely fantastic by the time listeners are listening to this i will be home in seattle with my family and my super cute nephew uh and if you guys haven't noticed this weekly roll up is coming to you a day early because of thanksgiving so happy thursday but still get your coffee because we have a bunch to do in this thursday bankless weekly rollover that's right if you're eating some turkey with your family and stuffing just put on the bankless podcasts get them up to speed on crypto they'll thank you later okay earbuds in family out weekly roll up on let's do this well you know on thanksgiving you're gonna have some thanksgiving crypto conversations right are you gonna have a few do you have any extended family uh it's inevitable it's a never yeah yeah i always ask you i always tell the same story with and like a lot of people resonate with this story my sister hates it that like every time she like runs into me at some sort of gathering like i'm talking about crypto but but here's how this works right like so like family gathering 20 people 30 people maybe there's a party in the backyard i don't know uh and they're like all right david like what do you do and i go oh i work it like well first off here's how this goes i ask them what they do and then they give me some like normal job and i'm like okay i get it like marketing like i know i know what that is uh and then they asked me what i do and i'm like oh i work in crypto and then of course they have a bajillion questions and then my sister comes over here's her like little brother talking about crypto it's like oh david's always talking about crypto i'm like they asked me they asked me it's not me ask you let me ask you i'm gonna play your sister devil's advocate here do you ask them what they do in order for them to ask you what you do so that you can tell them about crypto sir maybe subconsciously but not not intentionally when they ask you are you excited that they've just asked you the question and how do you lead into it like where do you even start that's where i have such heart like a hard time yeah i always let me tell you about the history of money do you know the gold standard let's start there so what's cryptos like all right well in in 1973 nixon went off the gold standard oh man too much fun all right guys we we've got a jam-packed um schedule for you of course we're going to talk about vc's abandoning ethereum at least the fund managers there was some crypto twitter drama over the weekend david i know you saw it an overview you were part of it absolutely yeah we're going to talk about that too also the constitution last week we talked about purchasing the constitution it was we were rugged by a fund manager though the worst like the same guy who rubbed us on gme we're gonna talk about that too it didn't happen unfortunately uh macy's nft day parade they're gonna put some nfts as floats i believe also the nfl going to polygon that's an interesting story too so lots to uncover even in this short thanksgiving week uh david before we get into it man we got to talk a little bit about opolis i love what oppos is doing because it is empowering the new worker the self-sovereign worker what is opelus up to david and why are we sharing this yeah opolis is a dow for daos so if you want to work for a dow be a self-sovereign worker that you know manages your own uh you know works life balance and work for a doubt that's fantastic a problem with that is what about health care what about things like payroll what about stability uh and opolis is a dow to help bring stability for the dow worker the self-sovereign worker uh so opolis is itself a dao it's kind of a co-op uh and when you join opolis you join in a healthcare group a group of people that all are given health insurance by the same organization and you guys you know uh you you split split the risk split the payments uh and it's a way to get health care for everyone in the co-op uh and just like every other dow being a using the opulence product gives you ownership in the opolis dao so if you sign up today or not today but also today uh but also before the 1st of january 2022 so the end of the year you will get a 1 000 work token that's the opolis token bonus along with a thousand bank token that's the bank of stout token if you join opolis by january 1st so click on the link in the show notes to get started getting your health insurance through opposites i think that's a bankless dot cc slash opola so many people david they're like i'd quit a job today if i had health benefits well now you can get those and it's not just health they also can pay in crypto they provide payroll they'll help you with taxes the whole gamut i know this is for our u.s listeners because we have particular trouble when it comes to to health care but maybe they'll be expanding beyond that as well anyway all right david let's talk about the market what is happening in the market this week i'm gonna flip to our bitcoin chart to tell us more a little quiet in the market this week bitcoin took a little bit of a tumble start of the week at around sixty thousand dollars uh is currently clocking in at fifty six thousand six hundred dollars overall down about five percent on the week uh but in terms of you know the grand scheme of things not not really too much action there no big deal okay how about eath price going into thanksgiving holidays are we gonna be bragging to our our family and friends i don't know yeah a little bit flat on the week we started the week at uh where did we start the week at um forty thousand ish dollars hit a high of forty four thousand dollars four thousand four i'll take you down four four thousand four hundred yeah uh-huh that'd be nice something that would be nice a year from now yeah that will be the the roll-up report yeah sometimes i forget to stop looking into the future um 4 232 is where the ether price is um so a little bit up on the week um ether doing a really good job keeping his head above 4 000. it dipped below for 4 000 for a moment two days ago but has really fought hard against staying below 4 000. there's also a story of the dxy the dollar index gaining a lot of strength getting stronger yeah and so there's the traders are talking about bitcoin weakness in the face of dollar strength i have my own takes there which we will unpack later in the show but ether had a very strong performance against uh what is overall a slightly down market this week all right family questions thanksgiving questions david what crypto should i buy how do you answer that one ether yeah and is it too late to buy a service look at this absolutely okay a year ago at this time you're having that conversation with your family it would have been a better time to buy 737 is the price ether was trading uh well that that was that was january 1st i'm gonna freaking oh that's that's year's day let me do the one one year oh my god steven 500. 600. six hundred dollars five hundred dollars somewhere in that that range uh better time to buy still not a bad time to buy if you're holding for the long run i suppose of course none of this is financial advice right david absolutely i'm sure you qualify why would you think that either bitcoin ratio what's happening there yeah up on up on the week we started we ended last week around point seven we are at point zero seven four uh hit a peak of almost point zero seven six which if you zoom out for like maybe the six months time horizon ryan uh we are approaching like a very the end of where uh ether btc ratio has been at its local high in the last year so it it hit the high earlier this year at point zero eight ish and we've been bouncing between point zero eight and point zero like six for like the last six months and we there's not much room left before we establish new highs on local time frames yeah look at that look at that we are uh we're not having that uh fourth quarter weakness that generally has like bitcoin i mean traditionally in in bullish markets bitcoin has a killer fourth quarter right and then ether kind of uh languishes uh but that's not happening they're you know they're both kind of doing okay and ether is definitely keeping up more than keeping up how about very little precedent for ether uh having any sort of price discovery above this level so like we keep on going higher like we don't really know what happens next and so a lot of people are speculating oh where is this going to go i feel like this number was the exact same last week when we talked this is uh total locked value in uh in d5 this is the d5 pulse we're above 100 billion dollars 106 billion dollars to just kind of hang in there seems similar to last week um how about our defy tokens defy index tracks that what are we looking at this week a little bit down on the week dpi start of the week at 355 dollars ending the week at 348 dollars okay let's talk a bit more about uh indexes this is the bet index so this is a third bitcoin a third ether and a third dpi all of them put together what are we looking at on the week uh also slightly down on the week start of the week at 172 currently clocking in at 165. that's a good recommendation right so if you're talking to your family and friends right a third a third a third just buy the bed index sleep comfy at night that's uh that's what we say here on bank list yeah they're always looking for something on coinbase though so coinbase if you could go ahead and list bed that'd be fantastic otherwise i'll just have to keep recommending ether but you know what they do they're actually what they really want i you know like what i found a lot of people talk to is like they don't actually want to know about ether they want to know about the next ether right it's kind of their question it's all it's always the questions like every time i like meet someone and i tell them i'm into crypto like half the time it's like all right what's the next token i should buy i'm like well wait a second have you bought bitcoin or ether and they're like no yeah i'm like why are you asking me about the next token you haven't even started you haven't even found the the starting line yeah you're not even into your crypto monies yet right like learn your abc's first before you start spelling [Laughter] man you and i should have thanksgiving together sometime good conversations uh all right layer two beat this is good man this is very good it keeps going up keeps going okay layer two beat for people uh we sometimes cover this in the market section this is the amount of uh value locked inside of ethereum roll-ups and um ethereum layer twos i should broaden that not not just roll-up ethereum layer twos we are at 6.5 billion and it keeps going up and david after our conversation with starkware uh like look man this is the i we keep saying this this is the chart to watch in 2022. okay this is the new d5 pulse type of chart that's just gonna keep going up and up and up and rocketing up as uh roll-ups and layer two become saturated and it's you know it's already pretty healthy at uh 6.5 billion yeah up to 20 on the week clocking at 6.5 billion yeah there's some big winners this week uh bobet network don't actually know what that is uh number two up 180 in total tvl on the week uh so brand new l2 uh apparently it's an optimistic roll up uh didn't know about that one another big winner this week it's loopering uh up 25 percent in tvl uh immutable x up almost 50 percent in tvl to 237 million dollars diversify up 23 at 59 million dollars and some big winners big movers this week yeah absolutely we'll continue monitoring this it's still super before you move on yeah check out the east number so we're looking at the dollar number let's check out the east supply uh in okay you can do that yeah each all-time high all-time high that's what really matters too yeah so if you measure in eth you get the the noise is this denominated in ether's denominator yeah okay so this is this could be stable coins it could be other value but it's just denominated beneath is that correct or is this equivalent yes you're right yes you're right oh yes okay so we're just changing the denomination here but this is still cool a lot of ether over there too uh let's talk eip 1559. i mean how many months has it been now let's see specifically 105 days thank you sir that was very precise actually actually that was uh on the 18th so it's actually been roughly 112 or 111 days okay well uh how we know that is christine kim who is an analyst at galaxy um she is looking at ethereum's fee market upgrade i love by the way that analysts now kind of like wall street s i know that galaxies are crypto fund but they're also like wall street plugged in okay now real analysts are looking at eip 1559 looking at ether as a bond and what does she have to say to us uh david you want to talk about some of these tweets yeah she's got some great charts the first one she says since activation eip1559 has saved users a total of 844 million dollars through base fee refunds um and so what this means is that like if you overpay for your transaction because you just wanted to go in but you eip at 1.559 actually returns you the amount that you've overpaid above and beyond base fee so this is people learning to wrap their heads around from the previous form of transaction types to the new form of transaction types yep the actually baking in how much a transaction costs into the protocol saves people money because they don't have to overestimate it stacking these wins win number one for users is saving money yeah uh second one the average cost of sending a transaction on ethereum has continued to crime tripling in dollar terms and doubling in native units since the activation of eip1559 this is going uh in parallel with the increased demand for ethereum block space uh eip1559 does not increase price increase gas fees um but it just so happens that it doesn't alleviate them it doesn't yeah it doesn't alleviate them but it just so happens that once the ip1559 was uh implemented the nft markets really took off as well as d5 markets as well so demand for gas since eip159 has only gone up okay not a win there but like it's kind of neutral well it's it's a win for ether is hard money yeah true third one despite lower earnings from transaction fees total minor revenue in dollar terms has increased 33 percent so miners have actually been making all-time highs i thought they were gonna leave the market david yeah yeah that was the narrative right that's what they said that's what they said they're gonna kill our business but nope uh yeah all-time high minor revenue even after eip1559 okay god bless the miners hope you guys are investing in ether so that you can become stakers what's uh this next one david 56 of all new coins issued on ethereum have been offset aka burnt by the amount of ease burnt through 56 56 yeah so uh we are as a result of ether issuance has been reduced by 56 almost uh more than half crazy is that great that's happening did we just get it happening and that's happening yeah oh cool accidental uh that's awesome and she writes more there's an entire research paper here that you can go look at but once again super cool to see analysts diving into that and seeing this on the charts yeah great data also david we just passed a major milestone all right over 1 million eth has now been burnt since eip 1559 this happened tuesday i believe so uh earlier this week huge milestone a million eighth that's like one percent ish just less than one percent of all eth's supply has now been burnt what yep one percent man that's crazy it's like it's like point eight percent but yeah pretty yeah pretty close we're getting close well we could celebrate again when it actually hits one percent uh this is eric connor what's he say uh ethereum network hash rate all-time high there is has never been more hashes produced per second on ethereum than right now it's been up and up and up uh basically since for instance forever uh and even with eip1559 the ethereum network security is at all-time highs this definitely has to do with the increasing eth price right as east price goes up there's more minor incentive um and yeah so ethereum also never has ever been more secure well i think the lesson there is don't believe the fud yeah i mean this might be a recurring lesson in this in this conversation it's like there are some concerns of course i'm not saying everything is always rosy right like there are some reasons to be bearish there's you know some technologies that will take longer but oftentimes david people get trapped by flood type narratives you remember when everyone was saying pre eip 1559 first it would never come then when it when it was obvious that it would come that uh it was too risky would destroy the network miners would leave right they would fork gas would shoot up yeah user experience would be terrible like none of these things happened it's just narrative battles uh we'll get into a major narrative battle in a second but here's a pro tip on gas fees you want to save on some gas fees this holiday season then you should plan your transactions uh not during business hours all right so like don't do this monday tuesday yeah don't do us east coast ish pacific time business hours do it on saturdays saturdays at like 3 a.m it looks like or sunday's even better like 3 a.m eastern time this is a chart that shows average base fees by time of day in the east coast time zone and when things are more expensive that's uh that's that's the yellow color and when things are cheaper that's purple uh and it's kind of showing us when the the cheapest time period to get transactions through yeah so it looks like yeah looking like saturday and sunday much quieter wednesday is a bad day to make transactions but also specifically noon at eastern time we're super do not send your transactions then yeah mid-week right between midnight and 9 a.m on mondays eastern time is a great time to do it uh the same times throughout on saturday and sunday anytime after noon till like you know 5 p.m eastern time on a weekday probably should just wait uh-oh this is looking like banker hours david are we in trouble here i thought this was bankless people doing all their d5 banking during like workouts we're at work like being distracted and just like oh i could just like yeah right buying a keys instead of doing my work that's what's going on well who knows it's helpful though it's super cool you can see all that too um let's talk about ronin this is uh axe infiniti i think it's a bold case for actually infinity to be honest right it's like um they've had a lot of it's it's been an incredible year for axi in general people are wondering like what's the next cal catalyst for them well it's really cool that they're turning their uh side chain their own side chain which maybe in the future becomes a roll-up they're turning that basically into like a mini axi um banking system right so now they just out of economy right they just rolled out a decentralized exchange uh 1.8 billion dollars moved to the ronin decentralized exchange over the past two weeks this thing is still brand new what else we got 1.3 billion in total locked value over the last 30 days 7.5 billion in volume just crushing it man people trade naxis trading assets and it's become sort of a a banking layer i bet this is how millions of people were will find their ways into d fight this might be for a lot of people their first banking experience might be ronan sidechain defy you know using metamask or something super cool to see that 100 yeah no actually proving out to be a sustainable economy not a flash in the pan really yeah my god i i think i fell in love with this website it's like more data phenomenal what is this okay so this is tps.info ethtps.info and it's a great way to visualize the transactions per second of the overall ethereum ecosystem uh in real time in real time yeah in real time so currently clocking in at 122 transactions per second and then if you also hit that button exclude side chains you can go back and forth between uh including true layer true roll-ups that have the same assurances of ethereum versus also having um a side chain so if you want to account just the roll-ups ethereum's clocking in at 5.28 transactions per second if you include side changes up to like 122. um but this is not the theoretical maximum this is actually ethereum as being used as a system right the actual transactions that are going through so this actually changes um the roll up throughput just jumped up to 16.15 transactions per second so they're supposed to be updating every single block really cool visualization uh and so as we were watching like l2 beat go up in tvl we're also going to be watching these squares on the right side grow and grow in in size for the audio listeners we're seeing a big big blob that is ethereum with some smaller squares on the side that's arbitrary optimism zkc zk swap immutable x loop ring all the all the layer twos as those two things build out we're going to see those get larger and ethereum shrink and the transactions per second go up right and yeah a really cool visualization here's the big lesson to david is that if you want to measure the transactions per second of ethereum you can't just take main chain like that the 10 to 15 transactions per second increasingly you're gonna have to take the entire ecosystem that is secured by ethereum so that will be mainnet plus all of the rollups and that will give you the the real transactions per second time that is ethereum scalability strategy so as you said i expect in the future this purple to be like just a small sliver exactly and i'm very so much more active right just the settlement layer right yeah uh it's a really cool website i bet we'll include this uh in the future in the roll up as before we should talk about the the theoretical max right so oh yeah and optimism actually get used more and more and more and they also open up and unconstrain their layer twos the theoretical theoretical max of these things are insane right like right now people are using arbitrarily a little bit right clocking in at 49 transactions per second with a theoretical max of 40 000 per second optimism recorded right the max record oh yeah that's the max recorded yeah so it's 49. 49 right optimism uh has only clocked in at 2.4 uh max transactions per second recorded but again this is because people are just beginning to use these things immutable doing 28.3 transactions per second like we actually need people to actually go on and start to use these things to really like rev up how many tps they can actually do but like uh theoretical max of arbitrarium 40 40k theoretical max of optimism 20k zk swap 10k immutable x 9k like the theoretical max on these things is like the ceiling is there's so much capacity there's so much capacity right and we just need more and more people to actually just be moving and moving their apps moving their money moving their value onto these layer twos which is why we should be probably following this alongside with layer 2b on probably a reoccurring basis i think we should be doing that do you want to make that executive decision it is okay we're doing that it's done it's done governance is governance governance vote do i have to sign on chain anywhere no no are we are we a dow david that with two what's that all right let's talk about uh the metaverse too and in particular i want to talk about sand they just had a crazy token surge um adidas is teasing a partnership with sand this is built partially on polygon i believe partially on ethereum i think we should get them on the show at some point but like what is going on with their token dude oh my god it's way higher than it was yesterday my gosh yeah so i remember looking at this token doing doing some due diligence on a bankless show forever ago and i thought i was like clocking in buying it like buying it and not buying it yeah so i thought it was a dollar it's like oh that's just traditional yeah as a tradition right so like three weeks ago saw it as a at a dollar currently clocking in at over seven dollars hit an all-time high of seven dollars and 81 cents uh definitely should have bought that but uh the obvious trade after like facebook rema rebranded to meta was to buy all the meta verse tokens sand being one of them uh so definitely they're also the the organization that snoop dogg is helping promo uh so they they got him on board and now apparently also adidas these valuations getting frothy though sir i mean like look we just jumped to seven billion dollars for this thing for sand i mean i don't know ryan how valuable is the metaverse i i did but this sounds so much like a dot-com thing to me that i just gotta be like how valuable is the internet sir and that's why you should buy pets.com right are you like are you going to be but the dot-com bubble while we go through the documentary i'm not saying i'm not saying like i'm bearish or anything i'm just saying like one difference is like for to me actually infinity these guys are crushing it on the revenue like i see some of those fundamentals i don't know much about sand uh so maybe i need to do my due diligence maybe i should have done that 30 days ago oh my god all right let's talk about this the opposite direction yeah this is uh this is a sad chart so when i see a chart like this i just think like big connect i think um right a scam i think someone rugged us but this is not a cryptocurrency what chart are we looking at here we are looking at the turkish lira currency the currency of turkey versus the u.s dollar so back in february you could get 13 and a half almost 14 cents for one turkish lira and today you can get 7.8 cents for a turkish lira which i mean okay that's like losing about half of its value in crypto that's nothing in global fiat currencies that's a big deal like uh going from february to uh where we are at the end of november losing half of your value that's a really big deal so yeah the we're watching the the um i'm not gonna say hyperinflation but i'm gonna put it into people's brains we are watching the rapid inflation of the lira currency as it relates to the dollar and it's sad because like unlike unlike the uh the big connects that you know go to zero so this this affects um tens of thousands businesses millions of people's lives right so like currencies fail economy is shut down yeah and it it causes like real economic hardship for people it causes political instability it's it's sad it's a sad thing to happen right um and uh yeah i i guess like imagine being having your your funds uh in the lira and having a savings account of like a thousand dollars right a year ago and now it's just you didn't do anything like nine months ago yeah nine months ago you saved five minutes imagine how hard it is for people to like save up a thousand dollars not and not living in america and then that thousand dollars gets cut like kneecapped now it's five hundred dollars like this you think of all the time that just got deleted like if it takes you a year to save up a thousand dollars and then now it's 500 you just like lost a half of a year's worth of labor money is a battery of your time and energy when you when you go to work you spend eight hours a day toiling and then you take your paycheck that is tokenized time and energy when mis misallocated or just bad monetary policy loses the value of the dollar there these these central bank operators are playing with your time and energy that you've saved up stealing from you stealing from you mm-hmm look it's just sad right it's like i i feel you know very blessed like on bankless we get to talk about all the shenanigans going on in crypto we get to talk about the numbers we get to talk about nfts we get to talk about the fun stuff but it's important to zoom out and realize why we're here right this is a better financial system for the world like it's not fair and it shouldn't be the case that your money you live just just because of the the area you grew up in your geographic national jurisdiction that you should have this kind of money system in place and it's the default right that's sad and that this is the reason we're in crypto is to is to create a better money system for the world uh anyway i think this is going to be the first of many fiat currencies to pop in this decade yeah very sad uh guys we are we've got a lot to be thankful for we get a lot of news we got some releases coming up next before we get to those we want to thank the sponsors that made this show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of the centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many d5 applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stablecoin into the alchemix vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's dot a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x-f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemixv2 and to get involved in governance hey guys we are back with the hot releases of the week gotta start here finance is starting its integration with arbitram one they have opened layer two each deposits to arbitrarily i think you can also you know push push it's a bridge basically to arbitrarily where you can bridge each back or and forth from binance so this kind of provides a a fiat on-ramp so you can put fiat in binance convert it to eth and then get eth on the other side into arbitrage it's the first i think big crypto exchange to do something like this and i expect many others to follow in its place what are your thoughts yeah this is huge this is putting users where they're meant to be users right users need to use layer twos like use goes on layer twos that's what that arrives that's what they're flow there david and and arbitrom is a great layer too uh binance now allowing people to take their money and put it directly on arbitrary where the apps are that the users can use uh and not having to pay the l1 gas fees this is the future of ethereum uh binance leaving the charge uh a little bit surprising coinbase where you're at coinbase yeah coinbase is done let's let's do it let's get on that um all right let's talk about defrag instant liquidity for your nfts what does this mean yeah collateralized nfts we know that this is for this product i mean i'm guessing is going to be absolutely used by all the nfters out there being able to collateralize the value of your nfts and get a loan against them uh definitely some degen behavior but probably a pretty important primitive for d5 would you would you ever collateralize your crypto punk and like buy a car or something like that i'm very very worried that a lot of people are going to collateralize their punks and they're going to lose their punks that way get liquidated get liquidated on a punk i'd be very worried about that remember the stories of you know 2018 where people were getting like liquidated on their uh positions and maker that they took out in 2017 oh imagine losing a punk that way yeah oh hey is that you david a few times okay well it's only a couple times you're back though you're back stronger than ever uh defrag interestingly enough is um built by one of the co-founders of um of zapper as well noter uh so yeah interesting project it's not quite available yet but um there's some ways you can get involved there's something called a meta mathematician and uh yeah anyway this is like a minting story go check this out if you're interested in in more about that what is this reputation dao yeah reputation dao is a oracle reputation product is what they say so ryan has said this a number of times uh the cool thing about defy is you can write right click view source which is kind of a metaphor you can't really right click view source but you can go to websites like defy pulse or dune analytics and actually look under the hood at what are the assets what what is the balance sheet of all of these device apps like compound maker dao et etc that's the beauty of a transparent openness permissionless financial system reputation dao is taking the same concept the ability to vet and audit instantaneously and permissionlessly not just to defy apps but to also for oracles oracles are an increasingly important component of the d5 world we need to understand the prices of things and reputation dow is a way to audit the performance security of oracles and they have partnered with tracer dow which tracer dao is a financials products dow that needs to consume oracles to produce financial products so uh the combination of tracer dao and reputation dao have produced uh probably perhaps a new level of oracle security uh making our oracles and therefore d5 more and more secure yeah i think this is really important because not all oracles are created equal right some have um worse security assurances than others and so you really need the transparency there you need the abilities like not just what's the price of this asset but like what where did the price come from right and how is that secured i i expect we'll see many oracle attacks in the future and um you know we need this kind of transparency if we're going to continue to de-risk d5 which is what we're all after speaking of de-risking things you want to de-risk your cold storage actually it's not cold storage i guess it's warm storage but lattice is now integrated with metamask lattice is a hardware wallet that we've talked about on bankless read some articles about this earlier in the year on the lattice one hardware wallet it's a little bit different than a ledger so it's actually like a device that kind of sits on your desk has these these cards that you can plug into it and it's incredibly tamper resistant all right so if you're ever worried about you know somebody uh like i guess grabbing your usb stick ledger sort of thing and taking that and you know getting in latitude and that's a possible thing by the way it is a possible thing man that's another like it's podcast that's a possible thing to do it's really not possible with the lattice one this is like this is like the fort knox of uh wallet security anyway i call it the gringott's vault grange and small okay that's better for your harry potter gold uh they've integrated with metamask which is a long time coming and so now you can use your lattice wallet with metamask quite seamlessly it's fantastic that this is happening yep just increasing the potential security of your crypto assets the cool thing about the lattice is that you actually have to be physically around the thing in order to prove a transaction kind of like very much like a ledger but the idea is like your lattice it's like big enough where like you're not taking it with you like on an airplane like that thing sits in your home it's kind of like it it goes next to your like your amazon alexa right and so like you can go to your meta mask do something in defy press the approve button on your meta mask then you've got to go over to your to your lattice and then press the approve button there there's a number of other very cool things that can happen human readable transactions are really cool i think both ryan and i definitely believe that this is kind of the future of hardware wallets they just need more and more of these integrations to just become more and more usable and so this is that story here yeah absolutely they'll all get better over time uh speaking of getting better ave long time coming ave arc was like their institutional product uh now here it is i believe fire blocks has started up by providing services to all of fire blocks institutional clients in ave arc that's pretty cool to see anything you want to add here david yeah i want to add a take i was on the index co-op podcast and people were talk asking me about um is this just like taking the old traditional banking system and like now defy is just becoming permissioned and because you have to do kyc to get into ave arc and now like the institutions have their own like gated silo whether it's white can't play yeah it's white listing uh and so my answer to that is like well like you know is is defy just becoming the same system that it already was and the answer is no it's actually flipped on its head the world of defy is the more powerful version of what's going on here arc at arc by ave is a constrained version of defy everyone in there is a known entity all the institutions can know who the other institutions are so that they can be compliant but it's like the it's like the defy on training wheels it's like the d5 but protection the real d5 the wild d5 is the d5 with all of the power where you don't need kyc you don't need like to and so all of the cool aspects of defy are the things that are able to be used by individuals it's the constrained part of defy that is being given to the institutions because they need to be compliant which is the inverse of the relationship that we have in traditional finance where traditional finance is just like all right here's your robin hood and your bank account kids there you go but like all of the cool financial products are behind the scenes that you have to have a bunch of money to get into like goldman sachs and so this relationship is inverted in d5 yeah i i think that's a good take and like you know in general you can build permission systems on top of permissionless systems right but the inverse isn't true you can't build permissionless systems on top of permission systems right right and so this is just a permission system being built on top of the substrate of a permissionless financial system and that's the correct order of operations because we don't lose the permissionless aspect of it yeah yeah in the old world the bankers laugh at the individuals because we can't have access to the cool fun d5 products but in d5 we laugh at the institutions because we built the damn thing that's right uh all right what's this david this is uh my god is this a screenshot of the feature zapper um just a little bit of a release of a release very good tease that is coming guys the tools are getting better the user experiences are getting better it's all happening uh david let's switch from releases talk to some raises our friends at gemiini the winkleblast twins they just raised 400 million dollars what are they doing they're building a metaverse outside of facebook's walt garden i like that because you know winklevosses versus versus facebook who doesn't love that story winkleboss versus uh zuck doing this in the metaverse quite a big raise um there was rumor that gemini was going to ipo at some point in time i don't think this means that that's off the table now their valuation is 7.1 billion dollars though according this next raise so yeah pretty interesting stuff i know gemini is just doing all sorts of things beyond its exchange any other thoughts here yeah i just actually learned by reading this article that gemini the actual official company name is called gemini space station that's pretty cool what yeah i zoom up a little bit has it always been called that apparent new york parent company gemini space station llc valued at seven point one billion dollars yeah winklevich take it back to the zuck let's do this let's do this round two what about this david uh taking it to the music industry so this is royal now we had blau on justin blau who is uh you know dj you know fantastic artist and him in and of himself also an entrepreneur and he's starting this uh royal company to bring tokenized music and actually providing royalties attaching royalties to that this is kind of a um i guess a regulatory difficulty more than a technical difficulty they just raised 55 million dollars in a series a led by a16z to bring the music industry to crypto artists to crypto really cool crypto to the artists the same same same they also the lineup of music investors is also pretty impressive the chainsmokers kygo nas logic disclosure oh and also coinbase um yeah so like not only a16z but a fantastic lineup of really good artists but just picture how cool markets will get when rather than just having like a spotify style user interface like you can like look at the up-and-coming artist whom you love like you you just love their music and you're like dude no brainer i'm making a bet on this artix artist specifically and their like ability to generate future cash flows i'm gonna hit the buy button right it just turns we've talked about this before but it turns the music industry into a market it's like a stock market we can bet on different artists and it puts the artists in charge in control right because they are the ones actually producing the music it's not the uh the studios and the go-betweens and the middlemen um cool model if this can take off and be successful yeah and this is just a theme of ethereum at large right producing a financial market around everything to unlock the power of finance for the individual uh maybe there's some some people out there is like well like if you put money behind everything everything loses its meaning i think it's the inverse like you actually can can create meaning by putting financial markets behind everything teaching people how to actually be a financial participant because that education is very much needed in the world uh and if you just put like stock market's not for everyone but what about the music market like if you're a music person you want to like start to speculate on the music market maybe that's for you or like we're already doing the art market with nfts and this is a great educational tool to teach people about personal finances inside of the context that they are interested in do you ever find it somewhat ironic that like the way out of the crony capitalist system that we're in is actually more capitalist capitalism like hyper capitalism but like i'm not talking so some people hear capitalism and they get just this terrible exploiting workers they get this and i understand that right because but like this is uh individual self-sovereign capitalism this is like this is like think of think of this as the form of capitalism as go into your farmer's market right we have all of these local businesses these individuals coming together products with their crafts with their products pricing this like that's that's what we're talking about here we're not talking about big corporate machine suppressing the worker and the everyman and exploiting them okay that's a system we want to break out of but the way to break out of it is probably this way right yeah cap people confuse capitalism with with monopolies right the lack of existence of financial markets around music is because the music industry has captured it and not allowed it to happen right totally so this is the the birth of a whole entire new field that is fairer capitalism right the best way to fight it's literally fighting fire with fire like removing bad capitalism and replacing it with good capitalism yeah i i do think it's uh really important the way forward um crypto payment service moonpay they just raised 555 million from tiger and another firm so this is another fiat on-ramp david um i don't know if you have anything else to say about this other than that 3.4 billion valuation yeah the company was previously bootstrapped and profitable generating 100 million dollars in revenue so far this year which is pretty pretty good numbers lovely guys with these valuations out there with all these races going on is it about time you considered a job in crypto nice nice that was like that segway that's perfect seriously though get a job in crypto every time you hear about a raise that could be your money because that goes to hiring people that could not keep it they're not keeping it in a bank account they're not investing in crypto they're investing it in the growth of their companies growth of their protocols what do we got this week we have a community ecosystem lead at dydx the foundation a foundation based in switzerland by the way really cool stuff bitwise asset managers one of our favorites in the space from an asset management perspective they want an nft specialist they need a smart contract research analysts web 3 analysts they need a governance specialist imagine putting those job positions on your resume dex guru needs a head of growth technical lead at draft lee an accountant at smart d5 product manager at smart d5 as well get that head of ethereum research position down with immutable ahead of tokens at immutable as well dexable needs a community manager a lead engineer at hat stop finance community manager at iagranum can you manage a community you probably do it at egronum cto at egronum as well senior backend engineer smart defy blockchain technical cto as well at merit i'm out of breath dude uh there's a ton more just go check out the bankless job boards bankless.palette.xyz slash jobs hit subscribe and you can get these in your inbox as well and uh you'll hear about these again next week so all right but you will yeah uh unless you get a job and then you can ignore this part you can just fast forward david uh let's get to the news though that's some big news items let's start here this is the tweet that was hurled heard around the world around crypto trader yeah yeah that's true maybe i'm overstating things the abandoning ethereum tweet uh do you want to read this out yeah this is from the suzu through arrows capital we've had them on the podcast before sue says yes i have abandoned ethereum despite supporting it in the past yes ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past the idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burning concocting purity tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain is gross uh as you can imagine this was a very inflammatory tweet this was not the start of the drama this was probably the middle of it uh the story actually started earlier than this tweet this tweet was a reaction to like the earlier spats that happened uh and we're gonna recap all of it later on in this show i'm feeling attacked david the idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn is that what we were doing earlier in the market section of the show yeah he's talking about us he's talking about us that's not all we're doing okay right like we're talking about ethereum scalability we we spent a whole bunch of time during this show talking about like layer two and uh increasing transactions per second a lot more to say about that um one one of the things i think the ethereum community is doing is possibly a reaction maybe not maybe this wasn't due to the [ __ ] like the you know the twitter storms last weekend maybe this was unrelated maybe this is related more to gas fees but there is an eip proposal to reduce something called the call data function the gas price for the call data function on ethereum and this would be this would require a fork of some kind in the future but the net of this would be it would make roll-ups five times more efficient so five times less expensive in terms of gas fees roll-ups use their bottleneck their constraint from a gas perspective is this called data function so the idea here that's being proposed is that in the relatively near future we're talking the next three to six months um an ethereum network upgrade is is pushed out this could happen prior to the merge and would not necessarily delay the merge but it might delay it by a week or two a month it's a relatively small upgrade but it could have a big effect on roll-ups and what's interesting here is like the whole idea is that um ethereum is is almost like you know gas fees are taxes right and so like just like nation-state economies when you want to encourage some sort of behavior and discourage another use taxes to that for for that right it's like you want people to have more kids you reduce the taxes on kids if you want people to have fewer kids maybe you decrease the tax reductions right it's like you can control all of these things and this is ethereum as a network through their tax policy maybe saying we want to incent transaction activity on rollups by what by reducing taxes by making roll-up activity actually cheaper and increasing scalability that way that's why i think this is such an interesting proposal but there are more dynamics to this and there's definitely some controversy back and forth what are your thoughts on this yeah it's not an open shut case apparently this also adds a bunch of state bloat to the ethereum l1 which produces its own problems there's always trade-offs everywhere where it's not like we have this magical thing in the back of our pocket that we can just reduce gas fees on the layer 2 and have it just be oh i forgot about this thing that we had like no there's there's balances here so this is currently going through discussion um but uh it is aligned with the whole roll-up centric roadmap of ethereum where we prioritize uh transactions on l2 and de-prioritize transactional and transactions on layer one this is kind of interesting and here's uh here's what i feel like could be next i know we're going to talk about this more but what could be next is what we've seen is the eth community the ethereum community really pushback against this ethereum is abandoning its users sentiment coming from from zoo from sue and i think this is causing people to actually look deeper into ethereum scalability versus the unsustainability of some of the the alternative layer ones and the approaches they're pursuing um i i think it's also like causing the ethereum community to take a look at these gas tweaks right so like increasing uh reducing roll-up fees by 5x in the future what i think this could cause david is like other layer ones to start bleeding against eath as well and what's interesting i think about um you know uh three hours capital is they're just traitors so if that starts to happen if there's a momentum shift right if suddenly you know that the avas of the world and the souls of the world start bleeding into eath they'll get ahead of that they'll rotate right back into eth and i think what's funny is they'll start claiming credit for the for all of the above seen them see right yeah yeah uh pierre richard who was doing the whole eath supply gate thing like as soon as like oh you can't actually measure the eath supply and then a bunch of east devs took time out of their day to write a script for for calculating for measuring the east supply and then pierre rashard took credit was like look i made ethereum better by like complaining about it on twitter yeah so this has happened before uh yeah yeah this is the streisand effect right this is like um you know if you if you want the technical community to do something you just start like complaining right about it or you like blast it and you get really loud and they they get so angry that they're going to react and try to immediately fix it anyways we got to package that up for for the yeah so stay tuned for that uh what happened with the constitution doubt david this this met an interesting end yeah we have a brand new internet villain uh he was already an internet villain beforehand because citadel the citadel ceo of citadel is the hedge fund firm that called up robin hood and told him to stop trading this guy ken ken griffith i think kenneth kenneth griffin says uh i bought well he didn't say this he bought the constitution so the constitution dow raised like 40 million dollars to buy the constitution kenneth griffith raised 42 million dollars from himself to buy the constitution and then he bought it uh yeah so this one hedge fund vc guy bought the constitution instead of 17 000 members inside of a doubt oh the irony yeah like how could the story ends this way i was were you watching the sotheby's auction no i was okay yeah i was watching it in real time it was kind of interesting like it was thrilling to see i've never watched an auction all the way through and then like got to 40 million and it was somebody on one phone and somebody on another apparently it was ken griffin's people and versus the dallas people and they were just bidding up like a million at a time and suddenly the dow kind of ran out of its cash reserve and it's interesting because all of that was transparent right right so like if it feels like ken was paying attention he knew exactly how much the dow the max bid right yeah and so you said it but but the end of the day is the people's document the constitution went from one rich individual to another rather than the 17 18 000 people in the dow right which is quite interesting uh granted a dao has never proven that it's able to take care of like historical document right so like that is also an experiment is this is like a custody of a very important document yeah they wouldn't want to screw that up yeah that's kind of an interesting experiment i'm not sure if you want to run that right now oh well uh yeah it was interesting anyway but i think one of the most interesting byproducts was at sotheby's you saw eth listed with us dollars pounds euros yen all of the major currencies of the world as a denomination for bidding and this is anti-pro saying eath is money and this is a picture of sotheby's auction all the currencies bidding on this this fantastic art piece for 2.5 million dollars and you could buy it in eth you know what stands out to me on this one is like the denominations of everything like uh us dollar 2.5 million british pounds 1.8 million japanese what's the japanese currency i don't know yeah is it the end yeah japanese yen 285 million dollars uh a million yen million yen excuse me eat 619 like this is the difference between scarcity and not scarcity and it will be like 50 east potentially in a few years it's absolutely crazy like you can literally see the money printer here like all these fiat currencies with really really high numbers have a money printer behind them ether the really really low number there's a money burner behind it wow that's hilarious i've never thought about that um makes me wonder why you'd ever spend etho right there's another question about money uh david what's this uh mihailo of the the polygon team uh goes on twitter says dear uniswap community we have submitted a proposal to deploy uniswap v3 to polygon we firmly believe that this is the right moment for this deployment to happen for the reason explained in this proposal looking forward to your questions and feedback this has now since gone up to snapchat vote ryan let's take a peek at the snapshot vote and see where that vote stands do the uniswap uni token holders want uniswap v3 on polygon on the side totally against it we have 256 000 uni tokens voting yes on the no side we have 101 that's it 99.96 saying yes we want unit swap v3 on polygon unless some massive whale comes in with a really strong opinion about why it should be no looks like unit swap v3 will be deployed to polygon that's funny it's interesting the communities voted but like why not right isn't this good for uni token holders uh yeah not surprising the vote went that way but that's interesting to see what is uh cammie up to these days the infinite machine it's a book on my bookshelf back there it's a fantastic book about the birth of ethereum it's becoming a movie yeah look at that yeah cami russo says on twitter the infinite machine is becoming a movie the ethereum movie will of course be produced together with the ethereum community nfc is a fun production enable his audience to become participants cammie russo congratulations turning a book into a movie love it love it book into a movie uh what's uh tokamak doing okay this is xerox mackie who's been on the podcast before he's formerly one of the chefs behind uh sushi took up the reigns as the uh the first chief chef uh who's the guy that rugged chef know me chef know me yeah he he rugged the original sushi product uh product in d5 summer xerox mackie took up the reigns became a very beloved community member very like important developer behind the sushi product about a month ago stepped away from a lead dev role at sushi swap and now got picked up as tokamak's new chief strategy advisor uh toca mackie is apparently his new name will be our emissary to the greater d5 facilitating dow governance proposals integrations and expansions uh congratulations to mac very awesome acquisition of talent uh congratulations mackie for moving on to new new horizons uh if you want to learn what tokemak is we have a fantastic meet the nation with them on the bankless youtube yeah absolutely mackie becomes tokamaki i love that transition let's talk nft stuff david this is the first one the nfl is experimenting with nfts in a partnership with ticketmaster and they're deploying this on polygon crazy crazy really crazy what a world it's just an experiment at this point in time but that's how these things start it's just experiments right it's like just and polygon is a great place to test if you're going to test something you want to test it on like a a side chain of some sort right where transaction fees are low where there's no like high gas barriers to entry fantastic place to test things you know this is not going to be the end of things because the nba has a fantastic strategy for nft's partnership with coinbase uh they've also done some things obviously with flow nba top shots right and the nfl's got to be like we have all of these fans again it's the same question it's like they're already a disney boardroom yeah yeah we have all of these fans they're already buying stuff uh why don't we get them to buy digital stuff that's as simple as the conversation is right and so that's what they're doing they're starting with a polygon on that it's pretty big news i think yeah the sub caption is the league is exploring nft ticketing through the launch of its virtual commemorative ticket collection on the polygon blockchain tbd on what that actually means yeah uh first of many though first many experiments uh including time and they are all in on crypto it seems what's this time studios time magazine the emmy award-winning tv studio is partnering with pablo stanley i'm not sure who that is to create an original series based on robots so there is a robot profile picture nft project that's being spun up by time uh to develop animated children's series based on the robe roboto's uh animation so these are nfts of a children's tv show that's about robots and there's gonna be over ten thousand ot's yeah uh spun up by time some manatees the kids yeah hey you know what it's it's so funny how like um times square has basically become the place to like put the display yeah yeah looking like advertisement get the coke advertisements out of there and the nft and like advertisements why do people do this is it just like legitimacy it's just like fun legitimacy yeah it's a big flex how would it go i want to go to times square and see this yeah you want to put your turtle on time square right yeah how much did that cost me a lot more than your turn yeah but let me tell you that yeah yeah it's it's net accretive to the turtle community so uh maybe i'm willing to fund that public good huh more people need to know hillary if you put the turtle on times square that's not me uh maybe put a big logo of bank list in times square one day that yes that's cool let's do that yeah macy's launches a parade inspired nft collection for charity so macy's day floats coming out tomorrow i'll watch the macy's day parade sometimes in the mornings um they're doing nfcs now as floats what's going on yeah macy's will launch nfts in two phases first it's holding an auction for a set of 10 unique collectibles based on parade balloons throughout the decades the auction for these begin at midnight eastern time november 19th will run through the 30th and then around 10 a.m eastern time on november 25th that is tomorrow today for you the listener during the macy's day thanksgiving parade people will be able to claim one of 9 500 free nfts and also enter a sweepstakes to win ten thousand dollars nfts being mainstreamed this is the story that's the story here it's so funny the reason we included this story is because it's it's mainstream in a way that uh d5 could never be mainstream it's back to our example last week of jimmy fallon board apes right yeah you know getting people on jimmy fallon's far more interesting than god blossom kane warwick for instance or like stani from ave okay because this is like pop culture stuff it's just invading it's the trojan horse into mainstream macy's says the nfts which are erc 721 tokens are carbon neutral it is where okay nft platform suite which is built on the polygon blockchain so two things here built on polygon love it uh also again mainstream media focusing on the carbon neutrality of these things which happens you like they kind of need to pay attention to that because that's a big narrative uh the yeah for all the obvious reasons so let it be known the greater world cares about carbon neutrality don't tell them that polygon is uh also economically settled by ethereum burns gas which is right now proof of work uh backed don't tell them that well one footnote one day we'll be changing that soon but bitcoin has no plans to change from proof of work that's for sure let's talk about some bitcoin news el salvador is planning its first bitcoin city backed by bitcoin bonds apparently the bitcoin city is going to be located close to a volcano so that the you know geothermal activity can uh create energy to fund bitcoin mining facilities what is happening in el salvador they're going all in aren't they yeah they kind of feel like the michael sailor but like a country so yeah they are issuing bonds bonds i actually don't know the dollars they're issuing like six billion dollars worth of bonds in order to foster this uh city that's around the bitcoin mining volcano uh so yeah really just doubling down on the whole like bitcoin branding thing it's kind of it's kind of strange isn't it it's like bitcoin volcano city bonds yeah el salvador dictator leader like yeah it's a bit strange uh but bitcoin is very excited about this maybe this is uh the imf is not excited about it yeah imf is warning el salvador a bitcoin related risks in this new statement the imf is of course international monetary fund this is a collection of bankers these are the global banker elites uh and what do they say direct questions given bitcoins high price volatility its use as a legal tender entails significant risk to consumer protection financial integrity and financial stability you can just picture a banker kind of waving their finger at el salvador its use also gives rise to financial contingent liabilities that sounds like a threat because of these risks bitcoin should not be used as legal tender stamp your feet you know what the imf doesn't realize that the imf doesn't get to decide what money is right yeah they still think that they do and that to me is is interesting right using the whole volatility fund to talk to just you know undermine the legitimacy of bitcoin trying to strong-arm el salvador into not using bitcoin uh which is interesting using volatility fund and this is just the start right it's like if you see more countries start to adopt put your cryptocurrencies on their on their balance sheets man what's the imf gonna do right i can just see like the the archetype of uh el salvador just responding to the imf you know what i'm gonna do now i'm gonna use bitcoin even harder it's a little bit like that but i just get a crack out of these legacy institutions thinking they get to decide what money is the people do this is what chris john carlos said this is a social money is a social contract it's a bottom-up phenomenon it's not a top-down phenomenon if you think it is i guess you're to go like inflate your currency way it's like it's not going to work out well for you and the imf used my favorite euphemism uh consumer protection they kind of really mean incumbent protection that's what the imf does i mean like they should be worried about uh about fiat they should be worried about you know circumstances blowing up right yeah oops yeah um this is interesting this is uh 10 epic bitcoin mining photos from anthony popliano's newsletter and we just included this because it's such an interesting i think contrast right it's like i feel like lately david bitcoin is almost bifurcated from the rest of crypto right it's like the rest of crypto having these battles between ethereum and alternative layer ones over like scalability and talking about d5 talking about nfts it's like a different world and over here is like bitcoin and they're talking about volcano cities and el salvador and here's a picture of like 10 epic bitcoin mining photos they are this is they are very epic i guess in it like uh yeah i don't know are like the fact that three sizes of these things they're big they're they're gigantic but like when i see these pictures uh personally my reaction is like hmm are these necessary like i just like i when we have proof of stake this looks like waste to me right personally totally and it's yeah i think bitcoiners they see these facilities all over the world like big facility in china big facility in norway big facility in montana and they see that they see decentralization right they see hardcore investment into bitcoin into energy production all over the world and they see decentralization uh can i can i show you my my my equivalent um my equivalent to a bitcoin mining farm but for proof of sake yeah do you have a picture here it is can you show me this is this is this is my equivalent this is like here's go go for the juxtaposition go down to one of the like the big mining operations this is my favorite one because this looks like yeah okay here here's here's my equivalent of for proof of steak it's right here in my hands i'm holding it up that's your capital it's got a battery yeah yeah that's your cap that's your that's your validator that's your mining equipment for the listeners yeah uh well okay so like uh we're staking right now on rocket pool yup from a raspberry pi yep that's running running uh ethnos and a validator right it's like like bankless is doing that right yeah so like the the two versions of the future are ahead of us like one is these big and maybe they can co-exist over the long term i don't really think so but like one of these big big mining farms all over the world like connected to some sort of energy source bitcoiners will say like the the mining incentivizes the energy production and that that's cool and so like you know big these big big facilities versus the proof of stake which is everyone's got their like their home laptop staking on ethereum it's using the the idle resources of your computer in the background like and it's everywhere all over the world the tokens don't actually exist anywhere unlike the bitcoin mining units the asics uh and so like if this computer if i drop this computer and it breaks i can just like you know move the tokens to a different computer it doesn't actually exist physically in the world like what version seems more futuristic to you they both seem very futuristic but they also look like very different futures they do right it's like uh these asics that we're looking at these like you know data centers full of these asics these specialized mining uh computers basically um you know ether is just a virtual asic yep it's just a virtualized version of an asic when you stake it uh yeah and i'm just struck lately david by like the bifurcation kind of narratives like crypto is kind of split into into two pieces two cultures uh two cultures tale of two cultures here this is interesting too i feel like every week uh another athlete is deciding to take their salary in bitcoin so this is uh odell beckham jr from the rams taking a salary in bitcoin um yeah i guess we'll see more of that too that's the story that's what was going on in bitcoin uh felt a little different than what's going on the rest of the crypto space uh particularly this week but what's going on the regulatory front is citigroup is appointing a new head of digital assets it's eyeing a hundred new hires as well on digital assets so the banks coming to the table as we knew they would a little bit late but realizing they have to get on this crypto thing before it eats their lunch any thoughts here yeah where are they gonna find a hundred really good crypto hires oh they don't have to be really good sir like they're they're like they could just be not very good well that's kind of what i'm saying right like if you want to have good crypto like products you need to hire crypto native people otherwise like how can you advise on where the product should be built where are they gonna find a hundred qualified crypto people look at our drops board like those are the coolest crypto jobs of all time like people going to go there first before they go to city group like oh i'm super passionate about crypto i want to help build out the world of crypto where should i go city group i don't think these positions are going to attract the crypto natives right i think these positions are going to track the you know corporate people who are interested in kind of the next big thing right the products that are going to be determined by the people that they hire right so if they don't hire crypto natives then the products that come out as a result of these things are going to be different i am so skeptical that uh crypto banks are going to be able to actually develop any interesting crypto products one exception so far this exception to the role has been fidelity in my mind correct yes which is like they're crushing it but they started as crypto native believers like six years ago right uh yeah we'll see what happens but they're definitely coming to the table i i expect we'll see a lot of uh acquisitions yeah personally so i think these banks will acquire crypto companies as their way forward uh tetherfud tetherfud yeah uh things are heating up for tether the u.s senate sent a letter for requesting immediate information about their backings redemption process and activities due to several market integrity concerns tether has been given 10 days to respond uh tether has been probed like this before and has come out on the other side of these things like completely clean but i feel like this is just going to keep on happening until the end of time the set it yeah this is coming from that committee on banking housing and urban affairs the same uh committee that did that whole like cryptocurrencies what are they even good for uh this is probably one of their action items right yeah it's like we got to investigate that other thing yeah um yeah another another week more tether fud it's it's held up the thing about tether though is you don't know what's behind it right because it's not you can't view source right you can't like open source code it's not defy so i understand the concerns i just like not a big deal in my mind um what's biden doing okay oh this is uh i guess maybe a quick drive by is uh powell is named as the fed chair again so pre-appointed as the fed chair so i think the existing policy is going to continue into the future the i think this uh the general gist that i've gotten about this news is that like people are just going the fed is going to likely continue to be uh warm towards money printing i think that's that's the gist i've gotten yeah absolutely it doesn't look like a restrictive policy what's this david somebody is doing together because uh the pool together branded as a no-loss lottery well the guy lost money because of gas fees uh so this guy is suing pooled together because he didn't get his money back because of gas fees and so he sent in 25 dollars of usdc received 25 tickets of usdc and pulled together and then had a gas payment of 161 dollars therefore the person is effectively paying 186 dollars for 25 and pulled together lottery tickets and is now suing pull together for being a no-loss lottery but having uh but having to pay the gas fees like it's completely nonsensical but don't you like isn't this only worth like whatever he paid and even the best case he wins he gets 200 back this is like small claims court stuff yeah this is weird we need like judge judy for crypto right who by the way conspiracies about this that's your conspiracy oh it's it's a great news story to to advertise how high gas fires uh how high gas fees on ethereum are here here's another one i don't know if you saw this it's it's kind of buried in the thread here uh he's gravely con this is from the um uh the the actual notice here he's gravely concerned that the cryptocurrency ecosystem which requires the use of enormous amounts of electricity is accelerating climate change and allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam customers god what a [ __ ] [ __ ] well it's like but another like conspiracy theory would be right this entire thing was just built to right actually say that last sentence there which is like cryptocurrency is bad destroying the climate allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam consumers that might be the reason for this case not the two hundred dollars or you know twenty-five dollars and eric connor he lost eric connor follows up this thread saying he should see sue the ceo of ethereum he should do that he should do that last thing for news david uh binance smart chain validators are threatening to dump the chain and move on i don't know if you've read this thread on get github but it is an absolute [ __ ] show dude yeah it's pretty big they are they're upset what's happening yeah somebody who is apparently at bsc validators goes in the github for buying smart changes guys seriously wtf this is a blockchain with supposedly billions of value yet it is governed and developed like the project of a stoned teenager i've rarely seen some things handled so unprofessionally there is no code review patches are simply committed in most cases even without a proper description of what they do or what problem they're trying to solve there doesn't appear to be any reasonable testing in place every update seems to make things worse there's zero responding to bug reports hundreds of people report non-syncing no's or nodes falling out of sync response from the developer zero there's a list of other complaints apparently binance smart chain is not treating their their smart chain as the billion dollar network that it is uh and you know it's apparently the validators are very upset about it well uh fork of death and then they're just like increasing lazy block limits until the thing falls over right and i've heard we have more to say and we're going to come back with the takes and i think we're going to start with this uh this twitter drama again this abandoning ethereum thread got to pick back up on that give our thoughts give some takes around the twitter sphere as well but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible matcha everyone's favorite decks aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eath and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on mantra is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets living a bankless life

ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space all right guys we are back with the takes of the week let's start here where we left off in the news there was this tweet abandoning ethereum ethereum abandoning its users this is suzu from a16z david do you want to just set the stage like what what's the context for this before we give some of our takes and then the takes from around the community yeah so suzu is kind of like the the starting like really started this whole thing off but suzu is a member of three hours capital uh we've had three rows capital on the show before right during like the the peak of the may run uh where ether was like breaking all-time highs into the four thousand uh four thousand uh dollar range and there was like the whole like flipping narrative had them on the show three hours capital they are traders they trade on narratives they make big big moves uh over like maybe a couple months to half a year to year long time time horizon moves um and they just they just trade and trade bitcoin really good at it they're really good at it yeah they've been doing it for a long time yes yeah they move markets they literally have billions and billions of dollars uh and so people people pay attention to what these guys say because you know when you're whoever's got a billion dollars like captures a bunch of attention especially when they have the track record that they do lately since the last like maybe six months or so they have heavily been promoting uh avalanche on twitter and this is what they do this is the classic like this is what a lot of people do in this industry and not even in inside this industry especially in this industry but also even in the the legacy industry people funds do this hedge funds do this goldman sachs does this they fill and then they shill what that means is that they fill their bags and then they talk about their like they goldman sachs will like take a position on something and then they'll publish some like price targets it's really them just like pumping their bags right you remember when cuban came on mark cuban he was like uh get long then get loud yes that's his mantra for investing same thing yeah so this is this is a common activity uh it's it's annoying to some people in the industry because some people have different time horizons than like trades over three months to a year some people are looking at this industry 10-year long time horizons and so trading in the short term is just meaningless and that actually is i think the juxta really the through line behind all of the drama that happened here's ryan selkis summed it up people thinking five months out arguing with people thinking five years out the story of most debates on crypto twitter so really that kind of frames this whole conversation meanwhile uh suzu kyle davies really like pumping the hell out of avalanche uh the the kind of the idea the a conspiracy about why they're doing this is that they missed the solana run uh yet they saw avalanches like the next uh obvious target for a similar run on the heels of solana uh and so started like pumping pumping like avalanche really really hard if they get loud they can kind of make it a self-fulfilling prophecy they can kind of make it happen if they get enough people to believe it yeah like suzu has like half a million uh followers on twitter kyle davies has a couple hundred thousand as well if people pay attention to these things and they have consistently been pumping salon avalanche and like the ethereum community like tolerates this sort of behavior like they know like a lot of people like they don't like it but like this is part of the game they understand that traders gonna trade it's different when a lot of especially a lot of these eat killers start actively flooding ethereum with just straight up false information and misinformation and then also start to attacking some of the actual like purpose and meaning of the builders and what they're building and that is what happened here uh kane from kane warwick started off uh kind of started this thing off saying a lot of people i respected earlier in this cycle have sold out in pursuit of profit maximalism chasing opportunistic gains at the expense of their reputation remember this when they all come flooding back to the ethereum ecosystem once l2 scaling becomes inevitable so kane isn't just talking just about theo's capital he's talking about just like the cohort of people that do this right that and to be fair didn't name three hours didn't name anyone by saying right this in general just saying in general like like this this is relevant to three hours capital but is relevant to a lot of people in this space who trade on narratives and not on fundamentals and that's another dividing line between like the debates like people who trade on narratives or people who trade on fundamentals uh and so i i in the article i say um what happens next is that suzu responds to this tweet claiming hypocrisy due to cain warwick selling a position of his snx tokens to purchase 50 million dollars of real estate in australia across two different properties i believe uh and so we have this billionaire trader who's like doing the whole filled and chill thing uh being critiqued by kane warwick who is uh not a billionaire but might be kind of close definitely upwards of 500 million uh and these two like very wealthy people going after it one claiming uh that the other one is like dishonest and illegitimate right um and and so uh kyle uh suzu if you want to scroll up a little bit ryan uh suzu says you literally chose the worst scaling solution possible for your users to defend your own eath bags therefore making your own community actually poor now you have the audacity to insult anyone not as east-tarded as you uh good for you is what suzu said to kane so very very spicy is that is that good for you does that go f yourself oh that's go after yourself that's good that's what it yeah i kind of made that up on the spot i didn't really know what it was go after yourself yeah okay and then kane responds to sue the fact that you can't see the distinction between hedging your exposure to crypto in an alternative asset and turning into the shill of a competing l1 is bizarre i know you're smarter than this so i'm assuming this is just an emotional response and so like that was just that was day one of fighting a lot of like there was many many threads a lot of like other conversations that happened as a result of this many people in the comments uh everyone has to weigh in on this everyone's got a weigh-in yeah that was just day one uh day two a little bit over 24 hours later this is a last saturday uh suzu tweets out yes i have abandoned ethereum despite supporting it in the past yes ethereum has abandoned its users despite despite supporting them in the past the idea of sitting around jerking off while watching the burn and concocting purity tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain is gross and these are some strong words where ethereum has abandoned its users that goes to the heart of so many eth devs both on the l1 and on all the l2 research that has been going on the whole the whole concept of rollups is something that was funded by the ethereum foundation to independent researchers to figure out the scaling problem and suzu's coming in and saying ethereum has abandoned its users because it refuses to juice up the l1 in order to compromise on decentralization in order to actually create scale enough to fit everyone so this is what it begs the question what does abandoning users actually mean right it's like are you by centralizing the thing is that the worst abandonment of users yes in my mind abandoning decentralization is the abandonment of the individual because decentralization and individuals go hand in hand that's a topic for a different day but you also said something oh i actually kind of did say that so maybe that's a topic for right now it's relevant so i follow up with this uh to this zoo tweet uh saying suzu abandoning decentralization is the biggest sin that you can commit in this space it's easier to fix fees than it is to fix decentralization a lot of people didn't really like that sin word however i did choose it extremely precisely but that is a kind of a larger elaboration point which i won't go into here i definitely got my fair share of flack for this tweet because people were throwing poo left and right on these twitter threads um uh and the but the majority of the critiques was that i was making the assumption that anything that's not ethereum is quote not decentralized and that i'm co-opting the word decentralization to only mean ethereum well the thing is avalanche is a blockchain that is absolutely it's a fork of death and it's just pushing the limits it's just like juicing up how much throughput that you can actually have on the chain to the point where like if they add any more the chain falls apart and they know this because they have had to cap the number of validators that can validate the chain because if there's too many nodes not enough nodes can sync up to the chain and it causes the chain to just uh fork off and not be able to have consensus the literally the network topples over and we saw the same exact phenomenon happen with solana when it went down for 17 hours like it got too juiced and the name the network just froze because they just pushed it to the limits too much we were just talking earlier about binance smart chain right all the issues that validators are having with binance marching is because like big blocks and it becomes more centralized and possible to run until the entire thing not only centralizes but then falls over right so these all these same eth killer chains what they are really doing is they are just pushing the limits on network throughput up to the point of instability and then not going actually any further right just like yeah no it's unstable but not quite yes not all of them get to that point of instability but all of them like get to the point where yeah your macbook pro can no longer run an actual non-validating node right it has to be in a data center it has to be a big strong beefy machine and they say that's okay they say that's fine and ethereum says no that's not fine that is centralization that is the exact thing that we're fighting that is the old system we want a more decentralized system here yeah it really goes and and i'm going to make a video or something about this later but like it really goes like is the network separating its participants into two classes of citizens the people that can validate the system and the people that are just users of that system because that that is like there's a lot to unpack there but let's go let's go back through the story um and i and i kind of add some context in this um in this post that i put out on monday the ethereum community is known for its inclusiveness inclusivity and its openness the culture this culture of inclusivity came out as a reaction to the closed-mindedness and maximalism fostering of bitcoin culture that eventually pushed vitalik out of a bitcoin and many many other future ethereums out of bitcoin circles and ultimately those people ended up gravitating towards ethereum because that was ethereum was a reaction to the uh lack of inclusivity of bitcoin this openness and acceptance of ethereum is a very important part of ethereum culture but it's also a double-edged sword bitcoiners have learned to make very firm hardline stances where ethereans have been more willing and accepting and trusting of new ideas new people and new efforts this has allowed ethereum as a community to grow but it also lets wolves come in wearing sheep clothing in 2018 to 2020 ethereum did not have a spine during this time bitcoiners actually set the narrative of what ethereum was and the theorem as a community was just a complete pushover it's actually ryan here that made this big uh flag in the ground i think around 2019 saying eath is money yo fun fact ryan sean adams made the ethos money meme because it was a reaction because all the bitcoiners like isn't money uh bitcoin's money and like and we started like no ethan's money and we actually started to grow a spine as a reaction to all the bitcoin or fud that happened with ethereum and now it says sotheby's by the way now it's something and so this this culture that we've had with ethereum actually standing up for himself is completely different now and this is what happened in reaction to suzu's tweet we have uh hayden adams saying no issue with l1s that prioritize immediate scaling over decentralization many users want this but this is a really bad take incredibly insulting to everyone working on eth2 and layer twos especially from someone who has gained extraordinary wealth off the backs of ethereum builders uh sierra capital is a massive investor in starkware who we just had on the show and though they are working on scaling ethereum so like this whole like narrative shenanigans on twitter it's just like such not just three hours capital too um you know uh multi arthur yeah the multi-coin yeah definitely capital it's like it's like divine capital was a big investor in synthetics in the early days and made like a lot of money on their d5 bets with synthetics right carry on defiance capital is a capital firm that was bankrolled by three years capital uh uh sazel anthony cesano says ethereans were born in the fud molded by it we saw survived a brutal bear market and came out stronger than another we're not going to sit back and let [ __ ] be spread around ethereum we're going to fight back with everything you got dc investor says project teams i strongly recommend you stop giving allocations on your cap table to funds who don't give a flying f about the ecosystem you are building in or the goals you are trying to achieve money is plentiful in this space you always have the option exa the the last tweet here eric connor i loved how fired up crypto twitter gets when the ethereum community actually decides to defend itself every day ethereum killers just [ __ ] misinformation on ethereum sometimes you have to defend sell us your eth at 4 400 then go f off and like the interesting thing that i think is really cool about this story is what i'm calling the critique chain uh this is the pattern that we see going on right now the ethereum community is critiquing the ethereum killers in the same way that bitcoiners critiqued ethereum back in the day a centralized blockchain that only a few people could run nodes on early insiders got an outsized allocation of funds building an ecosystem on empty promises these are the same critiques but now it's just different communities pointing these critiques at other different communities so it makes sense when avalanche and solana community looks towards the ethereum community and sees the same things that ethereum see in bitcoin the incumbent chain wants to spin the narrative that every other chain is as centralized as a vc chain the disrupter chain wants to spin the narrative of the lazy loss that plot elitists who no longer care about the values they originally reported these critiques just get passed down the line right so what is actually true what is actually true okay so so all of this here's the critique david all of what you just said it sounds like you're an ethmaxy that's what they would say they would say you are like doing the same thing that bitcoin maximalist did previously and saying the only money is bitcoin the only chain is bitcoin everything else is just like a [ __ ] coin everything else is garbage right now you are saying that ethereum's way is the only way is this what you're saying and like ethereum equals decentralization both are the same but like these other chains are redefining what decentralization actually means and your view is too narrow you are an ethereum maxim so what do you say to that critique um yeah so they're they're what i say to that critique is there are twofold um there's two things that are really really important about our network who's got all of the tokens and who can run the chain those are the two like variables that are really important when it comes to decentralization and so what what is actually true about this uh someone is right in these criticisms about like you've gone too far down the centralization spectrum and so i think that bitcoiners bitcoin maxis are wrong about ethereum they say like ethereum's got this pre mine it had all these insiders the ethereum pre-sale was an open permissionless censorship resistant non-kyc pre-sale that's that sold 60 million of the 72 total million ether to over 9 000 participants on day one and raised 14 million dollars for funding of that 12 million that was left over half went to the ethereum foundation to fund development and that has um uh part of that like that ef like it just pays client teams plays for research it gave starkware a four million dollar grant to fund zk roll up technology which now powers immutable so rare dydx and which three hours capital is an investor in uh and so like a lot of these the half of the 12 million that wasn't sold to the public went to funding operations like this the other half went to like the ethereum co-founders and early contributors like vitalik joe lupin mahali a bunch of other people this sounds like distant past though like so somebody could argue like okay you know so what it's distant past like what you know um replace i i guess distribution distribution is less is more concentrated with a solano or avalanche or layer one but it'll get less it'll get more distributed over time right it's like eventually some of these people who made a lot of money are gonna actually sell it'll just get more decentralized everything you just talked about for a lot of people they weren't there in those early days so they didn't benefit from the crowd sale or any of the upside right so like what about that are you just i mean you're just saying that the centralization line starts stops at ethereum right the decentralization line stops at ethereum these people are saying no it's actually we could go a little further we'd go to avalanche we could go to solana and that that's fine right so on the spectrum of things like salon and avalanche are way more decentralized than like your typical commercial bank like they are on the decentralization spectrum but the difference between the ethereum pre-sale and the uh vc-backed avalanche and solana chains is that the the genesis event for the solana tokens and avalanche tokens was only given to insider vcs right and so where the ethereum pre-sale was open and permissionless the actually having upside to the very beginnings of this network was reserved for already heavily financially capitalized investors you saw the people on the all-in podcast the four billionaires who like are on this big flex fest talking about their massive solana bags and how they made a billion dollars that was it wasn't open to the public and the first impressions for these chains are really really important because they create the culture downstream and so this is also where the actual system device design of the blockchains also impacts this where the centralization of the difficulty of running a node also restricts who can actually verify the chain and so these things tilt towards centralization over time only a few people were able to have early access to the tokens only a few people can run the chain and so the the centralization is double is twofold right there's too many people to with early bag holders owning the bags and then there's too few people that can actually validate the chain one of the beautiful things about ethereum's version of proof of stake and also having a proof of work phase prior to that is that there's been this massive distribution event because everyone can run the chain i started off with mining ethereum that my first ether that i ever got i got from mining it's myself as an individual because i have the power to do that because of the design of the network of ethereum that is not true for avalanche that's not true for solana you need to have very significant beefy hardware you need to have knowledge with how to run a system like this because it's complicated and then you also need to have a significant supply of the tokens in order to stake on these delegated proof of stake systems and so it's it's it's really about what culture are you instilling in your chain from day one are you instilling a culture of decentralization or are you instilling a culture of pumping the bags of the insiders and restricting the ability for the average individual to run a node or to have access to the upside and so this is the difference that like and i don't ever want to like tell someone that they can't go use these systems this is not a conversation about the users if you are a user of avalanche and if you are a user of solana and you are happy that is great we are not talking about you we are talking about the people that are building these systems and and are not thinking about the long-term consequences of decentralization in five to 10 to 50 years yeah so so here's the thing dave it's like it's for for me it's not even um it's not even that these other chains exist on another point of the decentralization spectrum like that is totally fine i think we should we have we should have a rich spectrum of you know centralized things you know side chains and crypto banks exchanges you know a more fintech type of chains uh and then we should have things like a dissent you know decentralized bitcoin and ethereum kind of on the other end of the spectrum what kills me is like the decentralization theater right it's it's the pretending to be a thing that you're not it's it's a world where you're pretending there are no trade-offs it's a world with in suzu's original tweet where it's like avalanche cares about users because it has low gas fees right now and ethereum doesn't because it has high gas fees right now right without acknowledging or recognizing the trade-offs it's the deception that kills me yes okay it's like the deception the descendants yeah the deception and deception in pursuit of um bag pumping in pursuit of wealth yes right from people who are already exceptionally wealthy the wealthiest people exceptionally well and it's just this gets back to like why we're here and the responsibility that we have right as early settlers in these strange new lands like we're here first and i feel very strongly that we have a responsibility to future generations to get this whole thing right because we have one shot at it okay it could be five years ten years come to pass like i think crypto is inevitable blockchain is like this whole thing is inevitable what's not inevitable is that on the other side of this we have a decentralized open permissionless money system that part is not inevitable what could very much happen is on the other side of this crypto transformation we make a whole bunch of new bankers super wealthy and they're just new bankers that again control the masses you know clamp things down and extract become rent extractors right that's not i so i think the people in the space who are here now actually should be held to a higher standard right and like they should acknowledge and accept the responsibility i get if you're like if you're a trader you're just here you're trying to make money you're profit maximalist that's okay too like we need profit maximalist in this space too you you know you're a mercenary okay they're they're settlers they're mercenaries you're a mercenary that's fine but if you can't get sufficient that's a valuable contribution that's valuable but like acknowledge you're a mercenary don't try to pretend you're a settler right and like actually be a mercenary that's what pisses me off and i think that's why this tweet you know caught caught fire right so it's like it's not it's it's not really about the users is it and yeah that's that's that's why i think this tweaked a lot of people yeah so sue is trying to brand himself as like oh i care about the users and ethereum people don't because i'm promoting avalanche which actually has a blockchain that has cheap fees also in the in the last like week or so avalanche usage has actually gone up to where a uni swap trade cost twenty dollars i saw i saw a uni swap trade costs 20 a lot of these things have cheap fees because they're not being used right and so like not only is there a deception about like the intentions but it's also just straight-up deception as as the actual innovations that are happening on these chains you don't get to just call the fact that you spun up a chain and it has had empty blocks for the last two years innovation because there's cheap fees and this hazu had a really good take about this where he said truth be told other than choosing different points on the decentralization cost spectrum what 10x useful improvements have other layer ones made in the last four years and so a lot of frustration out of the ethereum community is that avalanche again which is just a fork of geth we already have geth avalanche forked it juiced up the block sizes and then called it innovation right and and sure there is demand for that especially when ethereum fees are like 200 to do anything on the layer one of course there's going to be demand for that but what you don't get to say is that you haven't compromised on decentralization and you care about users and caring about users a point is really really an important point because if you are not able to run your node you are the product it's the same thing with facebook and and the whole web 2 paradigm if you are the product like the users are the product and so if you can't run a node you are some banker's product and that is the difference between a fully decentralized system where users are self-sovereign and everyone is equal versus a compromise system where only a few people can run a node and it's not you yeah and you know i'd remind people because a retort to that is like well most people don't run their own nodes do they when they press a button on metamask right it's like no they don't but they have the option to having the ability to incredibly important having the option to leave the system or to verify the system for yourself make sure that you have the same amount of power that everyone else has right it's like i don't uh i don't vote in every single election like i try to vote in all the major elections but i don't vote in every single election but having the ability to vote in elections is the thing i want preserved in my governance protocols right if you can't run a vote you have if you can't run a node non-validating node you have no vote you have no ability to say which which uh block is valid and which is not you know which which uh upgrade is valid and which is not and it removes power from the user base anatoly the ceo of uh of uh solana said that salon is objectively decentralized which is already an oxymoron because you can't actually measure decentralization therefore you can't objectively be decentralized it's always subjective at the end of the day uh but then paulina responds to this claim that salon is objectively decentralized saying ah yes objective decentralization like giving half of the token supply to insiders creating a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism so that they can rule over it and making it so expensive that it's not a trustless network with only validators and a few users running nodes to defend against validator attacks like this is the difference between the network topology of ethereum and the network of the topology of some of a chain that has just juiced up the validator so that not everyone can run the node um and then there was a lot of ethereum developer pushback against the whole abandoning the users thing and the thing with the thing the power about layer twos is that if you want to compromise on decentralization you can do that on a layer two and you can literally port the avalanche blockchain the solana blockchain onto a layer two and and then retain all the decentralization compromises that you've already made and even be able to have an even more cheap and more throughput environment yet you also still get the center the decentralization and security that ethereum has prioritized and so this is also something that really frustrates the ethereum people is that like you have this this side chain of avalanche where you can port from ethereum to the avalanche l1 using a bridge but that bridge could have been turned into a cryptographically secure roll-up and have a avalanche be rolled up on ethereum and have that be much more secure and retain decentralization but they didn't do that because pumping l1 tokens is way easier especially when you just give them to people like give the tokens to three hours capital at the genesis of the of the whole entire chain in order to get this like pay for the mercenaries that you like bootstrap this fake community around it same thing that happened to solana like if you can't generate a community yourself give your tokens to multi-coin capital they'll do it for you right and so this is kind of where a lot of ethereum people get frustrated like you're compromising on decentralization when you could have just been done a roll up and you're making it an l1 because you need people to invest in your chain and because the community wasn't going to do it anyways in the first place like this is where a significant amount of frustration for me comes from too yeah i i do think there's a lot of it i i you know i want to be careful though because like i think that one thing that i don't think you're saying is that these other chains don't have like communities or users or this sort of thing right they they didn't first they didn't lead with that yeah but they're talking after there's like a question of like um yeah so you know many of these chains have you know developers they have activity they have they have a lot of things that are getting built on them yes i mean solana has a fantastic wallet for example the phantom wallet which is you know arguably a better wallet experience than what ethereum has today like there's some stuff getting built out in these chains right it's like whether the asset justifies everything that's getting built out or not is is maybe a different question and so like uh from a user perspective i think going back to that points like users should feel free to use whatever solution they feel like go use robinhood if you want go use coinbase if you want go use a side chain go use polygon go use avalanche go use solana if you want just use whatever you want so like there's no judgment here the wrath i think is coming from people who are just exploiting retail investors on short run narratives that they actually know don't have sustainable longevity and they're flooding projects that are taking the slower more difficult decentralized route that's where it goes off course right that's where people get frustrated and i you know i i hope that comes through so like let's uh let's talk about some other reactions uh from the community so what is cyrus saying here yeah cyrus says demand for cryptocurrency has greatly outpaced the technology given the macro climate vcs and other financial opportunists have found a way to monetize this imbalance by shilling centralized change to satiate the demand from retail to save face they claim that they are offering experimental alternatives with credible decentralization decentralization plans dubious eth maxis as a combination of a true passion for decentralization and b their bags are fighting back against this narrative when eth or even btc for that matter given its status as the only other reasonably decentralized coin finally scales literally every single one of the opportunists will be back this is all short-term monetization plan due to the difficulties in actually scaling this tech i'm skeptical anyone actually thinks these centralized chains are the future if they do end up being fully decentralized then i guess the ethereum community was wrong place your short and long-term bets accordingly that's a very rational take that's a great summary of what just happened yeah here's another one uh polynya crypto twitter is like an equestrian club from um 1885. a bunch of spoiled and i don't even know that word irascible irascible brats squabbling over whose horse is the fastest meanwhile a gentleman called carl benz was building this contraption called the automobile he's referring to zk roll ups and that is right brats that's in the 1885 uh terminology there yeah uh what about this take this is you this is the one to round it all out and i say we are fortunate to be alive during a pivotal moment in human history the choices we make here and now will have outsized impact upon future generations that use these systems we must knowingly take on this responsibility and i think this is something that really divides crypto into two camps it's people that understand that the choices we make will have impacts upon our kids and our kids kids and our kids kids kids and so we need to make sure that we make the right choices for them today because these things will ossify little did i know when i signed up for facebook in high school that facebook would be causing civil wars 10 like 10 15 20 years down the line or swaying the actual election of the united states of america i didn't know that when i signed up for facebook but this is my favorite quote from from the cypherpunk's manifesto is that cypherpunks understand that the code they write impacts the people that use it and so we need to make sure we have a very small window of opportunity to actually make sure that these systems that we are designing are people first now and for forever and there's a lot of people who the profit maxis out there that are trading they're they're doing whatever they're gonna do it's the profit maxis that trade on the try to like make this their narrative too while they apply it to their bags that don't actually resemble this straight this narrative they know that this is true they know that with the decisions we make are critically important right now and then they say that they are making those same choices on the on some things that's actually compromised and actually decentralized that is inexcusable in my mind yeah do you do you know what's funny is i you know write this in a newsletter bankless newsletter it's supposed to be sort of a crypto investor newsletter and this is supposed to be a crypto investor podcast but we are not actually profit maximalists right we're not which is like sacrilege to say in in in some circles i think somebody like at three hours capital you know susu is like uh why aren't you prophet max bliss you should be right right but it's like there are things that are more important than making money in this space and one of the things that i think we care deeply about and bankless keeps cares deeply about is that we actually create a bankless money system for the world that's a decentralized property right system for the metaverse right this is our opportunity and so close like if we get it right there's literally it's like literally a fork in the road we get it right we've got a fantastic future ahead of us if we get it wrong well it's going to be a repeat of the broken kleptocratic system that we see in the physical world except in the metaverse it might be even worse than the metaverse right so like i feel a tremendous amount of responsibility to get this right it's like people are gonna get super wealthy along the way like you're gonna do great holding these ideals right because you're here early you're building the future you're not going to be as wealthy as the pure pro profit maximalist but like how do you measure wealth right it goes back to how do you measure wealth is it just about your your you know um net worth is that the only measure of wealth or you actually care about like the systems that you're building and the economic value that you create for the world around you uh it's it's incredibly important this is like back to you know it's it's more like the 1780s than you know the 1980s or the 1990s right because we're creating a constitution here we're creating a governance protocol and it's it's incredibly important we get the balance of power the decentralization right because people are literally going to be living on top of the systems that we're building today into the future so we're not profit maximalist night you know i don't make apologies for that i think you know the bankless program is like more rewarding than just profit maximalism like you'll do fine i think people historically have done really well uh you know on bank list and on this journey but it's not optimized for making the most money possible at all times in the market there's a crypto is a reaction to the current status quo it's a reaction to the 2008 crisis it's a reaction to the incumbency and it's because people feel disenfranchised and left out of the system that they feel more and more aligned with crypto because crypto's more inclusive if we and the goals of making a decentralized system that is benefits our kids is is i'm not i'm not a prophet maxie but i want the most amount of wealth to be created over the long term i want my kids to be able to have financial upsides from the crypto industry and i want their kids to also have financial upsides on the crypto industry but if we create another system that the population has a reaction to because of the incumbents and because of the the capture then this system is going to break down and so this is about uh focusing on decentralized decentralization now means that our kids can prosper and our kids kids can prosper in a fair and equitable system man let's get to it the end what are you excited about this week oh gosh that was long yeah let's get let's get looking forward into the future i'm excited about all the future conferences that are coming uh right after thanksgiving i'm going to uh miami for art bazel hanging out with the optimism team there as well as nate mohler the artist that i bought all those nfts from that i'm looking at right on my my new tv nfc display thing right over my shoulder really really cool uh soap for that and then i go straight to puerto rico for metaverso for puerto rico blockchain week also for the pleaser dow retreat that's going to be fantastic in 2022 we got eth denver coming in february that east denver's home is going to be amazing bankless live podcast maybe maybe and then right after that in may in permissionless in florida where we are throwing the the bankless event with the permissionless team permission uh excuse me with a block works team throwing a permissionless conference where ryan and i meet for the first time just a lot of cool events on the horizon so i'm looking forward to all of them yeah that's awesome man uh you're counting me out for eat denver i haven't quite decided i might go i still might go i don't know we'll see it's pretty cold though it is very cold i'll believe it when i see it you know me i guess all right ryan what are you excited about uh i'm excited about starkware we had a fantastic conversation with them earlier this week and people don't realize how close um general purpose cpa roll-up chains are right it's like i i might i thought this was uh a year away you know maybe two years away i've heard estimates that this is like you know three to five years away it feels like it's eminent okay stark net is going to ship next week this is like an optimism or an arbitration it's a little bit different in some ways you can't directly import your contracts it's not quite as ethereum native but it's similar in a lot of ways and um transaction speeds are gonna be fast the more the more transactions the more applications the the lower the gas fees go and it's like it's like right here okay so let me see the metaverse on it we're gonna see gaming application we're gonna see nfts on it we're gonna see entire composable defy money legos and it's it's here it's it's it's going to start i think relatively small like in the next month or two but six months from now i think the uh the crypto world's gonna look completely different because we will have these zk roll up chains that are at least as big if not bigger than many of the layer one roll-ups uh that are out here so i personally didn't realize this was so close like i knew optimistic roll-ups were here um they're fantastic they're a great solution now we've got zk roll-ups with with starkwear coming out to you and then we also had a conversation with polygon who's doing some really cool stuff with zk tech i'm sure we'll have zk sink the matter labs folks on here soon but i really feel like 2022 is going to be a huge year for rollups and for scalability that's i'm also excited about all this i know you are all right let's get to the meme of the week volcano cities uh so this is a tweet out of a out of bankless hq we got two people fighting in the grass one's labeled ethereum ones labels ethereum killers then we have somebody posing in front of them looking like yo look at these idiots fighting behind me and that's bitcoin bitcoin in their volcano cities uh yeah that's that's that was crypto twitter this week for sure it's so funny they were not bitcoiners were not even worried about all of the drama and crypto twitter between ethereum and the eve killers at all they're just happy with the the uh the um the mining news and volcano cities and everything that's going on in the bitcoin space i think that about sums it up man absolutely all right everyone thank you for spending your thanksgiving thanksgiving morning yeah thanksgiving morning with us and i hope you guys have a ton of fun with your families you don't always have to talk about crypto but if you do remind them about the values of decentralization absolutely and remind them to tune in to bank lists happy thanksgiving from us to you we've
