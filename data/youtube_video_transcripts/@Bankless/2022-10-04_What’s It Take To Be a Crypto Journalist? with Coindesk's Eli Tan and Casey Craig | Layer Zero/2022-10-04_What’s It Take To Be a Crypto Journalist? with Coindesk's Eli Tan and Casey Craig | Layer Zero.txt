welcome to layer zero layer 0 is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto Community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero I'm speaking with Casey Craig Global head of comms at coindesk and also Eli tan a journalist an nft journalist also at coindesk and this is the episode that I really wanted to produce to talk about crypto journalism I haven't really seen anyone go down the rabbit hole of what's it like to be a journalist in crypto or what's it like to be the head of comms of a crypto media crypto journalist publication uh bankless we don't consider ourselves journalists we call ourselves a thesis driven Media company we have opinions there's a future out there that we want to help shape and journalism is not that journalism is here's the facts here's the news here's what you what you need to know and it's also about getting the scoop it's also about getting the alpha and so Eli is this very young 24 years old started at coindeska 22 fresh out of college skipped over going over any sort of like Trad media Trad job and straight into nft journalism in the height of an nft bull market so we get that story and Casey the head of comms at coindesk has been with coindesk for many many Winters now so she's been around and she's seen it all and so we just take a peek under the hood as to what's it like to be a crypto media company coindesk is of course extremely large of a journalist entity a media entity in crypto and they are now broadening their Horizons to Trad five competitors so they are competing with the likes of Bloomberg or you know any of these other very large media institutions that are outside of crypto and I think this is a sign of crypto really growing up uh and looking out at bigger fish bigger Horizons and thinking about what we can bring new to to the table we also talk about just the different structure of coindesk versus its competition the very hierarchical nature of traditional media versus the very flat nature of coindesk and how coindesk really empowers their own journalists to do their best work of course after they earn the stripes so let's go ahead and get right into this conversation with Casey and Eli of coindesk but first a moment to talk about some of these

are ahead of moms today we're going to go down the exploratory journey of what the hell it's like to be a journalist inside of the world of crypto which I would imagine is a challenge Eli is it a challenge to be a journalist in crypto it's a challenge but I think it's probably one of the most fun things you know a reporter can cover it's got all the all the drama you know of any beat but all of the drama of the absurdity yeah I think it's let's go a little bit into your guys's backgrounds just to kind of set the stage in the context for The Listener so Eli can you give us a little bit of background of who you are uh what you're what you studied in college and how you came to be a journalistic at coindesk yeah so I'm kind of an up-and-coming reporter uh coined us actually my first uh you know full-time professional job I went to school in Minnesota but out of college it was uh June of last year um join coindesk and then at that time June 2021 you know nfts were still kind of like a nascent thing so no one really wanted to get stuck with the nft Beat It was kind of like something oh I like nfts I like writing about these and then you know I don't think anyone could have predicted kind of the rise and fall of it throughout that next you know whatever it was 12 15 months but um yeah I kind of rode the the career wave with with nfts okay so you were writing about nfts you were you were pushing into that domain of crypto before media entities in crypto were really covering it and I'm assuming that flipped really really fast pretty quickly yeah he's always being modest too I mean Eli he was breaking nft news stories um so he's been featured in everything from like Rolling Stone to CNBC hypebeast kind of all across the board um and Eli came to us as an intern within one year he was not only one of our top reporters but one of the top reporters in the entire space yeah I mean I benefited from having my entire beat the nfts you know at the time it was like kind of this quirky technology Niche right like a lot of people were writing about web3 and if he's were part of that but I was like full on in the nft space You Know full time which was definitely interesting Casey on the on the coindex side of things can you talk about that pivot pre nfts to post nfts like what was it like uh what was the attitude about nfts in coindesk and when was like okay the transition be like oh no we need to cover this thing I mean that's a great question and Eli might be able to answer a little bit better but I don't remember us ever covering it except for sporadically before um and when Eli joined we really gave him that beat um and that was like also one of the first times just from a com standpoint that coindesk was cited in mainstream Publications we've always been cited for breaking news um and the financial or Tech or like traditional business Publications like CNBC um but when we started covering nfts we were like cited in super mainstream Publications um I think you know coindesk alone had 190 million people visit the website last year and it was the crypto price was a part of it but a big part of it was probably also the nft coverage and Casey can you just explain a little bit of your of your role in background at coindust what do you do there yeah totally um so my role is global head of communications which is just a fancy way to say PR so I coordinate all the internal communication between the industry side of the business the business you know just the business business the events consensus and then our editorial team um yeah so my job you know it's kind of a simple goal um but a complicated way to get there is I want to make coin Escape household name when people think of Bloomberg they think of news business news when they think of the Wall Street Journal they think of Finance news business news the New York Times every kind of you know realm of Journalism so I want everybody to know what coindesk is and that we're the leader in crypto coverage and blockchain and what'd you do before coindesk I've kind of always worked in crypto I mean there was like a stint when I was still a ski bomb and I was selling timeshares in Brackenridge Colorado um but ever since then uh when I moved to New York I worked at Waxman PR coinus was a client then I went into spark PR and worked with anyone from Abra um to a few other smaller crypto companies and then I ran actually the financial services PR Public's Sapient so we did a little bit of Trad fi and then came back into Quinn Quinn desk in my current role okay so I'm getting the the sense from both of you that uh backgrounds generally not were you you majored in journalism Eli uh so that that's a strong uh a strong background and of course journalism but no one can really prepare you your background really isn't marketing or or uh journalism or anything like this and so I mean I feel like most people can empathize with these stories like crypto always throws you a curveball and you end up doing something a little bit different than you expected it to but Eli I want to kind of go through your background starting with uh majoring in journalism what did you think you were going to do and write about what did you want to do and then how did how did crypto end up throwing you a curveball yeah so I can remember really distinctly it was the spring of my senior year and I was applying I just wanted to get in a newsroom right I was applying to these papers you're a Seattle guy I was applying to papers on it's like Bainbridge Island right paper of like five people and you know I couldn't I couldn't get in the door right like no one wanted me um and then I had always been really interested in crypto kind of from like an investment standpoint and then of course like the Dogecoin stuff I was like really interested in um so I you know I see this kind of coindesk opportunity and I essentially tell them like Adam I've never written about this stuff and they were like you know not many people have um that's like the thing like if you can if you could want to throw yourself into it like you can become an expert and you can really have like a voice here so I thought okay I'll try it out um yeah and then to go from that to being like you know touted as kind of like this nft expert right because essentially anyone that knew about nfts like I did in you know the winter of 2020 technically is an expert right because it's so new so it was like going from you know the rookie who kind of has no basis in anything to like the expert I can remember distinctly was actually in Miami oh yeah I ever spoke publicly was at FTX arena in Miami where Miami he plays yeah I've been invited to talk to moderate that panel in front of like thousands of people so I have like they put the makeup on yeah and the Nice Clothing I've got the mic and you interviewed Pia Mia on stage and uh she's like like what eight ten twenty million Instagram followers or something you know and shadows from um Avenged Sevenfold like it was just kind of this funny thing it was like my coming out moment of like a wow I'm like freaking out like I've never talked in front of people before and that's like the big intro but um and then since then I mean Eli's been to the Grammys uh he interviewed G-Eazy right before the Grammys he attended um you were like at a table like right you did the full it was essentially like all the absurdity of nfts I was kind of there for like during these times when it seemed like every sports team every musician um was doing nfts like I was kind of right there for it because you know of course they want the Press right so like I think the Grammys thing was probably like the peak moment of absurdity like me on the red carpet for the Grammys in it and it talks right now and people just being like like what is like who is this kid and it's like I read about nfts you know um and it's of course changed a lot since then like I think like the yeah the the industry is like rebranding a little bit like the hype's not quite the same as what it was but like for a few moments like there was there was some Glory definitely along the way lots of Glory what's going on yeah there's a you mentioned how you were trying to just get into Bainbridge Island newspaper and for for those that aren't familiar with Seattle or the Pacific Northwest Bainbridge Island is where you take the ferry to Across the sound and it's it's a small town population 300 yeah there's not a lot of readers of that and so to go from uh applying for something like the Bainbridge Island like local newspaper to doing nft coverage in the middle of a bull market I'm sure was a little bit of a whiplash like how how what were your emotions going through that like year of your life it was a lot I mean it's still kind of like a fever dream thinking about like some of the stuff speaking at like South by Southwest was another cool thing oh my gosh yes he spoke at South by Southwest with Russell WrestleMania Stars yeah yeah it was Stephanie Cohen no that's not right I think so somebody I mean so like we've you know acquaintance can generally we've had some cool public speaking opportunities I think Eli is one of the only journalists that speaks to he's asked me on panels with like real life celebrities not just crypto celebrities but um yeah like big mainstream celebrities and it's kind of funny because he's he was 22 at the time um and he like they they didn't know anything about nfts and he was really the one leading the conversation driving the conversation the expert I mean South by Southwest is huge um so that was just one of them and then you know he's even been interviewed by the New York Times it's a piece that like we don't know when it's coming out but it was just on his career in crypto journalism um and how you can become an expert with I mean not not a short amount of time because I don't want to dilute that expertise but it's it's different than every other career so it's pretty great I think is that people really don't care about credentials yeah it's all just about like what you do right yeah like yeah you know you've got some of the most authoritative figures and nfts and they're just like a picture of them monkey and you know some Alias right and it's like no one cares who they really are no one cares like where they've worked if they have like something to say you know like people will really listen and I think I kind of benefited a lot from that just because I'm it's my first job but because people like the Articles you know they're willing to listen to me so yeah you uh had the the fortune to jump right into this industry I wish I had like were able to skip that four years of my life of post College before I found crypto if I had just been able to Gap that that'd be really really nice but so you don't really actually have like too much experience uh not reporting in crypto and so this will take a little bit of creativity to answer this question but what kind of challenges as a journalist uh where like we are in an industry where there are tokens everywhere people want to pump their bags people have uh self-interest and it's not like it's not true in normal Trad fire journalit web 2 journalism all these same kind of incentives apply like everyone's trying to like pump themselves like promote themselves and so like as a journalist I'm sure you have to be skeptical but in crypto it's got to be like on steroids right so what are the some of the hard challenging Parts about being a journalist in crypto especially when they're like especially during a bull market right like how crazy was that yeah the pitches right Eli you get a hundred a day yeah I was getting like you know a few hundred pitches a day um so that was hard to sort through I mean it's tough because you've got to balance like what is news and what is a promotion for somebody's project you know um the way that like information is shared too with nft is like it's all on Twitter right like I think that's like probably what helps a lot of my articles is that I'm just like very native to like these Twitter communities and I'm kind of like in the weeds of um like what's going on and some of the best stories like we were just talking about the uh the whole bend down liquidation thing it was just something that I was like watching and no one had really no one was writing about because no one was kind of in these like really inner Circles of of nft people interesting yeah I actually I can definitely relate to that because one of the first ways I got into content uh and that joke about like I did this thing and then and then you know a year later we created Bank lists as I was just noting this noticing this thing happen on chain with ether volatility and mkr burn it's like oh as ether's more volatile mkra gets burned at a faster rate mkr out of maker Dow I thought that was pretty interesting and I wrote about it and like no one else was looking at it and then I thought like 50 people were going to read it but like 500 people wrote it and that was like my first dopamine hit and people I think don't really realize how much there is to write about and how much of it is being like looked over by so many people how did you develop your intuition as to like what is a good thing to cover or what is going to be interesting to the readers so what I had always thought like in the early days right is like oh what what are kind of like the groundbreaking things happening that are like moving the industry forward but then what I found with nfts is that they're actually more people that like to make fun of nfts than there are really like promoting them right so like some of my favorite stories to do are stories where Outsiders can kind of look in and just laugh at the absurdity of like everything that's happening like the bend out thing is a great example right like essentially people recreating like the financial crisis of 2008 but instead of mortgages it's with monkey pictures right and it's like even if you're not like really uh don't know much about nfts or like understand the technology like something like that I think is is kind of compelling do you think that incentive where and this is true for all of crypto people kind of want to crypto for just to crash and burn right there's that external incentive and then that kind of creates incentives out of our media institutions to cater to those readers so we can get the views and then it starts to incept itself a little bit deeper into the culture of everything how do you think about this this challenge where we want to promote our industry for the best that it is we have businesses that run on like eyeballs and attention and Views uh how as a journalist how do you how do you balance these things yeah it's tough because if you look at like most of the you know empty Media stuff like people make their money writing about like the way up and the way down like one or the other you've got like I don't know if you know Molly white but her like web 3 is going great it's a great uh blog but we're recording with her later next week oh great yeah um yeah she does great stuff but she only writes about the bad stuff right and then a lot of people only write about the good but as journalists like that's not our job right it's so many journalists do and I think there's some Publications I mean I don't want to say them because I don't want to hurt those relationships but um they really only focus they kind of wait for Scandal um and they really want to focus I mean they're such pessimists because sometimes that is a good story I mean we even published The Genesis story and that's our sister company it was a little controversial I mean we're talking about a giant giant loss um but yeah I mean I think it's good to have both you know as our Newsroom um I noticed that we always try to represent both sides I don't think I mean when you read coin disk articles we're really good at everything's not only is it factually correct but we're pretty blunt we get to the point we're not Evangel is in crypto we're extremely neutral but a lot of other Publications are not like that I think most they're at either one of the spectrum they're either evangelizing it and they're pumping it um or they're ripping it to shreds yeah Casey how would you place coindesk in the sphere of crypto media so we have we have coindesk we have the block we have decrypt we have all of these different journalists or media entities reporting on the news how would you characterize coindesk's specific niche in flavor so it's a great question um I mean okay so to be honest and not just to sound like uh I'm you know I'm trying to pump coindesk but we've there's a lot of yeah we've kind of um to be honest those are our competitors for crypto but we've kind of evolved Beyond being a crypto trade I mean 190 people 190 million people came to our site last year consensus of 20 000 people the indices companies who honestly we see Bloomberg as our competitor CNBC is our competitor broken out you guys are are going for for bigger you really have to be honest yeah we really have and so how did coindesk get there can you can you remind me when you started at coindesk and sure kind of carry us through that Journey so I've been Global head of comms for about two years um but like I said they were my client in 2017 when I was at Waxman um so when I first started working with them I don't think Michael Casey was even in his as a chief content officer yet I think it was even advisor so kind of a long time um and so coin to ask kind of how we got there it's a lot of I mean the people I think it really does come down to the people um when we hire Talent they we have this tremendous intern program that you I was in um at a more senior level we're hiring Talent from Politico Bloomberg other huge mainstream Publications um we don't really have a super high turnover rate compared to a lot of other newsrooms um but yeah we have like absolute Legends working on the editorial side I mean Kevin Reynolds or editor-in-chief created Bloomberg's news breaking desk um so I think how we got there it's kind of simple I mean I think it's the people the commitment to journalism and integrity um and our ethics are really strong um so yeah yeah and the the Elder Statesman of coindescar oh no I mean it's true like can you explain that reference just just people who have been in crypto like literally since the Inception like later since Bitcoin like a year after it's great like you'll hear stories like as much as the new Youngblood people have like given some life to it like people you know you hear stories about um people who go to the first Bitcoin conference and took Bitcoin as payment for hotels from the buddies that they were um doing it from and had sold had to sell like hundreds of Bitcoin because the editorial policy was you know you can't own any yeah so it's like stuff like that right it's like as as much as uh MKC too I mean Michael cakes he was at the journal for 20 years he wrote the first book one of the biggest first books on crypto I think he's written three or four of them since um I can't actually think of a bigger Legend in the space besides Paul vigna who's his partner at the journal they've been covering it for 10 years so it coin desk has uh hired a bunch of people both both Chad's from the traditional media world but I'm assuming but I'm assuming also just like you know normal writers uh just because you need the talent right you need the Manpower how has it been to onboard these people to be crypto people or how do you do you hire people that are only interested in crypto how do you grow out a staff when there's such demand like in a bull market and you need them to be like crypto informed how challenging is this I mean I think so to be honest like we don't hire everyone I mean it is a pretty selective process um most of the journalists that we hired it is a big part of it is personality like they need to have tenacity they need to be a team player That's How The Newsroom runs we don't like internal politics competition so kind of it is a big part of it is a personality match um that's what the editor-in-chief told us um but they don't really need to be like crypto native or like super crypto literate I think anyone can learn the space if they're committed enough most of them are regular they have a regulation background policy background finance and some tech and how do you deal with that question of uh bags right where like uh are journalists allowed to own only certain crypto assets what are the general like rules and parameters yeah um and this is on our website too so we allow our journalists to own I think it's like 15 or 1500 USD um essentially I think you can own as much as you want you just have to disclose you have to disclose it and then we have very strict policies on when you can binds yep and we publicize it so when you go to the author's bio you can see how much they own and of what specifically um just so that you know that their ethics are never compromised when they're writing about something but we think it's important like how can you write about something that you don't actually use or know anything about it from a first-hand experience and how can you also retain Talent when like we kind of know Bitcoin ether are going to absolutely Moon over the next five years yeah so you need to and it's both like good for alignment because you need your journalists to understand what they're writing about but also like they want them bought into not just their job but the industry as a whole I'm sure yeah I mean I think we like strive to have like a great workplace which I know sounds kind of generic but it's true um I don't think we're I mean as of now we're not going to make people come back into the office full time we know writing is really demanding um and so we allow most of the journalists who are now worldwide to work from home which I think is important um but yeah I mean I think that's a big part of it like coins I mean I I don't like I personally love working at coindesk and I think most people do and so there aren't any limits as to like the magnitude of one's bags you can't you're not limited to like ten thousand or a hundred thousand dollars no I think we are so I think like I mean I think for the majority most of the journalists own of like minimal amounts yeah most it's kind of interesting most of us don't own very much yeah interesting how does skepticism is like very real I think how does that how does that apply to nfts what are they I'm assuming there's got to be rules on nfts right yeah we typically I think the policy is supposed to be similar any nft over a thousand dollar value um we just closed so oh but it's just it's disclosing not you're actually capped on owning that thing yeah no I don't know whatever you want I mean typically like I never I never own anything I write about as a rule of thumb if I do for some reason it's disclosed um but like my personal little nft Investments are very different from what I write about like I would never no matter what the policy would be I would never like buy an nft and then write about the collect you know it would just it would just compromise also you would get outed so quickly right yeah it would never be I don't think our competitors would do this but the way our journalism too and like the investigative background for some of the pieces I mean that that could be public knowledge and that's just something that reputation is everything Twitter's made journalist profile so public um I don't think anyone would jeopardize that yeah it's also a funny tool to use because people have their enses and then it's like yeah I'm gonna look like why were you you know right you worked for this company you were buying me bits before the you know it's like okay yeah it's really the Unchained stuff is interesting as like a tool sure so you guys feel that coindesk has got a pretty good wrap on just the incentive misalignment between having media people that we want these people to own assets we want them to be neutral how as an engine okay rate yourself rate yourself because that's a fun question yeah but then also rate the industry at large and also like kind of the aggregate of your competition like how well of an industry are we doing at like disclosing uh I don't think that well I mean honestly like I would want to kind of do more research before making like any kind of statement based on a specific publication but I think a lot of the crypto trades it's obvious I mean they also get it's a lot of misinformation that they're spreading I don't know if it's for an incentive to their personal Advantage but that's one of the biggest problems in crypto journalism is that so many people are getting the story wrong um and that's why we really pride ourselves on verifying every Source everything is fact checked so diligently um so yeah I mean I think I think it's kind of known that a lot of other crypto Publications are pay for a plan that's something that we've never done and ever will can you walk me through that uh the due diligence process where I mean basically yeah you're like let's let's go and like peel back the layers and make sure this is right but crypto is so noisy and it's not like the easiest place to do that due diligence could you could you guys walk us through a process of like what it what a due diligence process looks like in crypto you like you want to start yeah I mean a big thing crypto are just open room or open Secrets right like um you know Scoops about people being involved and this was a big thing when the whole Luna crash happened right like all of dokwan's you know involvements and it's like the the process of you know taking the Open Secret and being like no we've got to call everybody that could possibly be involved and we've got to see the documents and we've got to see the records like that's kind of what I think crypto media like why it's really like this really valuable asset to the industry like there's just all this kind of like there are so many rumors that are swirling around right so to have an organization and this isn't just us I mean a lot of other media places to do this like to really go and like fact check what's going on I think it's like it's really valuable how do you balance uh wanting to be first and wanting to get the scoop and not having complete data like where you don't really know if it's all there how do you balance this I mean I think that was back to the process right when we publish a piece um it's like the fact checking it's I mean you're not ever publishing a piece like by yourself like there's are so many other eyes on it so many other editors I mean I do think we get a lot of pieces first but that like I think Danny and I'm sure you've done the same thing they stayed up all night publishing a piece to get it first but it's a process and it's a commitment yeah trying to get things first is a dangerous game because it's like you really open yourself up to I mean we've gotten stuff wrong before um but yeah it's it's something it's a Temptation you know it's not really the only added benefit is like the attention so you kind of gotta put that what's the recourse process if you get something wrong uh just panic I don't know we have a very we have a very like yeah we issue our Corrections yeah right up at the top I'm thinking as the journalists like everybody Reuters does that yeah no no well immediately wrong it'll be like really sorry this is like a tried and true science of Journalism like yeah yeah everything's location yeah you never we never like you know try to cover it up or anything that's the exact opposite if anything that's why it sucks as the journalist so much because if you get something wrong like everyone will know you got it wrong okay because we have to let people know like yeah we were wrong like there's no you know like sweep it under the rug right like it's all very out in the open uh do Eli in your history at coindust you have like a particularly good Scoop that you're proud of what you have a what is your best scoop here top three yeah just in terms of like um I love that Constitution down story um I got to go to the auction I love oh wow yeah I've been to a few Sotheby's auctions um but that was probably one of my favorite stories is to be like right there as the auction closed obviously you're on the frontier of constitution doubt yeah yeah we were one of the first people to kind of write about that amazing but again something that we just kind of saw happening on Twitter and we're like oh my gosh this is unbelievable okay so you saw it happen on Twitter somebody I'm sure realizes like hey I'm making the call we need to cover this uh can you like walk me through what happened next in your life yeah I mean that was one of the funny how I'm thinking that and I'm thinking of the razzlecon as well like um stories that become so much bigger than just crypto media right like Constitution doubt for sure like I remember we're at it was uh Danny Nelson and I who's now one of our editors like we're at the auction house this was like one of my first months on the job and it's like everyone's there right the New York Times is there like everybody's like you're kind of like in the neck of it with these reporters um but we actually have like better information than a lot of them because our sources are really good and it was like being in the Discord channels for it which a lot of the reporters just didn't know how to do LED to like a lot of information that made for like some really compelling parts of the story right I would imagine there is a lot of Advantage you get as a journalist just being informed about very basic crypto principles like you be in Discord you be in telegram you are a part of the community when you're in a Discord do people know who you are or what you're up to or you're like okay leopard or something random something right so I feel like that's a disclosure of itself yeah yeah like but knowing how to use Discord like even a lot of crypto journalists aren't yeah you know up on that like there's just little things like that where it's like the alpha as they say you know it's like oh you gotta go get it would you say that most uh journalists at coindesk are Discord people uh definitely not I think even though other Statesman maybe is that kind of what makes you special is you're a Discord person well yeah because young people like yeah I don't have any experience but I keep going I don't have any and then like the Boomer crew right like it's like the two it's like the two forces right it's like the Wall Street Journal you know experience reporter and then like someone like me as I don't have any experience anything but like we both kind of add our own like value to it right like I think that's what makes crypto so great is that like it's just it's just all over the place yeah Casey uh since you've been at coin death for a while is there a division between like older and younger journalists and how they operate what they talk about and what they cover yes but it's not a bad thing it's um Boomers is mean it's more Boomer in spirit I don't know um but no I mean it's funny I mean Eli's 22 you know the editor Danny Nelson he's talking about is 26 and then um I think our editor-in-chief I don't want to guess and get it wrong but he's definitely over 45.50 um but I think that's why our journalism is so good because we have people like Eli hustling working on Discord and then these Wall Street journalists uh Veterans as he said that can like they know the editorial process almost from like a corporate standpoint and in terms of like these larger media newsrooms so it's a good balance like we have the hustlers and then the like you know steady Eddies right and I'm assuming you're doing as a result of that a very good job in capturing both audiences right some people exactly need to be talked to like they are being written by like an adult or is it a tie well I mean think of like all the crypto verbiage and like lingo and language my mom Dad don't understand that but like that's who we want to read coindesk um we want everyone to read coindesk that's why we become a house because you also need the people in the telegram you also need people in the Discord right so we have I think crypto learn or no sorry coindeskworm or Explorer is almost like there is like breakdowns of what a lot of this terminology means for anyone but yeah we do try to strive and it is kind of hard to straddle between this industry that's moving so fast I can't even keep up with the lingo I have to ask Aubry like what does this mean on Twitter um but yeah I mean I think we do a good job of blending it what would you say is like the uh the uh 50 older crowd 50 younger crowd how is the division of journalists in at coindesk split uh you mean readership or like the staff uh staff journalists the writers I'd say 40 Boomers 60 one of the editors are boomers they're great that's what you want from there yeah it's more of like the report a lot of the reports that are probably younger age like fine ones that's the editors have to be the bricks and the young journalists have to be the gas right yeah yeah uh that's an interesting interesting relationship so so your editors are the of the Boomer crowd yeah I would say so yeah but it's exactly what you need right they'd be like Eli like people don't understand whitelists or like people don't understand what it's yeah what gas Wars are fermenting right like explain to them like you're explaining it to me right like I gotta know so is that a frustrating part of your job it's like oh these Boomers don't understand what a whitelist is or is it is it interesting no no it's great I love the editors yeah the wisdom they pass down it's like unbelievable I mean I mean yeah like they they were I mean like you know Kevin Reynolds I mean again like such a legend he he's been covering news for 30 years I think I mean he practically invented the Bloomberg terminal he invented Bloomberg terminal I mean can you imagine how much he's seen in news how much it's changed who's writing before people were reading their news online before push notification social um before any like digital subscriptions when people were still picking up the physical newspaper he's seen all that evolve I mean that kind of wisdom is priceless the brave wallet is your secure multi-train on-ramp into web3 and it's built directly into the brave privacy browser gone

that like once upon a time there were internet funds and now it's just funds now so now it's just a16z in the same way internet was taken over and we kind of think that's going to be the same thing with crypto and so now that we call this thing crypto journalism crypto media eventually it's just going to be media uh and so you're you're 22 you're on the front I'm 24 actually 24. 22. now 24. um you're on the frontier of what it means to be a journalist in a brand new industry that is figuring out everything about itself so if you had to explain your what the difference is in your job is to perhaps a journalist who is at the end of their career their 50 60 plus they're ready to retire how can you compare and contrast these things what are you doing what do you need to do to do your job very very well that is completely foreign to journalists of old like to one of your professors at Columbia because they've probably been tendered or you've been there for a while um I think like we kind of talked about just being proficient and like these new ways of communication like like the discords like the twitters um I really think maybe it's if anything it's kind of the opposite like it's like how do you integrate kind of the existing methods of Journalism into an arena that is just like seems really chaotic Anew but really kind of isn't when you think about like at the end of the day like all these even ft companies like they're just institutions right like there's companies they're just people behind the companies that are making money right like I think if anything yeah like trying to figure out like okay how were how were uh you know the what's the uh the.com bubble yeah like oh my gosh going back and reading about how that was covered and how you know people figured out how to like get information from the rise and crash of that like it's so relevant to crypto it's so relevant to nfts like as much as I like to think that I'm like you know in this kind of like Uncharted Territory with everything like it's all history Rhymes or whatever they say right like it's all kinds history repeats itself yeah um I would always imagine that like a strong media institution like coindesk would have just like a stable of sources that they would call if they needed to get like uh just information verification a scoop and like growing up as a child you would like listen to The Morning News and be like sources say and like oh sources they clearly have somebody that they call up and give them a bunch of Alpha and I'm sure coindesk has that but then this like whole new open Discord thing or open telegrams changes that a little bit where again you're you're there Discord handle is like lurker right and so so a working leopard looking leopard myself everybody's typing in their discords right now is there a lurking leopard in our Discord so how do you balance like where do you get your Alpha from do you have sources or do you have Discord channels like what's what's a greater source of alpha for you when it comes to your journalist Endeavors I mean me personally like yeah there are a ton of people that you'll just see tweeting out random stuff and it's unfounded right it's completely like it's a complete rumor but usually there's some kind of truth right even if it's not like exactly what's being said um like for example like there were a bunch of tweets about Amazon doing an empty marketplace right insiders they know oh yeah Amazon it's like that's some version of the truth right and then you kind of have to follow you follow the money like you follow you you get in touch with people who are not Anonymous but might be in the same circles as these people that are and like see what they have to say and see who they can kind of put you in touch with because you really can't cite sources that are not real people or that are not like really committed to you know always telling the truth which are and encrypt other a lot of them how does using an Anon as a source work does that change the game at all yeah I mean we if you're just like citing somebody like you've got to have the first and last name yeah typically yeah it's just invalid if you don't have that I mean the anons they're good at giving you like the information that you can go and fact check but like it's Risky Business to cite somebody that you don't know who they are or what they're about yeah and we had an interesting conversation about this the other day like if we broke the story with like dokwon for instance they were originally Anonymous do we should we reveal that name um is that an ethical question we know that it's going to blow up their identity um and we decided that unless we felt it was absolutely necessary we do try to maintain the anonymity of the sources just so I mean it's also good journalism it'll keep you know the relationship with the source is strong but um yeah unless because it really blows up someone's spot so we're not looking to make somebody a Target sure yeah that's a great example like dokwon um you know it's an Open Secret yeah he had this other algorithm stablecoin thing and people know but it's like no we need to see and we ended up getting this wasn't my start but like we got the text between him and his team right like we got the actual documents that proved like yes this is real this is not a rumor like this is and this is in reference to dokon Leading basically basis yes and so wait so you guys did you guys get this group on that yeah Danny Nelson was uh yeah Sam Kessler yeah so that was the story they stayed up all night to get yeah uh right okay so uh coindesk figures out that everyone knows who do Quan is this is post uh Terra Luna blowing up um but it was revealed that dokwan was also the anonymous leader of basis cache and so it was and then coindesk at the time decided that that was an appropriate time to disclose somebody's Anonymous identity against their like probably against because it blew up they were willing to go they were willing to go on the record as their yeah who they actually were because they didn't fear you know right okay didn't happen okay cool but yeah I mean I think the start of this conversation was we were talking about if we knew who Satoshi why should we should we reveal that source and it was kind of I think like the conversation I had with the editors like this isn't we don't have this story I just want to be clear we don't know who she is sitting on that but if we were should we do that um it could change media is powerful I mean articles are super powerful in the news it would change someone's life um and honestly it was like The Newsroom was split half and half it's such a great story should we give enough information where people can kind of figure that out on their own do we disclose the identity yeah the doxing thing is like ongoing conversation yeah right and uh I'm assuming some of the issue would be like well if we discovered who Satoshi Nakamoto is and we keep it a secret somebody else could reveal it and then the outcome is the same is public information but we don't get the credit of revealing it so we've lost that lost that opportunity a little bit of that game theory I'm sure it comes into play right oh yeah yeah that was big with the board eight founders people knew who they were um but yeah BuzzFeed chose to reveal and it was a whole conversation well if they're not doing anything wrong do you want to reveal their names and did you guys know it ahead of BuzzFeed I didn't personally know it but a lot of nft people knew it okay um yeah I read something in New York Magazine they came out with it was just like a background on it and it's a good example if they gave enough details or I'm sure if you just figured out the city that they were talking about in Florida the school that they went to they were like literary majors are super interested in it you can kind of like figured that out on your own if you're if you're interested enough sure um how do you I'm assuming you might get leads or get Alpha from anons maybe in DMS is this a child have you had this opportunity or were you a circumstance presented to you where like an Anon comes like hey here's some here's some Alpha have you ever had this before yeah I'm less of a I'm less of a scoopster for the team the scoop star I'm not like I'm not like Sam Castle I'm not like Tracy I'm not like Dan Nelson yeah but that's essentially what happens like I don't know if you read Danny Nelson's story about it is called master of anons yeah about the guy who had like 16 or 17 different Anonymous alter egos I mean someone essentially just came with a document and was like I'm you know here it is right like we had to fact check it and all but like you know somebody had enough right and they were like some people know about this but I think it's worth if everyone knows so it doesn't really matter if they're coming to you as an Anon because it goes through the same fact checking process at all articles and and journalism pieces of Journalism goes through so you're kind of filtering out the fact that it began with an Anon to begin with yeah I think that's probably true in traditional yeah that's probably the same exactly yeah not everybody you know some people are more valuable completely on off the Record around background okay so I meant to ask this question earlier but we were talking about the uh not gender divide age divide in uh at coindesk and uh like how different uh journalists approach their strategy of writing an article uh I would imagine the younger types are the ones like in the discords uh probably don't have the same level of like connections out there and then the older journalists are the ones with like the the behind the scenes connections the the good connect uh I don't even know what you call these things but just like you know The Feelers the birds The Whispers yeah I think it's actually shifted really I mean of course you know like Michael he's such a legend in the space he knows so many people but the media invites are usually going to the journalists not the editor so it's like Eli Danny are going to these parties you're meeting so many people they might have a bigger Rolodex I think than the more senior journalists just because of the amount of people that they're exposed to the amount that they're invited to um so yeah I mean I think I think it shifted do you often Eli feel like you have a leg up on on some of your older older uh colleagues um maybe a little bit yeah I mean it's tough because I really like operate kind of in the I just do nfts right so I'm not looking for one thing it's not as much crossover but it is funny when it's like someone will be talking about a certain person like oh we should get in touch and it's like yeah I was just got a bird yeah yeah probably why we have such a good Newsroom just because we have so many great reporters that all yeah and everyone gets along which is rare yeah I think like I would imagine if you're like just stumped on a story you just need something you just stand up and be like does anyone know who this person is yeah like or like the like you know like we'll just like group chat or something I imagine right yeah I guess there are things like slack and Discord now yeah telling you the event you meet someone I mean you know this like we we go out a lot together and you meet so many people right yeah one of our journalists Tracy um should call it hotel lobby Khan she would call conferences because you could just go to the hotel lobbies yeah and you could get she would get like all her great Alpha from hotel lobbies which is like I think it's very it's true to the you know crypto journalist idea right I think if you're just willing to go out there yeah people used to tell me anything how many journalists do they have you guys have on staff we've won six oh no sorry we have 160 full-time at coindes so I think one 2140 of those are journalists full time I think so I think we're 160 total coinda staff um and I guess that does include indices the majority of that are in the editorial room or cdtv I'm not sure the exact number because we do have Freelancers they're Global but it's majority of the staff so Eli when you look forward into your own personal career what do you want to become as a journalist in crypto and also do you feel like that is also true for your your colleagues like what what does the average crypto journalists want their future career to be and does that relate to what you also want personally I mean I think it's it's tough because something like uh you know being an nft journalist like there has never been one and I don't even know if that will exist in the future you know so it's hard to know like what this whole crypto media landscape will really turn into and like what kind of roles will be out there in the future but um I mean personally like there are so many great Tech reporters out there right like I love like Katie natopolis like Taylor the wrens right like people that are able to kind of make their livings with really more than the tech like the communities right like the culture um like nft is like it's a it's Finance it's Tech but it's also culture and I definitely love the culture part I think that um in the future like I would love to kind of continue to live in that realm but also I mean you always wanted to get into Columbia journalism school right and now now Eli's there so yeah that's cool right now yeah tomorrow yeah were you in the middle of school while the bull market was going on no no no I started school like yeah like few weeks ago like a couple months ago but congratulations yeah thank you now I'm doing quite as part time but okay um yeah I was was doing it full time during the bull run but it's funny like I don't I don't you know I'm not worried about nfts in class right is actually like it's the Bronx so I'll be like going up to the Bronx I'm doing like local news stories and it's like it couldn't be more different than like doing that stuff so it was coindesk like bummed when you had to scale back your time to go to Columbia journalism school like what was the coin dust cancel like yeah our guys I was devastated well I know I was so happy for Eli because I know you always wanted to go um to the J school but I was like no like and then people were trying to get me to stay there yeah so it's the purpose of uh going to uh J school is I guess what you call it the J school yeah uh the purpose is to be a better journalist for you is it to be a better crypto journalist uh not necessarily I mean I think I'm going it's always kind of been my dream to go like Colombia is kind of a famous program um yeah before when you tell people what you like what your background is at the J school like your history I'm like oh I wrote about nfts and people are like like for fun like did you get like no fruit I got paid like it was a real job like you know well you're one of the only kids in the program right um the one of the only students that was a writer before right like yeah they're fully employed journalist yeah um yeah most people come come from out of undergrad but yeah maybe you'll teach you professors before um quintess I always had interest I had interested in sports journalism I'm always like criminal justice stuff so yeah I've been able to Maybe cover that in the future would be great as well so where do you see your fellow colleagues you're taking a bit of a not a Hiatus because you're still working at coindesk but you're taking a little bit of a step back where do you see your colleagues seeing the CR the industry of crypto journalism go like what what does crypto journalism look like I'm gonna ask you Casey the same question after after Eli's done where do you see like your fellow journalists seeing crypto journalism go in like the next few years like what's going to need to change and what should change like how's the meta going to change I think that after this last bull market we need to be equipped to kind of know who the Bad actors are right something like the the Terra Luna deal right like it would be great to not have to have that play out the way it did and have so many people be affected when maybe there was a way to kind of prevent this I think crypto journalism is most important in the bull runs and then the crashes I think that's where uh the industry most needs like transparency um I think like trying to figure out our identity when it's kind of like a lull is is going to be not a challenge but it's just like something we'll have to figure out but I think like kind of gearing up and saying okay what a fun time it was for the rise and fall like how can we do it better now and I think we're still figuring that out you know yeah we can do that better next time yeah it's a good time to pull back build kind of focus on like the structure of our business or business model um and like you know coin us we've already been through two or three Winters before this isn't yeah this has been around forever yeah this isn't new to us um but it's a good time because the Bull Run is so crazy it's such a frenzy um so now we can kind of focus on like structure and overall strategy um so it's good to have a have both I don't think anyone could do Bull Run hours forever something that's sustainable I remember when the Bull Run started it was like one quarter into the bull run and like it took me me and Ryan about that long amount of time for us to be excited about the bull run to then realizing the absolute magnitude of just like Feeding Frenzy that was about to be in front of us and like usually and we were like we were stoked like sweet bull run but we were also like oh Bull Run I'm not gonna sleep yeah like this is my life is now different yeah yeah um Casey you talked about how coindesk wants to go and like compete with the likes of Bloomberg or like you know the biggest fish that are outside in the world of Trad media what does coindesk one thing I I don't want out of our media companies in this space is to just be just like them when they grow up right so when when coindesk grows up and it does you know bite the head off of Bloomberg and replace it as a media institution what how how and why is it going to be different and why is it going to be better I mean for a lot of reasons I think one is um I don't we're never going to go public like any other Media Company because we're already owned by digital currency group um another thing too is I think we'll always focus on crypto and blockchain and how it evolves we'll always be specialized in that um you know these other media Outlets they have covered they've evolved and they've covered so many different beads we'll always be focused and because of that and because of that Niche and you know blockchain and crypto become more mainstream so it'll grow but um I think it'll just mainly because we'll be you know so focused yeah yeah I mean we often talk about like our audience like all the different buttons between people that are just getting into crypto for the first time people and I think like our strength will always be like that that Bullseye of people that are interested in crypto yeah like we're kind of like we serve them I think better than anybody else like the crypto native like we do a lot of coverage but I think we're we're kind of the best at that that's kind of yeah and that audience on who's interested in crypto at the moment that's always changing right now we're doing a big um it's not like the editorial room is as much focused on Trad five but as a company like right now my overall strategy for comms is how we can really tap into the Trad fight audience in terms of our external representation um they're super you know interested in crypto but yeah it changes I mean last year that was literally everybody on the planet and now it's more institutional um companies which is interesting in case you talked about a little bit of a brain drain coming when coindesk is hiring a bunch of new journalists and Talent new operators you said you're doing a lot of effort just poaching them from the Trad media space right why do they want to come into crypto like what's motivating them and can you just talk about just the the quality and the the vibe of these candidates that are coming in yeah absolutely so so we did hire a lot in the past year so like our you know we have fulfilled the positions that we were looking for um and I think a lot of them are interested because again like there is like this you know having a niche and focusing on a specific beat is really enticing um you can have like one thing that's really rare about coinda's compared to other media companies everybody that is an expert and anybody that wants to have um you know broadcast appearances public speaking we give them the opportunity there's no hierarchy um and so any journalist that really wants to get recognition for the stories or publishing building their personal brand coindesk is a much better platform to do that than these giant newsrooms like Bloomberg and the journal where things are kind of you know they start at the top and it'd be pretty rare for you to be a junior journalist at Bloomberg or CNBC I imagine and get the amount of air time that um our journalists at coindesk at I like that yeah so I think what you're saying is that these older institutions older media institutions are just very hierarchical and probably a little bit more calcified yeah would you say coindesk is a flatter and wider super flat yeah I mean like it's so flat um I can't I mean of course there is um we do have a c-suite leadership there are editors editor-in-chief but everything's pretty collaborative don't you think Eli yeah yeah it's super collaborative um and honestly what's kind of funny is a junior journalist like Eli are the ones that get more public recognition there on more TV externally they're in like other articles externally then the more seasoned Boomers that's just kind of how the way you know the way that we operate and uh so I'm I'm guessing here so correct me if I'm wrong but for an older institution I guess we're just going to pick on Bloomberg for the rest of this episode uh it's like say like uh we'd also love Bloomberg it's gonna be queer but they're great but also we're going to be better than them um so like say there's this hierarchical structure a new journalist comes in they're probably like banging out some like fodder articles they're probably not really on they don't have too much Freedom I'm guessing here and so what you're saying is like a lot of the opportunity if a good article comes or a good Scoop comes or a good piece of story or something happens the good stuff gets captured up by that by the people higher up in the hierarchy first and so there's less there's less real value for the people the newer journalists and newer hires to really um prove themselves I mean I think so I mean I you know I I haven't worked and you know I did have an internship at the New York Times a long time ago so I'm familiar with that Newsroom a little bit I've never worked in the Bloomberg Newsroom but yeah I would imagine it's kind of like that and speaking to some of my external contacts it's a little bit like that um but one thing too you know with coindesk and my role you know coin is making it a household name but I want to make sure that the journalists that we have get recognition for their pieces that they publish um not just coin us but them individually which I think is people people when they think of journalists they know the stories they don't know the person behind it and I want to change that yeah a lot of it is also just the subject matter again like yeah you know if you're like if you wrote about banking like you're gonna go to one you're like maybe people that have been writing about banking though for like decades or like yeah you're an education reporter you know if I went into a newsroom there's gonna be education reporters that have been writing about this since like the 80s or 90s Dows like people have not been writing about Dallas for decades people have been writing about Dallas for months and years like if so if you want to write about something like that like you can yeah go ahead right like yeah there's not kind of like a precedence where you need to have or people are going to be ahead of you for experience right so do you guys think that as coindesk grows up and as crypto media grows up and starts to emulate more of the properties that we see in the traditional media space you think that flatness will kind of disappear and be replaced by a little bit more hierarchy or do you think we have some of this flatness here here for good for the rest of time it's just part of our model I mean even like our CEO Kevin worth who's so sweet he is fully like he's there's no hierarchy he's he's not ever condescending but he just is fully like immersed in whatever we're doing um like well Casey's the same way I think that's just a huge part of our culture and I think it'll always be that way um and like you know the way that the company structured is we have like a business side there taking care like there there is I guess a little bit of hierarchy there just to make sure that we are generating like a healthy Revenue to make sure that we can keep hiring when we do have open decisions again but yeah I think the flatness is a core part of our of our brand and um work culture yeah Eli can you can you talk a little bit about how the flatness makes things fun can you flat is fun can you explain the flatness a little bit more like yeah so so instead of like having a like we have we have you know open bazars or we have like top down oh okay right and so hierarchies is like you are pretty rigid in your role you can't really expand out there's like your your Superior who has a superior who has a superior uh versus a more flat organization which is like everyone's kind of on equal footing and maybe there's one Superior who's kind of coordinating it all together but it doesn't it's not layered unlayered unlayered on on like a hierarchy you're giving it a lot more freedom uh there's a lot less top down control you're a little bit more in charge of uh what you write about what you think about what you do and so when Casey's telling me that like uh you start writing about nfts and all of a sudden coins X coindes start sending you this other bees that feels very empowering and Sotheby's inviting me yeah yeah afterwards yeah now it's like I get that they're they're emailing me like oh we would like you to come and drink the champagne while we do the auction yeah I mean yeah opportunities like that I mean just being able to have I feel like with crypto there's way more free reign as to like what stories you want to tell um especially now like with my editor Rosie like he's very very little am I being now assigned stories that I need to hit every few days it's more of like well you're on you're out there on the ground on the in the Twitter circles like yeah what's going on right like it feels more like I have more autonomy you know with the news Gathering aspect of it and it's like oh well even if something might be interesting to her like well do you think it would be interesting that the people that we're reading right like there's a lot less it feels like uh just kind of strict yeah I would say yeah so I definitely get to be but then there's also the onus of okay I have to go out and I gotta find stuff yeah I gotta be creative right but you had to earn those stripes right oh yeah for sure oh yeah when I came in I was flipping so many press releases I mean it was unbelievable like I had no autonomy in the beginning like it would be like Zach you know giving me yeah I mean it was your first when I first started I was writing like three stories a day like I was banging out those those short hits right like yeah I definitely how long were you doing that before you started to have uh you know your own Stripes oh months and months maybe like four or five months okay [Laughter] some people have to do
