just remember i'm the better looking one of course well i'm the one that actually exists in real life so yeah david's the one that you're actually going to see at a conference hey bankless nation happy last week of july summer is almost over but happy friday morning to you we're gonna be drinking a cup of coffee as we enjoy the weekly roll up we hope you are as well david how you doing today oh absolutely fantastic ryan um some more three arrows capital fallout uh we saw we said last week that it was probably coming but as far as it goes that's like the only contagion stuff we have to talk about this is the last time we talked about three hours capital well i don't know about that but like the topics like celsius seems to be over voyager's over is only through errors capital that's left all right getting some closure this week hopefully uh we're also gonna be talking about coinbase an employee got arrested for insider trading yeah you could be an insider trader at coinbase and there's some fallout with the sec uh and coinbase they got into another tussle and even the cftc is weighing in on this we're going to cover that as well big drama big drama in the regulatory space and the last test net the last test ever this is the last step before the actual merge is scheduled it's here the gourley testnet is coming in the 6th to 12th of august we don't know when because it's uh set by a ttd number we'll talk about that later but ryan it's happening lights in the background that's great as always guys this comes at you every friday morning this is the best way to recap your week in crypto hope you're joining us and uh make sure you like and subscribe if you are so if you're on youtube make sure you like this video and subscribe to the channel and if you are listening to this on podcast form rate and review wherever you listen your podcast on spotify by the way this is now in video version we partnered with spotify they partnered with us i don't know what are the other we now have bankless video capability on spotify which gives us another platform beyond youtube it's pretty cool i enjoy it yeah if you're a spotify listener you can become a spotify viewer and then at the crypto conferences people can stop mixing me and you up that's great just remember i'm the better looking one of course well i'm the one that actually exists in real life so yeah david's the one that you're actually going to see at a conference like so it's definitely going to be david all right um all right we should also talk about our friends at rhinophy i know they wanted us to get the message out that former formerly they were called diversify and now they are rhinophy formerly they were also a decentralized exchange and now they are more than that you can swap you can also trade of course you can deposit into liquidity pools what else can you do with rhinophy so running fire just abstracts all of the many many chains that are existing and coming online in this multi-chain future so you know all the basic stuff like ryan said like trading and swapping but you can also you know put your your assets into liquidity pools uh you can also invest some in various parts of uh inside of the multi-chain future and as we just go and grow and grow in complexity stuff like this is going to be more and more needed in order to just like manage all of your defy stuff for across all of the chains the reason why it looks like this on ryan's window is because every time we start recording i have him squeeze his window yeah real tight uh but it would look a little bit more expanded on your desktop when you when you go to the link in the show notes uh to go check it out yeah go check it out i think part of the reason that um we got so burned last cycle not we i mean crypto collectively i'm using c5 platforms is because d5 user interfaces weren't there yet it was just easier to deposit in celsius and block fi but now with rhinophize of the world we are upgrading our d5 experience and just a reminder c5 failed this cycle but d5 didn't this is a way to double down on it start leveling up using tools like rhino500 bankless so this is all on a layer two 100 organic said bankless organic uh experience for you here all right david let's get to the markets bitcoin what's it doing some good things uh bitcoin started the week at twenty three thousand two hundred dollars ending the week at twenty three thousand seven hundred dollars up two and a half percent up to an half percent nice green week okay green green week stacking on green weeks we got i think three green weeks in a row right knock on wood knock on what happened yeah that can happen during the battle loud hmm it's allowed but the bigger story was this one what's this chart telling us this is a bitcoin chart again but let me actually pull up the ethereum chart yeah because i think that the lines are a bit steeper upward what are we looking at started a lot the the week at 15.70 we are currently clocking in at 17.26 wow up 8.7 percent was it was it last week that eth was up 30 mm-hmm i think it was yeah yeah again just stacking that math in your head so we're oh don't ask me 8 plus 30 we're 38 on two weeks no that's not how it works you can't add you can't add percentages i know [Laughter] i'd have to go back to the 14 day right right right the good news is we're green we're up and we're heading in a good direction um i think there's a story here so did you see it just like suddenly leap up yeah i guess that was wednesday on the day of recording and that's something to do with the fed actually jerome powell spoke that line that nice green candle into existence i think and we're going to get to get to why that is in that story but before we do let's i'd love to be able to speak green candles into existence sorry you have to apply for the position of central banker david oh you want that job i'm out nope no i don't it sounds like a terrible job like honestly everyone hates you all of the time sorry powell eat bitcoin ratio what's the ratio telling us up 6.2 percent uh is up to .02 my eth btc trade finally coming back to parity is that a real trade you made or is that yes no a long time ago i've been holding it oh really yeah i've been knuckling it yeah you know sir i've never had the guts to make that trade people traded the ratio short bitcoin long ether yeah yeah i mean like i would do that by just holding eth over bitcoin over the long time horizon but like actually trading this ratio is like scary to me spooky territory i admire you david yeah i told you that well uh thank you don't don't don't you shouldn't you should admire me for other reasons other than my dreams you're hating you're trading not your trading game uh we could always look at the dpi ratio if um if you're curious about ratios but how about the crypto market cap are we above a trillion this week yeah we're above a trillion we were at 1 trillion last week we are up to 1.138 trillion uh the math is easy this week we are up 13.8 nice uh gas prices still down honestly gas prices are like crazy low ten ten gwai average gravy you know what you know what would be like super ironic ryan what is if like we merge and there's no burn ether is not here there's no ultrasound money after all of this after all that uh so like the the deflationary threshold is seven and we are at ten ah we're just hanging on we're hanging on two so um i don't know what's so funny is when transaction fees are high people get bearish because they're like ethereum is not scaling what's the matter transaction fees are so high now on the flip side when transaction fees are low they're like bearish again no one's using ethereum david yeah it's like scenario yeah bearish when fees are high bearish and fees are low i mean okay then that just means you're just a bearish person yeah probably uh i'm optimistic in both of these cases so it's a good time to get your transaction fees through um but i do hope i mean just for the posterity of it like post merge we gotta be ultrasound right we gotta be we gotta bring any more eat we gotta be i will i will just personally spam the network please do just for like you know just for the meme yeah yeah okay okay by the way five minutes of spanning ethereum i'm pretty sure that is at least like half a million dollars so i will not i will not actually be doing that wait colin create a doubt for it you know ultrasound dao i don't know let's just tell him back it's moving to help um okay markets the fed press release so um the big powell raise uh came out i guess uh on wednesday uh the federal reserve issued a statement that said they were going to increase the federal funds rate that's the interest rate of course uh to two and a quarter to two and a half percent that is a .75 increase uh bringing the target rate to 2.5 so they call that 0.75 uh is 75 bips this is of course the um biggest rate hike i believe let me see since volcker the fastest tightening of monetary policy since fed chair paul volcker battled double-digit inflation in the 1990s is the headline here weak economic data was the reason although powell did say here here's a quote from him i do not think the u.s is currently in recession he told reporters that after the end of the the latest policy meeting and he cited unemployment rate that is still near a half century low and solid wage growth and job gains it doesn't make sense that the us would be in a recession what's interesting about that statement though is i remember last summer he was telling us about transitory inflation and this summer sorry about transitory i don't think the us is not in a recession and that wouldn't make sense at all so i'm not actually sure whether he believes that or not or is kind of playing the act or um yeah so what this is i i've been thinking about this a lot this last week actually after listening to uh like lynn alden and luke grominar podcast but also content that that kyla scanlon has been putting out i mean i actually think that every single word that comes out of the fed reserve is an act yeah there is nothing that is actually him it's there's nothing that is not specified everything is done as like a theater there is another lever to tinker with you yes yes that's yeah we talk about what are the levers of the tool of the fed they have interest rates and they have quantitative easing and tightening they also have how they appear as a big tool a narrative and so that is actually probably the biggest tool and so i think when you read these statements by the fed and you see you see the words that the fed the fed chair does not think that the us is currently in a recession that is not what the fed chair actually thinks that is what he wants you to think that he thinks that that doesn't work forever right because if okay so this is what markets are just a hall of mirrors sure it's like well they think this so i think this so they think that's why i think this right but like it's kind of the keynesian beauty like once we start to know that the fed chair is actually not telling us the truth but is telling us what he wants us to believe then it's like conception you have to you have to go one layer deeper at that point and then and then so does the fed and then we go one language oh my god wow if we could just outsource this to robots and code that would be so much simpler zero layers deep wow wouldn't that be nice the question is though is this uh a peak in the inflation rate i think that's a question we had 9.1 percent remember last time but um what was interesting about this i think david is what we'll get to next the market actually liked this yeah so think about this we go .75 75 bips up pretty big raise pretty big move to tightening but the market had kind of expected this to happen and then what do you think the market does does it go down or does it go up well up is the answer to that nasdaq shot up crypto shot up and we're gonna get into a thread as to the reason for that but let me ask you david were you surprised at that nothing surprises me anymore this is right so tightening up don't have an opinion as to the direction of the market i'm i've been in buy only mode for the past like three months do you know it sound it seems counterintuitive though right it's like you actually like raise rates and then nasdaq and crypto would you pop up and that's why we're seeing the the eath pop of nine percent this week and also you know bitcoin up this week it was it was actually after the fed meeting right uh why don't we get into this thread what is uh macro elf saying this is this is a voice i've increasingly enjoyed on uh macro topics but uh why don't you read this out it's a whole thread about this yeah so macro alf alf says powell hikes 75 basis points and yet nasdaq and bitcoin are going to the moon what the heck while i disagree with the unfolding market narrative here let me try to explain why we are witnessing such a rally this uh despite open openly recognizing economic grosses if softening the fed unanimously exclamation point decided to hike bips by 75 percent it's all about inflation inflation inflation but markets convincingly started to rally only when powell went ahead and said the following quote we are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates and after front loading our hiking cycle we until until now we will be much more data dependent going forward let's find out why this is so relevant so macro alph continues and says the neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy runs at its potential without overheating or excessively cooling down i think i think that is called threading the needle i think that's called a soft landing with a 75 bips hike the fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate from here they aren't contributing to economic heating anymore uh and then here we see a graph um and then he continues uh but that also means any hikes from here are going to put the fed in an actively restrictive territory so i think he's saying that we are have established an equilibrium with the economy the economy is not going to go up it's not going to go down it's going to be flat uh and so he continues and says but that means that any hikes from here are going to put the fed in an actively restrictive territory the bond market knows that every time the fed becomes restrictive they break something so powell was asked a couple of very important questions i'm guessing i'm guessing in like the the after the statement they had like a press uh like seminar thing where the reporters could talk to them uh what about bond market pricing uh 70 bips cuts in 20 uh 2023 what about financial conditions uh so what about forward guidance and so this is when the quote from here on out we are fully data dependent from that's the key quote that's the question which the rally started the the rally started happening in the markets before that it was kind of nothing the .75 did nothing to the markets but this statement from here onwards we are fully data dependent that was the differentiator right and so the the question of what about forward guidance is answered by from here on on for here onwards we are fully data dependent meaning forward guidance is gone and so again the threat continues why is this relevant it all starts from a very strong opinion that the bond market has developed uh the strong opinion that the bond market has developed about inflation over the last few months it's going to move down and very fast inflation the bond market thinks the inflation is going to go down fast bigly between july 23 and 24 the cpi is priced to print at about 2.9 percent so we're at where were we at nine point one percent last month uh the allegedly the bond market and between july 23 and july 24 the cpi is priced in from the bond market to be at 2.9 percent basically at target so the bond market is pricing in that the federal reserve is going to get inflation under control in about one year's time so if powell is not nearly on autopilot anymore and the markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing they can also price all other assets based on this scenario so basically saying if the bond market is pricing this in so is everything else if you look under the hood market action also validates this narrative hence why you know qqq the nasdaq is going up bitcoin is going up crypto's going up uh and so what's performing here out performing here now is that getting crypto of course as i just said if the fed isn't going to tighten financial conditions on autopilot anymore real yields will actually start declining again uh and here we actually do see yields start to decline and they continue again we're almost done win real yields decline value intensive and risk sentiment driven assets classes outperform that's because the marginal return for owning cash usd becomes less attractive and the incentive to chase risk assets is larger such as qq the nasdaq and bitcoin do i think this rally has legs question mark i can rationalize the narrative being built post fomc but no forward guidance equals a very very volatile fed ahead of us one small hawkish turn and it's all gone you might you must price in some additional risk premium here not less basically what he is saying is that the bond market has priced in we're solving inflation in one year's time so as soon and because the federal reserve is not operating under a forward guidance scenario anymore they are saying we are completely data driven at this point if the data comes out and shows that we are not solving inflation within one year time the market is not positioned for that and will likely react to that in a volatile manner like hint into the downside uh and so that that's like the main conclusion to this thread yeah so the the the tl dr is that data-driven statement had the has a market thinking that the fed is done increasing for now like nothing more than sort of expected it won't get super ultra aggressive right that's what the market thinks but the reason this rally might be tenuous is because if the market is wrong about that and inflation is much more persistent it may drive the fed's hand to change because now the fed is data driven apparently so can you trust this rally is is a question of i don't know can you like what is inflation going to be in the future that's sort of how tenuous this is right now so i don't know i mean it's it's cool to see a rally like this i i i suppose but we're probably not out of the woods yet uh and uh i guess we're all pretty data dependent from here on out absolutely um yeah the the the data is going to be the thing leading the market is an interesting place to be nfts you know last week nice transition yeah it's just just a nice soft transition to something that matters a lot less global soft landing policy i guess the nft price floor actually i was looking for a um dashboard of kind of the the biggest like by market cap uh nft projects and i found this nft pricefloor.com someone sent it to us we can include this from time to time but quick recap david what are we looking at just like maybe the top five how big are the top five nft projects by floor cap yeah so i really like this measurement floor cap which is the price floor multiplied by the number of assets which is basically what a market cap is judged by the floor uh so coming in at number one of course board ape yacht club floor cap of 857 000 ether followed by crypto punks at 714 000 ether that that gap is way closer than i thought it was uh once upon a time like board apes were like almost three times uh uh crypto punks now they're almost at parody followed by mutant apes other deed for other sides moon birds uh clone x i don't know what that is uh and then auto glyphs do you know 857 the board apes equates to about 1.5 billion i don't want to know 1.5 billion that's the value of ten thousand four eight nfts right now but there's not enough there's not that much like liquidity there there's 477 uh ether that was traded in the last 24 hours decent volume i guess i wonder if like um nfts continue to become more financialized if uh we'll see this kind of you know free up a little bit do you know what i mean like to your point they're super illiquid right now but like what happens if you can kind of lend against them borrow against them uh i don't know does that change the liquidity of them yeah i think it should yeah that's interesting anyway we'll look at this from time to time to see the health of the nft market uh let's move to i i expect there to be different things there in the future i would not expect like this remember do you ever remember um what was it coin market cap before there was coin gecko and like look looking at like the total market cap in 2017 like it's it's completely foreign to what it is now because like things rotate out of like the top ten i expect i expect there to be big rotation out of the top ten oh that's a good take yeah so you don't think crypto punks uh you know stays in the top five okay crypto punks in the in the top five dude is it crypto i just i was anyways i got this nft project to chill yeah crypto punk maximalist okay um merge david do you want to talk about the merge i do want to talk about the merge ryan how did you know i wanted to talk about the merge it's so exciting okay this is happening and i guess uh you know quick tease in the market section today um this is from d5 surfer more than 7 billion of annual cell pressure it's 20 million dollars of daily cell pressure will be eliminated the day the merge is complete how press reminds us of that yes this is not pressed but something that he would say going to be fireworks for the month following the merge if you saw this chart david but again once again we're talking about post merge ethe issuance is going to be reduced like 4.1 percent to 0 hopefully negative in the negative territory right i hope so um and that's an 87 reduction incredible issuance reduction of 87 percent the triple happening it's like three halvings in a row if you're used to kind of bitcoiner uh terminology and that is happening so if if the test net is happening in early august we'll get to what that means for like potential mainnet deployment but we know what this means for issuance is a massive amount of cell pressure will be removed from the market at day one so ryan i just want to help put into context how big seven billion dollars is off the top of your head do you know how much capital how much dollars micro strategy has purchased of bitcoin not how much bitcoin that they have in dollar terms how many dollars they've used to purchase bitcoin i'm gonna i'm gonna throw i'm gonna throw a number at you okay you ready to catch okay hit me two billion four four billion okay double they have spent four billion dollars on bitcoin and with this with the you know post-merge ethereum basically gets we have this current equilibrium of where we are now and post-merge we have this a new equilibrium which is equivalent to a seven billion dollar buyer coming in yearly every single year dollar cost repeat until history ends more relevant michael sailor even yes much more reliable like michael taylor's out of cash i don't know if you've noticed but his like cash that he's bought is like now he whenever he's like oh michael cellular about bitcoin it's like he's adding point zero one percent of like to his to his uh stack yeah seven billion dollars yearly yearly yeah what's great what's cool about this too is like if you're an eth holder every time the ethereum block space sells some blocks to somebody which is what this is ethereum's selling blocks you get money how great is that it's so awesome i mean anyway we're excited about the merch uh let's talk about this going into the merge all right this is from felix hartman and this is a total market capitalizations the good old bitcoin dominance chart this is what felix says we're well into the bear market yet unlike the previous one bitcoin dominance is still bleeding lower while eath dominance is on a steady ride rise eth is now a mere 120 percent outperformance away from flipping bitcoin did around 120 performance outperformance from january 2020 to september 2020 so nothing crazy david before is the flipping back on the menu sir okay so flipping has always been on the menu but also people are like oh one day like ether might flip bitcoin like all the all the eth people say that me including um but like people like forget that like the flipping is just the first flipping like then there's the second flipping and then there's the third flipping like where you just start lapping bitcoin over and over and over again like you're allowed you mean like doubling like yeah you double bitcoin then you triple bitcoin and then you quadruple bitcoin yeah come on man don't don't grave dance on bitcoin okay i see it can be number two and be fine i'm sorry but fundamentals are fundamental what do you think about that what do you think about this take because i've seen this increasingly and it happens whenever um eth is coming closer to flipping bitcoin especially in the bitcoin maximus community it's like if you flip in bitcoin you destroy the entire store sovereign non-sovereign store value meme like you kill it all it's one of the many many ass backwards takes out of the bitcoin maxi camp what they mean to say is like if you flip bitcoin well then you like you remove the king and then you just make it so like somebody can flip you yes no the correct take is if bitcoin gets flipped by the second chain then it'll probably get flipped by the third chain and it'll probably get flipped by the fourth chain too it's a problem for bitcoin if somebody if something flips bitcoin it's because they effing deserved it because their fundamentals are strong not because i'm like magical oh we popped the the immaculate nature of bitcoin and it's like manifest destiny to be the biggest crypto ever it's that fundamentals matter and bitcoin hasn't been paying attention to would you say the same thing david if ether got flipping and i will remind you either got flipped xrp yes flipped it right at one point in time something else did too i missed for calling this uh xrp maybe xrp twice it was bitcoin cash bitcoin cash as well yeah so did did xrp and bitcoin cash deserve it were you talking about a flipping that is more sustained in terms of more system yeah more sustained and like not when markets are just super illiquid and young and also that happened during the irrationality of the the bear market like but it's simultaneously when xrp flipped like yeah flipped to ether ether was also 80 which i would also say was extremely irrational that was just a rational time in the market i um i also find it ironic that um like kind of if you're a bitcoin maximalist your whole purpose in life is to actually like flip in gold and not the whole thing and like well if gold can be flippant i don't know that that is the king by bitcoin like i don't know it's just like of course better stores if bitcoin flips gold the world just destroys that's what a gold maximus might say peter schiff gets you on the podcast um no no no have you ever heard him speak oh god yeah it's awful i i haven't in a long time it's been a while actually he's one of those people where like his macro takes are super awesome his asset takes are terrible hmm yeah i know those people i know those people all the bitcoiners those people don't have enough eath let's talk about this for a second this is the maxi hats are on today sorry toning down i'm just excited about the merge david um he who controls the infrastructure controls the universe this is greg tweeting this out and this is a kind of an org chart of um sbf sam bank but freed um beloved uh crypto banker and he has been on a buying spree this cycle right um assets that are kind of like have depreciated massively other crypto banks bailed helped bail out um blockfy and i think the take here is that's great uh sam managed his money very well and is very well positioned for this it's also a little bit alarming to me to see even more consolidation in the c5 space like all of the the companies that managed to stay healthy and retain a balance sheet are now buying all of the companies that didn't and so what we get the result of like all of these kind of acquisitions is further and further consolidation and centralization cz is also doing the same thing and i'm just like okay these are smart business people i get it but it's another reason why defy looks like very hopeful and very bright is because we've always been concerned at bankless that if we just replace one set of bankers with another set of central bankers we haven't really achieved anything in this whole crypto journey and like i'm not faulting sbf or cz for being like responsible and good business people doing this but i'm just saying like this system is kind of broken if it's all consolidated with a new set of bankers like we got a new jp morgan on the scene and he's sbf all right coming up next like i said three heiress capital is on the table they speak suzu and and kyle davies they did an interview with bloomberg they actually said word so we're going to read out some of the quotes to hear what they have to say i'm going to go ahead and put on my fed cap for that one saying like if all the words that coming out of kyle davies and suzu are not their true selves but instead an act because that's probably what they have to do in the moment anyways after that coinbase insider trading opens the window to for the sec to target the entire industry so there's two parts of the story a uh insider trading a coinbase that's bad but just like kind of an open shot case the what the sec is doing as a result of that is terrible and needs to stop and now it's triggered the attention of the cftc so we're going to get into all those details and more and the rest of the show right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show

gives us maybe a little bit of closure on this story but the story is kyle davies and suzu who are the founders of theories capital and definitely in the spotlight they spoke this week it's their first interview wasn't on bankless it was on bloomberg in written form and we have some of their quotes here david what are some of the choice quotes from this articles that in bloomberg three years capital founders break their silence over the collapse of the crypto hedge fund what did they say yeah first one comes in from suzu and he says people may call us stupid they may call stupid or delusional and i'll accept that maybe he said maybe but they're gonna you know say that i absconded funds during the last period where i actually put more of my personal money back in so that's not true like the absconding is not true um again like my take i was gonna say if this is the end i'll say here this kind of feels like a whole like pr stunt like why would three hours capital take an interview with bloomberg is because they need to they need to fight their image right now because it's probably relevant in court uh that's my take i'm going to go ahead and poison the well here with that quote number two uh from the from the article advisors in charge of liquidating the funds said in the july 8 filings that sue and davies hadn't cooperated with them and that the founders whereabouts were unknown sue said death threats had forced them into hiding quote this does not mean that we've been that we haven't been communicating with all relevant authorities said zoo in the telephone interview with davies and two lawyers from salter llp we have been communicating with them from day one again um again pr management again it is my take is my take uh quote number three this whole situation is very regrettable kyle's debut says many people lost a lot of money yeah but it is very regrettable that is certainly true uh quote number four uh efforts by sue and davies to deflect blame are a sharp contrast to the pair's previously relentless campaign of cheerleading crypto assets and belittling critics nerves were raked in new this week by creditor claims that the founders put a down payment on a 50 million yacht before the fund went hunter a claim suzu said was a part of a smear campaign the boat was quote bought over a year ago and commissioned to be built and used in europe suzette he rejected the perception that he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle noting that he biked to work and back every day and that his family only had two homes in singapore that's it he just lived on the poverty line here you had two homes we have never been seen in any clubs spending lots of money we have never been seen you know kind of driving ferraris and lamborghinis around sue said this is kind of smearing us i feel it's just a classic playbook of you know when this stuff happens when fun blows up then you know these are kind of the headlines that people like to play quote number five what we failed to realize was that luna was capable of falling to effectively zero in a matter of days and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions suzette after after that day when bitcoin went from 30 000 to 20 000 that was extremely painful for us says kyle and in that that ended up being the kind of the nail in the coffin uh last quote for kyle and i there's so many crazy people in crypto that we kind of that kind of made death threats or all of this kind of noise said sue we feel that it's just in the interest for everyone if we phys if we can be physically secured and keep a low profile i think that is maybe it is in the interest of everyone maybe not it's definitely in the interest of kyle davies and suzu to be physically secured and keep a low profile that's for sure yeah and of course death threats uh are are not cool that's probably that's probably true they are probably actually getting death traps yeah i believe that i mean that is a legitimate reason for for um hiding but like i i death threats and not cooperating with the council did you hear an apology no did you hear it i heard that it was very regrettable [Laughter] you know maybe we made some mistakes along the way that yes um i read this article because it was fascinating because as i said before like i feel like i wanted some closure from this sure because like i can't hearing this now if you're just new to crypto i can't describe to you how revered these guys where three years capital yeah where during the there was like the traitor gods traitor gods greatest traitors to ever live like just this is just what it felt like crypto twitter and the broader community kind of bought up like you want to see the the best traders in the world it's suzu kyle dave's three years capital um and so i wanted to understand how mechanically they went bust right from their perspective and this is what i gleaned from the story between the the quotes about yachts and such so how did three years capital go bust number one they failed to manage risk yeah kind of report to go bust quote quote from the article we believed in everything to the fullest not the kind of thing you want to say if you're managing risk and by the way these are not just lessons for three hours capital these are lessons that are applicable to us right how do we not fall in the three-hours capital track so they went all in on these speculative projects they used margin they didn't hedge it's kind of like gambling if you're approaching crypto like that it's not the way to do it number two they got wrecked by luna we failed to realize that luna was capable of falling to effectively zero in a matter of days what happened i think david is something that can happen to you everyday investors people on the bankless journey is you get fomo you get in this case alt one fomo and what happened was through his capital missed a number of big alt one run-ups right they missed that whole solana thing that multi-coin and friends got uh got in on and so they started to believe their own narratives they wanted to play catch-up and they added risk in an effort to catch up they didn't have to do this but they wanted to get more out of the alt one narrative and so they went in on luna and they went in big big also avalanche i think yeah um number three they got wrecked by uh staked depending from eth the quote from the articles are there people who uh there are people who also leverage long staked eath versus ether who will get liquidated as the market goes down the answer that question is yes so they didn't appropriately manage the risks when they were entering into kind of these um uh these markets uh that were somewhat obvious right of course you can't make the assumption that dye is always going to stay pegged to a dollar you can't always make the assumption that steak diet is always going to maintain its peg with eat and if you are margining and risking some of your assets based on that assumption that is a bad move number four they got wrecked by gbdc as many people did because everyone did it then the trust went to the discount and then went um to a far bigger discount than anyone thought possible so like during these kind of market events things can happen that you don't expect like gb tc depending in such a big way and they didn't consider that and then of course like they didn't do the classic thing of they weren't ready for bitcoin to go to 20k right this is again bitcoin went from 30k to 20k that was extremely painful for us that ended up being the nail in the coffin crypto investor are you ready for a 90 drop in your assets okay and last beer cycle eth went down by 95 percent right i knew many a good crypto investor who got their positions liquidated hello and something like maker dow all right it's like these people are great investors full full confession i was one of them too there we go where's that co-op i think we both would have that poe app well i did like so i didn't get liquidated but it came closer than i ever want to feel again all right so like you got to be ready for these drops summary of the lessons for us from the three years capital bust number one how do you avoid this in the future they went bust because they took too much leverage they believe their own hype they bought the top on speculative assets they weren't ready for a 90 draw down and they invested more than they could afford to lose at the end of the day this is basic stuff it's almost noob level stuff right it's the stuff that we all need to embed deep in our psyche if we want to survive on this journey and i think the final lesson from all of this is the pros aren't always what they seem okay the traitor gods didn't end up being gods after all you got to do your own research don't listen to what david and i say don't listen to what suzu says do your own research on this stuff yeah yeah there's a there's a there's that quote that everyone's an expert in the bull market so like it's it's more about being an expert in the bear market that's that's where true colors show up what what is the uh the fallout reaction from this uh this interview like it wasn't very favorable no there's a number of uh yeah the block put out an article that that had some reaction takes to the bloomberg article and so a quote from the block article says one disgruntled party told the block that they were absolutely disgusted after reading the interview and said stop hiding and deflecting blame and own up to your own mistakes cooperate fully with the relevant parties and do not ghost those involved with this and a second quote from arthur hayes and this is this one's awesome arthur hayes no stranger to controversy he's the guy that got charged by the cftc for operating bitmex was scornful in a threat on twitter taking issues with sue's claim that he wasn't flashy come on y'all sue ain't flashy he rides a bike to work and then to the marina where his super yacht is moored only two homes bruh you straight summoning it in the kampung aka tangling i don't know what these references are uh rich people referencing there yeah rich i'm assuming rich neighborhoods in singapore maybe uh he referring to different singapore neighborhoods yeah there it is that's the story case closed that's what we can learn i hope we can move on from this and i i know we will david let's talk about this next item which is big coinbase insider trading and i think there's two pieces to this story why don't you tease up with both those pieces yeah yeah so the first one is just a headline right uh coinbase product manager arrested on insider trading charges you know kind of more or less the full story you kind of get it there's not really too much crazy there um two individual brothers profited by 1.5 million dollars in illegal trades on 25 different crypto assets and at least 14 different separate coinbase public listings and so the idea here is that coinbase lists these tokens these people that know about it ahead of time buy the tokens and then they sell the tokens after the listing after the token pump uh coinbase has been like listing a lot of like just ridiculous tokens lately like ones that i don't even think are on uniswap of all places wait really yeah i don't know if that's true but it's like the names of the tokens are like like uh what was that what was that right uh let's go brandon coin like something yeah stuff like this bad tokens it's like already questionable uh so like they're kind of digging themselves a whole but anyways these two brothers charged with uh doing illegal trading um but that's like the much smaller side of this story the much bigger side of the story is that the sec is charging these two brothers for trading illegal securities and that's where so much collateral damage comes into this whole entire wait are there there's two charges here one is like wire fraud yeah which is the like the base charge right but they're also charging them for uh legal securities yes so the the sec is is claiming that the assets being traded are securities and so they're taking these two brothers and there's also a third person a friend uh and they're taking these people to court for wire fraud and for and for trading secure illegal securities so what this does ryan is it implicates coinbase as an illegal securities exchange it implicates every other exchange that also trades these assets as an illegal securities exchange it implicates uh the issuers of these tokens as issuers of unregistered illegal securities and the worst part about this ryan is you know who the defendants in this case are these three bro these two brothers and this other guy oh so they're picking they're picking on them right i understand they were they're at fault there's a real wire fraud yes charge here no one is contesting that but the sec is trying to make a broader point i suppose in court right yes and so the it's like say these these people like plead guilty i think this is the way this works these brothers plead guilty because they don't have the resources to fight the sec and the whether or not they trade securities is not their fight they they're fighting whether they should go to jail and not over wire fraud they don't care if they were securities or not who does care is coinbase and the token issuers who aren't defendants and so since they're not defendants they can't stick up for themselves because they're not involved in the case it's ridiculous it's actually the most spineless move i can think of like it's it's it's like okay so yes wire fraud front running bad yeah the thing they did charges inexcusable like we have a legal system for a reason let's use it to its full extent it's the securities thing that the sec is sneaking in right that implies agenda okay let's see what uh let's see what jake travinsky says i'll read it um the sec alleges in today's complaint that nine digital assets are securities but don't explain their analysis for even one right they also didn't see the issue is or exchange where the tokens traded the people with resources to fight back they just went after one man and his family it's hard to overstate what a mess this will be the sec's jurisdiction turns on whether these assets are in fact securities this means the case may require nine mini trials one for each asset to resolve their security status without the issuers or exchange to defend any wow this is like a winning on a technicality is this what the sec is trying to do here in order to push its its um i guess regulatory apparatus into controlling more of crypto yeah yeah it's super super nefarious uh jake had another great thread which we'll read here um the sec filed a complaint yesterday accusing ten companies of violating the securities laws nine digital asset issuers and one exchange none of them are the defendants in the case none of them will get their day in court and if this isn't regulation by enforcement then nothing is here's a threat defendants are three individuals coinbase employee brother friend et cetera we've already talked about this uh in addition to the sec sec suit the doj indicted them for criminal wire fraud uh blah blah blah um friends downright uh to be clear i'm not trying to excuse insider trading of course another we that's what we're saying uh the sec alleges that the defendants committed securities fraud by using material non-public information to trade ahead of coinbase listing announcements to establish jurisdiction the sec claims that the assets in question the nine digital assets are unregistered securities as far as i know the sec has never addressed these assets before we've learned the sec's views on the facts patterns that it believes uh qual that it believes qualified them as securities for the first time in a federal complaint rather than in guidance or rule making this is regulation by enforcement it's not uncommon to learn for the first time when an enforcement agency has identified a violation when a complaint is filed but typically that happens when the agency files an action against the person who they think broke the law this is different very different here the sec isn't just accusing the defendants of breaking the law the sec is also accusing 10 unrelated uncharged companies are breaking the law nine for failure to register digital assets areas and one for operating under an unregistered national securities exchange despite leveling accusations against uncharged companies in public the complaint is devoid of legal analysis they didn't even give any analysis as to why the tokens are securities the sec just makes a few allegations of facts and then similarly some similarly concludes that they satisfy howie but surely these are the howie tests which is kind of the legal court justification for why things are securities in the u.s yeah to win the sec must prove that one or more of these assets is a security in a real sense these companies are on trial too but the sec didn't name them as defendants they are only allowed to defend themselves in court they are not allowed to defend themselves in court on principle this is deeply unfair and unjust yes uh that's probably a good place to wrap it up it goes on yeah you know there's a lot more to this but i think i think we kind of get the gist um okay so that's what's going on um besides the defendants who are in this like regrettable position of like also trying to defend against uh the sec here um coinbase wrote a post fighting back here the title of this blog post is coinbase does not list securities end of story this is by the chief legal officer of coinbase the tldr is coinbase does not list securities on its platform period i think the cldr is all we need to read just read the title uh yeah and it's like the tone of this is like hey sec f off we're not we're going to secure i don't even know like why are you saying these are securities you're providing no justification for why you've given no clarity despite the crypto industry having asked for this for like the last seven eight years and now you're just blanketly uh saying through this enforcement action that certain things are securities or not right i get my question though is david is this actually in in one way sort of a good thing in that like the sec will also have to prove in court that these nine assets are securities i don't know maybe some of them genuinely actually are securities i can't like attest to you each of them right it's just the principle of like we have no idea what's the security and not there's there's no clarity we have absolutely no clarity from the sec and they keep pointing to the howie test which is like was it 1930s 1940s legislation about an orange grove has not been adopted for the modern world and certainly not adopted for the world of cryptocurrencies and they can barely say bitcoin is not a security they barely say that and sometimes they say eth is not a security and other times it feels like some of them try to to wheel that back a little bit too right and so we have absolutely no clarity even though some of these assets are clearly commodities and this is what the sec is doing and i don't know what the end game is or why they're doing it david yeah yeah um i i think this is just a state an illustration of what happens when one agency just gets off the rails and tries to do a power grab and so the cftc is playing in this game as well so they they release a statement and they release a statement that starts with a quote which i really love and the quote is in the world words of federalist papers number 49 the people are the only legitimate fountain of power and it is from them that the constitutional charter is derived government is and should be the servant of the people and it should be fully accountable to them for the actions which it supposedly takes on their behalf and so first principles baby yes first we yes we love the first principles thinking and then they continue the case scc versus wahid the one of the brothers is a striking example of regulation by informant enforcement the sec complaint alleges of dozens of digital assets including those that could be described as utility tokens and or certain tokens related to decentralized autonomous networks are securities the the fact that the cftc is making a public statement about the errant nature of this of the sec that that's a big deal yeah this is the commissioner saying basically to the scc guys chill chill like joe gary right okay you've gone too far you're crossing some lines here and it's not even clear that this is sec's jurisdiction right right i mean there's some turf war between the cftc and the sec and the cftc so far has been much like more pro market innovation right and not enforcement right uh like through um through enforcement regulation through enforcement and the problem with that ryan is that like the cftc is like okay like you guys industry there's some rough edges but like good job keep going let's see let's see where this goes we'll like be relatively hands off bitmex no no bad we're going after you but like for the rest of you guys like keep going cautiously and then the sec is like oh cftc you're just like leaving this open for us we can have all of this we'll take it like we'll take all of it it's the same reason libertarians never win elections right right just because it's just like the tactics they use just you know aren't aren't working so the bigger government policy uh ends up winning but this is really hurting coin stock i don't know if you've seen this david but uh coinbase shares tumbled 21 and this was right after the report that it's facing an sec um probe i guess that's what you call it being probed by the sec uh sounds lovely uh coinbase valuation look at this since ipod that's brutal yeah we got a bear market here of course sure but like it was ironically i i think when coinbase ipo'd yeah that was the top of the main market uh felt like the top of the market man um it's kind of funny because i'm like kind of bash coinbase at these prices ironically you know what it takes for it to be especially bullish coinbase for the sec to get just like a leash on it yeah through the court system i mean how where else is the leash going to come it's got to be executive order which doesn't seem to want to bring that in or the court system um this is interesting as well related unrelated who knows kathy wood of arc she's bitcoin uh bull of course arc invest they just sold nearly 1.14 million shares of coin at all time lows of 53 dollars and their average purchase price was 254 dollars so down bad on that trade it's called down bad yeah i um i guess like a take as a reminder take here is i feel like a lot of people are trying to solve problems through regulation right now in the coinbase like so even if you think about the coinbase insider trading problem david um what if we just allowed everyone to list assets and there was no such thing as front running imagine that we don't have to imagine that that's called uniswap right the take here is stop trying to solve everything with regulated crypto banks that's what the genslers want the answer to listing uh front-running is unit swap where anyone can list the way to prevent another celsius is by using ave where loans are unchained we have the solution it's called defy i do think that d5 doesn't solve everything right but it does solve some of these problems here including lack of transparency in a black box we have the celsiuses and the block files of the world and also including coinbase front running if you're listing asset on uniswap anyone can list any time there's no insider information whatsoever for an asset listing and it eliminates the problem completely you eliminate the need for regulation that is the model for defy or the regulation happens on chain and everyone can be a regulator anyone can audit this thing at any time that is the better solution than uh you know clamping down in a big way part the whole point of labeling something as security is because of a information asymmetry like if you are the issuer or the manager then you know things than the buyer does and that gives you a bunch of power a lot not everything you are you you just said that d5 doesn't fix everything so we're alluding to the same thing but like d5 fixes a lot of the information asymmetry like the majority of it and it really reduces information asymmetry so like sure uh like a 10 people could get together make a dow issue a token and that might be considered a security because you have these issuers but like you know maybe you know i don't know join the discord see what they're up to if they if they allow allow that you can see their behavior on chain you can punch basically they're like um quarterly statements in real time right now so like a lot of transparency happens when so even if it's a security if it's a token on chain automatically there's so much reduced information asymmetry so i don't know genzler take it into account bro yeah what we're saying is there's wins for you gary if you come if you come to d5 look at d5 if you get back to base principles of what are we trying to do right more transparent fair orderly efficient markets there's some wins on the d5 front and we wish you would see that gary in the sec it makes us say it makes sense uh david this is not sad though breaking some good news some breaking news uh what is happening now with the road to the merge yeah the ethereum developers have announced the merge date for the gourley test net kind of weird it's weird to say they announce a merge date and then the date is arranged between august 6th and 12th well that's because of the way that this works they've announced the ttd which is total terminal difficulty which is basically a metric that is like related to the hash power of the gourley uh network basically as we get closer we'll kind of know this date between 6th and the 12th it'll happen the gourley night is going on of august uh which is the last test night before the merge uh bankless will be live streaming this uh and host some east acres probably anthony suzano if he wants to come whoever wants to whoever's big in the staking community wants to come we'll host them we're gonna livestream this merge if it all goes well if it all goes well ryan i give it four weeks till merge maybe five five maybe six maybe september september september wow if it goes well if it goes timber merge and the others have gone well i will see the others have gone well they will have gone they they have gone well enough to pass that test of going well yes correct correct this is big man this big big this might be happening guys we're gonna um stream it here of course we're gonna have lots of merch coverage for you so much that you be sick of talking about it uh we've got some other things to cover when we come back first poep and the wnba this is a non-speculative crypto use case love what poep is doing here secondly the uniswap token there's some fee switch rumblings they may be turning on the revenue stream we'll talk about that too and its effect on the larger defy token market before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode

back with a battle of the zk evms this was a huge theme during ecc week three different teams independently launched their zk evm road map scroll polygon and zk sync happened to just be zk evm week probably depending on when you're listening to this i am hosting a live stream with scroll polygon and zk sync today friday if you're listening to today 8 a.m uh eastern time uh and so you it might already have been happening happening maybe if you're listening to this very early morning it's about to happen we are hosting all these teams to talk about their zk evm uh but we have three different teams going after the zk evm ryan can you explain why we are so bullish on zkm it's ek evms and what the difference is between all of these various dk evm flavors so we talked about it last week why zk evms are important and it's basically because you can get all of the the goodness and expressivity of the ethereum main chain only in a layer two that is you know zk roll up secured and there was this um this term that was bandied about that like people like people have still have questions about of evm equivalents what does it mean how do you stack these platforms side by side and i thought this was a great illustration of equivalence so what you're trying to do is everything that you can build and deploy on the ethereum main net you want to be able to do the exact same thing have it be mirrored as close as possible to the ethereum main net on a zk in a zk evm world and the different zk evm solutions take different approaches to that if you're to kind of like boil a technical stack into three layers you have kind of like the the very low level runtime layer it's where everything is kind of eventually compiled down all the code that somebody writes in solidity is compiled down to runtime above that you have another layer the bytecode layer and then above that you have the actual language so in the case of ethereum on the mainnet you're programming the language of solidity in almost all cases and so evm equivalence and evm compatibility means some level of the runtime byte code and language layer mirroring what's happening on the ethereum side so starknet basically allows you to do solidity but then it transforms that into another kind of language that is called cairo and then it has its own bytecode layer it has its own runtime does not mirror ethereum closely um zk sync is kind of next uh it allows you to uh write in solidity and then it compiles that down but like the byte code and runtime are still different than the ethereum mainnet hermes goes a step farther and uh some of the byte code like at the kind of the op code layer is um basically the same as ethereum main net and then scroll goes the farthest where is the most equivalent to ethereum of all four of the solutions where it gets down to kind of the byte code layer uh and um you know the runtime of course is the zk evm that's kind of the difference between all of these solutions is you can sort of transport your your solidity code uh on starknet you you kind of have to learn some cairo on zk sync you can sort of port your solidity code same with hermes and scroll but with with scroll it has more equivalence to ethereum at the bytecode layer and these other solutions don't have as much though they have some well done i'm impressed ah yeah what is it some someone more technical is just gonna be like all of that was trash bad explanation but everyone less technical would be like oh wow thanks ryan he's really smart he's really smart let's talk about this uh hayden tweet david so this is the unit swap token it is printing money not the token but the product protocol what are we looking for yeah we're looking at we've seen this so many times before but this one is even the biggest the biggest discrepancy between the uniswap fees earned through the uniswap trading fee protocol 7.5 million dollars in one day versus ethereum's 2 million dollars so like uniswap fees up ethereum gas fees down um like nine million dollars a day average in daily earned fees for uniswap liquidity providers which is just crazy uh i mean we usually would talk about this in markets but there's more to the story this time so we have there's a governance proposal about the uniswap fee switch not necessarily to turn it on but perhaps about a redesign so this thing coming out of a latent cue sack fee switch design space and next steps and he begins saying there has been a lot of discussion around whether the fee switch should be turned on this in most of this discussion i see an assumption that using this fee the fee switch equals money going to uni token holders i think this is limiting i'm not going to read out this whole entire proposal but there's conversations in the uni swap governance about the fee switch so like anything at this point would be great uh and anything is happening something is happening uh there is a podcast coming out on monday about dow governance and how doubt governance needs to get fixed in order to fix uh protocol fees uh so that's highly relevant that is with hazu is one of the best podcasts we've ever recorded but the fact that uniswap's printing money there is a proposal being actively discussed called uh fee switch design space and next steps uh yeah this is the these are switches coming so you're saying you think it might be i do it's it's not not coming at the very least we are i don't know if we're making steps in the right direction but we are not making steps in the wrong direction at the very end look i think that hassio episode is uh is perfect because there is this perception of like our our d5 protocols our blue chips are not broken like they just handled the recent crash phenomenally well they're still printing money from a revenue perspective but there's a perception that the tokens themselves are broken from a value accrual perspective valueless governance tokens has turned into an actual not a meme but actually exactly and so that's the discussion we have with um hasu is how do we fix that and i'm pretty optimistic that we will fix it and fix it this cycle and we're starting to see that in governance play out uh anyway definitely tune in to that episode david i've had this question of um whether i don't not many people are talking about it which maybe means like people aren't going to do but like you know it could i could imagine that the chain that gets forked you know merge and becomes kind of the canonical ethereum chain with with proof of stake right that will obviously happen but someone will probably continue to operate the ethereum chain in a proof of work environment like an ethereum classic classic type of no classic cash classic cash ethereum is oh is this a thing that's happening oh i don't know but i would imagine that what else we're going to do well like uh it just seems like opportunity do you remember that that time when um there was like i don't know 50 different flavors of bitcoin like bitcoin diamond bitcoin bitcoin private bitcoin gold bitcoin exactly cash bitcoin satoshi's vision around the time that a bitcoin cash forked right yes satoshi's vision all of these things you could probably append an adjective to bitcoin and there was probably a fork of that it was it was it was called the the um fork and fair launch era and it was equivalent to our d5 yield farm era but for bitcoin and proof of work like 2017 era 17 yeah 2016 and 20 so do you think anyone's going to do this uh yeah probably like the miners i mean like the it just takes a very minimum amount of coordination to coordinate on the new shelling point which is the proof of work chain that forks off of ethereum before it goes to proof of stake uh like why not well and the thing is like if some people do it then like traders do it and if traders do it then other traders do it and all of a sudden it becomes a shelling point i feel like all the people that would have done this are busy with their own chains though you know like um they've already made it to justin's son yeah right like you know he's got tron you can't fork in another ethereum uh sir you underestimate justin's son sir she could look the great news if you are an eath holder is of course you just get this coin too yeah whether it's valuable or valuable simple get it sell it free air drop free fork i will say that that you should sell it [Laughter] you never know david i don't know how fast or slow but eventually you should get rid of it okay not financial advice but you should definitely sell you should have yourself nft stuff david this is pretty cool uh oh by the way we didn't even finish we didn't even start that story the story this story story was a different story ant pool which is a proof-of-work mining farm for ethereum supports ethereum classic ecosystem with 10 million dollar investment ethereum classic is the proof of work ethereum chain that forked off of ethereum with a dow hack it's the one that has embraced proof of work ampoule a proof of work miner has invested 10 million dollars to support the ethereum classic ecosystem makes sense because these people have hefty hefty financial investment into proof of work and so they would love it if ethereum classic had a vibrant ecosystem so they could they could just like mine that chain and sell those tokens because like you go i mean what is the ethereum classic market cap ryan it's got to be under a billion looking at this yeah what are we marketing wow five five wow wow this is 8.5 billion my friend well yeah but it's also up 40 on the day oh it's been appreciating relative to eth recently yeah well doing this right yeah yeah and so what but also this like quarter trillion dollar network ethereum is going to turn like all of the revenue towards proof-of-work miners off and then like these miners that are mining this like you know quarter or 200 billion dollar network are all going to go and start mining this 8 billion network uh and so like margins are going to get real thin and so these miners are investing in ethereum classic because they need to pump up the chain because that's the revenue source maybe that's david maybe maybe that's why there won't be many forks uh or any forks of a pre-merged ethereum is because no there'll be one ethereum class kind of has that niche already yeah but but if you fork off of the most most recent chain you get a lot of like make or doubt and all like compound all these things are still like the contracts are on ethereum things like die will break because the ether price on the new ether price will go to like zero or like very very low like uscc is not going to be honored a lot of things that are going to be extremely chaotic on that chain but like i don't know like you can pick something up from the ashes for the enterprising young scammer it's just uh just long enough for me to sell just let me sell there you go hey maybe something could come of it i we shouldn't be uh so so yeah something has been more ether for me all right let's talk about poap nft stuff um this is roz saying i'm a giga fan of poe app because they found product market fit outside speculation and this is a tweet yeah a few have done that at in a stadium on the megatron uh scan to collect your wnba nft it's a co-app uh and this is a partnership with the wnba the wm mba releases like this like to do like what is this yeah and they say we're excited to announce that everyone attending the 2022 wnba commissioner's cup championship presented by coinbase on july 26 will have the opportunity to amend a free collectible nft called a poe app this is the first ever wnba issued nft and it serves as a digital proof that you attended the game kind of like a ticket stub or souvenir cool cool that's very good explanation of what a paw app is actually yeah right yeah good job guys and that's exactly what a poe app is um this is the poe app itself on public oh it's pretty gallery yeah it looks great and i think about 84 84 people no no um seven apparently 700 people or so input of their emails they're still you know we're we'll start working it something like this and uh you know but these are new people entering the crypto world that previously wouldn't have and these are definitely um more more than normy side right this is not a speculative asset use case it's nothing defy i guess it's nfts but all you had to do was show up to a game to an event that's cool i love that yeah so like uh 84 people got them so 84 people pulled out their phones scanned their qr code and had a mobile wallet to collect that poe app 84 people at a wa nba game had a mobile wallet that's kind of yeah um let's talk about this david there's a bill before congress bipartisan bill seeks to eliminate taxes on crypto transactions under fifty dollars if i had one of those kazoo things i'm like i mean cool but just under fifty dollars these are some of the that's not even dinner like if i have to pay somebody back for dinner it's like over fifty dollars right i mean i guess this is gas fees maybe sometimes most of the time on ethereum but i guess so yeah that'd be nice that'd be nice some progress i don't know it's something we have to see if that goes anywhere you know that it's something meme it's something i haven't seen that me but yes i see it now uh other news solana has physical store stores now it's like the apple store there is a solana store looks like in the background there's some t-shirts looks like there's a shoe over there yeah what is that um there's some nft uh frames as well um can i say anything more about this you know it's okay solana's got a store solana's got a store is it open 24 7 or where's the store i would kind of like to visit actually come on that was a funny joke would you say is it open 24 7 or is it close oh dude great uh edit that delete that we're going to don't don't do that that was a good joke let's move on uh chipotle buy the dip promo includes 200 000 in crypto for customers coinbase accounts the restaurant chain is also giving away two million dollars in guacamole and queso to celebrate national avocados oh god it's a bear market god next next thing you wanted to include this david so you have to live with it now tell us why this is significant for a roll-up sir oh coin chipotle has adopted crypto guacamole introducing introducing web3 subscriptions coming out of mirror this is a real announcement we're back to being totally serious mirror says that they are excited to announce the launch of web3 subscriptions this new feature allows readers to subscribe to any mere publication with their wallets and receive email notifications when content is posted for creators web3 subscriptions open the door to building a wallet-based community as opposed to an email-based community that can be used across web3 so basically rather than using your email and password you use your ethereum wallet and a big headline big like line that they title a paragraph is the future of community is wallet native big fans of that big fan big fan i like i really like what mirrors doing it's like you're the sub stack killer i don't know they're making some progress this is all about winning the hearts and minds of the creator community and i think that's better done with nfts uh david what's this as previous subset customers we would know uh wallet connection oh yes oh yeah oopsies don't jump the gun uh wallet connect say hello to the future of chat with wallet connect chat you can dm any user using any wallet on any chain so while connect to releasing a chat feature uh cool nice nice uh next i like this i want to do it i just don't know who to do it with david yeah i mean we have like we chat on discord right right on discord yeah chat you up but uh okay if ryan you want to take this one you should take this one yeah okay uh this is raises so we're talking about raises so aptos is a layer one chain that just raised 150 million dollars from ftx jump crypto and more and friends um i think aptos was the um former people involved with the dm project the novi project at facebook yeah so aptos consists of the leaders engineers and strategic talent behind years of development at diem and novi you remember when um dm was like a big thing and ethereum 2018 it was the blockchain that was going to come eat ethereum and all of the other smart contract chains it's called dm's best engineers in the game they were at facebook and they developed this uh not solidity this programming language called move well it's back now it's called aptos and i've actually heard in the developer community some some rumblings that move is kind of cool kind of works better in some ways maybe than solidity um that does not say much for the aptos chain i'm not sure about that but the same tech and it kind of begs the questions like you look at some of the investors here ftx and jump crypto besides aptos there's another chain that's similar to this that he also uses move rather than solidity it's called sue and so is this the rise david of the eighth killer killers question mark is this a solana killer around the roller coaster we go yeah it's interesting and the set of investors of course are typical investors who funded other layer ones in the past um the skeptic take here is rotator is going to rotate and we get a new crop of alt layer once every single cycle and here's another one i guess the more optimistic take is awesome more funding move is potentially a really cool technology who knows what these blockchains can bring to the table doing more experiments getting more funding for these experiments as well what's your personal take my friend um i don't know how to differentiate it other than the backstory of facebook i'll wait until i see a community there you go what what a reasoned uh rational take from my co-host here um also i'm just exhausted ryan are you hot in there do you have the ac off no i'm exhausted of all of all the uh i thought you're exhausted because we just did like a three hour podcast with blossom we do a lot of podcasts guys uh unstoppable domains they just reach unicorn status after their latest raise so over a billion dollars that's what unicorn means a 65 million dollar series a i don't how does unsolvable domains make money sir they've gotten drowned out by ens no they sell domains it's a good business model dot crypto i have a dot crypto i did not purchase it but i have one uh let's talk about you didn't give the money thank you bankless jobs board uh few cool jobs of course as always this is your reminder to what david what do they need to do get a job in crypto it's do you listen to how much fun me and ryan have i mean uh banquo's probably has the most amount of fun out of the company yeah everything's like this we do i mean we i'm just we have a lot of fun we watch you guys other other companies other companies also have fun yes um and so you should get a job in crypto because they are probably more fun than your boomer web 2 trade job oh there's also some bankless jobs alpha oh wow i wonder why i was talking about how fun it is to work at bank list but first vertex protocol a marketing coordinator that's non-technical uh bankless ux ui designer that's non-technical senior newsletter editor we are looking for that it's literally the best job on the market also non-technical really hard to do but if you got it you got it streams looking for a financial analyst steak fish i think is that is that non-technical it's definitely not that's non-technical okay yeah okay uh steak fish smart contract software engineer steak schedule back end engineer steak fish blockchain marketer that's non-technical steak fish front end software engineer steak steakfish devops engineer bankless academy product manager don't know what that is but it's definitely not technical uh bankless academy i know what that is up and coming i do know what that is but i don't know what they're up to guys there's so much for you there uh go follow the bankless jobs board at bankless.palette.com make sure you plug in your email you'll get these updates via email when they come up you'll know what the jobs are david devcon's coming up too yeah i should do a quick psa for devcon what's devcon about and uh what's some of the alpha around devcon yeah so it's a little bit like dev connect that we did back in amsterdam amsterdam was the first dev connect devcon this will be the seventh no sixth sixth devcon this one is held all over the world uh if i was on my game i'd be able to list off every previous city that devcon's ever been to even though ryan i have been to zero of them and i'm very bummed about that but i will be going to defcon number six uh so defcon ticket sales are underway they are release and tranches uh you can get your tickets at devcon.com en for english slash tickets or devcon.org oh dicey.com.org devcon.org for your tickets it's in pagoda columbia some people got a little bit turned off by like is that safe scary everyone's asking is it safe david vitale if italic's going i'm going and i'm gonna go anyways even if he doesn't look beautiful i'm definitely going uh like yo there are hotels and stuff it's fine it's fine um yeah uh it's gonna be great uh it's happening in october like 11th through 14th of october uh so i will certainly be going uh which is yeah i'm very excited there is also a special discount for um students builders uh and and particular students from latin america so we'll include a link to uh where you can find that as well um david we had some hot stuff coming up next including questions for you and i from the nation including is uh veblen good question mark i love this question what is it good another question what's ryan and david's life like when they're not working does that even exist who let that question in hot takes from crypto twitter of course we got a few hot takes for you as well we'll be right back but before we get there we want to tell you about these fantastic sponsors that make bankless possible zk sync is an ethereum layer 2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll-ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk-sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero-knowledge roll-ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk-sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk sync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at sync rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eath by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your note to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there hey guys we are back starting with the questions for the nation as a reminder if you have a question for dave and myself for the roll up get it in go follow us on twitter that's banklesshq on twitter if you have a question for the roll up we're throwing a thread out there every wednesday and just add your question to the list the first here this week is from mymoneyplan.cha is eth a kind of veblen good that is a good that's demand increases as its price increases like designer handbags the gucci the prada that sort of thing is a veblen good david what do you say ryan the answer is unequivocally yes yes it is and we have two ways of answering this question one we can just kind of reason about this um ether the yield the real real world yield as in like what you can buy with ether yields uh goes up when ether price goes up right and so but not uh how am i trying to say this okay so 32 ether gets you like five to seven percent yield at like one thousand dollar price it'll still get you a five to seven percent each nominated yield at one thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars so the yield does not go down in real terms as the price goes up which makes it desirable as price goes up because the yield is always the same uh we've also can see this in uh just the transactional volume of this thing whereas we've we're talking about today ryan where the the volume of uh gas markets or the the great prices super low because it's a bear market but when it was a bull market we had 40 400 500 600 sustained grey gas prices for weeks because as like as the economy heats up on ethereum more transactions happen on ethereum more ether gets burnt more yield goes to stakers and so as ether price goes up because the bull market is on the yields go up the eth burn goes up and the price goes up and so this turns into a positive feedback loop which is exactly what a veblen good is so this thing actually perpetuates itself forward now it doesn't do that in a short time frame it does it over like 10 20 year long horizons and so this like self perpetuating bull market i think will take a long time to play out but yes think this thing is a veblen good you also it also gets more liquid as the price goes up that's like a normal property of all assets but it's especially true of ether because it has its own native liquidity inside of things like unit swap and balancer and like all these exchanges and so ethereum provides ether its own liquidity which scales with price it provides increasing yields as price goes up so price goes up but yields increase faster in real terms not in these terms in real terms and so is ether kind of fed and good does it get more demand as price goes up the answer ryan is yes yes it does there it is all along eth wasn't luxury it wasn't ultrasound money it was luxury money all along that is a terrible plot of money gucci of money i do not subscribe to this that's what you just said david i quoted you directly let's go to the second question how does your day week normally look like in terms of uh work outside of the hours you record would love to know how you guys go about your days why don't i pull up the bankless calendar and see if there are any hours that you are not recording this week because i think you might be recording during more daytime hours than you're not recording so oh yeah yeah this week was special uh this week was i did a lot of podcast this week um well why do you answer when you're not recording what are you doing this week has been so far wake up at like uh seven in the morning and then and then kind of clock out at like 7 p.m go get dinner and then come back and write a little bit more for like an hour uh it's for the this week has been i like uh only bank that's been kind of insane what's what is it like normally it's uh that wake up at seven maybe i clock out at like five go to the gym go get a dinner with a friend and then i come back and start writing more i don't necessarily think that i have a healthy work lifestyle see how fun this is guys this is crypto well look man when it's a get a job in crypto guys it's also your job it's kind of hard to like separate i mean i have a similar schedule to you as like i wake up at like 6 30 7 30 i spend some time with the family um i have kids i have a puppy a dog i do all my family stuff and then i get into bank lists i'm usually like trying to catch up on what happened the previous day yeah it's sort of where my day starts so that's like email twitter discord telegram like digesting massive amounts of information and data and like sorting it putting in different places i i do all those same steps except i skip email but then i get discord messages from ryan saying see email see email or i will screen i will literally screenshot david an email force me to check my email show this to you here you go and as i just described it like information sorting i'm like oh my god am i an ai that was like anyway i do that for a while and then uh man we have so much going on at bank list if it's not the podcast it's looking at the newsletter trying to improve the product uh we're launching a new website we've got some other initiatives some member initiatives that we're doing and we have a team of things hang on we have to stop talking about bank list what he says uh fuma says would love to know what you guys do oh my god i misread it outside your work hours yeah it's outside of work hours no no how do we work sir so this is outside of the hours you record so i was getting to the other non-recording hours okay yes i guess okay so in terms of hobbies and such my hobby is also crypto and d5 and like philosophy and economics and history and all of the things that crypto touches so it's all it's all kind of one and the same i am uh i guess i love to read books i'm uh reading a book on kind of um you know there's a new christopher nolan movie coming out oppenheimer are you a christopher nolan fan by the way oh certainly so we talked about this okay so oppenheimer is coming out and i just recently started reading a book called the making of the atomic bomb that sounds great it is great david are you making fun of me no no that's a really interesting period like with like united states like we we kicked germany's ass and then we stole all their rocket scientists and then and then we started making rockets and the break starts before that it starts with kind of the scientists who actually discovered the physical property of a thing that hypothetically existed but they didn't actually know existed called the the atom the freaking atom and once you discovered that existed then everyone's like well what do we do with it and some brilliant scientists were like we can harness the energy of the sun from this thing both for good like it's just fascinating so it's all of these sciences i'm just saying that line in like the late 40s we can harness the energy of the sun look it's the atomic era for re reason anyway i do stuff like this i go on historical tangents i listen to podcasts uh spend time with my family um that's my life man you exercise for people you used to have exercise on your calendar in the morning right i used to i've gotten to it man yeah yeah i i've actually since coming back from uh ecc i've actually gotten into it i got i got some sort of lifting i got some sore glutes right now you know i used to lift right yeah yeah yeah totally like yeah you're a big deadlifter heavy as you but like yeah i have not lifted in like two years yeah it's been bad yeah i need to get back into this bank yeah i need to do this oh okay i also need to redeem myself because i said like like made it seem like i eat food and and uh do bank stuff and sometimes i skip the food stuff uh i thoroughly enjoy rock climbing so there's a rock climbing gym not too far away see so i'm i'm often there um uh also big big smoke salmoner i don't know i i was gonna say didn't know that but that doesn't uh doesn't land so well no yeah i smoke some real good salmon ryan really you have never had my smoked salmon but yeah you can ask my san diego friends the alfalfa boys can you smoke that like in your this might be a super noob question like in your apartment do you know where you can you cannot smoke stuff yeah so this was back in san diego but they're so like i've got this fire escape and you are not you are not supposed to put things on your fire escape at all um but like it's right next to my window and so i'm thinking about getting one of these like green eggs because they come in various sizes famous green egg smokers get the medium size and just like carry it through the window just share some with the rest of the apartment and no one will complain it'll be fine all right we still have one more question then okay uh very important question is bankless doing a merge watch party and how do i get an invite we are going to be a part of a merged watch party we will not be hosting the merge watch party the actual merge watch party will be done by the ethereum foundation on the ethereum foundation youtube and me and ryan will be there or at least i will uh and but it will be the gourley test net that we will be housing a watch party hosting a watch party did you just say at least i will dude i'm not missing the merge live event you kidding me i've just i don't it's virtual right i don't have to appear in person you know i'm going to be there yeah you can pre-record yourself and put it guys that's that's going to be really exciting how do i get an invite invite will be available everyone's on youtube on youtube the entire crypto community comes this is the biggest event in crypto i think since the launch of ethereum before that it's probably the launch of bitcoin this is like the third biggest event to ever happen in crypto are we over hyping this sir let's get to taking no no it's the biggest thing it's the biggest event in crypto since the launch of ethereum what's uh what's this take from cronk cronk uh ct sentiment crypto twitter sentiment in november 2021 we're all going to be billionaires in this super cycle july 2022 germans will have to eat their own cats this winter to survive oh wow that was dark it's a little dark but you know crypto sentiment runs uh real hot and then real cold real quick yeah right and it's been real generally counter trainable question mark good question sometimes um you got a hot take though how about i read this it's a hot take from david hoffman uh number one the 2017 bull market was ethereum driven explanation bitcoin had its own story but it was the ico mania at the center stage that wasn't the hot take that was the lead after the house that was the lead-up okay we're still building number two the 2000 uh the 2020 to 2021 bull market was clearly ethereum driven d5 nfts gaming number three the next bull market will be three three bull markets three out of three three out of three bull markets led by ethereum the bottom line ethereum leads rocket send that tweet to the moon we're not we're not done yet we're not done yet wait no that was not the hot that was not the hot take we got two more takes three for one package sorry i'm ruining david's incredibly hot take here uh the third ethereum bull market will be a fees-based bull market the merch will allow ethereum fees to actually move eth price unit swap synthetics mkr and all the fee commanding tokens will also lead the next bull market is based on fees the third tweet here's the hot take okay there's a hot take we're just building okay now you're ready for it yeah bitcoin's unsustainable security budget is actually not going to be a issue for like 20 years as eth goes through a 20-year bull market it helps bitcoin it helps support bitcoin price along the way there that was the hot take you actually said that in the tweet all right so it ended with uh basically the sun grows up and supports the father yep that's yeah what's that meme of like the uh the mutant ninja turtles who are like being taught by the dojo person and then and then the dope person personal and then the ninja turtles are super strong i i you know the star trek meme i see the star trek meme of like are we friends and the one that guys because no well the others say yes at the same time i've been kind of mean to bitcoin in this episode that's a bitcoin saying no we're not friends and theory i'm saying yes we are um okay this isn't a take but i thought that's pretty cool so i'll just put it in here this is tim baiko he goes first time here here being the seattle washington nft museum and i'm impressed beyond the art the museum also has a mainnet miner and proof of stake test net running so there's this nfc museum in seattle probably why this has showed up on my radar seattle's my hometown uh but also what we're seeing on screen here is what that one specifically is like this uh uh nano pools mining software and ryan this was like the beginning of the first like nine months of my life was like staring at this screen watching my miners like mine mine ether and like if you see if you zoom in you see these little like green words that say like uh you know unit confirmed and you're like boo i got one nice yay wow what a what a great date idea take your uh perspective uh date to the nerd museum in seattle here at the nfd museum and watch live proof of stake command line uh all right vitalik he had a great update at etc i watched the video it's about 45 minutes long completely worth it an update on the ethereum roadmap we we pulled out um two slides here and i think uh the big question here there's much more in his full presentation but the big question i think people have we included is what percentage of ethereum are we complete right and so vitalik has given the line before that the difference between bitcoin and ethereum is bitcoin is 80 complete and ethereum's about 40 complete that's a big difference between the communities um he actually said from his perspective about the ethereum roadmap that we are 55 complete once we finish the merge so just over halfway complete i want to ask you david so first first of all that that number 55 does that feel about right to you what would you have said about completion and so when we did our road map episode with vitalik he talked about there's like all this extra stuff that there's a chance that we just don't have the time to get it into ethereum before this thing settles and this thing this his talk at ecc is about ethereum settling down uh saying like we're about to go through this period of rapid change with the merge after that we need to let things like stabilize um but like there's a lot of things in the ethereum roadmap that like are kind of far out there um and we might not actually get to it before we like learn or accidentally unlearn how to coordinate which is a feature not a bug like eventually these things these blockchains need to calcify so i think when vitalik says that post merge we're at 55 done he's accounting for if we did absolutely everything on the ethereum roadmap and we never really calcified before we like were unable to get some of the last remaining things on um and so i think that's that 55 measurement what uh what are we looking at here because this chart i think tells a story here right and uh describe the axis for us and the shape of this uh line here yeah so we're assuming we're seeing an s curve right and the vertical axis is the capability of the system so as we go higher the capability goes up and then the the horizontal axis is of course time and then we have this we are here and where we are is like right before the steepest part of the s so we are on what vitalik is saying is with emerge we are on the cusp of the most the period of the most rapid change a lot of things are getting capability and and yes and increasing capability like yes um like blockchains aren't necessarily supposed to go through rapid change so this is a compromise that we're making because we know that we can make a more performant system higher capabilities of course but then what he's he's saying is like okay we're about to go through the merge uh and like that's gonna change a bunch of things after that like yo we need to chill we need to let things like steep a little bit like we need to we can focus on some other things other than the protocol also the developers need to break uh so like we're going to go through this period of rapid change and then we're going to chill but he's also saying he's also saying that uh over time you know big criticism of ethereum is so it's always changing it's like that's only the case right now it is eventually the s-curve kind of like curves down and it stops it ossifies to a certain level of capability and even in this chart not the x-curve not not the same s-curve the curve of the complexity of the system so the the chart that we were talking about previously was the capability and then this next chart that we're now going to look at is the complexity of the system yes and so the we are here is we are right up to the point of maximum complexity we're about to go into maximum complexity and so what vitalik is saying is once we get to that point of maximum complexity we should start becoming less complex not more removing things removing extraneous things you actually get which is the purge in the whole like purge merge whatever thing yeah exactly purge the great purge the great ethereum purge i'm here for it david those are the takes what are you bullish on this week you know ryan you know how i recorded a bunch of podcasts this week yes yes i do yeah i'm bullish on all the podcasts i record what's your favorite you have to just name one that you know i have three i have three um what are your three favorites uh so you know the cypherpunk t-shirts that we that we made out of the bankless style oh yeah i interviewed one of the names that's on the cipher puncture david trump david chum coming on the podcast uh so that that was just an honor the we we stand this crypto industry stands on the shoulders of giants uh and i got to interview one uh so that's coming out uh i also did this pod the food podcast the food podcast i've been talking about uh not what you expect but the cool thing about it is we use very similar words like uh anti-fragility and uh like the decentralization of our food supply and did you like did you crypto pill this nutritionist or was he he's already crypto pills oh really yeah he's already crypto pill so he like he leaned into this with me and he's like we like we have a debt to pay to our soil because we have not been like reintroducing nutrients back into our pay to our soil yes dude and so like we've had fiat soil this whole time we've had fiat soil and like now we need to like change our farm because we have been borrowing and pulling out nutrients from our soil leaving it empty and we need to put nutrients back into it we need to start saving nutrients more than we are borrowing nutrients this is some saffidina a mousse type level stuff here david dude it was really really no but it's really really good stiffening to moose is like is acceptable okay the best um but like we have to have this soft landing if you will of how we change the way we produce our food or else if we don't we're going to like overreach and then crash like these are the same principles of decentralization anti-fragility like savings and debt but we apply all of these same words that we've been using in crypto to like this food crisis that's coming it's like it's it's one thing when like we have a crisis in financial markets ryan because we can just kind of print money you can't print food like what happens as a result of that is people starve and so i actually this was one of it's a really good podcast from a content perspective but ryan it's also one of the like i think one of the most important podcasts that i've ever created uh because of like how important this information is you you have my attention sir i will be listening to this one please please listen please number three is all the ecc videos of the ecc interview with vitalik 30 minutes long that's out kane warwick is out uh i talked to kane about i think i'm teased this last week i talked to kane about his fight with suzu uh just talking about a lot of this content by the way is coming on youtube all right but special thing for people listening to the podcast primarily we are doing a massive content dump on saturday where we're releasing all is it seven or eight of these hcc episodes eight yeah all at once all at once that's just a funny eight hours but broken up into eight different episodes so you can you know pick and choose as you see fit yeah get the full eth experiment right so you'd listen to six out of eight or you know listen all eight listen to all twice listen listen definitely yeah yeah yeah there are all right add add reduced add reduce from six minutes down to like less than two minutes so you're welcome ryan what are you bullish on uh what am i bullish on you know what uh defy tokens okay so the hassu podcast that we are releasing on monday the theme of that episode was supposed to be um how we fixed defy tokens but the actual content was a bit more bearish and turned into a question of can we fix defy tokens and the truth is hassu wasn't 100 sold that we could and yet as we had this discussion about all of the flaws with defy token accrual mechanisms right now and the regulatory landscape that um exists the difficulties by the end of that episode david i was more bullish because i see these all of the difficulties that we outlined though they are um large are also surmountable right like it's these are problems that can be solved we've solved them before in humanity exactly and so i left that episode more bullish on d5 tokens particularly at their current values when you see like the uniswap we're talking about that case how much money it's printing david i was just running the math and 78 million dollars a day was that what it was like right 7.8 uh what was it seven point to eight million dollars a day seven point eight million dollars a day so what is that um seven point eight million dollars 400 and uh wait wait 46 50 million a year is what that amounts to is that it no no it's 2.9 billion 2.9 billion a year is it seven seven point eight times three six five is two point eight five oh yes of course yes sorry i was multiplying that only by six not 365 2.8 billion dollars did you get six frauds i don't know why the six was in my calculator instead uh proof of humanity right here i can't calculate everything um so 2.8 billion dollars and like that's just one protocol and anyway i am i am bullish on defy token in the future i think the problems ahead of us from a governance perspective are completely solvable um i think regulatory is an issue it's an obstacle but actually the constraints that regulatory have given us i mean we're growing in a different way in a different direction uh and they're okay and they they will also be removed over time so defy tokens is the thing i'm bullish on david i will have to say that the fees collected by unit swap 2.8 billion dollars of fees are fees that are paid to liquidity providers and you have to pay them so i think unit swap fairly might get five percent of those fees if it took a five oh that's a pretty steep charge uh but let's run that number 140 million dollars a year uh in revenue for unit swap if unit swap took a five percent cut on the point zero three percent average trading fees of unisop lps 142 million a year and what's the cost of that like very low a couple million right so this is kind of it's kind of close to profit at that level yeah um really cool i am similarly bullish meme of the week so if we can fix if we can fix d5 tokens by fixing dow governance we've got to fix our governance first true true that's uh that's the topic of monday's podcast david meme of the week what are we looking at in the week here we go so this is the famous friends meme where phoebe and joey are phoebe's trying to get joey to say the words and so phoebe goes re and joey goes re and phoebe goes se and joey go se and then phoebe goes eshen android goes eshen and phoebe goes recession and then joy goes risk on season yeah that's awesome which one which one are you positioned for ryan um i am positioned for both surprise phoebe and joey i got both sides that's the crypto barbell stretch that's going to go on recession the crypto barbell strategies all weather okay that means you have cash on one side you have crypto on the other side you get the maximum risk on and you also have the safe haven risk off and nothing in the middle
