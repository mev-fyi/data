[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david i feel like this is a long overdue conversation it's been a long time since we had polygon in the podcast and uh they've been doing a lot over the last like nine months or so since we talked to them so uh yeah fantastic episode with sandeep and mahalo who are the co-founders of polygon which is like a swiss army knife for scalability on ethereum what were some of your takeaways yeah this is coming right on the on the heels of all of this twitter drama that has been happened uh last weekend uh and that definitely set some of the context of some of the conversations that that we had uh we really drilled down into the the differences between there's a lot of chains out there that are forks of geth geth one of the original ethereum l1 clients avalanche is a fork of gas spinach smartchain is a fork of death polygon is a fork of death what makes these things similar what makes these things different and so we go into the differences between the security models for these things and overall talk about the in addition uh completely separate from that the long-term vision of polygon where i believe ryan you called it a portfolio of scaling solutions rather than a single individual scaling solution and also talking about um the whole uh draftkings becoming a validator on polygon uh the future of zk roll up tech on polygon and overall just the future of the entire portfolio as a whole yeah i think if you're like an investor in the space also if you're a user but you know if you're an investor you're someone building right so the key question the the industry is facing right now is like where is the future going to be right and there's the ethereum view version of the future which is like this modular blockchain sort of feature and then there's the alternative layer one future sort of the the multi-chain future uh version of events as well and that alternative layer one feature has really gained steam over the last you know three to six months or so correlated uh with prices predominantly but there's also been some activity on these alternate alternative layer ones and so i think this is an important episode to hear like you know polygons side of the story which is definitely very modular blockchain very ethereum centric so that you can make your own decisions right because like if you believe the modular blockchain thesis then you might believe a lot of these alternative layer ones are overvalued if you don't believe this thesis and you think that you know cheap block space is paramount and ethereum doesn't have the market cornered on you know good scalability ideas then maybe these alternative layer ones are justified in their valuations and maybe if you're building in the space you should consider building on one of them so this kind of lays it out and again this is this is polygon's perspective and they're very pro ethereum but also i think that like it's it's sort of bankless's uh take two we we do we have kind of said that we believe in the modular uh blockchain thesis ultra scalable ethereum we think it fits with um you know the values of decentralization that this program uh holds dear and so it's good to hear other builders in the space doing it so we talked about like the events of uh the the past weekend all of the pushback on on twitter and then we got into the actual polygon solution a lot of people don't know that it's not just one proof-of-stake kind of solution that this is a swiss army knife of different tools and technologies including some really cool stuff going on in zk roll ups what's also interesting i think is a lot of the narratives get spun on the back of token price i think and polygon is one of the few uh layer twos type solutions in the space that actually has a token which is interesting right optimism arbitrarium zk-sync stark where they do not have tokens available on the market so you know it's interesting for investors to consider relative valuation of of like matic versus everything else that's going on in the space so a lot of insights here uh as we dig into the polygon story and quick disclaimer i'm an advisor on this project i believe in what the polygon team is doing as well uh but i'm not and so we're good there uh and just for everyone to to know we had a little bit of internet issues uh mihawks in eastern europe he dropped off a few times uh same deep had some microphone issues uh we're gonna do our best to edit all of those out so bear with us a little bit of a hairy bit of content uh quality but uh hopefully we can get all those smoothed out in the editing process so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with me hollow and sandeep of the polygon team right after we get to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible matcha everyone's favorite deck aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage matra has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price masha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the default apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest it's been a while since they've been on it feels like 10 20 years have gone by in crypto we've got sandeep and mahalo who are the co-founders of polygon what is polygon we've done previous bankless episodes about it but if you're not familiar it's ethereum's internet of chains not just one scalability solution it's like a collection so it's almost like a swiss army knife of side chains and layer two technologies this organization is completely focused on scaling ethereum sandeep and mahalo great to have you guys back how are you doing you're doing great thanks thanks thanks thanks for having us here uh really excited uh and honored to be here this has become the the best show uh in the entire crypto industry and i think a lot of new people who join in like i was very surprised like somebody i uh in my family i asked them to join and then uh i mean to to you know know more about crypto and i think they found bank less on their own and they said yeah it's good and i said guys you know what we're gonna start with this there's been some um a little bit of twitter drama here recently over the weekend and i wouldn't normally start here but i think we need to because it's relevant to today's uh conversation and sandeep i noticed you changed your uh twitter profile accordingly it's now sandeep not abandoning ethereum is the subtitle and we just had a week uh weekend of well-known vc investors hedge fund managers stating their public abandonment of ethereum and here you are saying you are not abandoning ethereum so first question is sandeep why isn't polygon abandoning ethereum sandeep yeah so i think the the easiest answer is that because polygon doesn't hold the bags of other other layer ones right otherwise there is no reason to even discuss this uh you know i think ethereum forget about abandoning anything on ethereum um you know it i mean in in our mind it is it has actually already emerged as the global settlement layer for this web 3 like you know we have this uh internet of value and we very strongly believe that ethereum the network effects the the the native asset is has now properties of a hard money and you know for any layer one uh decentralization is the most important thing and to have that decentralization you have you need to have um that the the native asset to be a very strong and hard money because that is being used for incentivizing and disincentivizing the people who are running this network and ethereum both in terms of its app development uh you know network effects as well as the native asset uh capturing the capturing the the kind of features of uh you know hard money on both these fronts ethereum is way ahead of anything else and already that is the the scalability solution that are available on ethereum be it uh you know polygon polygons pos chain which runs on top of ethereum or it's like you know our layer two project products uh let's say uh polygon hermes which is already live with some production with some payment ready uh payment uh use cases or other uh you know layer twos like arbitrum stockwear have already proven that ethereum can scale on the layer two so it's it's only a matter of time uh you know where uh you know ethereum and the layer two scaling is going you know is going to completely decimate uh you know other uh kind of competition in that sense uh and you know establish itself as the ultimate uh layer for the three and we strongly believe in that so mahalo i you know i know we were having a conversation pre-show about sort of you uh getting off twitter and just getting to this place of zen and and by the way i i envy that because i could use some zen sometimes in my life and all of the back and forth that goes on in all of the various you know crypto social uh circles but i i want to in case some folks aren't as plugged into that i want to give some context the question i just asked sandeep and get you to weigh on in on this mahalo so this is the tweet that kind of started it all over the weekend this debate between like abandoning ethereum and going to other layer ones versus doubling down on ethereum which is what you know sandeep just advocated and gave his reasons for but this is the tweet that started it all this is from suzu who is uh kind of a vc fund manager at three arrows capital we've had him on bank list in the past two and he said this yes i have abandoned ethereum despite supporting it in the past yes ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past the idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn and concocting purity tests while zero members can afford the chain is gross and it's not just this tweet because there's tons of tweets that you know get sent out and no one hears them right this got almost 16 000 likes on it and i i believe that this provided a lot of people some validation of this opinion so i want to ask you mahalo what do you think is going on here what do you think was the reason for this tweet and why did it set off such a a storm in the the crypto conversations over this past weekend yeah thanks for the question as you said like i i'm personally really trying we have fortunately and luckily we're in very good position with polygon right now and we're extremely happy and humbled by all the success that he have seen in the previous months and we're really trying uh to to be laser focused on work and what basically our mission is and that is basically scaling ethereum bringing mass adoption to ethereum onboarding the first billion users and i think we are in a very very good position right now with polygon and we just want to be you know very serious about about what we committed uh uh to do and uh these things are um in in in the long term basically on long enough time time time scale they're just temporary i don't want to say noise but you can even say it like that it's just everyone has the right to to you know be within ethereum or abandon ethereum or do whatever they want and this is like an open open uh society basically and open community but i don't know like this seems to me uh um really seems like some sort of coordinated action number one number two uh um the dislikes that we're seeing on the street obviously they are communities uh um or at least bagholders basically outside of ethereum and uh there is clear interest now to to disrupt ethereum to take market share from ethereum it's not up for me to say that but i think that maybe when some people feel threatened by all the scaling activity that is happening including polygon it i think it's in a way maybe even becoming somewhat obvious that ethereum can actually scale with all these efforts with all the activity that's happening in layer 2 and on the scaling front um people are questioning you know their choices their investment choices among other things i guess there can be a bunch of reasons but the the most important thing is and what matters is where are the users where the innovation is and that is very clearly ethereum like there is like really zero doubt about it like that's where the users are that's what they're all the smart people are i mean oh 90 or 90 plus of the innovation and uh yeah i'm as bullish on ethereum in general and ecosystem as as like as ever basically guys what you think of this chart specifically all right because like you know let's let's try to steel man the argument just just a little bit right it's like i i totally understand what you're saying about like the the bag bias and you know you know pumping other alternative investments and you know no doubt that goes on um but like the the narrative of ethereum abandoning its users right because gas fees on mainnet are high the the the idea that users are livid that ethereum is just a whale chain that it's not defy if the only the wealthy can afford it that ethereum isn't shipping do you think that there are any points in that like any merits to that argument or would you reject them all and cindy i i kind of you know jumped in there so why don't i let you uh jump in first yeah so i mean i i i mean i actually also had a similar kind of uh conversation on twitter with someone is that you know when you see the adoption of polygon or when you see the adoption of starkwear or when you see like star pit solution that's a divided dx and things like that or when you see the adoption of arbitrary or even x die per se all of these are essentially the adoption of ethereum only adoption of evm evm users who own some addresses and then they can switch the metamask and then you know go to the go to the layer 2 side chains whatever you want to call it and you know i mean we have multiple times said that you know our our our kind of definition of ethereum scalability or scaling ethereum is not you know extremely narrow as that you know this only is layer 2 and this only scales ethereum we believe that there is a whole spectrum you have sovereign side chains and in original thesis of milo also has originally mentioned that you know there are probably 100 plus you know side chains or enterprise chains which are connected to ethereum similarly you have like the chains like polygon pos and all that all of this is actually adoption of ethereum and you know somebody was even saying somebody was saying that you know the dau on some other chain has become has has grown past ethereum and first of all that was uh you know was was was a wrong fact and uh then second thing was that if you combine yeah even if some chain let's say is starts approaching that dau but if you combine the dau of ethereum main chain you combine the ethereum a dau of uh you know polygon starkware and you know some of these other chains that you know that dau is way way ahead of any other thing that that you see so i absolutely don't agree with this do not agree with this this narrative that you know the ethereum is abandoning its users and all that is just that you know the the technology this is a very hard uh technology to build and you know ethereum achieved adoption before that you know scaling technology could come but now that is now it is here and then you know the layer one is kind of becoming that you know last time also i think we were discussing is kind of the manhattans obviously manhattan is costly it has huge amount of value going here and there and you know like i don't know any other chain where a independent investor who's not who doesn't have any vested interest in the chain itself or you know some part uh in in the in the underlying chain would put would be willing to put let's say 500 million dollar worth of their assets on on particular or maybe one billion dollar worth of their assets on any other chain except ethereum ethereum is the you know the the very essence of where you keep your uh core value so i don't agree with this this this thesis and then i agree that i feel that the gas ps are high because ethereum block space is highly posh like you know kind of it it it needs higher value to be transacted if you want smaller values to be transacted use any other layer 2 scaling solution or ethereum scaling solution like polygon pos or other solutions available out there i think this is a great point and by the way when sandeep is mentioning daus he's talking about daily active users which of course is an important metric for uh for scalability and how many users are are actively in the space but i think you raised a really good point about this kind of manhattan right it's like the you know the main the main chain is manhattan but when you talk about ethereum you can't just measure manhattan this is like saying that you know it's impossible to live anywhere in the united states because manhattan prices are high well like the united states is like it's a big country there's a lot of places there's like yeah all sorts of side chains and suburbs and like cheaper cities to live in you can live in all sorts of places mahalo do you have anything to add to this this idea that ethereum is abandoning users um what do you say on that yeah i absolutely disagree of course i guess there are several aspects to to consider there the first one is and the the maybe closest to to i don't know my heart is basically the technology or tech aspect so um narratives aside and whatever someone says on twitter like the reality is this we have ethereum ecosystem that has the main chain that is now expensive because the demand for the the transactions are on ethereum is very high and we have this whole fantastic ecosystem of scaling solutions the layer two solutions build around it and so many smart people so many smart teams working on these hard problems the alternative are alternative layer ones and like all of them or majority of them are using evm they're basically just a clone of ethereum that starts empty and in the beginning they can offer these cheap transactions and that's that's a given i mean that's that's uh simple but as the state blood grows as the activity on this chain grows they are facing the same issues like ethereum so uh to put it succinctly i from the tech point of view i don't see a viable alternative to what is happening on ethereum and that for me is the most important like i always try to put narratives aside memes aside let's look at the technology what technology here is there any alternative to what is being built on ethereum that can actually reach mass adoption and can support mass adoption and can support theoretically at least in five in the next five or ten years can support one billion users i really don't see the technology that can only happen on ethereum and that is what is what i consider the most important that is the the kind of essence um i i could say a few more things but i guess we have topics to to cover but when you realistically look at it and again from the tech point of view i really don't see any alternative approach uh and just something to keep in mind uh um is that people just need to remember that you're still very early like we are building basically this web free and this there's this amazing promise of this open financial system for everyone and uh to build infrastructure for something like that that is far from trivial and it cannot happen overnight and what is a real strength of ethereum is this decentralization there is no central party like uh uh no one including vitalik or whoever is controlling ethereum and controlling the innovation the innovation is happening full completely organically and and there's this as i said smart teams all around all over the world that are working on these hard problems and that uh that is like a real real strength of ethereum that's i'm really happy that it's happening things are happening like that because at this phase that's basically the philosophy that we want to adopt that we're trying to adopt at polygon as you know we already have multiple uh zk based efforts because we are in this stage of intense innovation currently and experimentation and we need to we need these decentralized efforts and with time they will start to crystallize the the these scaling technologies will mature become more robust be more reliable etc and we will slowly i believe converge towards uh several i guess solutions that can actually support uh mass adoption but this is basically a marathon and i think ethereum is by far uh the the best position uh ecosystem to to basically run and win this marathon so i want to play devil's advocate here and i think there's maybe some of the the newer listeners or newer entrants into the world of crypto uh these are some complex concepts to really wrap your head around and so what would you guys say to somebody that said well there really just appears to be this bias that people have where if you're building on ethereum that's good and if you're not building on ethereum that's bad and uh it's kind of like the the dividing line is there it's that that tribalism where uh a l1 a non-ethereum l1 experimentation is a waste of time and other people's resources but if you just do what you're doing on ethereum is good what would you guys say to to that critique so first of all like i mean i i mean i don't want to be demeaning towards any ecosystem like ecosystem building is really hard and some of the other layer ones have done a good work in in trying to build those ecosystems and they are in a very early stage where ethereum was like let's say five years back and things like that but still far away in that but that's that's good good part right but in terms of like you know the criticism i understand uh david and you know sometimes back i also said that you know because blockchains are as much technical as much social as they are technical so there is always bound to be some level of tribalism even like i go to an extent that if let's say there is there is a particular project community-owned project which does not have any tribalism that project does not have any real community right any project which has some real community will have some level of tribalism we'll have some people die hard fans who are you know willing to go to any extent for that right so so i mean that's that's kind of unnecessary and important evil i i i say to that right so um so but there is some level of tribalism where we simply you know from ethereum community might be discarding and some people can be really harsh on twitter but the other side of the story is that if you ask me how many teams who are building on these alternative let's say layer ones which are actually determined about building a product or which actually have a product vision and we who are not going for a quick token you know pump and you know that pump and get rich cycle or you know get some large grants and all that i i can because i heavily do this research on i can probably count them on on my fingers right how many good teams are there are some good teams but they are very very low in number right now so even though there is some tribalism and and you know there is that critique some people can be really harsh and they are the ethereum people are harsh within the community like you know there are people are extremely harsh on polygon at times like you know when you for for a variety of reasons but that's the strength of ethereum community we introspect we kind of question our biases like you know i mean i'm really i really highly appreciate you guys are also you know willing to kind of deep dive into it that whether there is any reality to it and that's the power of theorem community uh but you know in terms of like looking at good projects like some part of that criticism is actually true or not some part maybe like large part because 90 of those projects which i feel today are like mostly you know kind of not that much focused on building some product and doing some innovation but are chasing some sort of you know grants and you know rewards in terms of like token pumping and things like that so that's my opinion on that hello yeah i don't have anything special to add i generally wish in an ideal world there would there would be less tribalism i don't know in especially in crypto and crypto is a special industry because we have these crypto incentives on top of i guess human nature that is also not perfect at times so yeah it is how it is i guess but that being said um what i generally don't like i i am always in support of course of any sort of innovation any meaningful activity be it within or outside of the ethereum ecosystem what i generally don't really like and don't appreciate is more or less constantly you see this pattern of uh um trying to extract value of course you have ethereum that is absolutely uh the dominant player in web free of course and he has like a lion's share of the uh market basically like 90 plus percent i guess and these competing ecosystems are trying to capture that market share but in some way that i cannot always appreciate first you try to piggyback off of the technology in the community and then some sort of attacks uh uh are kind of um a common thing i guess there in a way and that's something i of course i cannot appreciate and then you have this ethereum's uh immune system that kind of was uh uh uh strengthened throughout all these years and fights with i guess bitcoin uh maxis mainly and then people have to react and ideally i think ethereum community is very very friendly very uh i don't know supportive of innovation and uh um inclusive in all sorts of ways uh but yeah um i just think um it might have been better for these projects to kind of try to add value it's uh it's better it would probably work better even for for ethereum competitors if i can give any advice to ethereum competitors don't attack uh i don't know try to add value try to contribute collaborate and i guess it will be better for everyone yeah well guys let's restore the zen a little bit we're done with that conversation right that's like twitter narrative side of things i think the way out of this as always uh for any uh technologist is you build right and so and polygon is building i want to divide the the rest of the conversation maybe in two parts first uh let's talk about the technology right so like all those benefits the decentralization that sort of thing everything you guys are building and then secondly let's talk about um the users because there are some cool applications cool sectors like nfts and and game five that we might want to talk to too and you guys are doing some really neat things with draftkings and others so lots of different applications going on in polygon but but first let's start start with the tech because as david was saying look there are a lot of newcomers in this cycle right you know 2022 people don't actually understand um the difference between block space on polygon or ethereum versus avalanche and solana right they just don't understand what the differences are uh and you know i i think we want to talk about the difference between polygon and some of these maybe alternative layer ones and i've got like three differences that i really want to drill into uh to kind of highlight this but but let's start at the top level the first is this understand i think people need to understand about polygon that it's not correct me if i'm wrong but it's not just one technology and one chain it's a portfolio of chains right and so this is a picture i i've seen often and i think we need to spend some time actually describing this picture and for for those of you listening in the podcast uh this is a kind of a diagram it's a hub and spoke diagram and in the middle in the hub there's this icon of ethereum so ethereum being the the hub and then all of the spoke positions are these various chains and this represents the polygon ecosystem but we see in these spokes different solutions right so we see something called polygon hermes and we see something called polygon nightfall and we see something called polygon proof of stake and then polygon midan and then we also see polygon avail and the polygon sdk right so like again that swiss army knife analogy okay like now we're opening up the swiss army knife we got the scissors we got the you know the the the pocket knife we got the compass i don't know what comes with the swiss army knife these days but let's let's go into each of these component pieces uh and we'll just touch them on a high level because i want to get back to what you guys are doing with with zk and i want to talk about the metrics of proof of stake but just at the high level what are the various functions of the swiss army knife so what are the chains themselves and the other pieces maybe sandeep do you want to kind of go around and give us the high level you know sentence or two summary of each of these parts on the spoke yeah yeah so i mean i will start and then you know me hello if some part you want to go deep on some of the things you can take up so um so basically as you know the the the story starts from here right so as we said that we consider you know ethereum scaling as a you know i mean as a broad-minded uh you know concept like we don't think that okay only this particular kind of solution adds value to ethereum so we think of it as a whole spectrum okay and on the left extreme of the spectrum think about sovereign like fully sovereign chains which have simple bridges with ethereum and you know some of those chains also add value to ethereum like you know with a simple bridge chain has having a completely separate consensus or whatever and then you know enterprises and if you go to like really big big you know kind of uh participants who want to come into the web 3 they all of them they don't want to be on a shared chain as of now because we don't have full-blown zero knowledge you know evm compatible talent available kind of you know chains available as yet so many of them want to choose polygon sdk type uh sovereign chains and we have some big examples you know soon uh launching some of the you know uh probably uh fortune you know 50 kind of companies launching some of their products on that similarly then if you if you start you know going from this left side to somewhere in the middle you will find uh something like polygon pos which is not a com not a separate chain like a side chain it is built on top of ethereum the consensus the validator set is on ethereum it checkpoints every 30 minutes just like any other layer 2 but that checkpoint contains less information so you cannot verify everything back to ethereum but then all the activities in the chain are posted on on ethereum and every transaction on polygon with relevant data can be verified that okay this happened on uh polygon uh you know pos chain so that is like you know let's say the middle part and then on the right extreme you will find um you know uh the pure layer twos which are actually putting both their data as well as the dispute resolution related to that data if something wrong happens in the off chain computation back into ethereum so they are very heavily pegged into ethereum they put all the data and um you know uh this thing and these are the like the most secured kind of solution the pure layer tools optim zika roll-ups but a problem with these kind of solutions can be that since you are putting all the data back into ethereum it can be costly right and some of the layer twos which have recently launched we are already seeing the cost to be five six dollar per transactions and things like that and they will scale you know linearly so but that's the that's the trade-off that you are taking with the security if you come somewhere in the middle between polygon pos chain and layer twos you might find solutions like validums where you have an off chain data availability where you don't put the data back into ethereum but you only put zero knowledge proofs on ethereum and you know the data is kept in an external data availability chain so idea is that there is a whole spectrum and you can provide solutions on the whole spectrum so if you see this this diagram and we actually should publish that spectrum also you will see that polygon you know the polygon sdk is on the left side of the spectrum then you have polygon pos then you will have the validum solutions which in which will include polygon avail as the data availability layer and then the validums uh with the you know weldom flavors of all of our zero launch solutions and then on the on the on the right extreme you will have these uh you know the the layer twos like zero knowledge roll ups because you know on the layer twos we are heavily focused on the zero knowledge because we believe and our thesis uh you know says that zero knowledge is the ultimate uh like you know holy grail for the ethereum scalability so we have not one but four different solutions on ethereum on the zero knowledge uh you know uh solutions out of which we have only announced three so there is uh you know something uh very exciting coming soon so you know stay tuned for that but then all of these solutions are having some sort of differences in their approach recently we announced polygon maiden which is actually a start-based solution which is like you know zero knowledge technology has two different uh you know kind of larger stream snark and starks and this is a stark based solution before that we had announced polygon harmons which is a snark based solution and then uh you know polygon nightfall which is very closely developed with the instant young which has privacy components to it which is very important to the enterprises so you know the polygon nightfall is basically part of our enterprise play which we believe that is will become more and more important in you know maybe 18 to 24 months from here so this is the larger kind of summary of this this ecosystem that we are building but all of these solutions are focused on providing additional scale uh on ethereum and bringing the mass adoption on here this is super cool and i i think a lot of people don't you know don't fully realize this and so so i guess the recap is you've got solutions at all you know the entire spectrum of the the whole decentralization spectrum right and as we said on bank lists before the difference between a side chain and a roll-up is a roll-up depends on the economic security of ethereum whereas the side chain doesn't and so you guys have you know a side chain right which is kind of the polygon sdk and then you have a polygon pos system which is like a souped-up side chain so it has some of the economic assurances of ethereum it's not quite a side chain it's a bit more advanced and then you have all of the zk uh roll-up solutions uh hermes which uses um did you say snarks and polygons zk snarks and you have maidan which is uh you know an evm chain and that uses starks technology and that's kind of new and then you have nightfall which is a rollup on the enterprise side of things and then you have something new which is coming down the pike so this this hub is about to get larger so i i think that is one of the key differentiate differentiation points is when you compare polygon to alternative layer ones you know generally people compare like the polygon pos solution to those alternative layer ones but all of polygon is really this um you know this this grouping this portfolio of different uh side chains and roll up solutions that is the entire ecosystem and that's a little bit different mahalo would you add anything to this yeah i don't have too much to add but these are all great points of course i guess what i can say is i can just repeat or iterate on what i already said previously so we really believe this we're still in a very early stage when it comes to building uh scaling ethereum in general and building blockchain infrastructure in general and again like we have uh millions of users on ethereum but we want 1 billion plus and it's still gonna take a lot of time to to to get there we have very good direction i think now uh but this is again a marathon this will not happen overnight and uh that's why we at polygon believe we have that i guess philosophy to let 100 uh uh flowers bloom at this point and we just want to become we want to facilitate innovation we are very fortunate uh um and humbled by all the success that that polygon has has achieved in in previous months since we were on on your podcast the the the last time and now we have i guess huge network effects we have a very strong treasury we have a lot of experience we have great team fantastic people on on the team already and we haven't even announced yet everything as as as we mentioned and i think we uh our mission and our uh how can i say duty if you want is to become the the innovation facility i guess for for for ethereum and we really want to support all meaningful scaling efforts and as sandeep said we are indeed a little bit biased we love we see merits of optimistic roll ups side chains enterprise chains we want to support all these solutions but we are definitely kind of biased towards zk based technologies because of several fundamental reasons and we recently published our zk thesis and alongside with it we committed one billion dollars from our treasury to fund the development of zk-based uh zk-based solutions and uh yes we are like uh heads down and working around the clock basically on introducing and then uh building these these solutions we will see along the way in the coming years we want as i said polygon to be at the forefront of these of this innovation and building these great solutions and they will slowly kind of converge in uh in my opinion towards several types of solutions and even in the long run like there will never be a one size fits all solution there will be not there will be no one solution to rule them all because always different users different projects will have different needs enterprises will never have the same requirements like uh native web free startups basically and small applications and we will always have uh several uh several uh scaling or infrastructure solutions in the ethereum ecosystem and uh yeah i think polygon is to to the best of might the best of our knowledge the only project that really follows that vision embeds on on all these solutions and supports all these solutions instead of focusing on on one solution normally we were just we're very lucky and thankful that polygon is definitely by far the most adopting now scaling scaling effort in the ethereum ecosystem and this uh pure chain that we introduced was definitely i would say an ss sorry a necessity so um we have definitely reached the point where where uh using ethereum layer one is it uh wasn't really possible for for average for average user i guess and uh and that's a good problem to have of course but um the ethereum community has really strong criteria when it comes to building infrastructure we make no compromises about some things like decentralization security etc and that makes the the researchers and engineers job like much much harder and of course we shouldn't give up on these these principles but i guess it's important to understand that sometimes you just simply need to accept some trade-offs at least temporary so that's what we did basically with the ps chain ph chain is not an ideal solution but it is a solution we just realized that we need ethereum ecosystem needs a scaling solution today like we could not have waited any any longer so we needed an evm compatible solution today and it was we consider it secure enough and functional enough and it has proven so far with i don't know like uh um 21 i guess million blocks produced without any major incident and uh all the value and 100 million plus users and 5 billion plus in tvl it has proven to be the right the right move basically to to keep users within the ethereum ecosystem and uh yeah now moving forward we are in a good position we kind of uh we provided some relief at least to to this pressing scaling need and now i think all the teams polygon and all the other uh scaling teams are slowly basically uh uh going into production with these more advanced solutions and i believe in i don't know in several years from now i i believe the the ethereum system will look impressive uh from the tech point of view mahalo one question i have that i think a lot of people might be interested in is uh we we have the the matic token which is the the token for polygon and most people associate that as the token for the polygon proof of stake chain it's the it's the token that you must stake in order to be a validator it's also the the gas for that proof of stake chain but how does thematic token relate to all the other chains as well is it really just for that one chain or how does everything actually connect to the matic token if there are so many different chains and and i'm actually curious even more broadly than the token is like is there any unifying force that like unifies all of these other chain solutions that we're just talking about on polygon that's a great question i mean questions but basically boils down to the same thing so dometic talking or polygons native token is the unifying force or is supposed to be the unifying force of all these uh solutions again like we are now really focused on on innovation it was really important to us to facilitate uh and uh uh start several great projects like the ones that we have now like polygon maidan and uh polygon nightfall and polygon hermes and the one that we are about to announce soon that was very important for us and we just didn't want to constrain yet these projects this is now the core the core process of innovation and building this bleeding edge cryptography and all the other components that are necessary for these solutions and then when these solutions are somewhat ready for production i mean along the way we are already uh working on redesigning basically our token that is something that we are not really speaking a lot about publicly because it can i don't know cause speculation i guess certain points we don't want that of course but the thing is that we have a very clear vision that polygons native token uh uh uh will unite and how it will actually going to unite all these oceans uh so yeah that there's definitely very clear idea on our head it's just that we don't want to impose and we don't want to do that right now we just now need uh to ship these core components that is the most important thing now and later the token economy uh uh will be adopted basically and improved we're already working on that behind the scenes to tie kind of old things together and i think people will uh generally i don't want to say love but i think we're gonna do some very interesting things there and we're very excited about it so if that's the first thing that's different about polygon just in general that it's just not it's not just one technology in one chain it's many different chains is this it's a portfolio it's a swiss army knife the second thing that's different that we touched upon a lot i just want to drill into that polygon really isn't pretending to be a layer one okay so like what's the difference between binance and avalanche and you know a polygon sdk or polygon side chain well it's like the polygon ecosystem isn't pretending to be a layer one okay and we'll get to the our point about modular designs maybe next but let's talk about that for a little bit so at the center of your diagram is ethereum which is economic security right we've talked about the role ethereum plays a little bit but i want to bring this up because it's it's interesting i think um for a while people in the ethereum community and people in the crypto community actually doubted polygons intentions a little bit i think and this is like look um the crypto ecosystem is best when it's like um you know verifying not trusting right so like that's what this entire industry is about so like i i totally get the criticism i totally understand it right and the the concern at the social layer was like hey we've seen so many eat killers buddy up to your etherium and pretend to be its friend and then just as soon as they get escape velocity just take out the knife and stab it in the back right and so the question is like is this more decentralized decentralization theater right is this another you're feigning friendship and then once you come big enough then the polygon is actually the layer one by by ethereum we don't need you anymore and that's of course a more centralized solution than ethereum uh natively but and i i feel like at some level you know because i saw some of this back and forth on twitter you know the last the first half of the year let's call it and there comes a point where you actually can't tell them you have to show them and i feel like recently especially polygon has been doing a good job showing them a 1 billion dollar investment in zk technology a heavy investment in zk roll ups you just talked about three zk roll up solutions a fourth one on its way apparently let me ask you the question sandeep do you think this has finally answered the critics on this question of is is polygon an eth killer or is it you know yeah ethereum uh yeah um synergistic do you think the critics have been answered finally are there still some in the shadows there yeah i mean the people who want to understand they they understand that understand it very clearly now and even before also you know people who actually uh cared to dig through they they realized that polygon even the polygon pos chain was never built like it is actually reside it resides on ethereum like you can't become a polygon validator by being by going to polygon chain you have to come on ethereum's take your you know uh polygon tokens automatic tokens and then become a sticker so even that chain was not never intended to be built like that why would we build a chain like that like we would simply build a bridge and then you know have it like a side chain so you know that actually is the narrative like i think always like that narrative has been uh you know painted by at times detractors or you know competitors and things like that but the sad part today is like ryan and this is actually i also wanted to mention is that you know like there is there is a there is a segment of the community which still for the retail still tries to kind of you know push that narrative that no this is only pos polygon pos is this is a side chain and things like that and conveniently ignoring all of these like polygon hermes these other things that we are doing and you know whatever uh you know a lot of things that you do for for the ethereum side and you know even though now we are uh you know launch these uh layer twos and all that many people will simply conveniently ignore and only talk about polygon previous so that you know they can nail that narrative right even with the for example that multisig thing that you kept hearing right all the layer twos have multisig all the ones right like name one layer two which does not have a multisig upgradable rights because you know this is such a new technology if you find a bug how do you upgrade that and then you know the same people even after having you know them also having the multi-six they tried to nail this narrative and that's exactly is the narrative part of the crypto community like some core people who run some of these uh alternative um you know chains or you know whatever they they know how to nail some some narrative into the retail and so that like everybody starts feeling you know knowing and nobody cares enough to dig through the real thing so as i as you said that polygon never intended to be a layer one and you know our conviction on ethereum when we started it was ethereum based and that conviction also grew uh you know at that point in time in 2017 when ethereum was also fairly new we always used to say that right now we don't see any other competitor emerging as a layer one if let's say in future ethereum loses out and some other maybe we can think of like but our conviction also on ethereum is like you know super strong because of the last three years of network effects multiple you know multiple you know kind of these waves d5 wave nft wave dow wave all of these have happened on ethereum itself and uh there is absolutely you know if somebody basically is still trying to pretend that no polygon is like you know trying to be aware one i would i would question the you know kind of intentions over there because it's very very clear if you if you spend like half an hour on polygon ecosystem you you you find it very very clear that we are absolutely uh you know focused and dedicated towards ethereum and i can actually as a founder i can you know i can say here that if let's say there is this situation happens like on a personal level also i'm saying and this is not like some part of tribalism or anything i have you know this is part of my conviction that you know if in future let's say polygons started starts focusing on somewhere else you know i would not be there like i'm so you know deep into deep into ethereum that you know i i mean i'm fully dedicated like as a team also we are dedicated and personally also fully dedicated towards uh towards ethereum and i keep citing a lot of things like this is actually you know uh like not not technical part but you know like why i feel that there are so many smart people people who are dedicating their lives uh toward ethereum because they feel uh you know owners of this network like everybody of the ethereum community feels that they own the network they are not building on somebody else's network this is not vitalik's network or you know ethereum foundations network and that is the core community feeling that ethereum has with among so many smart people i don't see it developing in any other uh you know any other kind of ecosystems and that also you know day by day every every day like strengthens our conviction on ethereum and you know hence we are dedicated on the team so let's talk about the we we talked about two things let's talk about the last thing which is the the difference between kind of alt layer ones let's call them and polygon is is polygon is really like embracing the uh the modular block chain design and becoming that execution layer okay and so if some of these terms are unfamiliar to bankless listeners i'd refer you back to an episode that david and i did on modular blockchain design go listen to that episode this is absolutely fundamental to understanding the future of blockchains and scalability that that's happening will include a link in the show note as well but a quick recap is the modular design in a modular blockchain design all all chains today are kind of monolithic including ethereum right now but it is moving into a modular design where you have consensus data execution and there these are three different layers and a quick mental model if you want to understand these is execution is what's happening so it kind of records what's happening at the moment data is what's already happened and consensus defines what's true and then in the ethereum modular blockchain design uh the ethereum mainnet is really the consensus layer does provide some data availability but there are some other data solutions too and then execution happens on the on the polygamy uh polygon side of things and so when we when we laid out like that the execution layer for for polygon you've got you know proof of stake and the sdk and all of these zk roll up solutions and then you've got also have polygon avail which is the data layer and of course this brings like specialization so i feel like many of the all of the other layer ones besides maybe tezos and near are pursuing this this monolithic design rather than this modular design that you guys are pursuing um but let's just touch in detail on you know a couple of the things here so the first is polygon proof of stake right so if we're going to compare that to like avalanche and binance smart chain i'm wondering if we could we could do that really quickly so one thing they have in common is they're all geth forks it's my understanding right it's like that's kind of the underlying but um how is polygon proof of stake different versus an avalanche or binance smart chain when it comes to resource management when it comes to like um the long term play like is is prove the proof of stake chain ultimately going to become a rollup maybe go into some of those differences because that is maybe a point of comparison like you could kind of compare binance smart chain to polygon proof of stake um what are your thoughts mahalo yeah sure so uh just take first a step back i guess um there are two components i guess to consider there so strictly technical we can talk strictly strictly technical and we're going to talk about it now i can cover that briefly the other component is this um kind of cultural or or a component or or i don't know component of intentions or i don't even know how to put it exactly but to try to explain it is that it is basically the reason why we see this layer once and why they want to capitalize on ethereum is because there's a clear market there so you have a very big player which is dealing with 500 billion market cap and it is lucrative to attack that market basically you have even if you capture one percent you're at five billion dollars you can make a ton of money there as a investor or whatever founder if you will uh um so there's a very clear incentive to do that and with polygon like if you want to do what we did at polygon at that time that wasn't really popular if you asked i don't know probably even some prominent vcs or big investors they would have told you that it's better you know to start your layer one because what is the actual market for these scaling solutions what market are we you know targeting or attacking here it wasn't really clear and with polygon we are one of the things we i'm personally very proud and happy about is that with polygon we prove we have proven by now that it is possible to capture value it is possible to add value to ethereum and at the same time capture value for the project and that capturing of failure was really important for us because it significantly grew the dollar the the value of our treasury in dollar terms and made us much more capable to to contribute far more to ethereum in the ethereum infrastructure so that is kind of a just a quick context uh before that and just uh some some just wanted to add that to what was said previously and uh that being said if we're talking about uh the ph chain for example compared to i don't know bsc or uh avalanche or whatever so there are several components right there uh first of all our whole validator set is implemented on ethereum and there is no other chain that uh that has done that and that means several things uh first of all it means that uh without ethereum our ph chain doesn't exist if ethereum shuts down if we imagine that happens i mean it's theoretically possible but uh if ethereum stops our chain also stops we cannot produce block seats in that way it's integral part of of of ethereum if you will it's like an extension of ethereum similar to a roll-up in a way the second uh uh second thing to to mention there is that uh we have periodical checkpoints where we actually commit to the ethereum chain and in that way achieve stronger finality for for the whole ps uh solution so once the checkpoint is submitted everyone can uh transfer the assets back back to ethereum uh assuming two thirds of uh two thirds plus one of the pos take uh has voted uh correctly and that's something none of these other chains uh support and the the direct and very important consequence in terms of security from from that design decision is that actually that transfer of assets back and forth from the pos chain and ethereum is secured by the whole validator set of the ps solution which currently i haven't checked the latest data but i guess it's above 2 billion uh at stake which is like basically huge level of economic security that is behind basically these transfers and it is to the best of my knowledge again like the the i guess by far the most secure bridge between any ev to evm kind of chains these bridges are normally basically operated by a small set of pa signers basically uh just externally on addresses basically that he have no stake whatsoever sometimes even a single uh single address so yeah all these things are adding significantly to the to the security of uh uh the chain and basically make important differences compared to uh these other alternative chains that we just mentioned and on top of that there is again that component of or or overlay of intentions i guess because with polygon it's obvious that we do not want to only extract value from ethereum we want to add value to ethereum we are really consider polygon an integral part of the ethereum ecosystem and the more activity we see on the ps chain the more kind of value the the polygon ecosystem and subsequently token captures ideally and the more the bigger our war chest is to basically continue working and contributing to to to ethereum and with us basically the third and the last thing i can say there is as you mentioned ryan we uh we would be actually very happy to consider upgrading the pos chain to to some more advanced architecture that is that fits into this modular uh ethereum modular blockchain uh uh philosophy basically by the way like we really like that philosophy in that philosophy i was like thrilled when i saw basically recently that whole concept of modular blockchains being uh widely accepted because that is the core of polygon philosophy that's literally what we uh set to build when we when we announced polygon these independent components that together can form different different basically architectures that fit different needs that's literally what we set to build so we're of course huge fans of of that approach and uh i'm pretty convinced it's gonna it's here to stay and that's the right way to do things and uh yeah just to uh to finish we are now in the process of building this advanced zk-based solutions once we have uh decentralized enough scalable enough battle tested layer 2 solution we would be more than happy to consider upgrading the pos chain to to uh to that specific architecture but we're not there yet no one in the industry he has that yet but we're all working around the clock working very hard and i believe we will definitely reach there stood enough and i don't see this any of these other chains that uh that we mentioned i don't see that even being mentioned or not to say on somewhere on the roadmap so there are i guess at least uh uh three major differences from the tech side side of the kind of intentions and basically when it comes to ethereum and how do you participate in the ethereum ecosystem and the third one are these plans for the future and the future architecture itself that was that was a fantastic illustration of the differences and i want to go back and just uh double down on on one of them in specific and that is uh the checkpointing that polygon proof of stake does with ethereum and then also what you said with the economic security of the actual bridge uh and so um you can actually maybe listeners don't know this you can actually go from ethereum to avalanche which is a similar um geth fork which is similar to what polygon is a polygon proof of steak is a death fork and there are two bridges one goes to the polygon proof of stake one goes to avalanche uh and so like as far as like the user experience and what the user is presented with so far like pretty pretty similar but the difference between avalanche and polygon is avalanche is its own layer one so you're going from bridge from layer one to ethereum to layer one avalanche using a bridge versus going to a polygon which is layer one ethereum to layer two polygon and what makes polygon a layer two is it check points itself to ethereum checkpointing is like um a save game right like there's the state of polygon that is progressing and then every once in a while it saves to ethereum and this is a fundamentally different than just reporting from a layer one to another layer one because as bankless listeners will know ryan here especially really harps on the power of property rights blockchains are property rights systems and the best systems that can ensure the best property rights assurances is what this whole industry is about do you actually own your own assets and so a polygon with this whole check pointing is actually tapping into these strong property rights that ethereum has and that checkpointing is not found on alternative layer ones because they are trying to be their own layer ones they want other people to checkpoint to that layer one um and so that is a fundamental difference is polygon has comparable property rights assurances that that ethereum does uh and and i just wanted to wanted to reiterate uh on on that point do you want to add something to that yeah thanks a lot for for saying that but i will just try to clarify it uh completely and just to we're really trying to be careful and we don't want there were a lot of debates basically uh uh when we started polygon and people generally don't consider uh pos chain as a true layer two in the sense that it doesn't fully inherit security of ethereum but now we're if we go there are literally opening a can of worms and there's a lot of details we can discuss there but uh still like as we said multiple times pos is solution that has certain tradeoffs trade-offs are mainly that the fact that there is still this independent uh validator set uh that is uh kind of independent that exists alongside ethereum and that certainly has uh a lot of power in the pos into ps chain but that is just the i guess again the solution that we really needed we had to accept certain trade-offs in order to ship something today basically and so far it has proven with these levels high levels of economic security with more than two billion dollars at stake you would basically need two thirds which means like 1.2 plus billion dollars to collude to actually try to do something malicious and then we can uh again debate there are some ways to mitigate even if this validator said decides to do something malicious uh it can be argued that we can still have we still have some counter measures or our ways to kind of defend in that case but again like pos chain is not the perfect solution we never claimed that we never want to say that but it is definitely good enough and it is definitely i would say quite a lot better than the alternative layer ones yeah and let's let's unpack that even more a little bit because uh so the when i say the checkpointing saves to ethereum that's backed up by the economic security of polygon not ethereum and that's the differences between a roll-up and a a proof-of-stake sidechain right where the roll-ups are secured economically secured by ethereum security itself polygon proof-of-stake is economically secured by its own proof-of-stake network of nodes which you're saying is uh two billion dollars worth of network security is that also tr how does that differ from the bridge between ethereum l1 and the avalanche l1 how is that bridge is that bridge also have economic security or is it just a bunch of uh multi-sig signers um if we want i i really like to discuss these things to discuss technology in general i just don't want to become to go too technical and don't want to i don't know confuse your listeners at any point but let me just try to also touch upon this quickly so um when it comes to security of certain scaling solution let's say we have these constructions like sidechains or polygon ps which is some sort of hybrid between a side chain and later layer two solution and these layer two solutions like roll ups so what we're focusing on is the community right now is the security of your assets and that's like super important like with rollups you can always take your assets back to ethereum so you have very strong property rights as uh ryan likes to say and that's fantastic that's like really important but we somehow also or often tend to forget there is another very important component of security and that is basically this operational or running security whatever i uh we can call it is basically the the what happens when the assets are on the roll-ups so currently the state-of-the-art roll-ups are these centralized operators and sen as if i'm a centralized operator i can basically do all sorts of things like your assets are safe you can always take them back to ethereum and me as an operator i cannot do anything about it but what i potentially do with some architectures i can basically censor your transactions maybe you want to i don't know prevent the liquidation of some uh wall that you have or whatever cdp or whatever and i can just simply censor your transaction and you need to submit it in the next i don't know one minute if i censor it you lose a ton of money and then i can potentially blackmail you like all these things i can front run you extract mvv so there's all sorts of things that when it comes to actually running the the chain your assets are safe you can always take them back but some other things pretty pretty kind of uncomfortable or uh problematic things can happen with centralized operators with the ps chain for example you have a fully decentralized uh operator set which is basically the validator set and there is practically it's not possible for anyone to censor you so it can be on it can be argued realistically that operational running security of the pos chain is actually much better than the operational running security of roll-ups in this point of time with the state-of-the-art tech that we have now so there are different components also there like security is is a complex thing always like it's it's not really and again i'm sorry i just don't want to derail the conversation too much it's just these things are i guess i just like to talk about it no i think i think but david's question was like you know how does it compare to other layer ones right you know this checkpointing of polygon there i don't think there exists any other uh solution like that none of the layer one solutions are submitting checkpoints to ethereum none of them is paying like we're paying millions literally in in ether and that heater gets burned through 50 59 then uh none of the other chains is doing that to the best of my knowledge and there is no economic security especially no not validator said that leaves on ethereum like none of these things exist with these checkpoints like you know some parts like you you actually summarize it very well that you know when with the layer one you take your assets to the other bridge i mean two other through the other layer one which right now are very extremely like you know centralized for example with avalanche i've heard that there are three sgx machines where three signers only sign in case of polygon there are 100 public validators who like 2x3 have to sign and all that but even if you leave that the checkpoint which is coming i think it was one i think it was one signer on avalanche or at least it was initially one maybe i'm wrong i was thinking yeah now there are three three sgx machines but you know if that got gets compromised it's like all three of get compromised like you know if there is one way to compromise one so it's like really problematic but the most important thing that david said that you know this checkpoint like imagine that you created an nft like you know there was a punk like project on polygon and let's say polygon chain stops existing it got it it stops sometime in future and all that right even then you can bring back that data if there is an archive of the data you can actually confirm that this this nft was actually minted on polygon that checkpoint that you have you can actually verify the transaction it's just that because the plasma is now depreciated and originally plasma we use only you know payment confirmations you could actually verify payments on the main chain uh you know you can't verify and and slash people on the other you can still verify but you can't you can't slash the val data slot for the for the other generic transactions so there's a long technical part of it but that checkpoint actually you know anytime in the future you want to check back the immutability of the transactions whether a particular transaction happened or not all of that is verifiable back to ethereum and the fact that any other layer ones is not doing that because they have an intention to kind of this is like an umbilical cord they can cut it down any time like okay this bridge is over and they have a separate ecosystem but whereas in case of polygon if this bridge is cut the chains consensus stops like you know that checkpoint is the consensus mechanism of the chain the reward how as a validator on polygon you get as a reward that you have to two by three of the validators of polygon they have to sign and one of them had to submit the transaction only then when they submit the transaction the you know the the ethereum smart contract verifies that okay there are two by three signatures and then they get their block reward so the even the block rewards of the tr of the of the blocks they don't get on polygon chain they get on ethereum so it is that you know intermingled with ethereum if let's say ethereum has an outage polygon chain has an outage immediately right so it's that connected with ethereum so i i loved your uh you know summarization with the uh with the checkpoints like you know what is the difference right yeah sunday point is great and if you want to say basically absolutely i don't want to go into any sort of tribalism of course again like but um in a sense that from the design point of view you i think it's fair to say you need to kind of bend the knee to ethereum or acknowledge basically the etherium as the hub but what we're doing and what we're happy to do at polygon uh in order to get these security benefits uh um if you're planning on you know staying layer one or being layer one from the get-go and then you don't want to kind of acknowledge you know ethereum as the hub in any way or depend on it in in any way as sandeep said you just simply cut off the the chase and uh yeah you're fully independent and uh with this like moving there is no like it's actually very hard to move and achieve these these same security properties if we wanted to move um staking to to the poi chain actually we're now working on the version three of the ph chain we want to introduce some significant improvements there and one of the improvements is we're thinking of moving at least parts of the logic of the staking to the pos chain basically with keep while keeping these security properties and it's really not easy do you know what uh somebody on twitter mentioned to me i thought this was really colorful illustration you talking about the benefits of just getting economic security from ethereums like what other layer one chains are trying to do is found an entire country in order to open a deli right it's like you have to bootstrap this entire security apparatus right and all you're trying to do is actually just create a set of apps you're just trying to open a deli man and it doesn't make sense to me long term either arbitrarium is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's

i presented the devil's advocate argument of there's all the this ethereum ecosystem and when the ethereum ecosystem sees this development going on if that development going on is on ethereum then it's good and if it's not going on ethereum then it's bad like that's kind of sort of like the tribalism bias that people you know critique the ethereum ecosystem about but if you want to rephrase that differently the reason why this uh this bias appears to exist is that when you are checkpointing or saving or rolling up to ethereum then you have strong economic property rights and if you're not then you don't and it's it's ryan and mai's opinion the the the bankless thesis is that strong property rights is what it makes this whole entire industry work the fact that you have your own independent self-sovereign assurances that you actually own the assets that this chain says that you have and so the the this tribalism uh which definitely appears like that is actually grounded in the same theses that prop up the value of these assets to begin with so like if you if you do the same exact behaviors on avalanche or polygon you get the same properties you get sped up blockchains you get cheaper transactions faster transactions but on polygon because it settles and checkpoints to ethereum you also have strong property rights just wanted to summarize that this section for the listeners exactly and this tribalism debit like you know one more part i wanted to mention is that you know why this trap i have also thought about that why this tribalism at times come from ethereum community is because many of the times the facts that are being represented by the other layer ones right they are at times at times they are outright disgusting like you know you start talking about that oh this ethereum has already been defeated and all that where you are like something is just getting born like imagine the amount of hacks that ethereum has happened and those hacks actually strengthen the ecosystem like i mean can you even you know imagine the amount of d5 smart contracts that have that that have you know been hacked on ethereum like i think it's been it's around two billion dollars and right now on any of these layer ones we have not seen many of those attacks because those like hackers are not even looking into it because you know it's not worth their time they're spending that time on clear and then when those hacks happen those wallet hacks those multi-six you know kind of that is the battle testing testedness of an ecosystem and that has not happened with any of the layer ones and then at that point in time saying that okay you know they can they can they they are on the path to kill ethereum and all that that actually you know at times becomes uh disgusting and that kind of fuels some part of the uh tribalism at times and you know i mean i just you know i'm just trying to say some of the trial ism at times is justified because you know it's like too much from the other side so yeah i definitely agree and i i think it's um you know many traders many people in the space many speculators are just playing kind of short-term narrative games right and that's that's a big reason there's an incentive to inject these kind of narratives and um this sort of thing into the space but you guys are builders and let's talk a little bit more about another thing that you're building in some more detail so it seems like polygon is making a big bet on uh zk style roll-ups right um and i want to ask about the difference between hermes maiden and nightfall so here's my high level sketch of it is nightfall is an e and y sort of collaboration and um that is a um that is more of an enterprise style of roll-up right and then you because it is focused on privacy because it's focused on privacy okay and then you've got hermes which at least at first appears to be a bit more payment type centric and then you have maiden which is the newest addition to the polygon family which appears to be a general purpose you know um evm like uh you know zk platform is that the difference you got privacy you got payments and they got general purpose evm or there's some more subtleties here yeah it's more more more you know more of it is correct but let me kind of summarize it right so hermes currently has payment live but they are also working on a full-blown zika evm right and how that and the differences lie in how that evm or the zk avm is being constructed for example compare that with polygon myden which is the third solution which also is expected is trying to build a zk evm but based on star uh star technology not snark hermes is based on snark right and then there are so i mean as i already teased that you know there are more solutions coming and then some of them will have slight differences let's say with hermes in terms of how the vm or the solidity code which is the ethereum code is being constructed and being deployed on the on the vm like how the virtual machine is processing that code those are the subtle differences which actually on the developer experience point of view create large difference large kind of differences although on the execution side it's almost the similar but the developer experience can be starkly different on on these two uh different kind of approaches so but otherwise apart from the evm like the the privacy evm or the uh the the polygon nightfall the purpose of other solutions is actually to build a zk evm like evm compatible zero knowledge roll-ups where you can pick up your smart contracts deploy and they still have uh you know ethereum level security using the zero knowledge proofs that's cool so so understand so and and i i think people have heard the hermes story before because um that that happened uh you know a few months ago but the maiden story is relatively new that just happened the last like a couple of weeks so can you talk a little bit about that story so how did maiden become part of the family who are kind of the developers behind there what about the technology talk about that for a little bit so maiden is led by uh you know the the developer with the pseudonym uh bobbin threadbear he was previously leading the winterfell protocol of facebook which facebook recently open sourced so he was the he was the lead researcher on that and he you know technically wrote 80 of it and uh you know i mean we were and this is a stark based solution and then uh you know bobbin was uh you know is is looking to build uh and his team is looking to build a zk evm solution which is built on stark and uh it is also um you know fully open source so you know that's where uh you know uh bobbin was developing this and he can already see that one of the reasons why polygon is able to attract these many you know protocol developers to its ecosystem is because of the the the app developer app ecosystem like many of the zk developers are like you know hardcore researchers right and they see that polygon has already built this huge developer ecosystem by the way i should share some insights on that so recently alchemy which is which is you know after infuriating or or you know i mean these are the biggest rpc providers uh that is linkages into blockchain they they are actually a new entrant into polygon ecosystem and they had published a report that they have now three thousand plus uh you know weekly active teams on polygon which is you know it's absolutely humongous surrounding apps sandeep yeah yeah these are these are the teams who are building apps if there are 3000 plus teams only on only on alchemy you can imagine that you know they would have at least 1500 to 2000 apps deployed on polygon right and similarly and this is only alchemy which is the latest entrant you have before that we have in cura before that we have uh you know block vigil and there have been tons of like other you know uh um um chain stack and things like that the the you know service providers and they have their own set of teams so probably you know if i just extrapolated i think polygon would be having like around 5000 different teams developing various solutions on polygon and that's absolutely crazy statistics also in terms of the the daily average users of polygon you know it recently surpassed like few weeks back in fact it surpassed you know the main chain also and uh it has that like now the da by dau it is probably the number one chain because a lot of other chains are not talking about the diu stats it's probably the number one chain uh in terms of as a as a platform where people are building these these apps so all of this dap adoption and also like you know when we were talking about various different layer ones by any measurable statistics whether it's the tvl whether it's the dau whether it's the number of dabs deployed number of uh developers working on polygon it polygon pos chain alone will be far ahead maybe 5x bigger than any other layer once that we that we are you know thinking that okay are going to kill ethereum probably and polygon is one of the small projects in the ethereum ecosystem so i mean i i don't want to go into that so so now we have a huge dab ecosystem and these developers and researchers they believe that if they build within polygon umbrella they will be able to achieve adoption because at the end people will be we have this ecosystem will be able to achieve uh or use this as a kvl all right guys we've been talking so much about kind of the technology side of things but the other interesting piece about polygon is of course the the apps layers like what do you why do users actually come to polygon where the apps and different features the stuff that users care about maybe that should be our next section and it seems like there's been some interesting pr around draftkings and i know david you've been following this fairly closely so let's talk about that for a minute and david what what's your question on this yeah i think it's it's really interesting by the way congratulations on uh onboarding draftkings as for using polygon for gay of sports bettings and i think everyone who's been around in crypto understands that sports betting is coming to crypto uh more or less a it's a very optimum use case for for you know crypto but with another interesting thing about the story is draftkings is also becoming a validator on the polygon proof of stake chain and as we know with these kind of juiced up guest forks uh it actually requires more intensive computational power more you know direct attention towards the actual validating of these networks because just you know you need beefy or hardware so is my question to you guys is is this kind of a security model for polygon proof of stake moving forward is that we have larger beefier nodes being operated by larger beefier entities like the security model for polygon proof of stake is actually secured by these businesses that are using polygon for their own products talk about the the model behind draftkings and them becoming part of the governance and validating process for polygon yeah so it's it's it's not at all about the nodes like even if draftking is going to run it they are also that you know one of the reasons like polygon nodes are still fairly light you know compared to a lot of other different kind of nodes uh in other ecosystems and then you still don't need like you know like beefier notes so this this is not about the beefier nodes this is about like polygon ecosystem or the validator set being run by the apps which are running on polygon and this is something that we want to promote there are all existing other apps also uh which which are uh you know trying to run there are you know you know enterprise partners like infosys who are running this and all that so not only they have you know people have stake in running polygon chain plus but you know apart from that we want more and more dabs to be a you know incentivized and encouraged to be running the validator notes i mean the the thoughts from these big weeks like you know i mean there are multiple such institutions and you know some of them uh you know in the past days you might have also seen like macy's you know did something on polygon dolce gabbana did something on polygon and most of these enterprises like you know when they approach us uh you know i mean you know we are very very surprised like you know clinique which is a multi-billion dollar brand like they launched nfts without even you know we knowing and that's actually the best thing that you know they don't even need any support from the teams because it's like so close to ethereum it's like san diego i read the nfl was doing something this is like a week ago nfl also launched some you know nfts hollywood is coming in very big way in polygon uh bollywood which is the indian you know like the biggest movie producer industry they are doing a lot of crazy things on polygon so it is kind of like uh you know becoming quietly becoming the you know the the the the web three layer where let's say many of these do not need a lot of money like they are not incentivized by the money they end up choosing ethereum and then for scalability they end up choosing uh polygon right now it's that that strong and then um you know in terms of some of these like you were asking that what is the what is their thought process the thought process is i think many of these publicly traded companies their thought processes start small like start doing something with the change learn along the way be crypto native and you know when we also talk to them we also tell them that you know if you kind of run your blockchain strategy advised by let's say big four consultants who are onto the enterprise side you will never be crypto native and some of these teams have very you know the good thing is that the the people from our community the crypto community they are like you know already uh a part of some of these uh blockchain teams in these big enterprises and some of the some of the ones some of the teams who are fortunate enough to have crypto native people they are um you know you know driving this or championing the cause of uh you know becoming crypto native and you know starting small so uh you know the the strategies start small maybe do some consumer things nfts and things like that become validators learn more and then launch more and more products on that but eventually i think the the intention is absolutely uh to become especially for the prediction markets and all that and we don't have time to hit on all of this but there's there's so much going on with polygon nfts which is really i've seen that sort of take off over the last few months also gaming and the metaverse as a whole so everything you see that's been kind of priced out of mainnet is is is happening in in polygon which is really cool to see and it's especially cool to see in polygon because you guys have such a nice on-ramp to even more economically secure layers like roll-up type layers as well uh you know one last question before we kind of wrap this up too about meta verses so you know when we are talking about meta verses a lot right but people don't realize that actually all the most of the top meta verses who are live their own polygon right yeah name a few is on polygon the biggest one sandbox is publicly mentioned multiple times they're coming to polygons somnium spaces polygons sandbox the guys with doing something with snoop dogg having snoop dog parties that yeah yes yes yes yes himself is doing something on polygon like you said there you go you know you've arrived so so yeah i mean there are like many of these celebrities are doing i think messi messi's nft drops were there on on polygon and uh you know like it's it's it's just uh absolutely you know crazy over there versus like you know meta versus like i think polygon is uh like i don't know fast becoming the de facto uh kind of solution for meta versus and gaming also like i mean i i want to leave users for with this with this interesting survey i would say that okay you know talk to randomly 10 different teams gaming blockchain gaming teams who are building web 3 games right talk to 10 of different different and then find out how many of them are building on polygon if six or seven don't tell you that they are building on polygon then there is like i am you know i'm being a liar here that strong only one is that strong in terms of gaming you know every game all gaming studios uh you know they they are doing something or the other on polygon i'll make it a draftkings bet if uh if sandeep is right or wrong on that uh last question fiat on ramps super important right how's that coming along with polygon oh i mean i think we again like you know we we like the best thing about this chain is that the most production ready readiness so all the on ramps that you that you have in the you know crypto ecosystem be it wire read moon simplex all of them are integrated with polygon and most of them are providing direct on-ramps onto polygon and that is actually one of the biggest attraction points for uh many of these uh you know builders and also like now with the you know uh coinbase has also publicly said that they are integrating polygon main net uh it's integrated with binance also so that is also you know going to add a lot of these network effects into it and openc being there also like you know the big add-on for uh most of the game developers and all that yeah it's it's amazing uh significant growth since we last talked february 14th earlier this year and i can't even believe it's it's only been like eight or nine months or so it's it's you know it seems like it's been years of growth here but let's finish with with this question uh sandeep so as we look forward to you know 2022 it's been a fantastic year for crypto in general but what can we expect in 2022 do you think and i want to ask this question maybe what can we expect from polygon and then what can we expect out of ethereum so two sides of that question polygon and then ethereum for what's going to happen in 2022. so on ethereum we definitely you know feel that you know we should go into the proof of stake mode like the merge should happen and you know ethereum becomes proof of stake and this kind of this nasty narrative against pow you know that is going around that also gets uh you know resolved ethereum gets some scalability out of it probably i've heard that you know i'm not sure but i've heard that you know the main chain will have 30 dps there'll be a big big you know kind of breather for all the people who are you know running layer twos and polygon pos chain also because it checkpoints into ethereum the costs will be alleviated a bit so that's what i expect from ethereum and then you know like like the ethereum engine is like you know uh like the momentum with ethereum is so big that you know it will keep happening and i hope i i just wish that you know we have one more d5 wave probably because you know d5 is in a limbo for quite some time and i feel that tread phi in coming into d5 will be you know probably become a very big theme uh in the next year and then we we might be in for one more d5 summer uh which obviously will be driven by uh you know ethereum as the main chain um then apart from uh from that in terms of polygon we like biggest thing that we are looking forward is uh the zero knowledge roll-ups we want like you want to be able to go live with some of these zika evms like full-blown zk vms in the first semester you know or maybe the q2 or something like that hopefully and then if that happens which you know it feels like right now if that happens then you know post that you know there is no limit to you know the the polygons adoption because we feel that with this uh and we are also building this data availability like polygon avail as the data will be chained so with the zero knowledge validums where you can have the data availability on this you know data availability layer and you know dispute resolution back to ethereum i think that could uh that could usher in a you know big scalability error for the whole uh you know web3 space and then you know we expect big uh you know applications and enterprises and web 2 startups coming into coming into web3 bet3 and you know probably opening the floodgates and probably having you know maybe 10 to 50 million um you know somewhere between 10 to 50 million ba use daily average users uh on on the web 3. that's what is our goal uh very very specific as well sandeep that's fantastic mahalo uh do you have anything to add to that uh so it sounds like sandeep is predicting 2022 is the year of scalability for ethereum anything to add uh 2022 is definitely going to be very exciting both for polygon and and for ethereum we are going to see uh finally some of these uh ideal evm compatible solutions layer two solutions hitting minute uh and some of them are gonna come from our side basically we have at least two that are targeting uh mainnet and uh evm compatibility in one way or another in the next year and that is going to be very very exciting of course and uh yeah in terms of actually usage will i hope to see some other trends we have seen this huge d5a which was amazing uh another important validation basically of ethereum's product market fit we have seen this whole nfd craze it was also very very impressive and onboarded a lot of people that were previously not involved in any way with blockchains and we were free like a completely new huge segment of people that is now basically uh entering that free and uh and i i would like to see some new trend personally i really like this concept of of play to earn that was pioneered by uh i guess sexy and some other games now and i think we might actually we might be on track to something amazing there in a sense that i imagine basically everything to learn concepts i don't know like learn to learn like uh do whatever to learn and we can basically uh i think open a pandora's box basically of innovation and adoption mainly uh there that is my personal um expectation basically so yeah a lot of exciting stuff of course but again like just to stress that once again nothing i don't expect anything to be you know ethereum will not scale next year things will not be resolved next year this is a marathon we still have years to go but it's only gonna get more and more exciting moving forward fantastic guys we've covered so much today i i hope listeners walk away with a deeper understanding of polygon and of ethereum's scalability roadmap this is really part of it you know ethereum is a rollup centered roadmap and you guys are executing on that roadmap as part of the ecosystem so we appreciate everything you're doing thanks for spending some time with david and i on bankless thank you so much for having us action items for you bankless listeners first is the zk thesis that was
