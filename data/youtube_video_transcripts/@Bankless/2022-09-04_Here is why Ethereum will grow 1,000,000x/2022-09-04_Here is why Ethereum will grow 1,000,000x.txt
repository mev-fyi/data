to put the entire universe on ethereum that has always been the goal ethereum's current state is a monolithic blockchain because it does consensus data and also execution on the same chain but ethereum's future is changing with the merge and then the future upgrades that's undergoing polynomial says monolithic blockchains are crippled by moore's law and will only grow 64 x over the coming decade modular architectures will grow by 1 million x at the same time when you have modularity you get to optimize for that specific module and what it is good for let's put the the consensus module in the consensus corner and optimize for that let's put the execution in the execution corner and optimize for that eventually we are all going to live on layer twos and these layer twos are going to have different flavors and eventually all of the flavors to do what ethereum needs to do to put the entire universe on ethereum that has always been the goal a modular blockchain is how you become expressive enough to allow for optionality for everything to eventually become something on ethereum
