I consider eth a volatile asset I do not consider it particularly risky people often mistake volatility and risk they can go down but that means they're volatile but if you held did you actually lose anything cash is now a risk asset right for me treasuries are much more risky than eat volatility becomes risk when one you use leverage or two your time Horizon is short or unpredictable that's totally how volatility becomes risk but volatility and risk are not the same thing
