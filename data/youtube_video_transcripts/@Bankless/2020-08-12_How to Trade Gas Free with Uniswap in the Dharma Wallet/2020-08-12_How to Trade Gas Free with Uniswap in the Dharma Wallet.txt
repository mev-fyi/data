[Music] hi everyone this is defy dad and this is another bankless tutorial today i'm going to walk you through how to use the dharma wallet to beat the high gas prices and trade with uniswap thanks to the subsidized fees provided by the dharma team so trading fees and gas fees are essentially being subsidized the rates can vary just because dharma is trying to account for slippage to ensure that trades go through and so the rate that you pay is often a little bit higher than what you would pay on uniswap but end of day there's huge net savings in using the dharma wallet with uniswap so i'm going to show you how to trade from ether to another erc20 token like lend i'm going to show you how to trade from an erc20 token to ether i also have the option of trading from dye to another erc20 token or ether or i can trade from another erc20 token back to dye or ether you will soon be able to do trades like this where i go from an erc20 token to erc20 token but for right now it's not available it's just because the dharma team is working to ensure that they can properly represent all of the rates and ensure these trades go through even when gas prices are sky high in order for me to take advantage of the subsidized gas and trading fees on uniswap using the dharma wallet i've got to get money into my dharma wallet first so you'll notice there's a deposit button there if i just click that this is what enables me to then deposit into my wallet so that's my public address it's similar to the email address anyone would use but it's to enable someone to send money to me uh in my wallet so if i have money in my meta mask wallet or if i have money in my argent wallet i want to copy this address below which uh use the little share button and it'll allow you to copy the entire address you know if folks are using something like coinbase or binance you can take this address and you can withdraw your money from the exchange whether it's ether die or another erc20 token one last note on this i want to make sure that i am dealing with an ethereum based token i cannot deposit any token into this wallet this is only for ethereum so that means tokens like ether like die like lend like snx it has to be an ethereum based token and if i'm unsure of that i need to go do some homework go to someone like coingecko and check to see whether or not this is an ethereum based token another way for me to get my money into this wallet is to deposit fiat so i could choose the debit card option if i'm based in the united states if i'm not then i don't need to worry about this and i'm strictly going to use the dharma wallet as a crypto wallet without a fiat on-ramp or off-ramp at least for now so if i'm using my debit card here i could say let's deposit ten dollars now notice that when i deposit money uh us dollars specifically into my dharma wallet using my debit card it is not withdrawable for up to 14 days it is available for me to trade immediately which is i think a huge convenience to be able to you know use that money immediately to trade from dye into one of the other erc20 tokens or even into ether and best of all i don't pay any fees to deposit my fiat the third way for me to get money into my dharma wallet is starting with a centralized exchange so this is traditionally i think where many of us deposit fiat to convert into something like ether or dye or usdc or some other uh ethereum based token so i'm going to use coinbase as an example i'm going to choose portfolio and then i'll click on usd coin although usdc has lots of drawbacks to consider namely the fact that it is a stable coin with centralized risk that allows uh the team that backs usdc to go in and freeze usdc in an ethereum wallet although that is reality i also recognize that it's a very liquid stable coin and it's redeemable for a dollar with coinbase so this is a really common on-ramp and off-ramp to get fiat into the system as an erc20 token and then send that to an ethereum wallet and then be able to trade into other tokens that don't have that centralized risk so i'm going to use this as an example i could otherwise buy something like ether or die what i can do here then is buy usdc with dollars and what i want to be mindful of is many people will go to coinbase and they'll buy with a debit card or a bank account and you'll notice you end up paying fees and these fees can really add up i mean three or four dollars might not be a lot to someone but it's the point of paying that percentage away even on a thousand dollars you're going to end up paying a lot more money 38 on a thousand dollars so the trick to this is you don't buy with a debit card and that way i will just get 1 000 of usdc and i won't have to pay the same fees and then send that usdc onto my ethereum wallets another way to get to usdc is if you have a coinbase account you have access to their coinbase pro and once you get there if you click on portfolio deposit you have this option then of going and depositing fiat directly into your account so if you do that you would then deposit let's say in my case us dollars from a bank account once those us dollars hit my bank account after let's say three to five days then i can actually convert that to usdc so you notice i'm starting with usd here i think i have like six cents in this account and then i can convert it to usdc and you can go backwards as well so it's it's pretty cool i think uh this is again one of the reasons that usdc is a popular stablecoin despite the you know huge drawbacks to it and the centralized risk that i think everyone should be mindful of and actually work to avoid so let's assume that i've deposited fiat into my coinbase or other exchange account and then let's also assume that i've either bought usdc or i've converted usdc uh using coinbase pro that converter that's in the portfolio tools and now i've got usdc now i can click on send which is available in coinbase pro or in this more like retail friendly version of coinbase and i can then choose to send usdc there we go let's pretend i'm sending 100 of this where am i going to send that i'm going to send it to the xerox address that is in my dharma wallet just like any other ethereum wallet that is the public ethereum wallet address the 0x whatever the heck the rest of it is that's what i'm going to use to send my usdc back to my dharma wallet i click deposit and then it's the 0x5f number and so i can copy that and then i can go ahead and paste that into my coinbase account to make sure that i'm sending that usdc to this dharma wallet so we'll go ahead and paste in that address and we're good to go there i don't need a note here this is just something that's convenient and then i would go ahead and hit send one thing i'm not showing here just because i don't really use coinbase anymore is when you do hit send if you have actual money in your account it'll take you to a preview screen and then it'll show you whether or not this address is real it normally shows like a little green check mark look for that make sure that this is a legit address because it's very possible that someone could copy that address and then let's say that they delete a digit or let's pretend that they just copy the wrong address that isn't a real address you just want to be really really careful so that once i paste that in i want to check the first several you know letters and numbers and those at the very end to make sure that i've got the entire address whether i have deposited my fiat into die using the dharma wallets deposit options through the debit card or apple pay or i've deposited crypto into my dharma wallet from something like a coin base or another ethereum wallet i'm now ready to trade so i can confirm any of those incoming deposits or transactions by clicking over to the right here and you can see a history of my transactions so here's me depositing ten dollars earlier and then if i scroll to the left or i could just click here at the very bottom of the screen on the like the little arrows that represent an exchange this is where i can do my uniswap trading using the current version of the dharma wallet i have a few options in terms of how i trade now i'm going to go ahead and flip it here and start with die i can trade between die and any erc 20 token i can trade between ether and any erc20 token including die and then i can trade the reverse of that i could start with an erc20 token but i can only trade into ether or die this is a limitation for now while this is still a rather new product and they're trying to ensure that all of these trades can be executed with the right amount of gas and that they're uh showcasing the correct uh swap rates from uniswap another thing to be mindful of is notice that it says die under dharma verified and then under that it says unverified i would be very cautious to use any token that is not dharma verified there are lots of fake tokens that are being listed on uniswap that's because it's permissionless to list a token if i go and create a fake token called the define dad die i can go on and then list it in uniswap just by providing that liquidity so let's go ahead and do a trade i'm going to go ahead and start with the die tokens that i have and i'm gonna trade these for i mean i could go to eth but just to kind of showcase the power of being able to trade from dye or ether into another erc20 token let's choose something else so we'll do lend by the way notice that i've got the eth lend token uh and then what's spelled similarly is the attendees token but i'm going to choose the eth lend token and then let's go ahead and trade 10 die for some lend so now i'm going to preview the swap oh and there you go so trade amount minimum is 20 all right just learned something probably has something to do with the amount of gas it takes just to push through a transaction and then let's go and hit preview swap so you can see that i'm going to pay 20 die for about 52.3 lend and i'm going to not pay any gas or trading fees but the conversion rate is 2.617 lend per die let's go check on uniswap what the difference is so it looks like for 20 die i'm going to get 53.58 lend versus the now 52.46 lend on the dharma wallet so there is a small difference but i would argue that the gas that i would pay for this transaction is probably about 10 minimally so that's a lot of money um saved when i'm using the dharma wallet just be mindful that what i showed you a few minutes ago has already changed because uh the pricing in these pools is dynamic and they're constantly changing in uniswap here's what i'm saving on i'm not paying that exorbitant gas fee that i'm going to pay while the gas price today is around 150 gway i'm not paying a trading fee to dharma and i normally would have to work through two transactions with uniswap in dharma i'm just going to click the confirm button it's a single click transaction so let's go ahead and try it all right so my trade went through awesome and uh i think the key takeaway here is i didn't pay those exorbitant gas and trading fees i mean i easily saved at least 10 to 15 in gas which is insane to pay those gas fees to do small trades like this i recognize that one of the solutions right now to these high gas prices is that if you aren't trading a larger position and your gas is going to cost that much of a percentage of your swap you probably shouldn't be doing the swap that's not the answer though that most want to hear and i think a lot about newcomers to d5 so this is a really easy way to get around these high gas prices so if we go back to the swap you can see now that i have 29 die available so i'm down 20 die from where i started at 59 die and if we were to uh go and flip that i now have 51 len that i could trade back to die or i could trade that to something like ether and then if i hit preview it'll show me what the trade will look like so that's all there is to it that's how dharma is saving me lots of money in terms of fees and i would encourage anyone to check it out there's no reason to be paying high gas prices when there are other ways around that with trading all right so just a few risks to call out first off if you use the dharma wallet and if you use the deposit option with a debit or apple pay you're going to end up giving up some you know personal information normally i just use products where i don't have to give up any sort of information like metamask however uh getting fiat into the system no matter whether you go through a centralized exchange or through a d5 product that has a fiat on ramp there's no way around it at least for me in the united states so this is a great product for me to be able to easily deposit uh you know as much money as i need and be able to do it for free the second risk is just making a mistake sending crypto namely an ethereum token to my wallet and screwing up this 0x address i want to be really careful that i copy that by using the share option there and copying that very long hexadecimal address if i leave just one letter or number out my funds are lost forever another human error that could occur with this is sending a non-ethereum token to the dharma wallet if i try to withdraw my money from an exchange and it's a non-ethereum token like the binance token or if you use a wallet like the truss wallet or coinbase wallet they both support ethereum tokens but they also have other tokens that are on other block chains and i just want to make sure that i don't send something like bitcoin or something like the binance token or any of the other non-ethereum tokens another major risk that i think about is loss of my account so this could happen by uninstalling a browser deleting my browser's data or losing a device like my phone or my laptop and so the way to get around this is i want to add a new device which is something like an iphone or whatever phone you use or something in the chrome browser so the way i would do that is i click add new device and i'm not going to show you it because otherwise it would expose my own wallet but you get the idea this is one of the few ways that you can really protect yourself okay that's all i've got for you today i hope you find this helpful let us know if you have any questions in the youtube comments or on twitter you can also reach us in the bankless discord group and otherwise i will see you next time [Music] you
