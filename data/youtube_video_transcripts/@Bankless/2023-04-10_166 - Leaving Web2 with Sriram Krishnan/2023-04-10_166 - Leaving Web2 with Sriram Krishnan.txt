welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more Bagless what's broken about Twitter Facebook Instagram and how to fix it with sriram Krishnan this is somebody who's been on the inside he is an internet Optimist he's a guy who grew up in a small town in India with little opportunity and used the internet to change the course of his life and now he worries that these same opportunities won't be available for the next Generation sriram thinks web 3 is the only way to keep the internet full of opportunity for future Generations a few things to take away from this episode of course you know we're going to talk about web 3 and the transition from web 2 to web 3 but this is number one why sriram defected from web 2 to web 3 whenever there's an API key something is broken he says what does he mean by that we get into that in episode number two why Twitter can top a world governments but can't sell an ad we talk about that number three we ask the question does web 2 have to lose in order for web 3 to win number four we talk about what every social media network has to start with the cool kids it has to attract the cool kids says sriram and web3 social will never take off until it does and number five we conclude by talking about crypto and AI artificial intelligence that is how do they intersect serum has some great ideas about that as well David what were the most significant parts of this episode for you free ROM has an arc to him he was a child of web one and so he as a tinkerer as a coder as an experiencer of the internet saw what web1 did for him and his life and it's really really personal and that Arc has taken him through the web 2 age to where he is now as a GP of entries and Horowitz focusing on web3 and he's made a very big point to say that he is left web too he calls himself a web to Defector and now operates in web3 even though he does understand the good and and real value that web2 has provided and still provides to this world he is now focusing on web3 because he sees the Starry Eyed brightness that web3 brings to the world that he saw in web 1 and is worried that web 2 is not able to provide that same opportunity to the young Tinkers uh that are growing up in in this digital age and so I think that is a really important lens to view this episode through a really significant one if we want to pass the Baton of optimism of Internet optimism off to our children we need what sriram is doing investing in web 3 building out web 3 structures we need these things we need web3 to change the Paradigm of what social is and I think that that is three ROM's call to action that is his purpose upon this world and I think the The Listener of this podcast episode will be able to resonate with that as they listen to this uh episode and yeah David I think one thing for you and I to explore in the debrief is if this is actually a winnable battle it feels like the the armies of web 2 are definitely stacked against web 3 and uh want to see if we can overcome web 2's Network effect and actually succeed here so we got a lot to unpack in the debrief of course that is our episode after the episode and you can join as a

he's a GP at a16z crypto whom you know of course and he is a self-described Defector of web 2 to web3 we're definitely going to talk about that formerly a product lead at Facebook Twitter Snapchat he's been all over the place screen room has basically seen everything there is to see about the world of web 2 and especially web 2 social that's going to be a focus of today's conversation he also hosts a podcast with his wife covering Tech internet creators all sorts of things like that so he knows a thing or two about the space we are in Sri Ram welcome to bankless how are you doing I'm good uh I'm sure you get this a lot a long time listener YouTube stalker first time caller and I spent last night binging a bunch of episodes as I was uh preparing for this and God I feel pressure to deliver you know what okay so tell us what was um what was your what what episode most resonated with you what uh what did you enjoy hearing uh well there are a few which are kind of thematic I think what you're talking about but for me the standout one from recent times is the one with Eliezer right he was actually not crypto but I was riveted uh uh and Miley jealous as a sort of a fellow podcast so the default actually just knocked the ball out of the park on multiple levels I mean Eliza his obvious passion um capturing the Zeitgeist of the moment uh Ryan your face when he says we're not going to be dead in you and and uh my favorite part oh yeah and my favorite part and I can't do justice to it and everyone should probably watch it and listen to it it was at the very end when you go what is the takeaway for everyone and he says and but just like I don't think this will help we're all going to be dead but maybe somebody has a good idea and uh I I think it's just you know there's a lot to unpack over there but I think in terms of uh have a great episode which captures a moment and you know gets people talking uh you folks knock the ball out of the park there so you want me do you mind it because whenever someone brings up that episode I have to ask I can't not ask so what did you think coming out of that episode like I know you're into AI as well like you kind of dabble um what is he right what's going on who should we talk to like I still feel like a tremendous amount of uh discordance coming out of that conversation like I don't know if he's right or not we have some episodes coming up we're gonna more deeply explore that that uh discussion have maybe the Counterpoint on but what was your take I mean are you just like left with with desolation and and like do you think he could be right here so a few darts first you know uh I'm about to turn 40 soon and one of the things I've grown to appreciate is people who believe in a cause and whether you agree or disagree with elizer and um which we can get into um it is obvious that he is scared about this for a very long period of time and I just find something very inspiring about somebody who does that and it's kind of put his life's work and energy into one thing um and so I think that's just impressive you know anything that really comes about that's number one uh uh number two is I would say uh I think Eliza is Raising some important questions the challenge is uh it's hard to and he's obviously a much smarter person than me or a lot of people spend a lot more time thinking about it for sure the challenge for me is to reconcile one the obvious benefits that AI can bring which anybody who's writing code using co-pilot now on vs code can obviously testify to that like I have written production code in 10 years and I am no productive so uh I've seen people get health diagnosis uh which are maybe saving lives so the obvious benefits that are possible with also reconcile the possibility of a long tail risk that might kill us all so I think he's an important addition to the conversation I don't know how to disprove what he says to which always kind of worries me um when you know it's kind of hard for me to have a discussion where I'm like well how do I actually disprove this like what is the evidence that would change somebody's mind I actually think this also ties into crypto which we can maybe get into because I think one question of which allies are well one kind of question comes out of this is okay if air is going to be such a force who controls it uh you know who how is it going to be the domain of a few small companies which can raise hundreds of millions of dollars or you know or have access resources or is it going to be something which all of us can I'm you know I'm on a MacBook Pro uh M2 you know laptop right now can I run some version of it here can I partake in it can I get credit for the data that goes and switch all ties into the crypto ether so I think I I I would say this I'm happy that Eliza exists I think is pushing the conversation forward um and uh uh but you know I don't think there's the end of the discussion yeah I don't think anyone can emerge from that podcast episode uh in denial that Eliezer believes exactly what he says that he believes to to the full extent of that uh and I think that's actually what made it such a fun podcast episode is like man we are speaking right to the soul of this man who really cares about like tunnel vision cares about this one thing in particular uh so just from a from a Content podcasting perspective it definitely like struck the chord there and it's true I I kind of see a little bit of that in you um nothing to do with with AI but I think I I when you say you tell me that you have a very uh respect for people that really believe in a cause uh I'm guessing that that's because you have a similar cause and so maybe maybe a question to you is like what what do you feel strongly about that is your equivalent to eleazar's AI alignment problem what's your alignment problem in the world first we disrespect to Eliza because he's been doing this for 20 years I think and uh I can't claim any such credit but for me and just to briefly kind of recap my personal story because I think this ties into this uh you know I grew up in like kind of a small part of India and the internet was basically the only reason you know my career uh and pretty much every good thing in my life exists uh I met my now wife who's my co-host online 21 years ago because you're trying to build a website together we were unknown and thankfully you know before the word unknown was a thing and we met and we've been together for 20 years I wrote a random blog post with somebody at Microsoft saw got me and her hired uh flew to the US and set off like a bunch of career opportunities and things which honestly like we wouldn't be having this conversation if the internet and the technology didn't exist and my childhood was very much writing random code right I would write my own browser my own email client and just participating in my dinky bedroom and uh fast forwarding a few years I spent the last 10 years as you alluded to deepen the belly of the beast of the large social media companies I'm a nerdy Thanos collecting The Infinity Gauntlet of uh social media anyway um and uh so how many how many do you have now on your Gauntlet right like right here uh three uh but then I stopped uh didn't finish the gauntlet but I spent a few years at meta what is called Facebook I run a lot of their ad products I spent a year at snap and maybe most interesting I spent a few years at Twitter where I ran home timeline search Trends explore a lot of things which has algorithms and pixels which I think uh really ties into it and now I want to be clear I liked a lot of my time there I think there are a lot of amazing smart people uh who worked there uh I'm still close friends with a lot of them but uh when I left Twitter um and I was trying to think of like one of the reasons I think I wound up leaving was I was not thrilled uh with what was happening in the state of development and the state of product and there are a few things which I didn't couldn't clearly articulate and one in the last two years spending time with crypto I've now kind of totally articulated so I left her and I was trying to figure out what I want to do with my life uh I met a few Folks at uh a16g the firm I work for uh Mark Chris uh christickson um and who heads up the crypto fund here and Ben uh they got me here and I think a lot of credit goes to Chris Dixon who I think you've had on the show before uh Chris really crypto pilled me and this kind of goes into the heart of you know why I call us a Defector now my day job is to find work with amazing Founders uh you know who build amazing companies that's my day job but I do think for crypto everyone has a bit of an ideological calling I like to think of it as a church right where you have different paths to it and if you look at crypto there are very different people can have different paths I talked to biology uh who's a friend he's been here for eight years that's not me Chris Dixon been here for nine ten years he's involved in crime base and Los Angeles that's not me others to know about hang out in The Cypher Punk mailing list like 15 years ago right like uh that's not me either but my path was I saw you know the challenges that centralization of social media can cause and I was a part of it right like I worked on a lot of these systems I have developed a lot of these things I was in the to miss Court Hamilton room where it happens for a bunch of these and um and I saw a bunch of things where I was like oh there's some real downsides here and with crypto for the first time I was like well that is an alternate path um and and if we don't do something um as a technology Community uh really uh the childhood version of me couldn't exist right the person who was just writing code and by the way when I wrote code in 15 years old I didn't know how to get an API key I didn't have to call up a BD team I just wrote it on my shitty little computer in in nowhere town in India and like that person couldn't exist so uh so I think like a lot of things when we can get into like decentralized social et cetera Etc like are really critical and important for to the future of the internet so that my cause and you know I'm very lucky to have a day job which ties to it it's very room that's really profound I guess like what you're saying is the internet that of your childhood the internet that spawned all of this opportunity for you personally and you know thousands of others hundreds of thousands of others this podcast even would not be possible you're saying that that permissionless internet that you grew up on no longer exists or maybe exists as a shadow of what it once was and your cause your Les are Level conviction is to bring about that internet the internet that you grew up on it and pass it to Future Generations is is that that's kind of what I'm the spirit of what I'm catching from you is that is that right absolutely uh and again by the way a laser much smarter much deeper than me so uh I wouldn't want to uh insult him by clinically similar but I do think uh my cause is quasi-religious uh I'll give you an example like the very piece of first piece of code I wrote when I was 14 years old whereas I looked at the HTTP spec and I was like I'm going to write a web browser right and it was a terrible web browser but guess what nobody stopped me there were like no API Keys No BD team nothing just like open source Tech that you kind of adapted and of course I don't think it open till it's even a word then right like I think it was like lunatic was there uh I think free software was a thing thanks to Richard Solomon and Erica strayman and a bunch of those people but just the way things work right like you know if you wanted an email client like I used to write gnu email extensions and talk to SMTP and IMAP servers and that was my email address right like it was very bad code um and so on and so that was just the way the internet worked uh I hung out a lot on like Usenet um and so on and by the way for me you know I didn't speak English very well then I had really no access to resources that was very important like to actually get exposure to Western culture on the internet now fast forward now um there is absolutely no way like you can build uh let us say an alternative Instagram point or an alternative Tick Tock light there is no way you can say well I want to modify Tick Tock and I want to use my own algorithm um and learn something that way you can't do that and whether it is for just to play with it which I think is super important or whether it because you want to have a choice whether it is because I think there's an upside and a downside discussion on the upside uh it is about like can you bring in new innovative ideas right like with SMTP by the way right like Gmail didn't need to go ask someone for permission when Paul book height launched Gmail on April 1st 2004 they just built it and Gmail changable I mean I'm very dating myself here like Gmail changed email that day right they didn't ask somebody for permission right and then that cost everyone else kind of build cool new things um so imagine if we could take any one of these centralized social media platforms and say you know what we're going to innovate on top right and we don't need to call up uh you know the CEO of tick tock or the CCP or Zuckerberg or Elon or whoever for permission that's on the upside the downside I would say is uh not getting drugged uh you know when I I was you know on like when I was a kid I didn't have to worry about somebody taking up my web browser access right but I bet like you folks have expenses you were kicked off YouTube and I think if you are in popular and if you haven't been able to kind of kick up a storm on Twitter you would not be able to get back and even my wife and I who you know I mean not saying we are like powerful or famous but we have some say we worry when we have somebody on the show who talks about covet lab leaks and we're like is this gonna get deranked somehow like don't really know for sure right um and are we going to get removed and there is this kind of this fear which happens all the time so I kind of think about the upside limiting Innovation which used to happen a lot on the downside you know you could get rug the platform canceled removed apparent suspended Shadow event that's resilient words any point in time so that's what you know I think that's what I want to fix yeah Ryan called this the uh the permissionless internet is no longer available to uh your your child self if your child self was around today the the words that came to my mind are um defy and nfts and blockchains are these like it's a Sandbox it's a Sandbox for developers that uh you know a strapping young imaginative kid could come in and start to build build a sand castle uh and that's really why why this world of crypto is so cool is that it's just this endless um canvas for people with imaginations to start to to paint upon and especially young folk uh who have like the imaginations and are no longer bounded by adulthood have the best like opportunities to to create something new uh and so the the what I'm hearing uh from from this part of the story is that just there is no there's not much canvas left in the world of Twitter or Instagram or or Facebook you're kind of already given your confined box of what you can paint and how you can paint and what what your tools are and I think what I'm hearing screen from you is that uh if you were a kid these days you just don't have as much creative Outlet in the world of developing something or just being present online how do these words resonate with you I think it's profound I think Whenever there is an API key uh something is broken um um it because it means that somebody can you need to ask someone's permission um I think the word kids and playing with it uh May undersell how important it is for just kind of harnessing the collective human creative Spirit right like you want you know young people anywhere to go play on Star play on it you never know what's going to break out you never know what's going to be a hit but that's sort of the magic of the internet and computer science and we all kind of um grown with that um so uh for me right like some of the questions I get I'm sure you get like as a crypto person now is what is the use case of crypto right and I always try and split this into two parts so I'm like well these things are busted in the way centralized platforms work today right and we can talk about like for example even last week the whole Tick Tock hearing was a kind of an example of this right and I think crypto and there will be other Solutions which you can talk about but I think crypto is an ideal answer to these problems but let's kind of agree on where the problem exists because I think the problem is profound and maybe if I can't even sell you on crypto that's fine but I just want like people everywhere to be able to write code on their laptops you need to ask for people I just agree on that yeah just for I remember in my early days of my crypto journey I actually didn't understand what an API key was and and understanding what it is now I do I do get what you mean when you say if something turns into an API key we've lost something but can you just really unpack that one uh just to make it like an explain like I'm five metaphor yeah sure so uh so uh what kind of History lesson here like if you look at the way the 90s the original internet work um and by the way a lot of this has steal from Chris Dixon in his episode and other podcasts he's great about this so uh credit to him um a lot of the internet was protocols right HTTP SMTP IMAP and the way it kind of worked is you know there was a protocol spec there were a bunch of servers and as long as you can adhere to the spec anybody could issue a request over TCP over the network and talk to it and just kind of make it work sometimes they need payment um um you know sometimes you need I remember once paying for a Usenet server which was kind of a big deal when I was kind of a random person kid in India but like you know usually anybody could go ping a server now somewhere along the last 15 years that changed and you had the world where well a lot more of these things are going to stay behind a Walled Garden um and um and to get access you need to get an API key which basically means that you can now issue a request to the server using the key and you have to play within a certain sandbox now I I don't want to my choice of language to somehow say that these people are evil or doing bad things it's just that the world moved to the cloud the world moved to like the few things that happened one the cloud happened so you had a lot of things happening behind data centers two was a lot of these Services started competing with each other and I was at this and I was on these large social media companies and well if I have a network effect I don't want my competitor to steal my network effect right so if you were for example in the early days of Twitter and Instagram they could both log into each other's service using each other's ID and you could say like I want to follow all of my Instagram friends on Twitter and vice versa and definitely the vice versa was true but then people like well we compete with these books we don't want that so you started having like more restrictions the third part of it was um you know a lot of people are searching for business models for a long period of time and the business model which a lot of these internet companies want upon um and one I know I think you folks are not fans of but I am a fan of because I used to work on this was ads um and But If You and I by the way I have a hotel but why actually ads is not as maybe as awful as some people think they are but if we go on if your business model is ADS you need to control the pixels on which people experience your product because that's where the ad shows up so you can't actually let someone build an alternative client because the first thing they'll do is have a product where you can have ads the next time you talk to Nike or Procter and Gamble you'll be like hey I paid a lot of money but a lot of people that are not seeing my ads like WhatsApp right like so it just breaks the system itself so a bunch of these SEC things happen um none of these books are evil it's just like you know they're all amazing smart people it's just the way the internet got built out but as over time you know the sandbox that you could play got really restricted like I remember like f8 uh the Facebook conference maybe the first one maybe 2008 2009 you could do a lot of things with Facebook at the time you could publish things under anyone's feed you could read the prince contact if you go try it today it's much more locked down right there's a bunch of reasons there where uh privacy controversies there were competitive issues the ads issues it's very limited and you really can't build an alternative Facebook client today and I don't think Tick Tock even has an API which lets you do that so that's what I mean by an API key where you have this pattern where uh what used to be hey let me just go ping a server I can do whatever I want it's now like well I'm gonna have this particular rails on which I can play which is a lot more control than it used to be the the metaphor of uh hierarchy or uh a tower versus a Town Square comes to mind where in the early days of web 2 all of these web 2 protocols were talking to each other just you know sending around messages they were integrating with each other but it the what you the story that you described kind of progresses from a collaborative and open environment where Twitter and Instagram can share their social graphs but then all of a sudden the the the forces set in the forces that you know control the world the competitive forces capitalistic forces uh set in and all of a sudden the Town Square goes into a hierarchy goes into the the tower and all of a sudden that's kind of where we find ourselves today where each of one of these uh web 2 Gargantuans is a siled tower that doesn't want you to transcend across the Town Square to a different Tower yeah absolutely which is why I think when we talk about anything to fix this like the incentive structure from Day Zero is super important which is how do you align incentives to stop centralization to stop the tower like for example I was watching The Tick Tock hearings uh The Tick Tock CEO last week um and we can even get into one thing which struck me was how similar the hearings are when every social media CEO shows up for one of these it is always um um um and by the way obviously the issues the CCP in China are very different from say what Zuckerberg had to do uh but it's very similar like hey what are you doing with my data um how do I know who got censored or de-platformed um sometimes explicitly sometimes implicitly how do I trust you right and then um you know you can they usually say a bunch of things but there is really no easy way to validate to prove or disprove it um like for example right like I you I don't think there's any data which comes out where you can prove definitely or disprove definitely whether the CCP is actually having influence um and so one of the things that I you know I I'm hoping that we can fix as a technology community and you know spoiler it I think crypto is a answer to this is how do you have things which are verifiable where we don't have to take someone's word for it or we don't need to send you know uh uh uh like a legal team in but anybody sitting at home can prove oh you know what I can see how the algorithm works I can see what the levers that were pulled I can see who is Shadow band band and I can now make up my own mind whether that was valid or not um and by the way if I don't like it maybe I can build my own algorithm or my own client in an Ideal World so I'm kind of struck by how similar these testimonies and hearings are yeah I uh you know I was thinking we could start with Twitter but actually I want to reverse that and maybe start with with Tick Tock as a case study of this because I I think we're you know bankless listeners having heard some content in the past and being in crypto I mean uh we believe you sriram right like somehow the internet has taken a wrong turn we we've we've got um a whole bunch of API keys that can be rubbed instead of like rugless protocols that the original internet was was really built on um I I want to go to The Tick Tock hearings though because I do think that is a that is such a good example of what's going on and I did see um I don't know anybody who listened to the entire hearings that that's a lot but I I got Clips I got Snippets and every time I listen to something um that where it's it's kind of you know Congress or or leaders of the US government grilling some sort of social media CEO you're right it's the exact same conversation I feel like pulling my hair out every time I listen to it because it's always a how can we trust you right that that's what that's what Congress says and then the CEO says you could trust us because XYZ and they they say but how you've failed in like all of these ways and the CEO says no we're not really failing you can trust us because of all of these things and here's what we'll do differently it's just I just want to go go back and and just say to them like guys why don't we solve this at the protocol level right like rather than this like trust I don't trust you you know you don't trust us type of relationship where you've got the incentives completely aligned why don't we do something like um decentralized identity image imagine that like imagine we could bacon like privacy at sort of the the protocol the the root layer we didn't even have to worry about these types of conversations that I feel like Regulators always want to to hit this with regulatory cudgel like even the example of um I don't know if you've seen the restrict act uh for example right so this is sort of the answer to tick tock and there's this idea I don't know if it's going to pass actually but it seems probable maybe likely that the US is actually going to ban Tick Tock right whether you think that's a good idea or a bad idea or where you sit on kind of whether CCP is surveilling uh our data or not like no company should have not domestic companies shouldn't have the ability to do this so I guess I want to get your your kind of take what what what do you think why are these uh social media CEOs always on the hot seat right um how can we actually solve this problem at the protocol or or the root level if you want to use tick tock as an example or or you know something like Twitter you know so uh um Mark Zuckerberg and what's going on with with Cambridge uh analytica and all of that I mean it's the same example over and over again but how do we get out of this how do we solve this at the protocol level well okay so there's a lot to unpack that first of all I think if there's anybody like later watching this you know my my world doesn't mean sort of frustrating thing I want to see is like hey let us make up our own minds for ourselves right because every testimony is a version of we think you did things to people that we don't agree with right um if there's a Chinese government you know impacting us whether it is um you know um Twitter maybe uh disproportionately going after people on the right or on the left or Facebook was similar it's always some version of the same conversation and the first thing I want to come you know and you can by the way smart people again reasonable people can disagree based on evidence on each of these but that's besides the point the first thing I want to say well let's start with help letting us make up our minds for ourselves right so what if there was a world where uh and let's you know I think the protocol let's let's imagine sort of a sliding scale of verifiability and you know decentralized trust right let us start with okay let's even set aside protocols for a second um imagine you know if you are uh Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or Tick Tock right now by starting tomorrow we said that you have to publish a few things uh number one you have to make your algorithm open source which I think is very doable uh because I've seen on it on the inside it's very doable so um and a lot of smart people on the internet who can break it apart and you know and look at it number two every single time you make a account action change right either explicit or implicit um you are going to say you know somehow commit that you're going to make it public so for example when uh you know uh uh Bank list was taken off YouTube um it that was easy because that was explicit you knew I think the more Insidious ones are when you're subtly d-ranked Shadow band if you want to use that phrase because you don't even know what happened you just think maybe my episode was shitty but actually turns out it was trickling something and you don't know right I think so having every one of those actions published publicly kind of like a court of record I think is super difficult third is a right to recourse what you folks did and what I do if something happens is like VL on Twitter or we call up a friend and we're all Lucky sometimes our infringed friends who can help us a lot of people don't but a recourse where you can say hey I want to see the evidence against me and I want to appeal it um and I think if we just get these and these are probably very possible with low amounts of work by everybody like that's kind of just a good uh first step and um and sometimes when they want to talk to people they don't actually understand why this is necessary they're like well isn't this sport like they're crazy people on the left or the right who are saying very provocative things like this won't matter to me it's kind of like one response I often get like another fun story from inside Twitter um which is uh you know when I was a Twitter I ran uh you know I hit up the product team for like Trends moments a bunch of stuff on Twitter and one day I woke up and I saw a news story which had uh let me highlight the details like a popular Hollywood actor and he was he was just cast in the movie and the story was well there's a controversy about why is this person getting cast in this movie and maybe he shouldn't get casted right now you might be wondering what this has to do with Twitter now the thing which struck me was a bunch of Publications discover the same story and they all had the same two tweets embedded and none of those two tweets were from interesting people on Twitter and I was like that's odd like how did that happen right like you know uh why is this same two tweet showing up every publication so I did some digging it turns out that Twitter has a trending algorithm uh the trending algorithm basically tries to figure out like when treats uh when popular tweets break out spot it and make it Trend uh but if there's not enough a popular tweet there was a bug where even an unpopular treat could actually Trend um at the middle of the night kind of a random but now that happened at say 4 a.m New York Time by 5 AM New York time there was a moments team editor who basically promoted that into a moment which makes shows up as a big Square on uh on Twitter by 7am 8am a bunch of you know um people in the media industry woke up and they're like hey that's the thing we should talk about it and sort of just given that Twitter was in the memetic landscape you meme this story into existence I know it is actually a real story or real thing right and you know and I I always kind of bring up this example because Kind of a Funny example it's not very serious but you can imagine much more serious versions of this in political discourse all right uh um so it's kind of trivial but also important and I so I think like whenever we have algorithms publishing how these algorithms work publishing how these stations work is super important so if nothing else even if nobody buys into crypto protocol if any if a big tech company was saying Hey I want to publish this apps in public tomorrow that's a good first step right now ultimately and I mean I work on cryptosis what I think the right long-term path is to have this actually be decentralized and you know and I know there are kind of a lot of midpoints I think things like Mastodon or other projects are in the mid uh kind of a midpoint there but you know I'm a you know crypto a maximalist and I'm like a big and by the full disclosure uh we are investors in a company called forecaster who you had on the show so I think crypto and doing things on change the right answer but I think there's a lot of steps intermediate which should help build up trust and legitimacy I think one thing I would add to your three-point list which uh which I totally agree with is a sum ability to exit the existing system so if I could like if an algorithm or or a client or say that a platform that I was locked into say a Twitter or something wasn't working for me there's no ability for me to kind of leave with my social graph with my followers with kind of all of the the work that I've been you know invested inside of that platform and it really does begin to feel like oh I'm just a surf working on somebody else's feudal land it's like I don't actually own any property here and this is what what what crypto and I think digital property rights uh purports to help solve and I I think we'll talk more about that we'll get to that story later but I want to park on Twitter because you have some unique experiences around that and of course Twitter has you know has it ever not been in the news it's always been in the news in fact I've been in the news a little bit more it's uh crazy it's like you're in the eye of a hurricane and you are somehow causing the hurricane every single day you're causing it and and the weird thing about working at Twitter is the most important people in the world yell at you but using your own product right people hit it bankless but they use your own show to hate you like they started creating podcasts uh on the bankless feed about how much they hate bankless I'd be amazing yeah it's super weird like I remember like five years ago when Twitter launched the algorithm for the first time which actually really saved the company uh lin-manuel Miranda of Hamilton Fame wrote a poem and made R.I.P Twitter Trend all on Twitter right and you know and there's a part of us you're like great you know like there's good feedback and maybe not probably like dude like you're using your own platform like come on here give us a break yes so okay so uh I want to get your take on then Twitter specifically because you're right it not only is in the news but it makes the news it's like the meme layer The Narrative layer of like I being on Twitter and seeing how this kind of works I just feel like um Twitter sort of starts the story and starts the narrative and then the rest of media it kind of picks it up so it's almost at the at the base layer it's like the layer zero of all of this but what's your take on Twitter right now so uh is Twitter broken do you think Elon is on a path to fix it is this going to require some sort of deeper revision how does web 3 fit into all of this and if it's broken how I I just unloaded a whole bunch of questions on you so like pick that up wherever you'd like but but maybe the question of is Twitter broken and how do we fix it is uh is what I'm asking so first of all so uh let's get brass basic facts right so I worked at Twitter for two years I had like a bunch of product leadership type roles and I think what you know you're alluding to is about four months ago when Elon bought Twitter uh uh uh not that he needed some help but I was briefly involved helping him you know I knew where the bodies were budded um and you know I kind of hung out at the office for a couple of weeks by the way I think people think it's because Asics and they invested that's not totally the case it's actually because I just wanted to help Twitter I've always been a fan of the product so that's number one um I think your point about layer zero is interesting because I always say Twitter is a memetic Battleground it is Upstream of culture uh uh one of the running jokes inside Twitter was uh Twitter can topple World governments but can't sell an ad uh it uh there's some I think there's some truth to it because um you know if you can win the memetic war on Twitter by which I mean you start off a conversation and have people discuss it right um and what happens is when you start up a conversation um there are a lot of opinion makers right it could be journalists it could be politicians it could be athletes it could be notable people like you uh um you know all now latch on to it and you mean something into existence which by the way folks in crypto kind of really understand the memetic landscape there uh um but I think it's true or in pretty much every domain uh and it's a it is truly a Battleground right there is Bloodshed uh people get like deeply hurt and you know sometimes because the snakes are hard because the stakes are really high like you know if and for example there you know I'm sure there have been entire elections which have been decided because of Twitter and when I say that people like people often go well stream you need to get out more but I say listen um you know what happens on Twitter sets The Narrative and I go back to my story where I was like this actor almost lost this movie within a few hours due to sort of a random Confluence of people and algorithms right so there was actual real world impact uh uh and so uh and I that's why like foreign governments and there have been a lot of interesting stories of trying to battle on Twitter to kind of control the memetic landscape so it is a Battleground and it is at the head of the the landscape so so that's just Twitter um and uh and it's a service I love uh I've been it's given me so much personally if I get the fact that I worked there I've met so many people I think Brian I probably slid into your DMs like a year ago and you responded to me and you're kind enough and I met so many acquaintances I wouldn't have my job now if it wasn't for Twitter and I just want to see it do well um so I'm a fan um is Twitter broken absolutely not and I'll tell you how all of us including me are probably spending as much time on Twitter as we used to um anyone uh who said they're going to leave Twitter hasn't they're probably still on Twitter uh I'll just kind of like point that out there um and uh it is still the place that I see uh sitting in uh you know influencing the conversation now uh you know I think I'm also you know uh you know like this is not like a secret I'm a fan of Elon uh I think one thing's Elon doesn't credit for is in a very short period of time he has done two things a lot of other people in the tech industry have followed I'll give you two examples number one right uh you know he has pushed Twitter towards more transparency right and more let's call it egalitarianism um he made Twitter verification the blue check uh which used to be sort of this opaque process and I'm sure all of us have you know dm'd a Twitter employee or Instagram employee be like dude like I'm famous like get me a blue check uh and he said it's everyone has to pay eight bucks and when that first happened there was a lot of Opera right there's a lot of people who are deeply who are really really unhappy with it because honestly I think there are some legit criticisms but also because they just didn't like Elon um but now let's look at last month meta just did the exact same thing on Instagram right so they you know so Elon I think shifted the Overton window on what is possible with verification which kind of like an opaque process of like hey are you somehow notable as determined by the mainstream media to like anybody can get it it's just meant to show that you are who you say you are that's number one the second one is do doing more with less Elon is the first person to kind of like hey let's go hardcore we need less Engineers Etc and he has a very certain style of how he does it but then look at every news from every tech company in the last I'd say three four months everybody is trying to do more with class now they may are doing the same style they may not be doing it on Twitter but they're all I think he shifted the Overton window for people to follow now are there challenges yes right like I think you know I see them as much as this but long term you know uh the guy lands rocket so I'm a fan of what he can do on Twitter so that's on Twitter but uh so anyway I just gotta leave that so I'm a fan of like what he's doing at Twitter the the future of Silicon Valley is like social media Towers we'll call them Towers um uh one of the reasons why I was cautiously optimistic when Elon Musk bought Twitter is more or less for the reasons that you just left us with like the guy can land Rockets the guy's a pretty smart guy uh maybe he's delving into a new part of the world that he doesn't really have the same skill set for but he's still a problem solver simultaneously we're on we're exploring the frontier of web3 Social and so I I kind of few there's three different things there's Facebook Instagram the the towers of old if you will uh Instagram is 13 years old uh Facebook I think is almost 20 years old Twitter's almost 20 years old um and then there's Twitter and the reason why it's in a different category is because Elon Musk just bought it and so you know fresh eyes fresh leadership fresh fresh philosophy and then there's the web 3 social media Frontier brand new innovators brand new leaders brand new founders with a brand new user base and so we have like three different um categories of social media platforms and one of the reasons I'm again cautiously optimistic about Twitter it was kind disaster in the first few months after Elon bought it but it's been on the uptrend ever since is that like uh somebody with fresh eyes can come and re-architect an old archaic social media platform again archaic 15 years old uh an old archaic social media platform into the Modern Age at least by just injecting new energy with it which is the same thing that web3 is doing and so stream I don't know if uh how well you can feel comfortable trying to put yourself into the shoes of Elon Musk those are very uniquely shaped shoes to feel to fill uh what if he's trying to turn an old ship into a rocket ship uh with Twitter what do you think he's trying to do what is this new age of Twitter uh or new age of social media platforms if we're taking the old ones and trying to make them new again what do you think he should do a few thoughts first of all you know I can't speak for Elon but one of the good things about Elon is he tweets and he says pretty much everything in public um so pretty much what you see is what you get with him so a lot of this is very public um I think he's down to a few things right you know one you know he's trying to you know ship stuff again um Twitter was a company which we can get it for a lot of reasons wasn't shipping product and you know one thing you have to get to Elon is he's shipped a bunch of features maybe you know you can agree disagree of how good they are or where they work but he's got some stuff out of the door and he's just trying to get product momentum going um and some of these are new right like you know and uh some of these are for the over 10 window like like I said the verification feature the For You tab Etc and again email agree with him but they are new um I think second part is he's trying to build a stable business out of it uh and one that is just not totally supported by ads so if you look at say uh I could forget the official term for it but the yellow badges for companies uh or the way API access work he's just trying to you know make sure Twitter captures uh the value that's on one side uh the other side is I think he's trying to make Twitter more open uh and this has nothing to it being a good uh just a good business but I think he believes in the wage it should be run which is that's why the Twitter files happen uh that's why you know he said that he's going to open source the algorithms that run Twitter and that I think really pushes into some of the discussions on webpage only kind of get a little bit so one of the most maybe under appreciated things about Elon and Twitter is uh for the last two years if somebody complained about censorship and big Tech you generally assume they were on the right right like you know pre-elon and Twitter right uh and you know there's kind of this whole cluster of apps I think what is called um parlor was one there's a bunch of others you know which is all of the idea like hey uh you know Facebook Instagram Twitter Youtube Etc have no place for us and we want to get let's just call it maybe try cleaning folks out there uh one interesting I saw Elon Twitter is a lot of people on the left are now like hey we don't like centralized controllers either so there is now like bipartisan agreement that maybe we don't want one set of people to run things right I just probably I just find it like very amusing and uh one of the profound things about web3 and decentralized social is uh which I hope people realize is like you don't have to like the guy running it um and you know you know there is nothing about ethereum where you have to like vitalik personally or what he says or what he stands for because the legitimacy of ethereum comes from what is approvable so uh one of the things I hope people take away from this move to decentralization is a world where you know what your rights are and they're approval and it's not about whether the people running it agree with your point of view or not which I think is kind of like a profound shift but I do want to point out like the the bipartisan thing is kind of amusing now um what has happened I think post Elon is people want less centralized control but I would say it's been a Cambrian explosion of people trying out different ideas which I love by the way I'm a technologist at heart like I'm a VC but I'm really a nerd so I'm all in favor of like people trying out different things and writing code and building stuff that's great more of it right so I think one class of people one uh you know set of people are like Mastodon for example has gotten uh you know a lot of usage or you know a lot of like you know attention over the last few months which you know I like I think you know I'm obviously a crypto maximalist and you know but I just like that people are getting used to hey maybe you know I don't want one centralized peop set of people making all my decisions I want to control my own destiny and maybe the group around me should set my own policy so that's one that others for example like uh you know Jack Darcy has been talking about Noster quite a bit uh I haven't played with it but that's the thing um and uh but on the you know more like kind of blockchain decent like side there have been lots of projects right like there's lens uh um led by stani and then the one which I'm you know just you know full disclosure the one I'm probably most familiar with because we invested is Dan Romero's forecaster which I actually think is you know I'm biased but it's kind of the right long-term reason but honestly I'm just happy that people are kind of like going down this path because I think if you go down this idea maze eventually you land at crypto so I'm just kind of happy they're kind of being nudged on this maze can you give folks like a quick tour of the the Maze of what's what's happening in web3 Social I mean we can we can Loop this back to Twitter a little bit later but I'm just you mentioned some different I would call these like decentralized social media types of of projects uh Mastodon is one uh Jack dorsey's uh project and I can't recall the name of thought in my head but you can give us that and then also something like a lens or a far Caster walk us through these what what are the most interesting projects what angle uh is each of them them taking on it and why haven't they hit like critical mass yet they have they haven't really taken off even though they're sort of in this maybe early phases and some people listening will have heard of them uh just give us give us a tour here good question so I think they all have some elements in common right uh which is uh you know they're all kind of a reaction to hey we don't want one set of people making all the decisions for an entire billion plus people Network right and one set of people could be Elon could be the CCP could be Zuckerberg it doesn't matter I just don't want like one set of people I want to control my own destiny what are those decisions too it's like moderation like content moderation decisions or what other types of decisions are are social media um you know centralized control controllers making good question let's start with the basics you call it digital property rights right like can you create an account can you keep your account um and vitalik had a good phrase I'm stealing this from him um who can betray you right like you know who can have an agenda against you and betray you which I thought was like a profound way of uh uh putting it um and so let's just that's the basics right like you know today if uh uh you know the new Youtube CEO Neil Mohan who's an amazing wonderful human being uh I generally mean that uh if he really decides he doesn't like you he can probably get bankless removed of YouTube right so that is just basic power right um and we can call it drug pulling if you want then on top of that I think there is uh you know control over what can be said and not said put an upset on the downside so on the downside I would say things like are you going to get canceled like sorry account gets suspended for saying something right and some of these are obviously bad things like if I say like hey I'm gonna come to your house and do some terrible thing to you I should obviously get submitted sometimes it gets much ticier like if I say hey you know this is where I think the code virus came from there was a p time and everything got suspended so that's the downside where people get suspended the the more Insidious ones are which I think is in the broad category of content moderation like controlling what people can't say the more tricky one is what gets Amplified right like which is uh you know like for example something that shows up in YouTube trending or Twitter trending or Tick Tock has a version of that inject something into the memes way everyone reacts to it they create reaction videos it becomes a thing people write press about it you can subtly change who gets more amplification and less amplification right um and it's very much a gray area so those kinds of decisions are also run by a central team by the way all these are usually done by smart people with very Noble intentions but these are the kind of petitions that a centralized company it does every single day like this happening every single day at Facebook at Google or Tick Tock it's just the nature of the Beast and when you kind of push into decent like social I think every one of these elements there's a level of democratization which comes in which is instead of a centralized set of people in San Francisco maybe there are others maybe it is you the individual or some set of people that you're trusting or delegating legitimacy to has control over these decisions right so uh I'll set aside crypto for a second um and if you look at Mastermind the way it works is uh you sign up for a server and the silver admin kind of has power over who gets who gets to create an account who can say you know who can say things or not say things and they run the server and then there is a protocol by which different servers can talk to each other right so in some ways this is kind of like one step from say the Facebook or Twitter because the server owners really control what can be said can't be said so instead of like you know that is the inside of the master and CEO deciding things for example uh it can be the silver owners right um and I think there's a lot of good things here and you know um look I'm a fan of people trying things uh uh but I think like you know one couple of challenges which arise are you can still get drug pulled by the server owners at some point in time um um there is really no incentive for the server owners to talk to each other one of them could just become large and you know become a great product by themselves but if they do more power to them uh but that kind of goes against the spirit of uh uh decentralization and the way I understand said it like you really can't take your username with you like if your server kicks you out you're gone from Astronaut it doesn't solve your hey can I take my graph and go keep it with me as a sovereign entity everywhere right so it does have some issues but you know what like I'm a fan of people trying things because you get some elements and you're asking right questions and so I think you know I'm so that's Mastodon who are the server owners in Mastodon can anyone sort of spin up a server as at least a permissionless to become a server in Mastodon yeah anybody can spin up a server it's like uh it's kind of like lamp stack thing that anybody can run um and I believe there are a few which are really popular like the master and company itself runs a really popular one um some people have famously try to run servers and had bad experiences like for example the financial times try it on a server and they had I think like a some bunch of bad behavior and they spun it down silver owners can also decide uh you know which servers can talk to each other like hey I don't want people from this server because I don't like them or whatever um and they can kind of like figure out like how somebody uh federates but the sovereignty of mass restaurant usually lies in the realm of the silver owners which I think is kind of an interesting point to make now I would contrast this with uh let's say let's take forecaster right like because that's the example which you know I think I'm most familiar with um in forecaster first of all your uh uh I just want to put all this disclaimer one more time I'm investor in forecaster so I am conflicted uh but the way it works is uh your uh username on forecaster belongs to you right it's kind of a sovereign thing it's uh you know an nft on chain so it belongs to you like you know Dan Romero you know if he really hates you like can't really uh take it away and I think it's one of the Primitives of forecaster it's like the basic Bare Bones thing like this is where forecaster starts you get an nft that is your username and then the rest of far Caster grows from there absolutely right like it's kind of like really the first step uh it's not a mainnet yet but it will be and you know but that's really the thing and once it's yours it's yours right like and all of the properties of ethereum Etc right make sure that nobody can take it away from you you know um unless you lose your wallet or some such thing um so that's that's just kind of the basic fact so that kind of solves the you know like you know if I piss off Neil Mohan or Elon Musk like if you piss off Dan he really can't do anything to you so that's number one um you know the second part of it is the one way I think I think about it is um how much Choice do you have in Innovation right like right now there's a whole ecosystem and they all by the way it's super early because podcaster is still invite only you ping Dan you get some invites Etc uh and uh you know I highly recommend people go try it out but uh anybody can go build an app on top of forecaster and a lot of other other interesting clients which now exist and they can do anything they want right like you know some try to change a forecaster experience sometime and do uh you know stories on forecaster uh others try and change up the algorithm I don't think about like how profound that is like imagine you could say The Tick Tock CEO last week imagine if there's a world he said listen I know that you folks don't trust that the CCP doesn't influence me but guess what you can use this alternative tiktok client which has his own algorithm which has its like own set of content modulations exactly exactly right imagine a world where he could have said that right so uh that exists from you know day zero on forecaster by all the properties of each which we can sort of nerd out on obviously but the backlist folks probably know it super well but that exists uh from Day Zero and so the a lot of things around content moderation a lot of things around control now happens at the app level so forecast is a protocol uh it has an app it's called warpcast so the way to think about it is your uh mail.app on your phone or Safari on your phone talking to email protocol or talking to http so HTTP in this case should be forecaster uh your browser Safari Chrome Etc would be warcast now that is one of many and I think like you know if you talk to the team they would love to see many many of these out there and you know it's the thing is like every one of these clients can pick the Rules of Engagement so so one client can be hey you know what we only want to talk crypto here anybody talk doesn't talk crypto we kick you out one can you can be around political lines it could be our own communities you can be around countries you can imagine various kinds of bonding boxes but you always have a choice right because you can always go somewhere else and you will all never lose like your graph no that is such a profound thing where if say like two years ago when you know any one of these social media CEOs were testifying they could say you know what I know you don't like my client that's an alternative client which has the political leanings that you want in the algorithm go use that right like and go have fun with it so so that is I think one of the profound things about parkcaster which is one they're upside The Innovation people building cool new things in a way that is literally not possible today on social media and then the downside which is you know if Dan gets replaced by an evil twin who really really hates you doesn't matter you know they can't really you know hurt you that forecaster models is similar to Jack dorsey's blue sky and also lens they they sort of work in a similar way is that right uh I'm a little less familiar with uh blue sky and I haven't played with it uh too much I think I've spent a little bit of time on Master uh which I also think is from Jack Dorsey uh it's I'm not terribly sure how they all uh work together yet but they do have similar elements I think the big difference I would say between and lens by the way is also like you know stunning um you know uh works on it it's another decent like social product uh for me I want to just see people building more of these uh lens is um on the crypto side of things right lens works on polygon it works on chain and so it is much closer to the forecaster world one difference but I think between lens and forecaster is the forecaster wants to build a reference client like off the get-go which is kind of like you know they want people you know so you kind of know how the product looks like but lens is still very much crypto side of the world Noster you know from my understanding and by the way I'm very familiar with the crypto side of things let's do the non-cryptal set of things uh Noster doesn't use a blockchain at all um and uh which you know I don't want well that's we can go into like white Jack things that way but um you know why bitcoiners love it yeah well you said it not me but uh yeah but but you know I do think like you know if you go down the intellectual Maze of how do you get legitimacy provable decentralization you know all the good things that we take for granted you will wind up somewhere with eat or somewhere with a blockchain and not trying to like recreate a bunch of that like for example like how do you how do you rotate your public key how do you make sure like every server has all copies of data how do you have Sovereign rights like these are all things that I've kind of been solved with things like ens and eth and nfts and so on and anyway but again I'm a fan of people trying out different things in decentralization you know uniswap as the world's largest tax with over 1.4 trillion dollars in trading volume but it's so much more uniswap Labs builds products that lets you buy sell and use your self-custody digital assets in a safe simple and secure way uniswap can never take control or misuse your funds the bankless way with you swap you can go directly to defy and buy crypto with your card or bank account on the ethereum layer 1 or layer twos you can also swap tokens at the best possible prices on uniswap.org and you can also find the lowest floor price and trade nfts across more than seven different marketplaces with uniswap's nft aggregator and coming soon you'll be able to self-custody your assets with uniswap's new mobile wallet so go bankless with one of the most trusted names in D5 by going to uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide the Uglies remove the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or fishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February hey let me ask you this though so this is the uh the challenge I think these these web 3 decentralized social projects have which is um how do you build Network effects there's part of me that wonders if the centralization of the algorithm and the centralized nature of the platform itself makes a social network more conducive to building Network effects and so right now I think mainstream probably sees the projects that that you listed and they're like ah these are just you know Sideshow projects they're just a small Niche and share some you know crypto early adopters are on them but like we're never going to get mainstream appeal they're kind of too small is there some way we can like beat the network effect that these web 2 social media juggernauts have and actually supercharge web3 because my worry is or the failure mode is we build all of these great protocols that are you know decentralized and people can you know take their social graph wherever and they have digital property rights and all the things we care about and we're the only people who actually care sriram like do people value this enough and can we overcome these Network effects so there's a bunch of great questions in there first of all I think as an underlying question which I think you asked which is it would be a failure if we only get people who think they're going to get de-platformed right um if um they're not enough human beings in the world who care about that to build an alternative social media company right that just numbers the extremes only the margins come to crypto social networks oh well if that's what if that's always stays the case we would have failed um um because that'll be a very small uh set of people and also those people also sometimes really want the big audiences the mainstream platforms have so that is number one that'd be a failure case um I think the other uh uh uh failure case is I don't think we can nerd snipe people like you know tens of millions of people uh who are going to hopefully use these products will never listen to this podcast they will never care about the things I say and they shouldn't um and you know um but that's going to be the customer's case and so the way I think we win is a couple of ways so I think all social networks being in one of two ways one is uh you know I'm gonna steal this from Eugene ways status as a service which I think is the best ever blog post written on social media companies uh please link to it in the show notes Etc it's one of the best things I've ever written I'm very jealous that he wrote it and not me um but social all social media companies grow in one of two ways one is you get high status people who have been underserved an existing platform and you get them to a new place and they start building a small Network there so I think these are three different companies right uh when I was at Snapchat the high status people were high school kids um in La who are cool and people want to hang out with them they came to snap right when they came to snap other people want to be where they were they didn't want to be where the old people were which was Facebook and then the advertisers won them and when I was at snap by the way we deliberately tried to build it so it was confusing for old people right I'll give you a story right like oh my God are you serious oh yeah totally like make it confusing for patterns and explicit design you know the original uh Snapchat lens face filters right so if you look at it there was no tutorial on the screen there was nothing which taught you how to use it which seemed kind of weird as a partition because nobody had ever built that before why was it well uh you know um number one if nobody thought it old people configured it and all people being anybody over the age of 25 uh um and number two is the best way you learn how to use a lens was somebody in your class maybe somebody good looking you had a crush on show it to you in person and all of a sudden you had a bonding moment you're like oh I now learned this in person and it means something to me as opposal here's a 10 part tutorial on how to use this feature right and it and the other thing that lens did by the way was very cool was it gave you a social license to post a selfie like before that if you post a selfie you just kind of concerned a little weird you did Myspace duck face but with lens you're like I'm just posting a lens folder and just accidentally makes me look good right and it gives you so you kind of craft a lot of these things but it was really meant to get you know High status people right uh and high start in a particular way using the product and then everything else happens right uh tiktok did the same thing so I feel one of the things patterns you'll see it's like every platform has a star who emerges but the stars are always new and homegrown and they're not the same from one platform to the other right so for example on Snapchat it was Kylie Jenner right uh who first broke out on Instagram it was the Rock and Kendall Jenner who were not on Facebook by the way but unique and Tick Tock it was Charlie demelio so why is that right there are a few reasons number one and Eugene way has a great way of saying this right when the Europeans you know the Pioneers uh came to the new uh you know to to the east coast of the United States it's not the rich Europeans it's not the folks living in fancy houses they already had that you know they already had good stuff over there you know the people are kind of like struggling and they didn't have like much they wanted to get out here to the new world right so it's always an underserved High status person so with Tick Tock came out what it do really well it was like well musically but then Tick Tock it was like if you were had dancing skills and if you were funny that was a great format for you right so Charlie demilio amazing skills amazing talent relatable but couldn't you could create the perfectly manufactured Instagram Ram photo but Tick Tock was fantastic right tick tock also did something really uh profound which I think is underappreciated where because he didn't use the follow graph it removed the genie coefficient problem for every Network every Network you have to follow somebody and somebody gets really rich and you know it's really hard to you know get other people to be rich take care we will decide who gets rich and anybody can become richer any single day so you really kind of like act as Ubi plus removing Genie coefficient so anyway so there's kind of this pattern across all the platforms sorry sorry for kind of nerding out for a few minutes there now I think so I think so if you believe this pattern which I really do but I'm sort of a product of the clubhouse era by the way where I cut up my podcast became famous because of Clubhouse so um uh if so for forecasts or anyone's social networks to succeed they need cool people and we can Define Kool-Aid number of ways it can be the folks who hang out on slate start codex and less wrong uh it can be folks you know for popular and culture but the problem with the farmer is probably defined by every single protocol every single platform has its own definition of what cool is yes very much and it should right like you know so for example if you hang on and forecasted today it's a lot of crypto people but crypto people also really smart and it's you know it's a lot of very intellectually dense conversations and my hope and I think Dan's hope is that that brings in more people who want to be a part of it just like if you look at say something like subtract which is centralized platform but when subtract gets these kind of like these Stars right like the the the the Bari vices or you know opinions other people want to be where the stars are and you get like you know like high status people pull different people but I want to be very clicks High status can be anything right it can be LeBron James it can be the a cool artist it can be uh amazingly smart person you can Define anybody but you need High status people first so that's number one that's how a lot of social networks grow right the second part of it I think is um the ideal magic for social network is you capture High status people and a format that makes sense for them so Charlie demilio who is an amazing dancer and it's just amazingly relatable you know a girl next door right like wouldn't be great on subtract I mean she might be but I don't think you know like if you look at her she's so good on like Tech talk so she had a format which really worked for her which I think the second part of the protocol which like can somebody build an app experience right maybe it's video maybe it's live streaming uh maybe it's written text uh maybe it's something that I can't even imagine right now hopefully that's probably the best case which then unlocks the talent of this High status people in a way that nobody has seen before right so you need both but if you get this right like and um and I I and I think you know you're Off to the Races and I think you can destroy the network effect of any centralized social media company history on this is this is so awesome and I think one of the reasons why I love this conversation the most is that the internet all the phases of the internet web 2 web one Web Two web three is all about uh facilitating Human Relationships human connections like the internet didn't take off until we had social reasons to be on it and I think that the kernel of insight that I think we just got from you is that every single social media platform that's Arisen has unlocked some sort of expression and perhaps allowed for that unlock that new form of self-expression to come from a new crop of people who have different end of their skill sets from the other platforms that already exist and so I think the Learning lesson for the bankless nation to really just take note of is that far Caster Macedon lens protocol these are all new protocols to express ourselves and they're going to enable certain new types of people who maybe Instagram wasn't for you maybe Snapchat wasn't for you but maybe forecaster does unlock a certain Behavior set a certain way of expressing yourself that at the forecaster Community really enjoys and you bankless listener could be the first ever forecaster influencer if that is for you or maybe it's lens or maybe it's uh you know so insert your web 3 social media protocol here I think one of the reasons why so many of us are in this space why I came to this space where Ryan came to the space is that we saw such a fertile ground for growth uh it was easy to inject yourself into your and to build something new and to tap into that world and I think that is probably what we're saying with this world of web 3 social so I think the big takeaway that I think everyone should one should have is that maybe try out some of these web fee protocols and see if this fertile ground if your seeds can grow in this fertile ground and maybe maybe you are the first uh forecaster Superstar I'm sure there's already some I'm sure there's people already competing in this field uh but but I I think that's really just the the actionable Insight that the alpha here is that for web 3 social media developers you need a superstar a homegrown superstar that is your kpi and then also for the for the people out there the users of these apps the way to get ahead in this world is that these social media apps these brand new ones are fertile and easy to penetrate and there's not much much competition there and maybe you're the one that this brand new protocol this brand new decentralized social media platform maybe you really resonate with that and it's just any thoughts and Reflections on this uh well you assembled a lot better than I could so plus one to everything you've said I think there are two layers right one is you become a superstar but I think the other profound thing is you can do something on this thing which you can't do in centralized social which is you can build the app that produces Superstars you can't do that on Tick Tock you can't do that on Facebook right you can't be like hey you know what I have an idea for Instagram which is going to create a new experience you just can't do that so if you're a developer writing code like you know you don't need to call up anybody for permission right just go to any one of these sites look at the developer docs spin up vs code write something right and then maybe you can be the Superstar manufacturing Factory which I think is super interesting too and that is something which is completely not possible in centralized web 2 today yeah I really want I really want to double down on that because the thing that really got my juices going when we interviewed um Dan Romero from forecaster is the idea that far Caster is the protocol and it's up to the world to build clients upon it and so that was something that Twitter almost was in the early days of Twitter it almost was like that and then early in this conversation we talked about how all these web 2 apps were open Town squares and slowly they closed their walls into into centralized Towers now we have protocols that are Town squares that because in their nature they will stay Town squares and I think what you're saying is free ROM is that uh developers can come build more reasons to be in the town square and so we could actually turn this into a Cambrian explosion of like all right far caster and this one client can create this one flavor of superstars but developers can come and create infinite number of superstars infinite flavors of reasons to being on Far Caster that grow different kinds of superstars because the room for clients on farcaster uh where in Twitter Facebook Instagram there's only one client for each one of those protocols but with farcaster there can be hundreds or thousands of clients absolutely let me give somebody like an idea right off the get-go it's maybe a trivial idea right so uh every social media company right now has a lot large machine learning team and they put a lot of work into ranking it's a very complex technical thing a lot of effort lots of complexity but what has overtaken the world of ranking and machine learning in the last few months is GPT right so um you know idea for just somebody out there uh go out eat up and go build a forecaster client and then replace all things ranking and trending by just piping in a GPD and saying that hey these are kind of things which I like give me more stuff which I like see what happens right so uh like you know just the fact that you know I'm pretty sure and whether you can probably ask GP to kind of write the code for you to do a lot of this I actually think so you can actually speed it up so uh the I the fact that you can probably try one of these things and change the way forecasters what webcast algorithm works or uh you know or do your own thing that's super profound so I I really want to encourage people to go build things and you know try out things because I really want to fire up people's imagination and go ask questions of like why can't I do that on Instagram like why can't I change the trending algorithm on Tick Tock like as opposed to going back to my story of how this actor lost this movie like imagine like five different apps and you go well you know I have a different algorithm here which is actually the trending algorithm that I want to see so uh we talked about also by the way kind of a good way to bring together crypto and AI which I think is always fun yeah I um I do kind of wonder who the cool kids of uh some farcaster or web3 protocol are going to be like um I guess part of my my theory is that's probably going to come from something in crypto like maybe the the closest candidate is probably like the nft Creator type Community because you know anything built on top of a web 3 stack is going to enshrine digital property rights and nfts and you can already see kind of the Creator communities web 3 Creator communities blossoming in things like lens and things like uh farcaster and they're they're going to be like specially attuned for that so I I wonder if it's going to come from the nft community right we we saw a glimmers of that sort of nfts reaching like cool kids status in 2020 the first part of 2022 let's say before everything kind of crashed down uh completely um but like this isn't the end of nfts certainly it's not the end of the story I wonder if that's where where it emerges do you have any thoughts on where the cool kids might come from sriram uh it could be I think you know if you look at forecast today a lot of like intellectually dense conversations they're all you know very Affiliated to crypto obviously just because those are kinds of people are originally in it one of the interesting things I'll point out is the cool kids change so I'm not sure like who do you think of for an example right now as the top people on Twitter the last few years just give me a few names I'm in I'm inside of the crypto bubble so my top crypto people in on Twitter are my top people on Twitter are crypto people definitely Elon Musk would be obviously now he's like stacking the deck though yeah well yeah yeah yeah he bought the thing um well there's Elon you know back when Trump was on some people would say Trump uh you know Kanye you know a lot of sports stars but if you go back like few years before that there was a time uh and I'm really dating myself here one of Twitter's breakout movements was when Ashton Kutcher and CNN had a race to get to a million followers oh yeah like there's a there's a bunch of people in banglading like what the f is he talking about other people going like God I feel so awesome I'm the first one I don't remember this at all God I hate you again it was raised to a million followers right and it was Anderson Cooper for CNN versus Ashton Kutcher they were the stars of Twitter but if you go and they were active participants this wasn't people watching them they actually were playing the game right oh yeah they wanted to get to the first million followers which seems like a crazy low number now like given like you know what he's on Twitter or Mr Beast or someone but that was a game but if you go back even before that the original set of people on Twitter where all people in San Francisco right it was all the dead people right like so one of the interesting things about these networks is that it constantly keeps changing exactly things actually kind of healthy to one of the Twitter's failures I think is failure to elevate new stars because once um uh it's going to Sidetrack Twitter's biggest sin in a lot of ways I think was a photograph because once you have a photograph you have a lot of interesting people on Twitter but the only way to get them discovered is you have to get other people to follow them so you're always being like hey please follow this person he's really good for you he or she just trusts me and it's so you kind of had these people who had a million plus followers and they got locked in so they were like that the genie coefficient the wealth inequality of Twitter started like expanding more and more so a lot of product efforts were always like please follow this person I really wanted to follow this person right and if I think if Twitter had figured out uh which I think hopefully we'll see with the For You tab to constantly bring in new stars because one you're bringing new talent to it we have a fresh thing to say second you're keeping the older folks on their toes you're like Hey listen you're not gonna get the reach because if you're not participating you're gone right like one of my ideas for Twitter when I was there was like people should not show the number of followers at all and you should just show their account and you know we should start showing people how to say photographs so uh I think every healthy social network constantly needs to bring in Elevate new people uh and new talent to uh stay fresh and so my hope is who was the start of forecaster today is different from the forecaster two years from now and five years from now and there's a bunch of apps which all have their own Stars maybe there's a Indian forecaster client which only has like you know Tamil and Hindi in Telugu ecosystem people one for every country you can just kind of really go run wild with this let me ask you uh round tripping on Elon then so we we've just extol the virtues of web3 Social and decentralization um part of me was hoping like a small part of me was hoping because it was a faint hope that Elon would come into Twitter and he would be like web3 and crypto you know like we know he tracks uh crypto maybe not sort of in depth not the layer uh at the level that that we do of course but um he knows a thing or two about crypto he's certainly on the the Doge train so part of my Hope was that he would start to incorporate more web 3 features into into crypto whether it's sort of you know uh decentralized identity of some sort or property rights other things what what would it take to crypto pill Elon and get him to not necessarily pivot the entire company of Twitter towards decentralized social media but at least start to incorporate some of these features uh well I don't want to speak for him or reveal private conversation I definitely tried and as you can imagine um and uh so I I would say a few things right like I think Elon has his hands full of Twitter of just making the basics work right now right let's build a product everyone uses uh let's build a thriving business so I would say um in a um you know what the broad crypto Community would need to not to just for Elon right this can be for Adam mostaria to Instagram this can be for Zuckerberg this can be for Neil Mohan look at me literally anybody is to convince them how crypto brings value to them and I think it's often a challenge where if you say like hey your service is messed up and we need to have people just leave to a competitor that's often becomes challenging I think the challenge for crypto world is how do you make an argument that says like this is going to benefit you this is going to bring in features uh make your community happy in ways that they're not happy today right I think that's going to be the thing um I know elon's a fan of some elements of crypto maybe not a fan of other elements I'll kind of speak about that uh uh himself but I think that's the value prop I would say like you had to paint a value proposition not just for him but for any CEO right like what is in it for you uh to crypto enable your services I think that's the challenge for all of us I felt like we were making some Headway in web 2 for a while there where we started to see web 2 companies establish social media companies start to integrate web 3 features and then more recently I think after 2022 really we've seen a pullback of That So Meta for example um Instagram I remember what did this launched last year in 2022 over the spring or summer I was so excited to see Instagram uh start to add some nft features into into their product and this felt like oh this is a huge mainstream moment for crypto this is going to be huge and then more recently it was like two weeks ago sriram they uh decided to um you know remove that feature and it's not even a year later not even a year later um so definitely not staying in the game for for the marathon but there seems to be something in the air with web 2 where they've started to pull away from web3 and I'm wondering if you think that will be reversed or if that's just the way it's going to be for a while and we'll just have to on the web 3 social side kind of build the proof here and and as you just said paint the value proposition for web 2 before they get onboarded again yeah it's definitely frustrating um I will say one thing there's a great Steve Jobs line um from you know the mid 90s I think when Steve Jobs had just come back and he said he told the Mac Community um Microsoft doesn't have to lose for Apple to win uh that's kind of a great video of him saying this uh somewhere so I don't think web2 has to disappear or lose and I think Dan drummer is always very good about this right he was like the web 2 is great brought a lot of great things like bike career wouldn't exist without Twitter like you know I was very happy at Facebook a lot of great smart people like it doesn't have to lose for uh crypto to win so it's not like you know like Us Versus Them thing I think what has happened like and I'd sort of try to urge some people to go the other way and maybe unsuccessfully so at times is there's a confidence a few things right number one is there's a broad Market pullback uh which I think is like no secret like every large tech company is hassing having layoffs they are like let's just focus on what is actually hardcore uh to what we do so I think that's like a that's just like a factor like they're like if you kind of Stack rank things and you're like hey we need to do this thing which is existential which makes money for the company and we go compete on viewers like this is thing and everything else let's kind of you know cut it or lay off those people you know sometimes crypto I think winds up on the chopping block so I think that's definitely a factor uh another factor I think is the market pullback uh just obviously so because the market pullback means maybe sometimes perceived less interest inside these companies and then they're like when they're trying to stack rank features this thing on the ones are chopping but I would say there might be a deeper question which I hope is not true which is crypto at its very nature needs people to hand over power right like you can't make decisions in a centralized conference room you need to let the community make the decision and there is a part of me which wonders whether that is maybe a bridge too far for some companies to embrace I sincerely hope that's not the case I've seen rumors for example of meta launching a decent listing I don't know I haven't seen the details yet um and there are other rumors um but there may be a world where it may be a step too far and you may need to be decentralized from Day Zero to really really buy-in I really don't think that's hope it's not the case I've talked to a lot of very smart people in these companies who have much more practical issues practical issues like hey we want to build this thing but gas fees are too high right like I want the speed I want performance I want security it's just the basics and I think we as a crypto Community we like we know we're like hey they just want the basics right they want somebody to understand it not spend like you know 20 30 bucks for a transaction just the basic they often want that uh Second is you know they you know they want access to large community of people so there's a lot in there I wouldn't attribute you know negative motivation like Mal noted uh some sort of terrible motivations to them um uh and it sincerely just hope it's not you know they come back to crypto three one one thing I want to ask you about uh is just the the future of creators in these social media platforms and uh you are a GP to a16z crypto which has got to be one of the most busy jobs in the world uh yet you still find yourself doing a podcast uh which begs the question what about the podcast is so valuable to you that you take time out of your very busy life to actually be a Creator in the in this world of of social platforms and I think this this conversation will eventually be getting bleed into the conversation of how AI can help creators but I want to hear from you first like well and again very busy job you still find the motivation and the the desire to be a Creator so what what's what's the future for creators in this in this crazy world of the internet in 2023 and why do you do it uh thank you uh you know I often tell people that the job of a Founder is 100x more busy than the job of ovc but thank you for saying that uh and uh I think there's a few things um and the folks listen can I plug my show like you know uh uh my wife and I do a podcast uh you know it's called and you know it's on YouTube you can listen to podcasts uh there's a few reasons there'll be a link in the show notes oh thank you thank you smash like subscribe you know ping everything you know do all the other 20 things do those things that's probably a web three thing too oh yeah yeah giving somebody your attention is definitely a universal notion I think um and so there's a few reasons one is uh it's very personal uh like I wouldn't generally be here if I didn't have access to the open internet um and I have been sort of my wife and I you know we met on Yahoo messenger 21 years ago right to build a website we've been together for 20 to 21 years since that evening we met actually uh and uh so our lives have been tied to Tech optimism and positivity and it's in and I've been we have been very dismayed person really about the rhetoric against Tech right and Founders and Entrepreneurship by a lot of different parties uh and this is in our way you know a way of giving back um where uh we are like hey can we you know if you listen to our episodes it's just a way where we highlight uh people just kind of made it from the outside of tech to the inside often said sometimes it's not Tech but it's like you know and we want like in hopefully some kid somewhere is watching and he goes like oh you know I'm like that person when they start off maybe I can go open my laptop and build something cool that's the ideal uh scenario so there's kind of an altruistic thing uh of just kind of giving back and I do think like if you want to do these podcasts because things long term it has to come from something ideological right it can't be like I just want to do it for the views like you'll just burn out like over time and you know and you people can sense it by the way your viewers are not dumb um no the non-altristic view is if that kid at some point in time uh Builds an amazing company they think hey maybe I can go as a weird Indian guy who I saw on a podcast to for some money right and they build something amazing that's great but it doesn't happen that's also fine um I would say that uh you know in the uh the other version I think about it is in the memetic Battleground that we find ourselves today in uh having an online Army which I think is balaji's place he does have an army like you know ours are more like people who kind of maybe like us and find us a nice um but having an online Army and a following backless Nation um is one of the most important things you can have because there are so many forces that are coming at us right forces in government uh forces in the press and the ability to have a message and get it out there and battle it out on Twitter or on YouTube is super super important now everyone has their own way of doing it um Balaji does this one Million Dollar Bet which uh we can you know which is a whole other thing uh or you know but I think our way is to spread positivity and optimism and yeah so that's why we do it and do you think there's the web 3 technology is really supercharged creators ability to harness and leverage that army oh yeah so this is great so um uh I have a fun story uh which is uh you know Vin Diesel was one of the most hated people at Facebook right uh uh the actor yes uh and I don't think the story has been told before in public uh maybe he'll get in trouble maybe I don't know so but uh so the story around this is uh you know about 10 years ago uh Vin Diesel was super popular had a super popular Facebook page um and he had like millions of followers Etc right I don't know whether celebrities still have like large basically this thing and and he also in Zuckerberg was a huge personal fan of Vin Diesel it's exactly very well documented exactly the story how Vin Diesel made Triplex 2 uh just because Mark actually asked him to uh do so right he was actually a very big fan um but at the time you know uh the way the social contract of Facebook or any social media company worked was you bring in you bring in as a Creator which is not even a word at the time influencer is not a word you bring in your energy your creativity uh you bring you post content and the trade was it we will give you eyeballs we will give you views we will give you attention there's no money involved and the connection to a Vin Diesel who is that every time there have been internal discussion about like hey can we start paying people the uh the rebuttal would be like well then Vin Diesel would ask us for money and we don't want that he's doing it okay right like sure anyway so uh uh and uh but that was kind of the social contract of the internet for several years but a few years ago and this has nothing to do with web3 that contract shifted right uh I think of companies like Cameo where you're like hey you know what I want to kind of like make a living uh with my uh product but also just the rise of influencers and creators like think uh you know I think like the original YouTube folks like PewDiePie Etc to then to you know the Paul Brothers uh to now like obviously Mr B's people are building these entire companies and you know and they're making a living you know online so now the contract of eyeballs uh and kind of sneak in an ad for uh you know attention just doesn't work anymore and she's your advice of company so cameo in the NSFW world only fans is kind of the obvious example which is like people make an actual living and the core Atomic unit of these companies like there's a financial uh you know transaction involved right so now you kind of have uh sort of a conflict of interest because if you're a big tech company right you have a very high margin business right you have to give zero money to the people who are creating content uh from you right but you're spending a lot of money on data centers the r d Etc right and you're making a lot of money uh from ads right but if your creators are suddenly saying like hey uh I am making money for you and if I walk away it's bad for you and you have to give me money that you know seriously high margin business you're going to start eating into the margin right so I you know I used to say that when I was at Twitter we should build an algorithm of who's valuable to Twitter and you can make an argument that Elon Musk is one of the most valuable users to Twitter because if he went away there might be some set of people like ah I find Twitter less interesting maybe I'll you know go elsewhere so and I think you know about a few years ago creators started realizing their power right and they've been pushing for basically like hey I want my share of what I'm giving you right and that's kind of active conversion so every company tries tools there are all these Creator funds or I will give you like a bonus or I'll give you a little rev share and the internal discussion is always like well how can we kind of do this without eating toward margins but also incentivizing content and maybe the top people won't go away right now this now web3 just kind of finish this is the ultimate expression of this because you're giving two things one is you're aligning hopefully over the long term um economic incentives but also I think uh you're aligning ownership right like so for example like right now you know you folks are stuck to YouTube right well I mean you have a newsletter and you're on Twitter Etc but if YouTube takes you down right it's probably not going to be I mean you you'll do fantastic but it's not gonna be you're gonna have like an unfun few days I'm sure right now I did it again yeah yeah yeah right and and uh so but you know so first thing is this it just gives you control over your own property right so you can't get rock pulled and you you know and you can maybe go to an alternator which I think is very powerful uh the longer term expression all of this is obviously uh you know governance right which is how do you have a say and a say can be in many different ways I think a token is one way but the right to go to a different person or uh use a different client is another way where you say like I want to pick a different uh path for this company maybe it's different algorithm maybe it's a different color in the UI whatever it is I want to have a say instead of centralized people so I think web3 in some ways kind of the ultimate expression of the uh the Creator control Journey uh srirama this has been a lot of fun I um I have one other question for you that's unrelated to web3 and then maybe we summarize this and uh and conclude here but this is a question unrelated to web3 but uh something I want to briefly pick your brain on um crypto and AI right this topic has come up a few times of course we've had you know one AI podcast was more the Doomer side of things we we haven't actually explored we weren't able to get to crypto yeah I'm sure that nobody will see this episode because we'll all be dead by then it's possible uh but but okay is there some sort of intersection between crypto and AI are they complete orthogonal Technologies how do you think that um crypto and AI play a role together in the future and and really what should we be exploring on Bank list as it relates to AI I love this question okay you know first of all uh the meme that makes me most laugh is the one where the girl is looking at the guy looking at the other girl and it's like you know uh crypto PCS and then AI yeah I think nothing could be further from the truth I think the accurate me for crypto and AI is that the guy with the news from Pirates going like first time all right like you know because I think we in crypto uh you know look at some of the prints in Ai and we see some of the patterns that we have been through uh and we're like oh yeah this whole thing kind of could be happening again so what do I mean right and first of all look AI could be one of the most profound things that we see in our lifetimes right like you know it could be bigger than the mobile phone it could be bigger than the information of the internet it could be like the invention of the steam engine or something worse like I don't know how this all plays out right like I don't think anybody really knows but I think we all can sense that there is something profound here happening um and I think the intersection of crypto and AI is in a few places right the first one is the risk of centralization like I think the folks at open AI anthropic Google Microsoft Etc are all really smart I know a lot of them I think they're super well incentivized but I do think over time you know AI you know it's so too important uh a technology change for Humanity to lie within a few people's hands like I wouldn't trust myself if somebody made me the god king of AI like I wouldn't trust you I'm Christian to make the decisions of what gets uh launched who has access who doesn't have access and AI by the way they're still in the age of API keys right so I think just on that level uh you know I think AI you know be over to the world for AI to be decentralized and that means running on a MacBook laptop that means an Indian kid being able to train an llm or inference uh something without asking for permission and by the way I think it's probably inevitably going to happen whether we like it or not so that's a very broad philosophical uh uh kind of a statement but if you kind of break it down um I think at every layer of the kind of stack of LMS today which I've been spending some time on um is there's a crypto element to it and there are a lot of interesting people are working on it and some of them have not announced stuff in public so I want to be kind of careful like one is just in the training side right the way you train AI llms today is you you know you raise a lot of money and you basically get access to a bunch of like you know a100s or h100s or whatever and then it run for a long time and you train these right so imagine a world where you decentralize that and you can do it you know not just in a data center that you know like a large tech company or somebody a large bench a capital Town runs but a lot of different pieces so that's one way that's kind of one theme is very interesting a lot of interesting people working on this the other problem I would say is going back to your creators theme is one great existential question is the advice I really want to give clear to Chris Dixon he's kind of the origin a lot of these ideas uh the contract of the internet was uh you know hey I give you content and you send traffic to me and one of the things Chris often like points out is that AI could actually break that contract right like so for example I could create this content like you creating this content on backlist right now right and the hope is you know somebody subscribes and your sponsors uh you know see their ad Impressions they give you more money Etc that's all good that's the way the internet works right but imagine you know uh if LMS are trained by you and when somebody says like hey what is sriram Christian say on Bank list and you know and it shows up on this other UI and you play no part in it like that's not the way the internet is really supposed to work so I think there's going to be this great interesting discussion it's already happening right you know for stuff like people like artists Etc uh which is how do you think about I think one attribution which is how much of my work is showing up in the final output when you type it something in chat GPT or look at Dali or stable diffusion or uh mid-journey or whatever uh and the other is how do I get rewarded for it right and I think this is actually kind of important also which is uh it's not just about rewarding existing work it's also about like how do you Spur new innovation and new content to uh you know to show up so and I think these are all unsolved problems it's very very very early days uh but I think it would be a tragedy if llms just stay in the realm of API keys and there's a few people have access to billions of dollars and that's you know that's all it is and even though I like those people I think they're really amazing I think it'd be a tragedy for all the reasons I like Zuckerberg and you know I uh liked the uh Adam or Siri but I still don't think they should call all the shots so what's going to be more transformational crypto or AI if you had to pick crypto meets AI all right good answer combination of both true um this has been a lot of fun maybe maybe just summarize this this for us um I think the theme of this episode is uh web two broken web3 fixes this or at least fixes some part of it what are kind of your your closing Arguments for uh why web3 is is the future of of social on the internet I would say look the backless Nation are huge fans of crypto but I hope this reaches folks who are not crypto and I would say listen even if you just don't bind to crypto just think about why do things have to be this way like why can't a 15 year old kid in India write code without asking people for permission or write you know go on an app without being worried about who is controlling what he or she can't say it doesn't have to be this way um and what do we need to do to make it happen so um and I think one there's people asking themselves a question I think will lead them down like a very interesting track and the second is uh I look I my life my dad spent 40 years in the same company in a small town in India and you work this year anyways and he never had an opportunity at all like you know he was happy but you know he had an opportunity to do anything else outside of his job and he passed away like in 2006 and I always think about if you had access to the internet he was brilliant right but he had no opportunity he was just there's nothing he could do right he wanted right but he had access to the internet he could have done something right like hikero actually you know gone out there and you know participated in the global economy in the marketplace of ideas in a way he just had no access to and I'm sort of a big believer in the human Spirit creativity and unleashing that and I think unless we have some version of this play out right like future versions of my dad won't get a shot in the marketplace of ideas and I think that'll be a deep deep tragedy so I'll leave it to that this is the theme great closing argument this uh technology the reason we're here is to unlock human potential certainly at the individual level at the collective level at the societal level sriram uh we are looking for big things from from web3 we're hoping it can uh make the internet fun again and interesting and uh more free more democratic so thank you for walking us through this thank you so much for having me action items makeless Nation we will include a link to sriram's podcast with his wife which is absolutely fantastic as well as their sub stack you can access that in the show notes also there was an article that was mentioned that I'm gonna go flag and read after this episode I haven't read it yet called status as a service we'll include a link in the show notes to that too wrist and disclaimers Bank list nation of course crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the Bangles Journey thanks a lot foreign
