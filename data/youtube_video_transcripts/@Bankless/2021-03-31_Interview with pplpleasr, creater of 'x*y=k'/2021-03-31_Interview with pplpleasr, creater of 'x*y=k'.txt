people pleaser uh congratulations on the sale how does it feel uh how does it feel to have raised over half a million dollars obviously i mean it feels good i'm just it feels surreal almost like i don't haven't really like sit in yet other than that there's like a huge pile of each like sitting in my wallet right now that um myself and the unispot team are gonna link you know figure out how we're going to allocate the funds and then we'll post a follow-up on twitter about it with all the details and stuff so how did you and the uni-swap team come to be how did you guys meet um tyrone chitra texted me a while ago it was in january um he texted me and then he was like hey somebody from unislop just messaged me asking if um you'd be open like to working with them and i was like i mean yeah let's go into the process of like how the symbolism for the in the in the in the piece x times uh y equals k actually came about um was that all all your creative work or was there like a back and forth with like maybe hayden or people on the uni swap team like how like the obviously the unicorn would be a core feature but there's so much more in there as well tell us about that process it's mainly there's just a chat that has me um hayden uh taiyo and um khalil so teo is the strategy lead at unislop and then khalil is a designer at uni swap and then so initially actually khalil had spoken to me about making several different like short animations sort of like going through the the concepts of v3 um but then it's like eventually we decided to sort of just do like the one sort of hero um teaser video because at least like my my approach with these things is um they're always like as you probably noticed like not not so literal and um they're like more apps on the abstract side of things like abstract with a meaning obviously like you know i always um everything in my videos always means something but it's not maybe immediately obvious to the viewer um which i think is part of why people find the videos fun i guess it's like a little easter egg hunt or something right um but yeah so and so eventually you know we kind of decided like well there's some really technical um explanations about you know like um features of uniform v3 that you know require very very literal um animation videos which um you know also came rolled out later you know on on wednesday with that blog post and i mean that was your world as well no no no so that was um but they still looked incredible and helped people understand the concepts which i think was really great and then so i was able to sort of sort of just focus on the one like hero launch video um and yeah so then since that like decision was made then i was a little i i had like way more sort of like room to just expand creatively and then just sort of do what i always do um and so there were definitely a lot of like uh brainstorms back and forth you know between khalil and i about uh initially we had just talked about you know something that involves you know one of the main features is how uh like the of the bonding curve is now sort of like modifiable or you know like customizable essentially and then so you know we discussed maybe concepts involving like um maybe like a power user that's like uh morphing something or you know like just something that's like you know like involving a user and like manipulation of the the curve itself or you know we even threw out crazy ideas like what if we had like a landscape and like somebody was like you know like morphing the landscape or something and then the actual video came into fruition because khalil had showed me this a short story um and it was like about just like a magical forest or something and i i just like i really felt inspired by that short story and also you know when like he showed it to me i was just seeing like um you know like images in my head um already like i mentioned in the video princess mononoke was you know like high priority like visual references for me because one of my favorite videos i'm sorry movies and so um yeah so then it kind of like in my head started to come together at that point and then um so then i i was like okay let me like sketch up a storyboard and then you can talk about it and so pretty simple like four frames i had meant for it to just like here's just a rough like four frames and then we can talk about it but then it actually just ended up being like i guess these four frames work as each like individual shots and then so so yeah um that's kind of like how it came about and then obviously all the other like smaller details and stuff are um so that was like you know the sort of like the skeleton of the video and then the other small details you know usually come up like as i'm doing production or something you know they're like they always it's always like an ongoing process right like you know you literally be walking outside and then you're like well i have this idea or you know like even up until the last minute when when i'm like editing or something you know like like in the week like leading up to when the video is about to be released uh there could be like new ideas and i'm sort of like yeah like for example the the idea with um like so khalil had said that the uni swap team were uh hoping for like the the curves to be like um you know like more than just like one color and then um from that input i decided to like instead of just making like individual like strands different colors but why not also integrate like the fact that the colors are like sliding which is sort of reflecting that kind of uh which section on the bonding curve like we're gonna choose her to provide your liquidity so yeah like and that was like super late in the process as well and um so yeah there's like so many things that kind of it's kind of like a it happens with consciousness yeah stream of consciousness and happens with a lot of my videos too where i feel like there's a lot of happy accidents as well where like i've thought we'll just like either randomly roll in or you know i'll be making something and i'd be like oh that looks cool what can i extrapolate from this or i don't know just i feel blessed that just the whole thing came together nicely yeah it's an amazing piece of art and i think my favorite piece about it and you talked about this in your like behind the scenes video was how the unicorn starts in like this desolate land and then moves into the world of ethereum which is like lush and rich talk about talk about that metaphor and why you think that that is a worthy metaphor to include in this uh in this piece well i mean i think obviously uniswap being so essential to the entire d5 space and actually um the like the whole ethereum ecospace i think is um sort of something that i wanted to convey in the video as well so at least my take of it and you know the video is always also like open to some degree of interpretation to the viewer as well but my take of it is that sort of like you know one uni swap was introduced to the whole defy space like they kind of changed the game right like they introduced all this like new possibility of exchanging different tokens and providing liquidity and stuff which um so you know like the way it like said it in my video was like oh it's like a desolate land was maybe kind of like a stretch an exaggeration like obviously the land was rich already before that but it's kind of like yeah like unisop kind of brought this whole you know um ensemble of like innovation and just like color you could say to the whole device space and then so that's kind of what um sparked the idea and then really drove the sort of like narrative throughout the video and yeah so you know i i did i did just always have the intention of making the video slightly like psychedelic which is why you know like the end of the result was like stuff swirling around too i mean i try to keep it a theme throughout the entire video as well there's there was so so many things that i wanted to fit in the behind the scenes video but um i didn't want to make it too long because you know like i wanted to keep it short and sweet but yeah like even there's like even down to tiny details like um that the saturation levels in the video from the beginning to the end uh change as well so it's like starts out a lot less saturated and then um it gets way more saturated towards the end you know as everything sort of like comes together like um unicorn ethereum and then there's like a pool underneath which is also you know could be like a liquidity pool and then the constellation above like you know when everything comes together it's like harmonious and colorful so how long were you working on this piece before it was actually from start to finish actually i think from ideation it would be about a month and a half unfortunately i did um have i have like two artists who were able to sort of like i was able to delegate some tasks too um and also helped me out with like so i had this artist um hafid who is a great ex particles simulation artist um that's a good in case you're not like familiar with this just like a a specific sort of like task within the animation pipeline um and so he's really good at that so you know there were a lot of things like involving like particles and um simulated in the video that um he uh did a phenomenal job with and i also had one of my old co-workers like a girl that i and a good friend that i used to work with and her name is marion super talented animator she's worked on like uh the new pokemon movie um like animating the future and stuff did such a great job i asked her to help me out with uh the sort of the movement of the unicorn and that's why you know it looks so smooth and amazing that's all hats off to her so i was able to sort of just um focus on like directing and also obviously like i did everything else so you know like all the other like animating parts of it like assembling the scene like building some models and then also you know like curating the entire look and palette um compositing rendering uh post-production all that kind of stuff i think that definitely helped the production sort of like speed up a little bit um but it was i did like work a lot throughout this like month and a half but it was like it was like really fun which is why i put so many hours into it because i'm having fun and i'm actually really glad that you know the people that i brought on board said that they also had a lot of fun it's just everybody had fun making it and that's i think that's like the main goal at the end of the day i think artistic products always come out looking a lot better when people are passionate about what they're doing that's that's something i'm personally very hopeful about with what ethereum can bring to the world around it is the opportunities to create value that people had fun creating along the way um and i think that's a this is a perfect manifestation of that yeah definitely so uh this animation is almost a week old in the public uh sphere and so uh you know a week ago none of this none of this all this news event hadn't hadn't happened yet so while you were but you knew that you were going to nft it did you have any sort of like guess as to like how much this would go for on the secondary market before the actual nft auction started i had no idea i mean um the the nft wasn't actually part of the original plan at all it was just an idea that i had um sort of like halfway through production um it was also because i there were a lot of people uh i hadn't you know like i hadn't been minting some nf just like you know way like when we say way back in the day on crypto it's like not that long ago but um but it was definitely you know last year essentially and then so um like i haven't you know because i've been sort of like so invested in the d5 video eco space that i hadn't had time to sort of like dive into the nft space and obviously like nfc like recently really blew up too and um there was like a tiny little bit of fomo there but also just like people constantly like always messaging me be like why aren't you like selling any nft they're like why don't you admit nfts like i would love to you know like buy and he or whatever and i'm just like i'm too busy like making videos um and then i was like well why wouldn't i like double up on this you know but obviously i think um sort of like that the way i looked at it was just you know obviously the goal wasn't to make money but which is why i brought like it was all part of like i was just like to unicef i was like why don't we make this an nft and like make it worthwhile which is donating it to a good cause like i have no idea how much we're gonna raise which is why we didn't also didn't like settle on like one specific charity yet because i was like i like i don't wanna promise like oh we can donate to three charities just in case i only sell it for like a hundred dollars and you can only like donate thirty dollars you know what i mean so like it's like it wouldn't even be worth a gas fee so yeah like that was kind of why but i was like you know depending on how much we raise then we can sort of like um decide on how many we can actually allocate to which you know ended up obviously way exceeding my expectations like this whole dow thing that just i was like i woke up it was like we're gonna get into that for sure like the bidding war ended like in the morning of my time and i woke up was like there's suddenly like a dow named after me like so yeah let's get into that so uh the auction started on thursday my thursday and and then ended on friday which was your saturday morning uh and so then this massive bid hundred eighth bid comes in from andrew kang and uh i'm sure that was that was surprising and then leighton cusack uh signals on on twitter saying hey who wants to like pool our capital together so we can buy this thing because we'll need to match we'll need to beat this 100 each bid were you watching this happen or were you asleep while this was going on i saw his initial tweet about like oh does anybody want to get together a dow because um jameis had sent it to me and then i was like oh that's cool and i actually told jamis too i was like i actually love obviously i didn't know who was gonna win the auction at the time but i was just like i actually love the idea of the video being owned by like the community the same community that supported me you know from day one right like that's awesome to me at least i was like and it almost feels like weird that because like this is like the unison b3 like announcement video obviously it was like a big deal when it came out too so it's like it almost feels weird if it like just belonged to one person or something but i i was just thinking that it was a cool idea at the time i didn't know how they were gonna do it i just knew that they were they were gonna sort of something about that was happening but obviously you know i wasn't like involved in the channels or anything and then so and then yeah like uh when the 100 bid came in uh i was just like okay this is already far exceeded my expectations like literally i was having a conversation with um khalil the designer like you know a few days before like we were about to drop the nft and then we were just checking out foundation and we saw this like one nft that sold for 10 even we're like wow 10 each like that's amazing and then yeah so obviously 100 each came in like it was just nuts and then everything else was even crazier right so now this group of i don't know how many of them there are like 12 15 people they now they have this an actual dow like you said named after you please pleaser dao uh and when i was talking to lace layton leighton said that well um the this pleaser dow has excess eath left over and he doesn't know like the the dow members he thinks doesn't really want any of their eath back and they actually want to like grow the dao but then what that means is that people pleaser the artist needs to produce more art for the dow to have a purpose so my question to you is what's the future of your artwork and as it relates to tokens on ethereum and and has this event changed that trajectory at all it definitely has because um i had always been also kind of cautious i mean or not even cautious because it never really even came to me that i would be minting these videos as nfts because in my head um obviously always the ip would belong to the protocol who commissioned it in the first place right which is why i'm obviously super grateful that uh unisoft were so supportive of this decision we're like yeah um you know it's yours like minted but obviously the donation we're making together because um this wouldn't have happened because of them but um yeah i'm just like so grateful that they gave me this like chance to sort of um broadcast my artwork to such a large audience as well um because i think was sort of like a more niche community before um so but hopefully uh you know going forward i i think i would like to sort of um have a combination between minting my personal artwork um and then also uh definitely but i think within i also was having these ideas about you know even within my personal artwork i wanna still keep the same theme about you know putting in um subtle references here and there to either defy um or ethereum ecosystem and i think it would be a fun way for uh people who are interested in um the art to sort of look for those things as well and you know towards a broader audience like just a general nft audience you'd just be like oh this is a cool animation or like a cool piece of art but for um the d5 community which is you know my og community um there's an extra meaning behind that where they can pick up on references to certain things that maybe other people wouldn't understand or just not know about the fascinating thing to me about this story is that it is such a perfect like accidental orchestration of what makes us ethereum so awesome we have this application that is so powerful and in my opinion like resonant with the values of ethereum we have this dao which collected many different people to to empower them to get something done that they wanted and then we had the funding of cultural and artistic expression which wouldn't have been uh been able to have been funded with half a million dollars to in without this uh medium uh and then right before the other coincidence about what happened is right before vitalik on his blog put out this post about legitimacy and talked about how like nfts and many other things receive a lot of value because humans deem them to be legitimate and when he explicitly said in this one paragraph about how the creator of an nft can help bless the value of an nft by perhaps donating some of the revenue generated to a charitable cause that humans agree has uh value and i don't think that i think by the time this blog piece had come out you had already committed to donating uh all of the revenue to charity uh and so the fact that you were doing that without like the input from vitalik which many people just take vitalik's input and run and runs with it i think you did it with by committing it before that was incredibly cool and that just really just ties a great bow on this story how do you how do you think about that that component of the story and how it kind of uh impacted the the story of this animation i actually yeah i didn't know about it until i saw it in your tweet initially um and it's it's pretty crazy to me i everything about this whole situation is just seems like a crazy blessed coincidence almost like you know including the dow forming was unexpected and then also i didn't um prior know about this um uh vitalik article and it's really just a very crazy coincidence and um i'm glad that he sort of shares that value you know i really think that there's so much money going around in in crypto that we definitely have more than enough to sort of distribute it and put it towards something that's like worthwhile actually i was really inspired by uh one of chao wang's um tweets a while back which i had retweeted um which he was talking about um sorry i don't remember the exact quote obviously but he was basically talking about how um nothing against trading but just oh the act of trading is not necessarily like beneficial to society um so you know instead of like flexing on you know material goods or something you should flex on how you've helped other people financially and um i'm actually not a trader myself because i don't have time to do those things but um but i i did feel very resonated with his tweet like his weight was so inspiring i was like oh yeah i think totally more people should be doing that in this space and um hats off to people who already are and i hope that you know i'm like i'm not wealthy myself so um i was like but i have this ability to sort of generate uh like you know using my skill set to generate something that does have value hopefully and which turns out it did um that and i had always thought about um wanting to do an nft drop that was um committed to charity but i just never found the right sort of opportunity to and to be quite honest i was also a little bit scared to take that leap of faith because doing an auction is scary right it's um not something like this auction thing is not something that i've ever done before but so i think you know with the sort of like support of unisop um i felt a little bit more confident being like okay i think you know there's gonna be at least i knew i had you know um like a great community that i had always supported and were fans of my work but i wasn't sure you know the valuation of that or anything at all and so yeah this is just crazy i'm super grateful and i hope that this will also inspire more apps like this in the future as well yeah yeah that last point inspiring more acts like this i think it's really important because there's a frequent line of conversation in the crypto space like oh cool we're playing with these new financial assets you know everyone's getting hilariously rich like yeah yeah yeah uh and then and then the question is like well what happens if we just create the same old institutions and same old structures that we came from except now like great now new people are rich and my answer to this is always like well if we if we do want to have like a revolution in how society operates it's not going to be just the technology but it's going to be what how what people and and how people leverage this technology and the the way that i see this truly being different is like there's a different cultural shared ethos of how we recirculate value and like like to what you said like trading one asset for another doesn't create value creating value creates value and if we can recirculate that value in ways that are better than on our previous system through means such as nfts then that is something that is meaningfully different and in my opinion a much better improvement upon the way we used to do things yeah i completely agree and you know vitalik's point about how not just the legitimacy but you know about how multiple people agreeing that something has value and then you know compounds its value essentially and i think yeah and then his point about how you know when you put this to a good cause it i think it will definitely amplify amplify that um value because you're not only just people agreeing that this has value now but that it's directly benefiting um people who are in need for example um and i think that in itself is just so priceless um so yeah there's he really hit the nail on the head with that article people pleaser you hit the nail on the head with your animation and so i could i think i speak from basically all of uh nft speculators and ethereum culturalists that we will watch your career with great interest uh you have made a in my opinion a landmark event in the world of defy and nfts and i hope this is the first of many oh thank you so much
