celsius is a centralized lending and borrowing platform and they announced this week in a shock to the market that they were pausing all withdrawals this is an indication of insolvency and this of course sent the crypto world in a tizzy one a tweet from bankless hq if they can freeze withdrawals it's a bank and so celsius looking a lot like a bank the thing of it is i'm not against centralized lending and borrowing companies i do think defy is better but if you are depositing into a bank into a celsius or anexa or anything else you have to be aware of the risks
