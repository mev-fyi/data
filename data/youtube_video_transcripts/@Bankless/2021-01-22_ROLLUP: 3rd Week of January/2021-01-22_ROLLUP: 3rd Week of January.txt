[Music] david happy third week of january what are we doing today we are rolling up the third week of january it is roll rollups time where we go through a whole entire week's worth of news in one single episode get that rolled up and injected right into your brain we go through the market we talk about what the market is doing then we go through releases what got released in the last week then we go through some news talk about what happened in this last week of news and then we get into some ecosystem takes and then we finally finish it off with what david and ryan are excited about ryan are you ready i'm ready i'm excited about a lot of things let's do this all right you want to start with markets david that's my favorite place to start anyway so we have to start with bitcoin price but you know i am i'm i'm really excited to talk about eath price but i'm going to hold my excitement for a minute let's talk bitcoin yeah uh coming off of a very volatile last week the second week of january where bitcoin went from like forty two thousand dollars down to thirty thousand dollars up to forty thousand dollars we're almost doing the same thing uh bitcoin is at 31 and a half thousand dollars after touching 40 000 last week uh so you know volatility is just keeping strong um and so people people are getting a little bit bummed about this drop in prices right especially right after we touched ether price this is just how it goes folks this is this is what the market does up and down a little bit of chop in the bull market nothing to worry about let's talk ether david it finally happened it finally broke its previous all-time high of 1420 topped out at 1440. which is awesome because we broke the all-time high but kind of lame because we only broke it by 20 dollars oh i don't even care i mean so like i was told so many times during 2018 2019 that this would never happen and it just happened last week i wish i could go back and like find all of the tweets that that you know that said this would never happen that ether was dead all of these things um pretty pretty satisfying i think that that ether went all the way back from a 95 drop came back hit its all-time high it's trading lower than that now i don't really care we hit the milestone man that's that's what i wanted to see and i think that's a great marker that this is the the bear market or the bull market is in full effect where do you think things go from here uh yeah other than up and to the right um i think that we are in for some short-term chop um but the ball the ball has been rolled down the hill and there's no stopping it right maybe maybe some short-term chop in the next week or or a couple weeks but like people's attention are on this industry now like there's no stopping stopping this from happening um anthony cesano is out of jail now this entire this entire bump was uh engineered by anthony is this possible just to get him out of jail well i did i bought some eth to it's explicitly try and help anthony get out of jail i know a few other people did anthony probably did too um we will see how engineered this was if it was engineered by anthony or not of course it wasn't really um but i think what this really tells us is i mean for me um this is the power of a high conviction bet uh ryan you and i totally believe that this day would come where eth would break his previous all-time high and i believe that even when ether was dollars i believe that at 80 ether we would once again see 1400 ether and then we did shout out to the holders uh you guys helped make this happen and um you reap the rewards when things like this do happen david let's talk d5 for a minute so where are we hanging with the d5 pulse index at the time of recording we are at 22.2 billion dollars locked in defy if we had recorded this a couple days ago or even yesterday even it would have been over 25 billion dollars i think it peaked out yeah at 25.2 billion dollars that is the highest number ever locked in defy and the deep dpi also similarly topped out at i think 225 dollars per dpi index token currently it's hovering around 205 dollars so defy tokens are coming along for this ride as well though eth kind of took the uh took the headlines earlier this week um you know we were talking about holders david and pantera put out this um this a follow-up report talking about the the upside to holding bitcoin as an asset and you know it's similar to ethan bitcoin has a longer history and here's the magic of it david in order to win at crypto as long as you're buying assets like bitcoin and ether all you have to do is hold like that's it so any time period if you held bitcoin for at least three and a half years you win like and you win by a lot that's all you have to do it sounds so simple why is it hard yeah this is what this report from pantera is saying is there are zero people who have held bitcoin for more than 3.5 years who are not in profit right and this is this actually kind of goes into how i think about some trades and some investments you know i'm not a trader i don't really pay attention to the charts when i buy some assets like defy tokens that i want and sometimes i buy at the wrong time because i bought into the hype and bought into the fomo and then it drops but like my my personal bias my personal um rule of thumb is i never buy a token that i'm not willing to become a bag holder of and the reason is because you can just hold your way out of the floor right you can just hold your way out of the bear so if you're if you have conviction about the asset and you're not a trader and you are an investor holding is the secret to success in this crypto market and what this report shows is that it's in no one zero people have been holders for more than three and a half years and are and are not in profit with bitcoin and that's the maximum that means is probably even less amount of time for people to just hold through dips before they're in the profit you know it's crazy too so this is a report that came out from vision hill what the vision hill does is they provide a composite index of a whole bunch of crypto funds so that the private crypto funds that you have to be an accredited investor to get in they basically track their performance you know what their performance was in in 2020 david i don't know but i'm going to go ahead and guess it's less than if they had just held it was less than if they just held exactly buy a lot buy a lot so you know you know it depends on the funds different funds have different strategies but uh the composite index so kind of the the index behind the other indexes if you put your funds in the average crypto hedge fund you would have done well last year 170 up right that's a great that's pretty good good number like be happy with that i guess but if you just held bitcoin and did nothing you would do 425 percent up um actually i think these numbers might be wrong i think uh bitcoin was 360 okay so the numbers we have on the screen are wrong but if you just held bitcoin you would have gotten 360 percent if you held eth all you did was hold eve you would have done 425 up so holding bitcoin holding eth in 2020 you would have outperformed all of the geniuses in their crypto hedge funds maybe not all of them but the average and you wouldn't have incurred any fees so these hedge funds charge a 20 20 to 30 annual performance fee on the profits plus two percent annualized no fees holding bitcoin holding ether you would have outperformed them like it's not only that you're going to be profitable on a holding strategy for any any time period greater than than three and a half years you're actually going to outperform most crypto hedge funds uh on that on that time horizon this is why on the bank list program we talk about the value of the crypto monies specifically ethan btc they are the the benchmarks for this whole entire industry and this also illustrates why it's so powerful to actually practice like crypto and defy and ethereum is a skill and self-custody is one of those first skills that you learn and if you gave up bothering to learn that self-custody skill and instead just went to the funds to and just exported your responsibility of researching and learning and getting your hands dirty if you just didn't bother to do that you lost all out on like two to three x more gains than you would have if you had learned to buy and hold the crypto monies the bitcoin and ether and do it yourself that's that's the cost of not actually teaching yourself the skills to be in crypto yeah absolutely and you know what holding is a skill too last thing i'll say in this i i had a friend who came to me in in 2018 and he said what you know gave me some advice which i buy i talked about bitcoin and ether he went out and bought e3 bought it at like 500 right um and 2019 and i and my my my advice was basically hey if you're doing this you gotta buy and hold for five to ten years right okay like that's it just don't touch it but buy and hold for five to ten years and he texted me in 2019 and he was like oh so this is going well so his 500 ether dropped to like you know the low hundreds uh and then it turns out he sold it you know like this is the thing it's it holding is also a skill that you need to develop as part of your crypto investment strategy and you have to you have to learn how to ignore the volatility and and look at the long look at the long term uh on this on this thing so um david fundamentals while we're talking about it let's talk about this this thread from spencer noon there's 11 signs he says that eath is going to blow past its all-time high this is a threat all about fundamentals which which fundamentals do you want to pick out of this threat david well of course we have to mention fees we really enjoy the fee metric on the bankless program because of how ungainable it is there's no better way to prove that there is demand for a blockchain by illust by showing how much money people are willing to pay to use it according to this uh screen screen cap that uh spencer took you know the last seven days of fees for ethereum was 7.2 million dollars seven day average bitcoin was a 4.3 million dollars and then even uniswap an application on ethereum collected two million dollars worth of fees these are big numbers yeah absolutely a few other things the number of eth transactions uh it this is it's he says is 7x smaller than its 2018 game uh all-time highs and so he says this is a sign that whales and institutions still haven't entered the game what's he saying here david yeah he's saying that it's still kind of retail that is playing in ethereum that you know there's a large amount of eth uh there aren't large amounts of eth moving on chain which means there aren't yet big buyers i guess you could actually interpret this bearishly that's probably if i was a bitcoin maxi i would say like haha like institutions aren't aren't buying eth uh and perhaps that's bearish or perhaps that's an opportunity yeah absolutely he goes through a few more hash rate um ethereum active addresses i i generally like ethereum active addresses these are east addresses ether dresses are almost like bank accounts and um right now that figure of ether active addresses has doubled year-to-date and is now its all-time high so the bank accounts on the ethereum network are using the network more than they ever have we hit all-time high on that fundamental metric too yeah yeah there's there's nothing more bullish to me than more and more people using ethereum as their banking layer yeah supposed to be for he goes through he goes through a number of defy users uh total locked value and defile of these things stable coins all of these metrics that we report out so lots of fundamental reasons to be bullish as well um i saw this report from funstrat too david so funstrat is um kind of a group that appears on msnbc quite a bit this is sort of a mainstream finance um group and they just put out a price prediction for eth of over 10k so it's starting to leak into mainstream finance circles too what do you think about this number yeah i like i want to know how some of these funds and entities come up with their price predictions they made a specific prediction of ten thousand five hundred dollars i wanna know where that five thousand came from or 500 came from yes um but you know the 10k meme is getting exported out of the inner circles of ethereum into the greater world of people that are interested in investing in crypto assets you know fair enough i haven't read the full report but this line stuck out at me so the person who wrote this report said um blockchain computing may be the future of the cloud the future of the cloud so like what are we talking about what that means oh man i would like to know what that individual meant so price predictions coming out at over 10k but it's not clear to me that that mainstream finance actually understands what ethereum is yet or what ether as an asset is they're just they're just bullish for some reason if they did understand it they'd probably be a higher evaluation yeah absolutely okay ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defy is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today that's market david let's get into your leases so do you want to start with this first one yeah mstable which is a uh literally called a meta stable coin where you know there's so many different stable coins on ethereum and sable is a project that kind of offers a new uh stable quantum theorem using a basket of other stable coins on ethereum uh hence the meta they are launching their musd save kind of like a vault feature it's like a high yield savings account um pretty cool for people who are trying to access yield in d5 while also controlling for their own risk more and more yield opportunities than d5 for sure and have you kept up with the second one saddle raised 4.3 million for a slippage free d5 trading that's that's sort of the headline but saddle is basically it's a fork of a stablecoin automated market maker an amm called curve that's really popular very well used the saddle forked some of their code apparently rewrote the code uh what is interesting about this story do you think david yeah i don't i actually don't know the competitive differentiator between saddle and curve i do know that there is plenty of room for more than just one version of a defy application i think that's what sushi swap uh proved out that you know not just uniswap is going to dominate the the amm market and i think this is the same thing with curve and saddle saddle's saying like you know curve is great but i think we can do something in here as well and there's plenty of space for more than just one protocol to offer the same same product they had a bit of a rocky start with some issues at launch but we will see how it plays out certainly more competition is better for defy users the one thing i'll say on this to you david is it does seem like there's this dichotomy for for many protocols where you have sort of a vc backed version and a more crypto community led version right and yeah and so for almost every protocol you have both of those strategies being deployed um so we'll see how that turns out with saddle loop ring has been on a tear lately this is one of the the shippiest teams in in crypto right now there's constantly shipping shipping i've never heard that adjective before i love it oh never you've never heard that adjective i use your body all the time i have never heard shippiest all right what are they shipping yeah so loopering an l2 uh scaling mechanism for ethereum with amms on it so exchange functionality um and and uh order based dex as well uh has put their product to their app into the google play store um you know not actually not not the most revolutionary thing you know we're not we're not trying to infiltrate google play store that's not really at the goal of ethereum but we do need people to download applications like loopering like metamask like argent on put onto people's phones the difference with this loopering app is it is a direct integration into a smart contract wallet on loop rings l2 so people people who download the loop ring app are having their first interaction with ethereum on an l2 right and so to make an argent wallet uh it costs like 40 dollars worth of gas that actually argent pays because if the user just downloads argent they don't have any ether so the argent team pays for that gas to deploy their smart contract wallet onto the l1 and then also transactions on ethereum using argent are actually more gas intensive because it's a smart contract wallet we actually just recorded a podcast with vitalik talking about um social recovery and l2 and we go into details about this that podcast is coming out in a few weeks um but what vitalik is bullish on is smart contract wallets on the l2 and that's what loopering has rolled out here today this is great news because it means arjun's gonna go there next and so are the other smart contract wallets i'm really excited about this uh speaking being excited eth2 has been going pretty darn well like i i don't want to use the word flawlessly but there hasn't been a hiccup since network launch what did we launch back in december right so we're we're we're closing in on two months uh of like it just working well danny ryan no news is good news yeah yeah i've like almost forgotten that it's up there right um things um well it's continuing to accrue new eth i don't know it's 2.6 billion something like that total eat steak so it's just humming right along and danny ryan put together a fantastic report that uh we'll we'll add to the notes that you can go take a look at and uh and and see what's what's new there david let's talk about this one we're speaking about roll-ups in layer two optimism has just launched on mainnet with synthetics what's going on here yeah the long-awaited optimistic flavor of roll-ups the one of two flavors of roll-ups that this whole entire ethereum ecosystem is bullish on gets their soft launch on to the ethereum l1 synthetics is the team pioneering the usage of this new optimism l1 and so you know ethereum is just scaling in all directions look at this graphic looks like crypto utopia right there it's just on the horizon it's what the optimism team says we'll see um coinbase is doing some much needed infrastructure work what is this story about yeah coinbase is famous for going down all the time especially last full cycle during 2016 and 2017 coinbase will crash all the time i kind of would figured that they would have fixed this by now but turns out like coinbase is continuing to crash all the time they had three three plus years to figure this out turns out they didn't um but now they just released a statement saying that they are going to quote unquote figure this out by kind of compartmentalizing some of their back end infrastructure uh probably should have done this a few years ago coinbase like what what were you doing during the bear market well maybe they are just like uh surprised by all of the demand you know in this bull market so i guess that's good it's always a good sign when coinbase is crashing during the bull market i guess for price i guess question mark um what's going on with urine here too i was told that urine had a 30k cap that they weren't going to issue any more tokens but it turns out they're issuing tokens why are they doing this what are they doing this is just a proposal so this is not finalized however there is been a growing conversation about how to fund uh wirns developers right and one of the ways that we could do this is by just minting the protocol token many other d5 protocols like ave have done this uniswap has like a 500 million dollar treasury of uni tokens that they can use for development iron doesn't have that because it committed to that 30 million uh 30 000 yfi token cap which it's now trying to perhaps walk back on maybe that 30 000 or 30 000 unit meme is actually not the best thing for the protocol and especially there is some some some incentive alignment uh friction between the developers and the token holders that they are hoping this mint can help solve um and so they are they are just looking to to fund development and personally i think it's i think we should absolutely make sure that all wire developers are correctly incentivized to build for wire just i i think the my personal opinion is that uh keeping ourselves locked into that thirty thousand 000 hard cap just for the meme is a disservice to the people that are actually adding value to wire so you're not mad about this i'm not mad about this you know what's funny is uh fair launches are easy but like governance post fair launch is hard you know it's i think what the community is finding out um it's easy to issue a token it's hard to build a product right if if wiring if wi-fi was trying to be a money like a bitcoin or an ether this would be an absolute no right but this is more of a capital asset and the the truth of the matter is they didn't have a way to fund their protocol development reminds me kind of of the uh the synthetics pivot remember we talked it with with with kane and originally uh they were planning to issue synthetics according to the the bitcoin uh schedule happening every four years happening every four years just because why just because that was because that was popular you thought you had to do that and then when they finally started thinking about it scratching their heads are like no we should be issuing a coin to reward the activity we want in our protocol which is liquidity so let's go do that and it turned out very well for them so as long as you're not competing as a money this sort of thing is not necessarily bad but it is interesting how these communities are governing themselves david last thing we had lynn alden on the podcast post our podcast maybe partially in response to some of the questions she raised she put out a phenomenal piece i thought it was good anyway um about ether as an asset and it's um not necessarily that she was bearish but she felt generally that ether and ethereum were not ready for prime time investment yet would be maybe my take on it uh we have a related response can you tell us about this yeah when lynn alden writes a piece and she put time and energy into that that piece the economic analysis of ethereum uh and when i and i do not believe that lynn alden was just like contributing to the btc maxi dog pile on ethereum i think that was a an open invitation for her to gain more insight and understanding for her own benefit you know she put her rationale down onto paper as an invitation for the ethereum community to respond and you know she i think she wants to be convinced she just needs to be convinced uh and so i took the time as well as lucas and and we also made this open to just the general bankless nation community to help contribute and so we've gone through some of lynn alden's arguments and and formulated our own responses to them and i don't think lynn alden is anti-eth or anti-ethereum she is just a macro investor and let's let's be real here the market cap of ether is 160 billion dollars that doesn't show up on macro radar like that's that's small that's time yeah it's just starting to show up absolutely so where can people find this response david at the time that were publishing this yeah that this this we are recording this on thursday that article this response is also going out on thursday that's today so for listeners it was yesterday you'll be able to find that at newsletter.banklisthq.com all right man that's that's exciting i'm glad for that to go out good just continue the dialogue with lynn right um all right news goldman sachs i've heard of these guys they're bankers somewhere right um they're entering the crypto market quote soon with a custody play i feel like i've heard this from goldman sachs before and probably the last time was the the last bull run there were murmurs of goldman like opening trading deaths and getting into custody maybe it's for real this time it's funny to see banks flooding back into this space yeah custody is the low hanging fruit first stop shop for somebody like goldman sachs to get exposure into this world just learning how to hold it for their customers is kind of how they get their foot in the door um i i believe it the the difference between 2017 and 2020 custody plays is there's actually a lot more opportunity for custody plays we saw um paypal purchased bitgo a while ago uh as a custody uh play um and and then all the other like custody plays all the other uh protocols and or not protocols teams and companies and startups that were custody based got really excited because like oh you know paypal just bought bitgo who else is coming to buy you know my company my custody play and and i think that's kind of what we are seeing play out there's a lot more options for companies like goldman sachs to just buy a custody play i think uh what may have happened with bitco is if i recall that deal may have fallen through i'm not actually sure but certainly yeah certainly paypal was in talks about buying bitco and then something broke down last minute if i'm recalling correctly but yeah i i totally agree custis makes sense to start from a banking perspective i have a bit more respect for for banks like uh fidelity that were also here during the bear market goldman to me feels a little bit like a like a fair market entrant well things are good we're going to go enter of course whereas fidelity's been building this stuff since 2014. good to see some more competition in that area speaking of that the world's largest asset manager is a firm called blackrock they have billions in assets under management like excuse me i said billions but what i meant was trillions with a t trillions of eggs that's crazy um they just produced some filing some sec filings that suggest that they are looking to buy possibly buy big into crypto specifically into bitcoin is this a big deal yeah i'm not sure how much speculation this is or just like reporters or investigators connecting the dots behind blackrock filings but what's going on here is apparently blackrock is doing all the filings that it needs to do in order to compliantly put bitcoin on the balance sheet um and so i mean the timing is fitting like there's plenty of mania and excitement about this space so that would make sense uh if black blackrock is putting bitcoin on the balance sheet like there's no better signal like you know druckenmiller that's great like you know uh raul paul that's great like you know ray dalio talking about bitcoin that's great this is blackrock there's no more like bigger of an institution after this like this is the top this is the biggest institution uh if they're putting bitcoin on the balance sheet like everyone should be paying attention to that yup they do not make them any bigger david let's switch this so this is uh biden administration stuff it looks like janet yellen is going to become treasury secretary so replacing steve mnuchin and she's given some some remarks lately uh that might get into the agenda here but let's talk about the first the first thing is she said that the us must act big on the next corona virus relief package what does acting big mean money printer go burr i'm pretty sure that's what that means um this is okay pretty expected out of what we we expected out of the biden administration we always knew that biden was going to be very um favorable towards reliefs of relief packages right they they want to put money into the hands of the people um that's kind of in my opinion the the value prop behind the the democratic party was that they are pro relief and they want to get cash into the economy more than the republicans did and so this is them fulfilling those promises all right and that's janet yellen backing it up and at the same time she was calling for more money printing if you will she was also saying that cryptocurrencies are a concern what are they concerned for terrorist financing classic boomer statement out of janet yellen here saying let's let's turn on the money printer and get relief into the hands of the people at the same time uh let's also like restrict or stop as much of that money going into bitcoin like that's kind of the what i'm getting at is is they are the the federal reserve the federal chair the us dollar is trying to get printed so it can put itself into the hands of the people yet at the same time if people just take those dollars and buy bitcoin with it it's that's bad and so i feel like this is what this is what janet yellen is trying to get in front of yeah it's very difficult to know whether this is coming from like sort of the the state uh we you know we want to surveil all transactions kind of prong of things or whether this is just a fear that something like the us could lose its reserve currency status maybe maybe both of those things simultaneously i thought mike dudas had a great response to this on twitter because it's such a fallacy this i thought this mostly died in 20 2015 and 2016 quite honestly david the narrative that like krypto and bitcoin were only for terrorist activities and money laundering like that died way back then because since that time we produced a ton of data this is a chain analysis they actually produce data for big government agencies and less than a percent 0.34 percent of cryptocurrency activity in 2020 was criminal in nature according to their report that's a whole lot less than cash money in briefcases like the us dollar as cash is a far better tool for terrorists and money launderers than cryptocurrency is yeah and and this kind of just goes to show that anyone that says like that cryptos used for terrorist financing or just illicit activities has some sort of bias or ulterior motive either janet yellen is naive and she is just touting off the first statement about bitcoin that comes to her mind or she has ulterior motives which is protecting the brand and the value of the us dollar my opinion is it's the second we always seem to see david these same like headwinds and tailwinds coming out of the government like some things that are bullish for crypto and some things that are bearish simultaneously it's interesting to see how that will evolve with this new administration um coinbase is making moves as well we're talking about coinbase earlier they just purchased bison trails what's bison trails bison trails is a node operation service kind of a they're also probably going to be massive players in the staking as a service industry which i guess coinbase is now gaining exposure to that as well um buy some trails if you want to stake your ether using bison trails you can stake your 32 ether with them in a non-custodial fashion i used to be privy to the details is how that works i i can't uh can't do i can no longer do that um but if you want to stake your ether and also retain custody but not run your own node bison trails would be for you they also do nodes and and node services for basically all other meaningful blockchains and now they are owned by coinbase guys this is a signal the crypto banks are definitely going to get into staking in a big way david let's breeze through these last ones uh soldier boy is tweeting about nft how exciting is that wow um maybe we get soldier boy on bankless at some point would we take that interview sir i think we would i think we would yeah i mean i was a big fan of soldier boy in middle school so i'm not going to pass that that opportunity up all right i think this just shows the resonance between creators and nfts i think the value proposition of nfts is extremely obvious for creators like soldier boy i think that's the hell yeah what's what's so funny is so this this tweet originated from um he asked like should i release my own crypto or something like that and people like no don't do that you'll get in trouble remember 2017 when paris hilton blah blah blah all these celebrities tried to release tokens he's like oh okay and somebody was like yeah but you should check out nfts and he was like okay obvious answer i'm releasing an nfc what's gonna happen this market is like you know we talk so much about fractal patterns and how history rhymes what doesn't repeat right so like 2017 all the celebs wanted to to release a crypto token right 2021 this bull market is gonna be all nfts my friend i think that's how it's going to work much stronger product market fit the it just makes so much more sense we don't need a currency per celebrity however celebrities are fine to make art because that's kind of what they do in already yeah perfectly legal um all right pax gold so this is a token on ethereum they really they reach over 100 million in market cap super bullish on tokenization of all the things including gold and also this last headline pornhub just added a whole bunch of other cryptocurrency to their payment options i guess that's a good thing i don't know the it's the tokens that they added which is what's interesting to me they added xrp ripple uh binance coin bnb coin and doge and also usdc um i think it's going to be the usdc coin that gets used the most uh but you know it's who knows like in that order who knows who knows indeed people just want to get rid of some of their other coins i guess this is a way to do that david i'll trade some some xrp for some poorness probably you have xrp that's the bigger headline oh my god no if i did it would be a good trade to trade it for porn well okay gemini is the

the first one this is one from a guy named david hoffman on twitter you should follow that guy smart guy he says that ethereum is a bet that the future is going to be different what do you think he means yeah what does he mean i don't know i think my interpretation of this tweet is that you know ethereum is a revolutionary piece of technology and it's doing a little it's offering an alternative mechanism or vehicle to do almost every single in the previous industry differently either a little bit differently or a lot differently and then it also offers totally brand new things to the table uh i think we are it's obvious to that to people and to listeners that the world is changing the world is changing really really rapidly and i think in a world that is changing rapidly ethereum offers you know ways to capture that change you know ethereum is a bet that the world is going to be different yeah definitely it's probably a good bet one one thing i'd also say here is like some people think bitcoin is a bet that the world's gonna be bad in the future like the world's gonna fall apart in the future right the whole bitcoin citadel idea ethereum is not necessarily a bet that the world's gonna fall apart i mean i think it can thrive and do well if the world far falls apart but it can also do well if we have a roaring 20s era right like so it's not necessarily a doomsday asset in the way that some paint bitcoin has which i think is interesting on that tweet as well that reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from amin solomoni uh bitcoin in times of war ethereum in times of peace interesting uh there you go speaking of pornhub i mean oh man breaking global hackers are now called money mechanics what what what's a money mechanic this is an outgrowth of brian brooks uh self-driving banks meme which is again the most boomer meme for understanding defy i've ever heard of yet i think it's going to go miles with trying to get people's heads wrapped around what the hell this thing going on in defy is and so if we are going to adopt the term of defy is self-driving banks that makes all d5 money lego builders people building on ethereum money mechanics i like it wow going miles i like what you did there david hoffman nice nice nice pun job all right this is from spencer noon this is a another take that we thought was interesting he says he has no idea on how to value eth uh why is that a good thing david yeah yeah so i think this is an extension of the triple point asset thesis right where the triple point asset thesis believes that and if anyone can find an asset that fits into all three asset superclasses earlier than eighth that would be news to me uh the triple point asset thesis is that there are three asset super classes store value capital assets and consumable assets and ether is the only asset that fits into all three categories we've never seen this before and i think what spencer noon here is saying like he has no idea how to value eth because it just breaks all previous paradigms it breaks all previous models uh and i think i i recorded this uh this tweet and said you know valuing eth breaks the calculator i think it's bullish that we don't know how to value eth that's that to me that just means that the sky's the limit yeah other people have put it this way like assets like bitcoin and ether they can be priced but not valued so ultimately it is this pricing supply and demand uh mechanic and what is the uh the top on these assets it's a big question mark we can only guess no top all right um david this was a really good take this is kind of a tweet and also an article from josh stark and evan van ness so every year they do this what do they do every year they give us a recap of ethereum in that year it's one of the most valuable pieces of just just articles that comes out every single year if you want to get reminded what's happened in ethereum in this last year which i mean there's a ton uh josh and evan they always produce this article it's always a nice recap of the year in ethereum yeah here's my takeaway this was their first point they had four points but the the first point was interesting is bigger than bitcoin so they made the statement that ether ethereum specifically eclipsed bitcoin the network as the blockchain with the most valuable block space and they brought the data to prove that total transaction volume on ethereum for the first time in 2020 exceeded that of bitcoin so that means uh transaction settlements as denominated in u.s dollars so settlements of ether certainly helped that all of the d5 assets also stable coins were a big part of that story so more value is getting settled on ethereum than versus bitcoin now for the first time and that uh that line between them kind of that gap between them continues to increase in an accelerated way um also daily transaction volume so this is revenue essentially so this is how much are people willing to pay for block space essentially bitcoin has always been higher than ethereum like always people were more willing to pay for bitcoin blocks versus um ethereum blocks and now that's changed in 2020 so for the first time people are there there's greater demand greater value and fees being generated from ethereum versus bitcoin it's funny that that was uh that that's been a metric that bitcoin maximus specifically um had talked about like forever fee generation that proves that your block space is valuable yeah how much fees are you generating xrp or like you know bitcoin cash or what whatever blockchain well now ethereum is generating more fees there's a false pretty decent argument that could be made that the amount of fees that your blockchain pulls in relative to its block space is perhaps the number one metric that indicates the hardness or the soundness of the money on top of it yeah absolutely and of course this is an important metric for bitcoin in the future because its security will ultimately depend on the fees it generates from its block space um so a flipping i i suppose from a network perspective from a block space perspective this year but we have not seen a flipping in asset value in market cap of bitcoin versus ether and uh we'll see if that plays out in the future some people believe it could play out this cycle i'm not sure what do you think david this cycle would be tough i would be surprised um however i would be pleasantly surprised [Laughter] all right this is from hayden adams uniswap is doing two percent of the new york stock exchange that seems to be the new two percent of the volume specifically the volume specifically and he asked the question i love this i love this energy from hayden come on the podcast hayden if you ask the question when a hundred percent right so like match the new york stock stock exchange in volume dude to me it's only a matter of time it's only my time that's not that far may not be the category winner here like that also remains to be seen but if it's not uniswamp then it's going to be some defy d5 protocol that does it's it's it's it's coming this decade in this cycle maybe uniswap doesn't match uh the new york stocking stock exchange in volume but i bet you i with much more certainty that all exchanges on ethereum do totally like if you include curve and sushi swap and all the other amms uh i bet you that definitely breaches 100 of the volume on the new york stock exchange there you go prediction was that included in your predictions david for 2020 it is now 21. all right there you go you heard it here uh the last question we'll we'll end on this with takes and then we'll get to what we're both individually excited about the question of have we earned this all-time high with ethereum right now have we earned the all-time high with with uh bitcoin this this comes from a you know quote that vitalik made near the the apex of the bull market in 2017 yeah december 12 2017 yeah right before all-time highs yeah he said uh market cap just hit half a trillion dollars today but have we earned it and his implication was no we haven't earned it there's a lot of vapor here the question on everyone's mind i think is this time as we're seeing uh the market cap exceed this has crypto earned it what's your answer to that yeah i mean if something has earned something is always a subjective uh question or so yeah and we will obviously take a subjective answer uh one thing is is worthy of noting is that when vital tweeted that in december of 2017 there was nothing uh that we do on a daily basis today back then right there wasn't even make or doubt maker dow wasn't even launched at that time there was no defy there was cryptokitties and then there were icos so it was obvious that we did not earn it back then um i think it's totally justifiable to say that we have earned it we're actually uh the crypto market cap is actually 2x higher than what vitalik said if vitalik said half a trillion we're all we're above a trillion dollars right now um but absolutely we've earned it yeah totally like defy is a real product it's a got product market fit in bitcoin we don't even need to talk about bitcoin like money printer gold bur means that bitcoin is justified there's no dentacoin this time around there's no bitconnect this time around it feels much more healthy but i gotta say david i'm gonna be looking for that tweet from vitalik this cycle too because he basically called the top last cycle in december because by january everything was on kind of the the decline january february that's exactly right yeah all right david let's get to this what are you excited about my friend this week so one of my favorite podcasts that actually has taught me a ton about just finance and economics before i got into the realm of crypto was the planet money podcast and they just released a podcast that was a rerun of a podcast that they'd done before but the reason why they re-released this podcast was because the biden administration just got elected and people wanted to ask the question or get the answer to the question how are they funding all of their coveted relief uh mechanisms right there by the administration has a ton of relief mechanisms a ton of money going out and so planet money put out this rerun of this what the hell is mmt podcast that they produce i think in 2017 2018 and so like this is just an example kind of in the same way that we look out for examples of crypto breaking into the mainstream mmt modern monetary theory the theory that the central bank or the currency issuer which is the united states can't be insolvent because they can print new money that mmt is making is breaking its way into the mainstream i'm excited to see how that lands with people like how are people going to integrate mmt into their brains now that the biden administration is just like you know making it rain covered relief all over the united states yeah any time people start thinking about money i think is definitely bullish for bitcoin and ethereum and for crypto in general and nothing like receiving a you know two thousand dollar check to to start thinking about where the source of this comes from and then like what actually is money the nature of money so i definitely agree that that that's cool what else are you excited about yeah the other thing i'm excited about is this last week we saw optimism roll out on main net ethereum we were seeing loopering roll out their smart contract wallet on their l2 obviously there are over 2 million eth in the deposit contract over 2 billion dollars committed to the future of youth too um and that's that's all part of proof of stake so many ethereum anti-aetherium narratives are just getting the the last nails and just pounded into the coffin like ethereum two is shipping ethereum is scaling uh proof of stake is here uh that's only going to continue and especially as so much new attention comes into this space like they aren't they aren't going to be thinking like what is the execution risk of ethereum 2.0 because it's so close right it's the and all the other commitments that ethereum as an ecosystem and as a technology has committed to are being fulfilled and so these new people who are trying to get a grasp for what the hell is going on in the space aren't ever going to go through that will ethereum actually work face they're they're going to see it working and and delivering as promised and that's got me really excited yeah absolutely a lot has been delivered during this bear market on ethereum that like the previous bull market previous cycle uh we didn't know for sure whether whether this stuff was going to come through or not so well positioned for sure ryan what are you excited about i'm excited about a new meme or a new narrative so you know you were talking about ryan's cooking up a meme boys cooking up a meme get ready um you were talking about like a lot of the fud there's one last sort of fear hang on ryan sorry sorry let's start you over because my internet was it was um unstable you were just super robotic you were saying uh you were talking about and then i lost you okay um do you want to just ask me the question again or sure okay ryan what are you excited about i'm excited about a new meme my friend i'm cooking up a new meme ryan's got a meme coming up memes in the oven we'll see if it takes or not you know who knows but um you were talking about the the fear uncertainty and doubt with with ethereum and how a lot of that's dissipated there's one flood point remaining and that is around ether the assets so people still like to say uh yeah ethereum's great but um ether the asset won't accrue any of the value of ethereum right um so i think that narrative is going to shift i was reading danny ryan's point that which we post uh about the road map for eth2 that we mentioned earlier and made me think of of the positioning for the road map for ether the asset right so we talked so often that there's a road map for ethereum the network but there's also a road map for ether the asset and here's how you can understand it three words bond burn bend we get our three b's all right three b's um tell us about them b's this is okay 2020 was bond this is the release of staking this is ether as an internet bond this turns ether into a productive yield bearing instrument 2020 bond okay 2021 burn we are going to be releasing eip 1559 very likely in 2020 that is ethereum's scarcity engine that means all of this block space that's so highly valued and generating fees a portion of that gets burnt every single transaction a portion of eath gets burnt gets taken out out of circulation like gone from existence doesn't so what we're actually going to see is some disinflationary pressure on ether as an acid it literally becomes more scarce every time ethereum is used 2021 burn so the last is bend and bend comes in 2022 so that is where ethereum reduces its issuance from about four and a half percent to one percent and that could even go disinflationary if we're able to burn more eath every year so that happens when the proof of work system merges with the proof of stake system eth1 merges with eth2 and then all of the issuance in order to power the economic security of proof of work gets cut off is no longer needed and the more efficient economic security of proof of stake kicks in fully and you get something close to one percent issuance so those three things 2020 we saw the bond 2021 we're going to see the burn and in 2020 two we're going to see the bend of ethereum issuance i think that is a narrative that maybe has legs the three b's but it's certainly helpful to understand the asset road map for ether moving forward guys this has been a fun roll up to do with you of course risks and disclaimers none of this was financial advice crypto is risky is risky so is def
