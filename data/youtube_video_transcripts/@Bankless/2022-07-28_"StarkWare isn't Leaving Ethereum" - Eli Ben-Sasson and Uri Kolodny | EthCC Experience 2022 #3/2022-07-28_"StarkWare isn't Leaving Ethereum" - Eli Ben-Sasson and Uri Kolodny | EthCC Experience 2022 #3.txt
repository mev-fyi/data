welcome back nation back to this third episode of the eath cc experience in this episode we're talking with uri and ellie of the starkware team and this is coming off of their starknet token announcement which is of course the subject matter of this particular episode but not the only subject matter of course there are many different things to talk about i get their perspective on the zk evms that were released not from the starkware team but from three other competitors all having to get their zk evm released in the same week scroll polygon and zk sync but since you know starquery is peripheral to this they are a zk roll up i get their perspectives on this whole role and where they fit into this conversation of course like i said ask about the square token and then just really clear the air as to where will starkwear be in the future are they ever going to make their own layer one are they ever going to use an alternative layer one other than ethereum and i'm too good at producing content to tell you that answer here in the intro so i'm going to wait for you to find that one out in the actual show but first we're going to speed run the sponsors all here right now so we don't have to interrupt the conversation later on and we're going to start with rocket pool rocket pool is ethereum's decentralized validator network where you deposit eth and you get r-eth in return and you can take that re into it defy and if you run a node you let other people deposit their eth into your node and you get to charge them 15 for staking rewards as payment for your node operating services and then you can take that r eth and use the across bridge to join over 2.3 billion dollars in the arbitration ecosystem across of course is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge and one of the safest ways to bridge your hard-earned assets in the world of crypto and of course arbitrom is where you want to be with over 35 000 contracts and 1 million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of roll-ups you know how i know these numbers because i watched the arbitrage talk at ecc which you should also go watch but not before you're done watching this but when you do watch that video make sure it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web3 wallet and it puts the user first the web3 way you know what else puts the user first ledger hardware wallets and the ledger live ecosystem i know ledger is a great product because i have literally nine of them and i have 99 of my crypto assets on my ledger wallets and the ledger live ecosystem is all you really need when it comes to living a bankless life such as buying with fiat swapping and staking but for the rest of you that are sitting on stable coins because the market is scary right now make sure you're using a decentralized bankless stablecoin may i suggest die from maker down the most tried and tested stablecoin in existence but with maker you don't have to hide your stables on the ethereum layer 1 maker is building die portals so you can mint die natively across all the layer 2's so you can make sure that your assets don't go down another 90 but you still get to go do all the d5 things across the l2 verse and i hope you use all of these sponsors on your quest for going bank list and now i bring you my in-person conversation with uri and ellie of the starkware team elenarius darkware what's up guys how's it going hi hi hi pretty good yeah exciting is this your guys not your first htc certainly uh actually it is mine but it's been here a few times yeah yeah at least three yeah how do you how do you like the city how do you like paris amazing what's not to live i i hear they have good food the the current state of the crypto world we're in this like bear market whether where whether or not you think ether at 1500 or bitcoin at 22 000 wherever it is is a bear market is up to to be decided um but the current like meta that we're going into is that we need to build our way out of the bear market we're not going to just like magically come out of it we have to actually do something to get out of it uh and starkware has certainly been heads down guys of course started with starkx the the proprietary app specific change we would call them uh but we are now going into the more generalizable zk roll ups uh which is what we're doing with uh stark net uh so let's talk about stock net first because that's the thing that's getting everyone super excited uh what where would you say in the grand road map of starknet where are we and where are we about to be soon we think about this in terms of of three phases overlapping phases the first phase is the feature completeness or the feature phase uh we're pretty far down the road there people have been able for a good number of months now to build whatever they want um on starknet the second phase is uh what we refer to as the scalability phase and there the intent is by the end of the year to reach 10 times ethereum's throughput at 100th of the transaction cost and the third phase which started a long time ago the decentralization effort and this is a gradual phase and we're making sort of incremental progress there day in day out uh this will culminate in the ability of anyone uh anywhere being able to run approver or a sequencer on startnet there's a there's a recent tweet uh from john adler which was pretty funny because polygon just announced their zk evm and then scroll announced their test net and then zk sync is like no we were first uh so there's like a lot of hype around a zk evm i'm wondering where does where does stocknet fit into this whole story um we we okay we're proud of the actual in production achievements that we made i actually do not want to go into this fight of who did something first we have been operating in production for now more than two years using what some people call zk technology we prefer to use the validity technology because it actually is not zk so you know our numbers and performance speak for themselves so we prefer not to enter this fight but or pick who is the real first we've been at it for a pretty long time and i think the world especially developers knows this so i i do want to add that on the on the zk evm front i think that the excitement is terrific i think we're all sort of waiting for the real production systems to be out there with proofs turned on etc we have yet uh to see that and that's a big achievement we're looking forward to i would add that in the context of stark net uh one of the things that a bunch of people have expressed interest in and i think we're likely to see is people deploying an emulation of the evm as a layer three settling on stark net which would be sort of uh escherresk in nature right stark net settling over ethereum with its evm and then the evm being simulated as verifiable computation layer three on to uh starknet to what extent will that draw the attention and excitement of developers is a very interesting open question in my mind okay so is is that part where you can do that is that where we get the evm uh expressivity built on stark net is like would it would be a layer three not another layer two yes okay okay so the the uh the technical details are is something that um challenges me and my my understanding so stark net not a zk evm but you could do a zkv evm as a layer 3 on starknight is that correct i want to clarify something that that getting uh emulating the ethereum virtual machine which is what is often referred to as zk evm is not stark nets end goal right our end goal is to provide the best scaling solution for ethereum and we strongly believe based on our deep understanding of both evm and how to build stark systems that you are far better off in terms of scaling if you use a different uh virtual machine and ours is cairo so i think what's going to happen is that even though you can emulate evm inside cairo and this will happen the real scale will be derived from native stark net cairo written uh smart contracts okay so this i sorry i started to understand this a little bit uh a lot of developers talk uh with very frustrated tones about the evm uh it limits them there there's it doesn't uh it's not parallel i know some of these words i just generally know that developers are feel very limited by the capacity of the evm so if i'm tracking correctly cairo is something far more optimal and also more expressive and allows something like like the evm which people are already familiar with but also much more than the evm to also achieve scalability while also having the ethereum security i i i actually beg to differ in the following sense first of all i think evm ethereum and solidity are amazing they are what delivered the gold standard for a general computation blockchain and solidity was and the evm were built under this set of constraints that says we need a turing complete programming language that will be best fit for blockchains and it's an amazing achievement of vitalik and you know anyone who worked on it in the early days and advanced it since then gavin wood and others anyone who was involved in this this is amazing now for better or worse when you build scalability through validity roll-ups and in particular starks you just have a very different set of constraints and you need for scaling you need a different virtual machine model so cairo and starknet they are not better than ethereum they are built to address a different set of constraints to allow ethereum to scale i i want to add to that that the question of say assuming the existence of highly performant ck evms okay say five years out the question of whether at that point in time if you're a new developer building some massive hit whether specifying you know coding that for the zke vm makes sense or not is an interesting question meaning that code as such almost by definition will not run on a layer one it will be too computationally intense for a layer one and so at that point will that be the optimal tool chain for whatever scaling solution you know is is uh is developers first choice i don't know that's an open question and certainly uh stark starkx the first implementation of starkware has generated some absolute hits immutable has has uh blossomed into an into an ecosystem and just seems like ready to roll into like the world of traditional gamers with traditional gaming companies and so their their bd skills are absolutely insane uh we had um idx uh one of the biggest volume exchanges in in all of crypto that's also decentralized because of because of stark x um i'd like to take a peek into the world of of bd for starkwear like how do you guys get this done and why do you guys have so many killer hits well um we actually don't think of ourselves in those terms meaning we we would really like to be uh the technology developers that we are by nature and so focus on the research and then the engineering effort and the product effort uh but at the end of the day uh hopefully leave it to the people building on top of us to blossom and profit and and you know sort of build all sorts of innovative stuff on and bring it out there and and as as you mentioned immutable is is a wonderful example dydx is of course uh they you know they've really built a powerhouse uh with the help of of of starcx and sorer is a very interesting uh uh sort of uh real-world application uh that many people have told us feels like web 2. i i i know of no bigger compliment than someone saying to us that felt like web 2. certainly i want to add that even though i i mean i thank you for the compliment of like doing amazing on bd and having so many successful uh um companies deploying on it and of course we're very proud of that um our feeling is that um even just the star kick systems have so much untapped uh capacity um that we would love we would love uh far more uh you know many more companies and entities to deploy on them and uh i don't know if you're out there and you need scale and you like what dydx or serrero immutable have been doing then definitely talk to us there's a lot more room on stuff i mean i think star kicks is wonderfully useful for the you know the use cases that we've envisioned you know for example minting and training of nfts and so on uh the mind-blowing stuff uh is uh once again we see that day in day out is the stuff that we never thought of and no one else thought possible that developers are building on stark net and certainly stark net and that generalizability and composability is where that serendipity happens between d5 apps right we all love the word composability in this industry yeah um but i'm getting a hint that you guys think that the the stark x side of things the more like app specific chains that are built for one company each one at one time also still have a lot of potential left in them that is there's no left can you can you talk about that a little bit what's left well i i can't i can't announce we won't go into the announcement of an announcement of an announcement game but uh there are a whole bunch of things in the pipeline on the starcraft front that's going to come online in the coming period which is very very interesting once again limited to the use cases supported by starkex let's say a bit about l3 so you know stark x is going to move up to layer three so so what is layer three ah right which is another star core innovation which is which yes it is another star core innovation uh recursive starks are coming to uh mainnet to support our production systems in a short number of days um but uh so what is layer three so instead of having the starcx systems that today are proven off chain and then verified by a smart contract on ethereum instead of having that verification done on ethereum it could be done on the public stark net and by merit of doing it on the public start net you could sort of conceive of these applications as having moved one layer up and that's why we refer to this as layer 3. so i think the first things we're going to see at layer 3 are the stark x instances and for those applications the benefit is trivial for one it's just lower gas spending so better economics for them and their users i think we're going to see a lot of excitement on layer 3 with custom stark nets and i think that's where a lot of sort of the app specific action is going to take place i think it's going to strike a very interesting balance between offering sort of uh sort of the best of both worlds meaning the best of decentralization and and censorship resistance and general computation and composability yet at the same time offering those applications the certain degrees of control that they deeply care for which are essentially taken away from them on a public chain it doesn't matter whether that public chain is ethereum or the public stark net right uh there's been growing interest in the cosmos ecosystem lately for sure and this starts to look a little bit like like for sure right for sure this was yes yes this is a vision that zaki uh described to us by that three years ago and so the the strategy is you have the generalized settlement layer which most people assume i'm talking about ethereum but you guys are actually talking about about stark net the generalized uh the dk roll up that that is the foundation for the layer threes the more proprietary stark x's right well it's a two layer sort of foundation right there is ethereum providing its security uh and support at the bottom that's the the massive those are the the shoulders of of uh the giants we're standing on and on top of that we have the public stark nets on top of which the layer threes are going to be instantiated and uh there's uh a growing uh conversation in the ethereum community is like okay well all these stark x or like general layer three settling on the the stark net layer two makes uh stark net uh its own ecosystem its own vibrant fiber ecosystem uh and also you guys really uh released the token details which we'll talk about in a second um but the the token had native fees uh payment in its own token as opposed to something like arbitrary optimism which take fees in the in ether and so there's a growing conversation in the ethereum space about is is the stark net layer two interested in actually becoming its own kind of sovereign chain that uh disconnects from the ethereum layer one the technical details i'm a little escape me as to how this would work but is that a future world that we might see where absolutely not no we we do not foresee this we're not we don't we don't have any plans for such a thing we are relying in so many aspects on ethereum and uh that's that's our strategic decision from day one and uh it's it's a four-year-old strategic decision yeah yeah okay so okay so there's no plans for the stark net to become its own layer one what about settling upon a different layer one like in in addition to ethereum studying a language we've been approached many times anyone uh uh you can think of okay uh our answer is simple and straightforward you know we're layer two on ethereum uh that's what we've been building for years now and we're very proud of that um you know so this is where we are you know this is where we're at this is where we exist and what are the properties of ethereum that really make that true like what what about ethereum uh keeps you so aligned with it well i i uh two things uh um culturally okay there's this developer uh focus and mindset and that's a sentiment we share and uh that's something that sort of runs in our veins and we're very happy to see in that regard the the fast-growing ecosystem around starknet which is really sort of developer focused and developers first that's really top of mind for us at a more technical or called technical economic level uh security the security offered by ethereum is unmatched right there's just uh cannot be compared with anything else other than i don't know what bitcoin i want to add to that that everything about our team and our technology the way we work is about future proofing so the technology is the most future proof of all the uh you know options of proof systems out there and the most future proof layer one we see today is ethereum so it's a very obvious choice yeah certainly the the idea of assurances is very very important in crypto settlement insurances but also just assurances that the ecosystem that you build upon sticks around for a long time for sure uh and so especially in these very nascent years of crypto i mean we're 12 years into it but you know we know that this is a century-long endeavor having long-term assurances is super super important of course um okay so let's get into the details of the token because the token was recently announced and i have to i have to start with this uh isuzu accidentally uh leaked well not accidentally he and leaked the details of the token and then the token blogs which were already seemed like they were already ready to go uh were released 24 hours later wasuzu anything to do with the timing of when those articles went so yeah um unfortunately it had nothing to do with it meaning that was actually the game plan um and as as you indicate uh from the three-part series this was uh a well thought out right uh sort of uh yeah no maybe no one will believe us but the target date many weeks before was july 13 wednesday and we're working yeah i'd like to hire anyone who can produce that kind of content right 24 hours that sort of clarity of thought and expression yeah and and get everyone to sign off on it you know inside the team yeah did you do you guys feel like drugs by suzu for for no no i i i think you know uh um i think they're in a situation of extreme distress uh right in finance class you know that you're taught about the cost of distress how we're seeing this sort of uh extreme behavior unfortunate um there's a a part of the ethereum community is actually very happy about the things uh that have gone down with with throughout's capital because they think that the decentralization of stark net is super important uh and so they're actually kind of happy to see that the tokens that three aeros capital owns to be distributed amongst almost anyone else other than than hours capital is this a sentiment that you guys share or or any thoughts on this i i i gotta say uh the the sudden freud is is not something that i sort of uh i i can't sort of uh sure but on a more on a more like formal and technical level the the um the whole um you know legal process that is unfolding with uh with three hours is not something that we are um you know in control of or aware of all its details yeah yeah yeah like we are so about the the actual token launch so let's run through the next uh weeks months of starknet and the token and the roadmap for that uh can you guys uh for people that haven't read the blog post or perhaps they only consume data through uh video and audio uh what what's that what's the roadmap what's the launch process for this token okay so 10 billion tokens have been allocated minted and their allocation has commenced um allocation has been uh has begun to investors to core contributors which include stark where employees consultants and developer partners [Music] in parallel to that a foundation is being set up that once it is set up i mean it is being allocated slightly over 50 of the tokens and those tokens are going to be used both for user user-driven rebates and provisions to the around 18 in total of all of the 10 billion tokens in addition there are grants in the foundation that's going to have a strategic reserve and other things that you also see in other layer twos and in other chains now this is being done right now so the foundation is being set up now by september uh the tokens which are now off chain are going to be uh placed on chain in their erc20 token all of the tokens that thus far have been allocated to investors core contributors are going to have a four year schedule of release a one-year cliff and and then gradual release beyond that looking a little bit later on um sometime shortly after they're placed on chain they will start they will be requested for um governance and voting on upgrades to the network uh operating system um and then next year at some point we will transition to allowing fees and then demanding fees be paid only in the stock in the token and further down the line within 2023 these tokens will be used for staking for the purpose of participating in consensus and leader election for operating in a decentralized way the the system and so the the economic model that i've come to like understand generally about layer two tokens like optimism arbitrarily they don't have their token yet but i'm assuming it's gonna follow this path too is that you stake the token to validate the chain uh same thing with ether on the on on the layer one for ethereum um but the the difference between the stark uh net token and uh the other um uh concepts or or strategies of the layer twos is that layer two's uh optimism arbitrary at least the generalized optimistic roll-ups pay for the transaction fees in ether but the difference here with start.net is that you pay for the transaction fees in the stark net token uh what what's the thought or strategy behind this like why this decision uh well our focus as i mentioned earlier our focus is on on developers and developers first and uh we believe that this mechanism that we've put in place that would allow people to pay via pay masters to pay eth for transaction uh transaction fees but the the the the native token of this layer uh will be the the starknet token uh we think that this creates an economic ecosystem that would give developers uh the environment that they need to build and thrive in we think that long term this is the healthier ecosystem that needs to be built i want to just add a few more details so it's really important for us that developers further down the line uh experience inclusivity which means you know suppose there's probably someone uh she's now in college or or you know maybe high school in three years down the line she's going to write some amazing smart contract that's going to be really important and valuable and now how are we going to find a way for her to have a say in the governance for her to participate in operating the network well the mechanism we want to come up with and and we're very proud of trying to innovate on that as well is one in which a portion of the fees and these are governance tokens right and also used for staking for operating the system are going to flow automatically to smart contracts as a portion of the fees being paid so now this imaginary smart contract developer she will start receiving tokens that allow her to participate in the governance and in operating the system which can only be done if you have a native token and demand the fees to be paid in it that's why we're doing it certainly certainly and uh we're we're of course uh like i started this interview in this bear market which is also a build market uh and we need to build our way out of it and so just lay down the vision for how you you hope that stark net progresses where where are we in six months where are we in six years where are we in six months i think where we were six months ago where are we in six years same answer writing code deploying systems uh educating developers onboarding more people into the blockchain ecosystem into the broader ethereum ecosystem uh that's where we want to be in six years maybe also hardware may well be not just software all right well uh i i hope you guys have a fantastic rest of your ecc um and thank you so thank you for coming on and driving here and don't forget the sunscreen i think it's appropriate certainly cheers guys okay thank you thank you [Music] you
