foreign [Music] ation to Devcon 6 the Devcon 6 experience in this interview I'm talking with Dank rat Feist of dink sharding Fame of course Dan Craig is the guy that is leading ding sharding for us all eip4844 which is proto-dink sharding and then later dank sharding itself I asked Dan grad about the layer 2 Wars and how 4844 will impact all of these things and what ethereum will look like under a 4844 Paradigm and really just why we should be excited about 4844 I also asked dank Rod about his experience in Bogota what it's like to be at all of these devcons and how Bogota is different and what Dan crad gets up to after Defcon is over and the sun goes down so I hope you enjoy this conversation with bankrad Feist from the EF Mr dangsharding himself right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible truefy is leading defy into the future of on-chain uncollateralized loans opening up D5 to the 8 trillion dollar Global Credit Market whether you want higher yields on your lending or you're a fund manager who just wants access to global liquidity and the cost Savings of Defense AI trufi is here for you but if you're going to use trufi use it through the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the gray browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet view your nfts and keep up to date with your web 3 communities another thing you can use through Brave is of course Arbitron and you all of course have heard about arbitrum but the arbitrum ecosystem is really heating up with a recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrim has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with a recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrum Nitro shipped to last month and has made arbitrum faster and cheaper than ever before make sure that you can experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking fuel Network free from evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem them to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security also pushing the frontier of web3 development is the sequence wallet from Horizon sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for users sequence is a smart wallet and perhaps the most intuitive wallet in all of web 3 but for developers it's a plug and play platform for all web 3 apps and games check out sequence which is already powering some of the best web 3 games out there and lastly diesel is a decentralized social platform built from the ground up to disrupt the social media industry disrupting social media takes a lot of data and dieso's infinite State applications can finally store an index large amounts of content and data fully on chain with multiple crypto native monetization mechanisms for both developers and creators diesel wants to usher in a new relationship with our social applications check them out at diesel.com and now on to the show bankless Nation I'm here with Dank Rod Feist here at Bogota Devcon 6. thank God have you been to every every deficon no no okay how many defcons have you been to my first Defcon was okay 2018 so that's three defcons this is your third Dev con how does this one compare to all the other ones um I I think this one's really really great yeah um yeah great shout out to the organizers I think like it's I think the best def con so far in terms of organization and how everything like just works smoothly yeah this is my my first Defcon but I've heard of the chaos of previous stepcons and it also seems to kind of correlate with the general chaos of the ethereum ecosystem now we're a little bit more like for post merge like we've shipped some stuff we got our coordination down uh and that has also extended itself into the Devcon layer if you will uh what do you enjoying the most about Bogota and about Devcon what's really like gotten your juices flowing here um I think like yeah it's it's the mood of like ethereum now like I think um there was a long time where it felt like progress was really slow and was tough and like research never actually made it into the protocol and um I think we are at an inflection point where that is actually changing with the merge and I think like you can feel it in the community that this like people see this optimism and they're very happy that like over the next few years will actually scale and we'll actually be able to do all the things we wanted to do certainly yeah and you know as the all the listeners will know we all feel like we're in a bear Market but you don't really feel that energy here and I want to ask you about like developer morale now that we are post merged like it's probably the biggest win in the crypto space and definitely in the ethereum space that we've ever had so how how is developer morale now so I think I mean I I always think like I don't know I can't speak for everyone but I think like many developers um feel that they're actually more productive in a bear market and it's actually better time to ship things because you don't you're distracted by fewer things they are not that many people who maybe like are only in it for the money and calling you all the time and all that so um I think people are still very positive and optimistic um I think it was a stressful time for many of them so like I think many of them will probably at some point want to take some time off as well but uh but I think like the mood is optimistic certainly well deserved but also ethereum developers never seem to stop developing and uh now that we have like this confidence of the merge behind us uh I've always thought that like the merge was just the biggest training ground for developer coordination and developer shipping uh and now not only have we practiced coordination we've delivered it and had that like a great successful merge and now we're on the other side of it do you think development is actually going to like speed up once everyone has had their break and comes back to the table um I mean personally I do hope so because um in a way like I think like what we are planning to do over the next few years is going to be uh quite difficult like it will require a lot of work and a lot of coordination um so yes like we definitely need to like improve our game as well on like making those changes happen um but I think um yeah I think I think it's gonna I think it's gonna work like I can see like lots of uh momentum and lithium Community what are the technical challenges that you see looming overhead in the Horizon um uh so I mean I think like yeah I mean basically with uh with uh sharding data sharding like we are attempting something that has never been done and it's also especially like so it's like a complete change in terms of how blockchain work and clearly like some other projects are attempting this as well um I think all of them are somewhat less ambitious in terms of decentralization than we are um and so that makes it just a very hard project to deliver these things and like doing all this on a working project that has like large-scale use makes this all the more difficult yeah but isn't ethereum always doing things that have never been done before um yes I mean I guess the merge was one of these things but yes yeah yeah for sure it is but um but I think yeah I mean I think like these changes over the next few years are I think like vitalik had this nice s-curve and I think yes it is right we are at this little inflection at the bottom and now we have to like did about the rest of it and so uh the the year of 2021 was like the year of ultrasound bunny it was eip1559 it was the merge uh and like you know testing this merge but then now that's all behind us and now everyone is focused on eip4844 or Proto dank sharding of which is your your name right uh dang sharding dank rad uh and also Proto Lambda do you feel like uh my vision is like the Rocky Balboa is running up the stairs and like now it's your moment is that how you feel it's like oh this is dankrad's moment I mean it's certainly the things that I have been looking forward to the most in terms of what I actually wanted to do when I when I joined uh ethereum research a few years ago um so yeah I'm really looking forward to this changes making it to the protocol okay so what what about uh dang sharding or proto-dink charting why is that what your brain focuses on like why is that the thing that interests you like some people some people are interested in eip1559 Justin Drake is interested in ultrasound money you're interested in dank sharding why why I mean all of these are important things but clearly um I think um I mean ethereum right now maybe can serve in its current form like maybe a million people or something and we want to bring that to a billion so like I feel like every like day we're spending at the current form is like a day that's lost to all the other people who could use ethereum so I think like in that respect I feel that's a very urgent change sure okay and I'm sure you've you've explained what proto-tang sharding and ding sharding is but have you ever done it in like can you explain dank sharding in like one sentence or less how how quickly can you explain day charting um it's basically it's the roll-up booster you've heard about Roll-Ups they make ethereum much cheaper and more uh and more efficient and basically it's like it's like putting it an afterburner under them and to making them work yeah even much more cheaply and allowing them to serve a lot more users and why what is the Big Technical lift here uh like when you look under the hood of the ethereum protocol what's the technical if that we've never done before so um in terms of like the current exchange for H4 for there is no fundamental change how technically the blockchain works there are some new things that we introduced that were prepared for full charting uh but those are not strictly technically necessary for what we're doing there um what the big change we're starting will be that we're building a blockchain that maintains the full security as we are used to anti-serilization from ethereum but does it by providing a data availability that scales beyond what the individual node can process so so far all blockchains are built in mind with like okay like we can can never do more than your individual know that you run at home can process and we are going beyond that we are building a blockchain that is as secure and decentralized but can be go beyond that scale okay beautiful uh and of course having accessibility is a core pillar of ethereum and this is how we like you said allow ethereum to be accessed by by everyone in the world is there some now that we're post-merge there was I'm assuming a lot of previous developer talent that was focused on the merge that is now no longer focused on the merge and so now now like is that now it's being diffused across you know all the other eips is it like how much of eip4844 is now the focus versus people focusing on other things like account abstraction or other eips I mean so these are discussions that are going on right now and clearly like I'm a big proponent of like making 4844 happen even in the next hard Fork um there are definitely some other things that will compete with that like withdrawals need to happen uh lots of eaps want to get in of course um I would say like getting 4844 done is very very urgent I hear that from many like uh roll-up teams and other teams that like they're literally making the case that they have business cases they want to deploy and they cannot happen if they don't have 4844 sure so uh so I I'm making the case that this should be a very high priority but the discussions on that are not finished certainly and the way I kind of think of 4844 or dank sharding you called it a an afterburners for Roll-Ups I think that's a great way to do it to articulate it it's also just like unlocking a ton of new use cases on Roll-Ups that we wouldn't be able to have otherwise right mainly just because we're lowering the fees down to almost the theoretical minimum and it's also like it's it's like this question like often like people have these use cases in mind but they just know that at the current scale they can they can just never work so they don't even try to deploy them so I think these can now happen Okay so we we ship we ship Deng sharding layer twos become super fast super cheap super available uh what are some of these use cases that your people are talking to you about or other use cases that you're excited about that would be unlocked after 4844. I mean I think that's like I mean it's a permissionless system so like it I think I think we probably can't even imagine what people are going to build on it like I mean I think five years ago we wouldn't have known what people will build on that no now but um I think um they're great many I mean clearly like I'm always like okay like think about the simple things as well like I mean think about payments like it is an important use case and we can't probably support it now uh but I think like many other cool things like maybe more social media apps that sort of stuff can happen I I can't I don't have a great imagination for everything that could happen sure and it's of course it's a hard question when you just don't know because you've never the blockchain world has never seen this availability before we haven't had these opportunities because we haven't had secure block space that is super cheap yeah um my take on this is that the the ethereum layer one is heavy heavy Finance you know nfts that are super highly valued a lot of D5 stuff and vitalik of course is obsessed with non-financial use cases of a blockchain and I think that we don't really get non-financial use cases of the blockchain until we get transactions that are basically free right because the only transactions that we can really afford are they're super expensive ones and those are going to be Finance transactions well some exceptions there are some high value non-finance transactions like yeah ens hero revocations things like that sure right but it's very limited yeah and so if we want to unlock non-financial use cases of the blockchain we need transactions that aren't Financial as in like basically free so I'm sure vitalik will be super happy to see all these new use cases that come about what else across the ethereum developer space uh has captured your attention or are you just like Tunnel Vision on 4844 um I definitely do have like most of my attention is focused on the technical stuff so like I'm uh and particularly L1 so like my other big project is statelessness which I also think is like an important change to the blockchain um yeah I I don't know like I mean I I can see many things happening but uh often I don't you have particular time to look very deeply into into the applications so right after this interview I'm about to interview bartek right over there uh and the layer two Wars are hot uh and yeah I mean you're you're at the EF so you kind of just get to watch them all happen in front of you do you have any like hot takes about the uh the layer two Wars or just like any observations because there's a ton of announcements that happen this week right um I I don't think I have any hot takes um I'm no I I'm I'm really glad that it happens and like I I don't know I couldn't have imagined like even one year ago how how many teams would be and really high quality teams would be trying to do this um clearly they are still like I mean there's so many problems right like I mean most of them almost all of them aren't proper uh tools yet and that that's really the big challenge that probably also gonna talk about with bartek um but uh but I mean I I have no oh I mean I don't I don't think all of them are gonna make it but I have no uh I'm pretty certain that within a year we will see like fully decentralized proper secure l2s on ethereum and that's that's amazing well but uh thank God this certainly seems to be the Golden Age of ethereum building and so thank you for being a Shepherd a pioneer of that age uh and I hope you have a fantastic time the rest of your time here at ether at Defcon Bogota yep cheers bam [Music]
