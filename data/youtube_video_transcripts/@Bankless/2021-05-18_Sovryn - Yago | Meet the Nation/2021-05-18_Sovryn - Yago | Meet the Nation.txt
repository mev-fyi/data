[Music] welcome bankless nation to this edition of meet the nation today i'm talking to yago from the sovereign project sovereign is building out a defy ecosystem natively on bitcoin and if you have ever been frustrated which i we do get feedback from some of some members of the bank list nation about how ethereum and ether focus that ryan and i are this is an episode to give you a different flavor of that right this is much more of a bitcoin focus episode uh yago was a fantastic guest that i think represents bitcoin values in cryptoeconomic just progress and innovation uh while we are both like well i'm taking off my my ethereum hat and putting on my bitcoin hat which i can do surprise surprise to really talk about uh sovereign and defy native bitcoin uh or or uh bitcoin native d5 excuse me um we are i'm in complete agreement with yago that like wbtc renbi dc tbtc on ethereum it's kind of in from the bitcoin perspective not actually defy because you have to have these trust assumptions for getting bitcoin on to ethereum and so if bitcoin wants its own trustless level of decentralized finance it needs to be built on bitcoin uh and so while well sometimes sometimes i uh criticize bitcoin for being just this inert substance that you know is really unproductive sovereign really fixes this sovereign allows for bitcoin and btc the asset to really have expressivity and optionality as an asset and really really throws a wrench in the arguments of a lot of ethereum arguments about ether the asset uh trying to be you know maximally expressive and programmable sovereign allows all these things that we talk about ether for with ethereum it allows it for bitcoin uh and uh so you know the tldr of sovereign it's it's a side chain of bitcoin it's an evm compatible system and so they can take a lot of ethereum code and deploy on sovereign and all of a sudden we have you know amms on bitcoin money markets on bitcoin like i make your dow fork on bitcoin uh yaakov does a fantastic job explaining all of these uh little nuances and how this whole system works and where consensus comes from really i really thoroughly enjoyed this conversation so let's go ahead and get into it with iago from sovereign but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the unit swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right bankless nation i am here with yago from sovereign and sovereign is an interesting project that we is in in a design space that we don't typically cover here on the bankless program sovereign is building defy on bitcoin and so i have all my own questions about what defy on bitcoin looks like and we are going to ask and hopefully answer some of those questions today iago welcome to the bankless nation happy to have you uh absolute pleasure thanks for having me jago so so tell us uh a little bit about sovereign before we get into uh what it is tell us about the background and the motivation and the impetus for creating sovereign and uh also a little bit about the the formulation of the team uh who are you and why are you interested in building sovereign and who uh who did you collect around you to help uh build out defy on bitcoin sure so a little bit about me i um my background's in neuroscience i started a few biotech companies in the neuroscience machine learning space uh because i was doing that i was reading papers in network science around 2010-11 in 2011 i came across a paper by this dude called satoshi and it uh it blew my mind and screwed up my life because um very very shortly afterwards i i dropped everything else i was doing and i've been focused on bitcoin and um and crypto ever since and what drew me to it is it's you know there's this american line money makes the world go round and it's extremely true right the degree to which you are free the degree to which you are uh able to determine your life express your true values and to the degree to which you are sovereign is entirely dependent on how much in control you are of your value right of of the value you produce of the value you own the value you save of your financial and monetary life and um my personal background i've encountered this in many many different ways um so i come from a family of holocaust survivors um they and part of them ended up in where i ended up was apartheid south africa my family were extremely politically active they were members of the anc they were regarded some of them were regarded as terrorists by the apartheid government and had to flee south africa i ended up smuggling gold out of south africa as a very young child and so that and a whole assortment of other ways in which my family have been on the wrong side of history throughout the 20th century really encalculated in me and understanding that um the most valuable type of free speech is the speech that you make with uh with with money right i mean that's like there's another great american phrase put your money where your mouth is right we're never more honest or more true about how what we value in the world um and and the way we express that value than than the way we interact with with our financial lives so when i came across um bitcoin it immediately struck me as an extremely important innovation probably the most important innovation i would ever see and then on the level of curiosity right so my my intellectual curiosity had always been about network systems and um the internet had always struck me as missing something which is a native economy right everything was ads and the reason everything was as there's nothing else you can do on the internet or or there wasn't and then suddenly there was this digital form of scarcity that was presented which i realized was basically the second pillar that was required in order to allow us to have fundamentally uh digitally driven lives so um ever since i've been involved in the space primarily in trying to be involved in projects um around uh getting these technologies into the hands of as many people as possible of trying to make bitcoin and crypto hyper inclusive out of the sense that the problem with these tools is that by the time you realize you need them it's usually too late right so um i i set up among other things a company which we were managing remittances to to nigeria to zimbabwe to uh china to brazil um and set up payment processing for exchanges that had lost their banking and and and was very engaged sort of on on that side of the space and um over the course of the years you know i'd watched how bitcoin and the rest of the crypto environment had um evolved and there was one thing like in the same way that the internet had been missing something right which was digital scarcity um crypto bitcoin was missing something fundamental right you had this amazing uh decentralized censorship resistant asset and the minute you wanted to do anything with it you had to go to a centralized exchange and re-intermediate yourself it made absolutely no sense and so this idea of decentralized exchanges was was deeply bound with the idea of bitcoin from the very very earliest days and you know there were things like colored coins or um and the omni network and there were there were multiple different attempts to create this and it really started to emerge about two years ago and i think for me the big realization was maker down right what maker down managed to accomplish which is effectively competing with the fed uh in a decent with a decentralized uh uh mechanism um really got me excited and so about a year ago we were uh i and a number of other bitcoiners who had known sort of from the early days were raising money for covert related things primarily distribution of mosques to where they were needed in a decentralized fashion and we found ourselves talking about what was what was still missing what we were happy about what we were disappointed in and the thing that kept on coming back was that bitcoin didn't have still didn't have a native way of uh having decentralized finance or or using this asset without intermediation and um and then a couple of the devs uh started coding something up and showed it to us and that was the beginning of sovereign um and so what sovereign is is i think a fundamentally simple idea which is that we have um this core asset very likely to become the reserve asset of the future although i know that that you you in particular have have some thoughts on this and um and it needs to have it needs to extend its capabilities into the financial layer or all of this nonsense about hyper bitcoinization and building freedom and recreating the is all going to end up with just a bunch of uh bitcoin held in coinbase and by fidelity right there's a there's a line that i like to use where um really there's there are only two categories of intermediation and one is uh the money that we use and the other the technology that we use and really what makes me um optimistic about the world of crypto economics is it really fundamentally changes both money and technology and when you disintermediate or or just reinvent how intermediation happens both with technology and money you change everything like changes all culture everywhere right and so like the the reason why you you go into your own history and talk about like getting gold out of south africa or just like your family being on the wrong side of history to me it's a it's very much again a political and cultural conversation as to like what happens when you don't have sovereignty over your money like the culture is different and like why you and i and the shared values and ethos of people who you know put decentralization first is because like we very much value the the cultural impacts of where decentralization comes from and so i want to get into the details of sovereign and how it works on a technical level but first i want to uh i want to talk about like what because the obvious i think question that many like you call them eth maxis or ethes or whatever we'll ask it's like well then why not just build d5 on on bitcoin or define ethereum right like we already have defined ethereum just come over to ethereum but all over but really all of the implementations of bitcoin on ethereum are not awesome they're not great talk about why uh why the the why there's motivation to just build define natively on bitcoin and and why deep bitcoin on ethereum perhaps is not exactly what you are looking for as a future of sovereign finance sure uh well i think there are two reasons and i'll call them the little reason and the big reason and i'll start with the little reason okay the little reason is that there is basically no d5 for bitcoin even if it's on ethereum the to a first approximation all of the bitcoin so to speak on ethereum is coming through wbtc and renbtc which are both effectively centralized systems so you may be using a d5 protocol but you're not using d5 your assets are centralized and so the little reason is at least at this point um you [Music] uh you you just there is no d5 for bitcoin right there's an additional thing which is that um there's a and there's another little reason from a convenience perspective um if you have bitcoin and this is the asset that you want to transact in to now go and acquire ethereum as a secondary asset in order to and you're gated by it and you need to pay the fees in that um not to mention you know sort of like the the micro situation right now of how expensive those fees are um the it's not appropriate now so on the micro level right now despite the fact that ethereum is this has this culture of hyper inclusivity it's from a practical perspective actually probably the most exclusive blockchain in the world right now and one of the ideas that has really percolated through sovereign is the idea that you shouldn't have to be early and you shouldn't have to be technical in order to be free so that's one reason but that's the little reason because these things are part of the sort of micro macro structure of the current system and ethereum can change and evolve over time the big reason is this the big reason is that to my mind whether you realize it or not every single person who is in crypto is a bitcoin and that's because if bitcoin fails the entire enterprise fails now we see this on the on the day-to-day level where bitcoin goes up everything goes up bitcoin goes down everything goes down and bitcoin is the center of gravity uh for this entire space but there's there's a deeper level of understanding which i think is required here and and i think this is you know where you and i probably are going to most disagree which is that i think we only get one shot at creating a digital reserve currency and if we win with that one shot then there can be other digital reserve currencies right so if you think about the dollar right through the 1800s if there was a system called bimetallism the dollar was backed by both gold and silver but we need to get the gold first right because because otherwise let's i mean let's imagine a situation right now where you know you've got a lot of ethereum you want ethereum to do very well a lot of people end up thinking like you there is this thing the flipping right and suddenly ethereum is trading at a higher value than bitcoin what i think happens on that day from a narrative perspective is that both of them start trading like tech stocks and neither of them is able to ever acquire monetary premium and so i think the ability of the entire space to acquire monetary premia is solely dependent on whether or not bitcoin gets there um and so it's extremely important that we um build an ecosystem which is able to support that effort not just for bitcoin but for the entire ecosystem right yeah that's a very nuanced argument that i actually haven't really really heard before um and you know well while listeners are probably pretty familiar with with my particular like bias or stance uh towards with a positive stance towards ethereum versus bitcoin uh i'm actually kind of grateful to have this opportunity to actually talk with with it with a bitcoin first bitcoiner uh because like i i do agree that there is this potential for for bitcoin to do more than typically what i illustrate on like the weekly rollups when i really just have my ethereum hat on uh and and largely it's really because there there isn't defy on bitcoin yet right and that's why that's why i'm primarily interested in talking to sovereign right because on in my most critical days i'll call like bitcoin like pet rock or digital gold right and it just like it's a very inert substance it's like this excel sheet where on one one column you have holders and on the second column you have balances and that's all it does um and for all the same reasons that you articulated like if we just put you know bitcoin into coinbase for our borrowing and lending and trading and and uh you know collateralization uh opportunities then we're not we don't have sovereignty right and then and there's right i'm sure there's a very fantastic reason why you're calling this project sovereign right and so really the biggest argument for for all the people that and there are like bankless listeners who perhaps get like frustrated with me and ryan and our level of like etherism um and so perhaps this is a time to really like take that take that hat off because like the really compelling argument for bitcoin is exactly as you articulated right like well as soon as you can actually get self like native and d5 to bitcoin with no additional trust assumptions then all of a sudden we can talk about like bitcoin as like a highly functional um reserve asset of the world right and like there is something that that ether will never ever be able to emulate with regards to bitcoin number one being first and number two being that this immaculate conception which you know some people will uh disagree to the um level of how powerful that actually is but at the end of the day like a lot of people respect it and a lot of people have that like well it's it's inarguable to some degree like how powerful that is because of how much other people really really respect that that future about bitcoin and so like the biggest argument against what me and ryan often articulate is something like sovereign something like defy native to bitcoin that's on the the base bitcoin blockchain uh and that really turns uh bitcoin into this more inert substance into something more expressive with more optionality that allows users to really uh have the full not just monetary uh disintermediation which is where i see bitcoin bitcoin gets 10 out of 10 scores on monetary distance media and intermediation but also but it's lacking on the technological disintermediation because we have to use centralized custodians if we can actually build out that technological disintermediation with sovereign then all of a sudden a lot of the arguments that ryan and i really put forth about like why ether is a compelling reserve asset like could like i was very it's all of a sudden very very competitive so let's actually get into the the technical details of uh sovereign so say i i've got bitcoin on bitcoin what's the user story for getting my bitcoin on to sovereign tell us about that process right so i'm gonna start with the uh so this is this is an evolving thing the way it works now there's a pig this pig is what we call a pow peg so it's a proof of work proven via a federation of hsm holders uh where um proof needs to be provided from both a bitcoin sidechain which is uh merge mined with bitcoin and uh the bitcoin network via spv proofs so you have um this basically cryptographically um trust reduced trust minimized um federated peg which allows you to lock up your bitcoin on main chain move it to a side chain on bitcoin which is called rootstock and um and then you're still using bitcoin it's still protected and every single transaction is mined by the bitcoin miners but now your bitcoin has basically superpowers it has a greater degree of expressivity um can i pause you there um because i want to get some some technical definitions set um when when we typically talk about side chains on the bankless program we're talking when we use them we're talking about uh a system that has a different consensus mechanism to what when we're typically talking about we're talking about ethereum right so we have ethereum l2s and those are things like rollups that have one-to-one security parameters as the actual ethereum blockchain right the ethereum blockchain is the uh the where final settlement occurs and no other final settlement occurs by any other mechanism so we call those l2s side chains are something worth it within in the way that we use it is a system where there's different consensus there's a different consensus mechanism the polygon network is a side chain and it has consensus by a different token matic token and it's a proof of stake token and it actually has a different level of uh settlement because it settles using matic uh so so when you when you call uh the root stock or what do we call the the root stock side chain is that is that right that's right that's right is it is bitcoin the final final settlement or is root stock the final settlement so in bitcoin land it's a little bit different um it is a separate consensus mechanism which allows for a separate sense of rules but the consensus is bitcoin proof of work and mined by bitcoin miners in a process known as blind merge mining so effectively what's happening is the bitcoin miners as they're looking for the next bitcoin block are producing waste hashes right these waste hashes um a a the right waste hash will actually discover a block for rootstock and so you merge the security of the two chains but are able to have different rule sets and so what that also means is that there's no new token it's all one token and one token ecosystem now the power of this is and the whole reason this exists is because rootstock is effectively evm compatible right so we can write solidity code on rootstock um and there's been obviously this huge amount of innovation in the ethereum space which can now be adapted to the security assurances of bitcoin with bitcoin as the native asset and so the way that you get on it um you can go directly through the peg which is a little bit of an arduous process or you can use a relay that has been constructed which is known as the fast ptc relay which means that within one block you basically do a bitcoin transaction and one block later you are um on the side chain now i so that's the current state and i'll just point out where we expect this to go so i think what's happening with ethereum and what one of the things that ethereum has proven is that building everything on their own just doesn't work uh it doesn't matter if it's a side chain or not and some of the most phenomenal technology that has been built on ethereum which we're most excited about is everything to do with roll ups and in particular zero knowledge roll-ups so um we have effectively a a very vague right now road map um but it's got a three-step process step one is we have this merge mind bitcoin sidechain with similar assurances to bitcoin uh very very soon we'll be in phase two a nice and we're based very very soon i think we're talking 40 days or less we will be on a roll-up which rolls up to that which effectively takes the computation off of that uh chain but provides the same assurances again so you have the scalability of a roller and then where we expect this can go in in a slightly longer period where we're talking maybe um two three years is that you can effectively do away with the side chain entirely and roll up to um dlc enabled um uh lightning network so effectively lightning network integrated with with with extremely primitive uh uh smart contracts that all they know how to do is read these zero knowledge proofs and then what you ultimately end up with is everything collapses down to bitcoin main chain seamlessly without even having a separate consensus mechanism at all so in in that version of the world sovereign sovereign and just defy on bitcoin the consensus is the lightning network which the consensus is bitcoin and so so like and the cool thing about rollups is like rollups is actually a blockchain neutral piece of technology you actually apply it on any piece of blockchain um no matter the construction uh to i think that's right uh and and so uh with what your your long-term vision is so does that mean that in that root stock is built on on lightning in this future version of the world or or this is just sovereign being not like lightning enabled so again within even within sovereign i think don't think everyone agrees with me on this uh i've been a sidechain advocate for about as long as you could have been a sidechain advocate right 2014 when the idea really started um and it's always frustrated me that you know i think you know we are all familiar with what happened with the bitcoin well not all of us but probably the people listening to us right now know a lot of the story of how bitcoin you know had this massive civil war and then things kind of ossified for a while and this for um actually i think the majority of bitcoins has been pretty frustrating and i think is why people are getting so excited about sovereign but um uh the the the the overall thinking was look if you have side chains you basically can do anything you can extend any functionality into bitcoin you can have infinite scalability and what i think i'm starting to realize is that you might not even need the side chains at all right so if you have smart state channels you can and roll ups which has been this huge contribution that ethereum has brought to the world then you basically uh can roll up directly into the state channel right and and naturally everything gets more efficient that way and also with reduced trust assumptions so and that's what we like and in a bankless universe that's what we need the most um that's really exciting and so we so we have this all of a sudden this evm compatible uh layer two bitcoin which again collapses down to the bitcoin network one of the really powerful things about defy on ethereum is that it's got this permissionless level of innovation right and so if you want to build something you don't ask for permission you just build it and all of a sudden you have that composability with the rest of all defy apps on ethereum is that the way that it also would in theory work with sovereign right is it is there permissionless access to building on sovereign just as there is permissionless i mean it's not it's not even theoretical it's exactly how it works so um yeah i mean you you anyone can deploy anything to rootstock and integrate with sovereign um a number of projects are already starting to do it so we have some pretty exciting projects we've got a project called money on chain which has developed a bitcoin bank stablecoin there are a number of other interesting bitcoin backstable coin constructions coming along um there's an aggregator prog protocol called babelfish which um uh so you know one of the things that's happening right now just across the entire crypto space is we have like an asset like usdt or eth and it's being represented in all of these different chains and all of these different layers and so you get like you know right now there's like 12 different versions of usdt on on on binance smart chain for example i don't even know how many there are in ethereum right so babel fish they will refresh re-aggregates them and provides you with like a single token that comes out exactly so there's a whole bunch of sort of work that's being done around sort of like the core sovereign protocol and anyone um it's it's as a it's for a developer coming from the ethereum space it's basically the same experience right and so the the conversation of like all right well what does defy on bitcoin look like actually kind of stops right there because like listeners know what define ethereum looks like and if you're just an evm compatible uh layer to bitcoin like well it in theory it could just become exactly the same uh and there's always been this line that bitcoiners have chanted like since the beginning of time is like if it's useful it'll become it'll be built on bitcoin eventually uh and so we have all this software we have like unisop we have maker we have compound all this and and everything is open source and free to fork i mean your swap v3 has that license but like whatever um and so in theory you can just copy it and put it right on onto sovereign and all of a sudden you have uh you'll have the equivalent level of defy on bitcoin is that that's right yeah so if you look at what sovereign right now has so everyone currently has swaps in the form of an amm it has um an oracle system quite similar to the uni-swap oracle system allowing it to not require external articles it's got borrowing lending bitcoin back stable coins margin trading um a sort of token launch platform that's been built out it's got auction systems it's the the richness and power of the um of the protocol given the amount of time that that that it's taken to build is very very impressive um and the overall goal of the project is effectively to provide a extension to bitcoin which is a financial operating system or the financial operating system of the future very cool very cool so so you said you have an amm you have a credit facility so is this all um all of these applications that are being built on sovereign are these done by the the sovereign team or are there other just like independent builders who are also building on sovereign at this moment yeah so sovereign looks a little bit different from most other projects there's no company behind sovereign and it started out um it's so the the the first divs you're working on the on the protocol uh were pseudonymous devs kind of like in the tradition of satoshi or in the tradition of rugballs and um um and um and so you know so that's where where the work started and then um what has happened since it so so one of the first things that was built out actually was a governance system which we haven't even spoken about but it it also looks a little bit different from most of the projects on that i've seen on ethereum in that the [Music] um the way it works is you have an sov token the suv token has a number of uses in the system one is it acts as a collateral for a trustless for the justice pig but the other thing is it's used for voting in the system and earning the revenues that the protocol generates but um it's uh it's a quadratically um weighted system where the longer you lock yourself up for the more voiding power you have and the um the more value of the protocol you accrue and the idea basically was to um for focus uh uh governance participants in to thinking for the long term and also make sure that the system was resistant to any sort of flash governance attacks um what has happened as a result has been remarkable uh the there's um roughly about 12 and a half thousand sov token holders of about four and a half thousand are staking um the median time that they're staking for and when you stake you it's extremely it's like bitcoin level severe you know how bitcoin is very very stern i like the puritans of the blockchain world so so when you when you lock yourself up that's it like you lose liquidity for that period of time the the median stake time is two years and the um average vote of which they have now been 16 has a 60 participation level so it's it's it's the sort of the the focus that the community has had on proper governance from day one has been extremely founding father's style um and then um there's there were a couple of uh waves of fundraising for the project the most recent and probably most famous one was um anthony pompliano wrote a sip a sovereign improvement proposal asking to acquire some certain tokens and there was a whole bunch of debate in the community and then the sort of the community negotiated with him and then there was a vote in the past and then he was able to participate so the the whole structure has been extremely focused on being decentralized and community governed from day one hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with iago thus far in the second part of this conversation we go into the details of the sovereign token and how it plays a role in consensus and governance over the sovereign ecosystem i asked iago what bitcoiners uh or or maybe not all bitcoiners but because the more more ardent maximalist flavor of bitcoins what they think of the sovereign token i'm sure that has uh turn at least a few bitcoiners for a tizzy uh we also talk about uh just taproot and how taproot is involved with the conversation of sovereign and defy on bitcoin and then overall we just have a more grand more long-term focused uh conversation as to like what it means to have uh defy on bitcoin natively and also and generally just have a conversation about what it means to be a decentralized base layer and kind of how you need a decentralized base base layer to have defy at large really enjoyed this conversation with yago i'm glad i was finally able to get a bitcoiner on to the bankless program because i know ryan and i put on our ether hats a little bit perhaps too often uh and so i hope you're enjoying this conversation but first we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs of the d-pi with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indexes but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally bouncer smart pools could be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bank list we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bath t-shirts to much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield and defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool to top things off bouncer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at pools.balancer.exchange gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless right so yeah so this is the concept of a governance token which you know bank listeners are probably extremely familiar with um how does that land with the the typical bitcoiner uh because from from what i've gathered bitcoiners don't like the g word they don't like governance uh and so has has this been like something that you've really had to convince like the average bitcoiner or or do they kind of what's been that reception um well it usually starts with so i'll give you an example like recently now i've been in the bitcoin space for a long time and i i'm not i'm not totally unknown in the bitcoin space right um i was recently on a um on a clubhouse and um i started i wasn't even talking about sovereign was not chilling anything i was just talking about bitcoiners maybe being a little bit close-minded sometimes and then somebody started shouting at me you've got a [ __ ] coin you've got a [ __ ] coin and then i was booted from the room twice and then eventually banned forever um so that has been some of the reception and i think the initial reaction that almost every single bitcoiner has had has been deep skepticism initially and i i deeply respect that so i think that that is the right way to approach almost any project in our space which is so right deserved skepticism yeah um but what we've been seeing is that um you know as they come to understand one thing which i respect is basically almost everyone's been doing their own research and as they come to understand how the system works how it preserves uh how how it adds to bitcoin security by paying additional fees to the bitcoin miners it does not impact main chain at all doesn't require people to have larger nodes um and at the same time um provides this entirely new space for bitcoin to play in right we have started to see basically growing enthusiasm from [Music] across the board yeah right so this is generally how uh governance and consensus happens at large right and especially with bitcoin it start it starts off no like no no no and then slowly it's like okay someone's like oh well maybe maybe and then other people are like well maybe this will work like maybe maybe yes question mark yes and all of a sudden so it seems like perhaps we're in this like question mark yes like part of like bitcoin acceptance of sovereign some people are probably all on board some people are probably still skeptical but generally sort of people are like maybe maybe maybe this this could actually work um so the sov token this let's because if it's a governance token like how it came about and how it got distributed is really really important so can you tell us the story of the genesis of the sov token someone minted it and then and then it's gotten distributed somehow uh tell us tell us about the the minting and distribution process of sov right so there was deep philosophical debate about this um early on and the decision was ultimately that the best projects okay so let me i'll break this up into two parts the first question was whether or not we are trying to emulate in any way bitcoin's distribution or some kind of fair you know fair distribution mechanism and and both of those were immediately or not immediately the both of those were summarily um rejected yeah yeah one sov is not a coin it's not designed to be a coin the distribution they that you would try and do for for like a currency doesn't make sense for it and what it exists higher up in the stack and it's designed to provide for um a rapidly changing or the ability for have to have a system which can rapidly change and evolve as an operating system and application their system so it was clear that we needed to have some degree of governance and then the question became who should govern and uh the answer was everyone who uses the system should they have the ability to participate in governance however if you actually look at the world and you're pragmatic you can see that the projects that do best are the projects where the original founding team have a deep long-term stake in the system and so what was decided to do was to first of all provide a pool of 25 of the tokens for the core team so founders and additional core team who could join and lock them up for basically forever so the the lock-up was for three years um making sure basically everyone else gets uh the opportunity to to participate and and get tokens in advance and then in order to bring in strategic partners and additional financing a sort of um uh there was a vote the the protocol decided to provide for a number a series of like rounds the last one being the anthony pompliano round and there again there were these lock-ups um so that there would be no situation where you would have this like [ __ ] coin waterfall where people come in early and cheap and then dump on people who come in later and so the people who are liquid now are basically the people who have gained tokens either by the very very lost like small like that what we call the origin sale which is to kick off the system and who are earning tokens from the system via their participation and they're basically the ones who are are creating the market and so if um if sovereign is built on rootstock which is a side chain to bitcoin and gets his consensus from bitcoin what does the role of the actual token do if it's not if it's not for protocol consensus what does it actually govern over so it is protocol consensus it's just not a base layer protocol consensus so what sovereign access is a financial protocol with all of the base primitives that you would need in a financial operating system but those need to change over time they have potentially you know different types of risks that need to be adjusted over time um the any system which is like a live application level system is exists in a competitive world it's not money money's the whole thing about money is it's supposed to never change it's it's like the fact that it's a dead thing right uh unchanging is an advantage because money is like the centimeter or the meter right it's a unit of measure you don't want it changing all the time but products or applications need to change and evolve much more rapidly than that and so the token provides for that it provides an incentive to do that via the ability to earn the the protocol fees that the protocol makes the protocol instead making transaction fees makes trade or lending fees in other words financial fees and then the third thing it does is for the trustless bitcoin peg which is in many ways similar to the tbtc peg it also acts as as a a bonded collateral form okay so do you have to stake sovereign tokens sov tokens to uh build that that peg and so if there is btc on ethereum is there an equivalent or more amount of sov tokens bonded is that is that the right way to look at it yeah so currently the the pig that we're using is what we call the power peg right which is this spv proof peg there's going to be an additional peg which is the the what we believe will be a more trustless and collateralized pig which has more clear economic assumptions behind it and um and then what we expect to ultimately do is be able to merge these allowing for fractional bonding so that you would have less less of a bond than the amount of bitcoin that you could potentially bring onto the system but initially like with the tbtc system for the economic peg you would need to have more sov bonded uh bitcoin coming through um and so we are very lucky that the sov token has become quite valuable which potentially allows for quite a lot of bitcoin to come over awesome awesome and when you talk about fees paid to sov token holders how are those fees determined is it is it simpler similar to like just a gas auction mechanism that you would see on ethereum with with the the evm system oh no yeah tell us about these the fees are pretty much fixed so i mean they can be adjusted by the governance system but like when you're introducing a margin trade right now for example there's a 0.15 percent fee that fee is collected by the protocol when you borrow there's a 0.9 percent origination fee that fee is collected by the protocol and then those fees are collectible or effectively distributed to all of the sov stakers on the basis of their stake weight in other words the quadratic weight that we just discussed earlier right so with on on ethereum we have like the mkr token which governs over maker tao we have the comp token which governs over compound uni token governs over uniswap is it the sov token that governs over every single equivalent defy application on on sovereign the srv token will govern over anything which the sovereign protocol or what we call the biotocracy around the uh government now there are other projects like babelfish who are building out their own governance system and um some projects are preferred to just piggyback off the governance system which we've already built which looks like it's quite robust um so again it's permissionless um and some devs prefer to work within the structure of sov being the the governance sort of asset and the the plutocracy being the government system and so that has become extremely feature-rich and in addition to that um anyone you know like for example one of the things that we don't currently have is only options trading um if somebody if you david wanted to build an option trading system and have your own governance system for it you could absolutely do that and integrate the solver very cool very cool so this starts to look like a doubt right this sound that starts to look like a decentralized or distributed group of interested staked parties who are interested in the growth and success of sovereign and there so there's some sort of like responsibility of sovereign token holders um to build out sovereign as an ecosystem and also encourage its growth and development and and usage uh and so this starts to seem like like a traditional dow that we would see on ethereum just now it's now it's on bitcoin that's pretty cool don't believe you've used the words traditional endow in the same sentence well the space moves so incredibly fast that anything that's six months old is automatically traditional um but yes i mean effectively it is a dao and i think that's great right like why would you want to have a system which is designed to be permissionless and borderless governed by a a system which which relies on the on the courts of of some jurisdiction right you want it to be governed by the blockchain itself right awesome awesome so so let's talk about the the future roadmap of sovereign what do you what i guess you as a as a member of the sovereign dell can only speak for yourself but what do you see as like the future of sovereign perhaps more concretely in the short term and more abstractly in the long term well i think i i can't talk personally like where i'm coming from what i would like my first desire with this is to just use it and that's why i've been so engaged right like i'm basically all in a bitcoin i want more bitcoin the best way for me to do that is to borrow on the basis of my bitcoin more bitcoin um i want to uh you know like let's say i want to go on vacation i don't want to sell bitcoin so i want to be able to borrow off my bitcoin um so it's just like what i and a lot of people like me want to be able to use the next step is i think we have a shared mission with basically ethereum default which is to kill the sexes right and i don't mean men and women i mean the centralized exchanges right like they they are a aberration in the story of how crypto should evolve and the sooner we can get rid of them or at least provide a credible alternative to them better and then i think the the the the further looking further out i i'm not i don't have a hundred percent certainty that bitcoin ever becomes a reserve asset um there's a lot of reasons why it might not um but i think certainly of all of the assets in the world right now crypto or not crypto bitcoin has probably the best chance of all of them of being the reserve asset in 10 or 15 years i think that world will require a financial operating system as permission as censorship resistant and borderless as the base asset itself and i believe that right now serving by far looks like it has the best chance of becoming that financial layer for bicker right and this is all very much part of the bankless revolution uh the bank list of revolution of course is not just defy on ethereum it's defy at large and what is true d5 which i don't pers i personally don't think exists on anything that's not a decentralized base layer right and so like that's right on on polka dot defy on cardano defy on eos not actually defy uh and as you alluded to bitcoin on ethereum is not d5 for bitcoin it's d it's it's something else only only something native to bitcoin can offer d5 for btc the asset and so uh this makes me very just optimistic about a bankless future uh coming in all sorts of shapes and sizes wherever wherever uh wherever it can manifest i have one last question and and maybe this is just an open and shut case but what does uh how does taproot um integrate or be like intersect with sovereign is that a relevant conversation yeah so sovereign is not reliant on temporary but teper it's awesome for lots of reasons uh but also with regards to sovereign so first of all i think it's going to make it much easier for us to continue to construct even more um easy to use permissionless peg systems second it allows for better privacy assurances as you're moving into the sovereign ecosystem um and it might prove to be and this is something i'm looking into and i don't have a strong opinion on yet but i think it might also prove to be a very powerful tool in terms of being able to allow zero knowledge troops to roll directly into uh bitcoin state channels so um you know i suspect we'll probably get taproot around november and taproot's really really cool tech and i think for it's going to make sovereign easier to do and cooler as well awesome well iago this has been a fantastic discussion i really appreciate you giving me some of your time to to just elaborate on what defy on bitcoin looks like and so if any interested community member is just interested in learning more where can they go to join the sovereign community or just read more about sovereign at large sure so um yeah sovereign dot app is a website that i and a few other people have built for it and it's the primary sort of like front end for the protocol so it's a great place to start our wiki is community driven and extremely extensive i think it's one of the best documented sort of d5 platforms anywhere um and if you thought i was in any way interesting you can check me out on twitter at idaniago and definitely follow um sovereign btc so that's s-o-v-r-y-n-b-t-c on twitter do you have like a discord or a telegram or some community like we have a number of community places but by far the most activism discord so the the sovereign sov ryn i'm a little bit dyslexic so i think that's right we'll get all the links in the show notes for the list yeah well that's good to hear that you guys on discord because if there's one thing i do want uh to change about the bitcoin universe it's about killing telegram and coming over to discord it's way better absolutely um there's actually a really cool um version of discord which is decentralized which has been built on bitcoin uh what yeah yeah yeah you should check it out um i'll send you the link um it's um called oh damn i hope i'm i'm remembering this right fabric um um and and one of the the bitcoin core devs has built it out and it's starting to become a little bit popular with uh with bitcoiners and there's also a chat system which has been built uh using lightning network called sphinx which is really taking off these days um starting to see a little not only defy on bitcoin but web three on bitcoin too that's right yeah look i mean it was bound to happen that you can't repress that level of of like it's a community that was built on a sense of adventure and innovation and wanting to um [ __ ] the status quo and change the world um and you can only refresh that for for so long [Laughter] well uh jago this has been a fantastic conversation and i i just i feel a ton of resonance with what you are doing uh with sovereign with with the bankless revolution so as a steward and pioneer of the bankless revolution thank you for your contributions to the space and also for coming on and telling us all about sovereign likewise and uh if you ever want to talk about sound money and ultrasound money i'm happy to do that and in the meantime i hope all of us stay suffering thanks very much power power yeah we definitely do need to get a little bit more of a bitcoin or take on on sound money at large on on bank list is definitely a missing niche uh and so maybe we'll have you on to talk about to talk about that as well it would be my pleasure you're awesome thanks jago hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how to
