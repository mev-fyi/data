hey guys just a quick disclaimer before we get started none of the following content should be taken as investment advice and a16z investments are discussed in this podcast please see a16z.com disclosures for more important information alright let's get into the episode [Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david awesome episode today who did we have on chris dixon of a16z the leader behind a 16z's crypto fund chris dixon is an early pioneer in the world of the internet and then also the world of crypto he has seen it all and he comes into crypto using that perspective he's very much a technologically minded person it was really valuable for me to to see and hear about chris's perspective as to what is unique about the fourth cycle of crypto we talked all about chris's mental models and what he is excited about that he sees coming on the horizons in this industry ryan what were your takeaways oh i was just uh fanboying out to talk to chris because he's written a lot of great articles that i've read over the years and really shaped my mental models for how to spot the the next big thing he wrote an article called the next big thing we'll start out looking like a toy maybe you've read that or heard people reference that article it's just a great way of identifying new trends essentially and new technologies that are on the horizon that are contrarian that people uh start discounting so it was fantastic to see the world of crypto through his eyes where which we really got an opportunity to do and david we uh i don't think we completely agreed on everything i think that like our way of thinking about thinker the bankless way of thinking about things is a little bit different but what we wanted to do was was see crypto through through his eyes and i absolutely think we achieved that david we're doing something else with this episode for the first time and on an ongoing basis which is you and i are having an extra conversation after the episode the types of conversations you and i usually have but that aren't recorded that are kind of private uh and we are releasing those to premium bankless members can you uh tell us about that yeah it's been a reoccurring theme every time we finish up a podcast with a guest we would hop into discord and be like yo you want to talk about that then we would talk about it for like 20 minutes and i thought some of those conversations that were just between you and me were some of the most valuable and you know i want to make those conversations public and so that is what we are doing we are making those available to people that subscribe to the bankless program uh so if you are a bankless subscriber there is a premium feed there's also a video there's the same thing one's a video one's a podcast uh and you can get it into your podcast player if you are a bankless subscriber it's about 20 to 25 minutes after every single episode so just a little bit of bonus content for the people that subscribe to bankless so if you want access to this after the podcast conversation go to shows.banklesshq.com you'll get access to that conversation you'll get a private rss feed and a link to the youtube video all right guys really happy to make those conversations available to the people that want it let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with chris dixon but first we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn you guys we've entered a bull market now is the time to start building your crypto empire and you should do it on gemini gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange it's available in 50 countries supports more than 30 crypto assets including defy tokens like dai ave uni and yfi if love their default token support you can buy crypto safely and securely on gemini's mobile app or their exchange you know that your assets are protected with industry-leading security and they're not only protected they're also insured i've been a loyal gemini user since 2016. the winklevoss twins are the founders they've been on the podcast they believe in the bankless vision they are helping to onboard the world so get ready for the bull market open a free account in less than three minutes at gemini.com go bankless and get 15 after you trade 100 or more within the first 30 days that's gemini.com go bankless all right guys i hope you're ready to get into the podcast because that's what we're about to bring you chris dixon of a16z crypto bankless nation we have a special guest today we want to welcome chris dixon who is an investor and partner at andreessen horowitz it's a vc firm that probably needs no introduction he leads crypto investing there chris is someone who shaped my mental models for how to see the next big thing while everyone else dismisses it as a toy including crypto chris welcome to bankless how are you doing i'm great thanks for having me chris you are a seasoned vc you were early to the internet you were early to crypto now you're on andreessen horowitz crypto fund leading that on bank list we're really on a mission into the crypto frontier so we're investors yes but we're also users and builders and what we're hoping to get out of today's conversation is to get like your mental models to understand what you think crypto holds for the next decade i mean we've just kicked off this this decade um so you know where we want to start is actually at the the high level the the 20 000 foot view in crypto um what is going on here like what is crypto what's happening here yeah so i mean the way i kind of look at the like so okay so let's step really far back what you know why when you go and you and you look at a movie from the 1990s um does does does a lot of things look the same if you go back and look at the tvs and movies from 1990s like the cars look the same and the appliances look the same and the washing machines look the same but what's very very different are computers right over the last 50 years we've had a very rapid acceleration of better and better computers better and better connectivity more and more apps to me the most important question when analyzing the sort of past and future of technology is to is to dig deeply into um you know what are computers um how do they how does each computing cycle develop um what are the ingredients that that that go into that development um i see crypto blockchain very much as a new cycle of computing that fits into that history so that history is you know mainframe computers in the 50s and 60s pcs in the 70s and 80s internet in the 90s and 2000s mobile phones 2000 2010 now i think we're you know on the cusp of a whole bunch of exciting things there's stuff going on in ai and machine learning there's stuff happening in virtual reality and augmented reality self-driving cars etc but to me the most important at least what i'm most passionate about and i think will be one of the most impactful areas of kind of new computing is um is is around you know what you might call blockchain computers right and this can be anything from an application specific blockchain computer like bitcoin right so bitcoin is a computer that has a specific application i.e you know sort of global censorship resistance store of value um baked into it and it's a very important obviously innovation in and of itself and then you have things like ethereum which are uh more generalized platf general purpose platforms that'll let you you know fully program on them and then you have a whole bunch of other kind of interesting things getting layered on top um and i think of it now just sort of drilling into it i think one of the interesting things you can ask is when you sort of try to analyze what has happened and what will happen is where are we in the evolution of the cycle and i think we you know are i have i've written a lot of blog posts and things about this if folks are interested but i think most of these kind of computing cycles go through multiple phases the first one i call the kind of gestation phase the second one the second one is the deployment phase like you know i think a really interesting question and we can talk about this later is that where are we in that cycle what are the other key innovations that have to happen one of the really important things that happens and i think we're starting to see it now in any of these kinds of computing cycles is you get a reinforcing feedback loop between infrastructure and applications so you know as the the the first iphone started off um with relatively few applications and and kind of weak infrastructure in terms of its cellular connectivity uh you know kind of weak camera things like this then as you know as some applications became popular like instagram and snapchat that in turn created an economic incentive for apple to go and invest and make better cameras and so you had this sort of nice kind of ladder effect reinforcing feedback loop where the applications got better and the and the infrastructure got better i think we're kind of starting to hit that in uh in crypto right now anyways that's that's a lot right there to start with but uh you know happy to happy to dive into any area yeah so we want to get back to cycles because you've written a lot about this and uh i think everyone's wondering like okay we're 10 years into this where are we in the cycle but before we do let's talk a bit about what's unique about these uh the this next era of computing right so you took us through the progression we had mainframes pcs mobile internet right and each of these computer uh paradigms eras had special things you know pcs brought compute to your home uh the internet networked all of these computers together so we could like you know communicate across the world what is special about these new computers that we call blockchain or crypto economic computers yeah it's a great question and i think this one something is this is one of the reasons people are so thrown off by this so a lot of the people at you know at let's say a company like google who are very who who rode the last two computing waves right and who very intimately understand the transition from for let's say desktop to mobile computing um a lot of those same people don't really fully grok blockchain computers in fact a lot of them are actually hostile towards it and i believe the reason for that is blockchains are they they in some ways they fit the pattern in that they're you know they a new type of computer that has new capabilities uh new sets of trade-offs etc but the the dimensions along which blockchains offer new capabilities are different than what we're used to right so in the past what we're used to is computers getting smaller more mobile higher performance more connected blockchains i i the way i like to describe it is they are computers that can do a new thing that can never be done before and that specifically is they can make commitments um that and commitments that um cannot be overridden by the owners of the blockchain which of course are just you know as a community and a network cannot be overwritten by the developers behind the applications um that you can trust based on the code itself that whatever those commitments are that are relevant will be honored and so specifically then they'll say let's take bitcoin right some of the commitments bitcoin makes there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins um that you cannot double spend a bitcoin um there's a whole set of things that the kind of commitments that bitcoin makes which in turn um give people confidence that bitcoins could have value right if it wasn't for like for example the scarcity limit the 21 million limit presumably people would have much less faith that bitcoin would be a good store of value right so so how do we why do we trust that commitment we don't have to trust satoshi we don't have to trust the core developers um they may all be trustworthy but it's just not really relevant right we can just simply look at the network if we're you know you have to know how to program and things but to do that but if you if you do and you can either do it yourself or you can you know pay someone to do it or whatever but you can go and look at the open source code and you can say okay i understand how this works and i trust this commitment and this is a this is a commitment um that and let's let's contrast that for example to say let's say i have chris coin or let's say google has google coin and google says you know i i will only ever have 21 million google coins well if that's you know if in the case of google coin you have to believe google will do that and they won't change management they won't change their views and et cetera et cetera and that's why there's never my knowledge been a private company that's you know successfully issued a currency right because and by the way i would add chris not only not a private company i would argue in history might might bear this out that there's never been a government a centralized government who over the long term has been able to keep their their hands away from sort of inflating the uh their their monetary system well yeah i think until i mean i think i guess yeah i think that's probably right i mean we have 50 years now that we've been unpegged from gold right i guess before we sort of did that through pegging to gold um but yeah i think that's right well and look and it's a this gets into a whole set of issues there's a lot of people that you know probably aren't crypto enthusiasts who believe that the you know that the federal reserve having the ability to kind of issue more currency as a feature not a bug you know i think a lot of the bitcoiners would say it's a bug not a future um like putting it i don't want to you know i think this this gets into these all these kinds of economic things which i i would just say that the the you know that i'd sort of sort of uh punt on i guess but uh um but i guess what i would say is that this ability to even make this kind of commitment is a brand new thing right and it has to do with it comes from the architecture of blockchains right which is blockchain's the way i kind of think about it is in a traditional computer the hardware governs the software in the sense that um you know if google has google coin and they ultimately control the servers they can just change the code on the servers and make google coin have more you know than 21 million coins or something right what what blockchains do architecturally and this is through the consensus mechanism and the kind of game theory on top of it is it inverts the power relationship between the hardware and the software right and so what what ends up sort of the consensus mechanism and the network on top the software layer governs the hardware layer um and so even if you know a bitcoin miner or an ethereum miner validator miner uh changes their mind or whatever unless they you know there are caveats here if you have 51 etc but in in the in the general case the the hardware um providers are um governed by the software and that and that is a brand new thing that never existed before and creates these and by the way let me go back to the commitments thing one of the things i think as as the space is evolving we're learning is what else can you do with a computer that can make commitments so you know one thing obviously the first application is you can create a global censorship resistance store value like bitcoin what ethereum says is hey we can generalize this and let people kind of come up developers come up with new things and those things can be anything from you know new tokens on top obviously like erc20s etc but also protocols which make commitments so you know i think it's very important that that you take a protocol like compound you know which is a lending protocol on top of ethereum it makes commitments about things like the take rate right so um you know a very long-standing tradition in technology is for somebody to build a platform and then kind of change the rules of the platform as things happen as as it becomes more and more popular right this happened very famously with facebook and twitter where they had big developer systems and they changed the rules on them and changed the take rates it's happening today with apple you know fortnite and apple are having this big battle over um over the platform rules and apple et cetera well you know one type of commitment you can make with the blockchain is you can make a commitment to developers and say um you know we're going to keep the take rate at this level we're going to make the api work like this and you will always have access to it you can always trust it you don't have to trust robert you know the founder of compound you don't have to trust the investors and you can look at the code and trust the code this is a brand new and very very important idea um so i would argue that the reason i like this framing computers and make commitments i realize it hasn't caught on yet is it is it expresses i think it will catch on over time because it expresses the the uh incredible generality of this breakthrough from what blockchains can do it's much more it's a much broader i think um and and more profound uh uh breakthrough than uh people sort of initially realize because they they we haven't fully explored all the different kinds of use cases the the new things you can do by making commitments so chris this focus on blockchains or computers that can make commitments and it speaks to the generalizability of a blockchain right and to me that and i'm slightly worried that that puts the image into a into a reader's head or listener's head of something along the lines of like blockchain not bitcoin which i know that you are not in that camp of but i'd also think that you do believe that there is extended utilities out of blockchains that aren't just something like bitcoin right so maybe you could talk about that that contrast like what what does blockchain not bitcoin mean to you and where are the real values that you can we can get out of a blockchain that you know isn't just bitcoin well i think you guys know the history of this i think that's the the the challenge here is that these terms have they're sort of overloaded and have multiple meanings the specific phrase blockchain not bitcoin in my recollection that became popular in like let's call it 2014 through 16 and it was specifically referring to mostly private blockchains um so uh you know the idea was okay bitcoin is too weird this is the uh blockchain not bitcoin kind of movement right if you will um bitcoins are too weird uh but there are certain there are uh pieces of technology we can factor out and sell to banks or something like this right um i was never a proponent of that you know you can go back and look at all the things i've written and talked about over the last seven years um i've always felt like the um value in blockchain is in the sort of public blockchains um so so you know a lot of what blockchains are today they'd be looking at something like ethereum bitcoin they're networks and networks are valuable when they're public and used by billions of people um and so to me that's always been the case um so i think there's a little ambiguity in that in that phrasing so i would call myself like i i'm a believer in um uh i think kind of like the strong pure form of blockchains um in the public sense and and i think you know look bitcoin and that that means things like ethereum as an example like we're big believers and have been for a long time and i think there'll be many more um blockchains like that um i think i i think we're kind of like at a public blockchain maximalist or something you know what one mental model actually that came from me that helped me understand this a little bit was this idea of strong versus weak technologies because this kind of this um i guess this notion of blockchain not bitcoin it's not the first time we've seen this kind of idea play out right this pattern sort of repeats almost with every technology yeah i i've seen it i've seen this many times over the years since i wrote a blog post about it people are interested called strong versus weak technologies and you know it it's there's always a tendency so so my argument essentially in that blog post is is technologies always come in pairs and and there's always sort of the the pure what i call the strong form and then they're sort of the weak form and and the reason that the they come in and so as an example um uh tesla is the pure form it's a pure electric car and then you know a hybrid car is the weak form um uh years ago like when i you know i was involved in kind of web 2 internet stuff where things like youtube were the pure form it was a new uh video platform where anyone could upload things and then the weak form was all these software providers who would build software and sell them to cbs and existing movie companies and the idea was um you know you can't go and and create a new media form you have to just sort of be a technology provider to existing media companies um the uh um uh anyways if this blog post i go through another example i use in the blog post is the the iphone so if you go back for there's a whole decade before the iphone when everyone sort of thought that mobile computers had to look a lot like desktop computers they'd have a full keyboard they have to have like a windows start button they have all these things and the iphone was really the first one to say now what happens if you go from first principles and you design the ideal uh first you know kind of mobile phone from scratch it had these obvious drawbacks like and the quote i used in the beginning it was involving steve jobs uh people were like how are you going to learn how to type on a screen et cetera and what what ends up happening though is that when you create the pure form of the technology and it's kind of um you know first principles ideal form um that at first it looks uh uh like it's going to require too much change in the world for people to adopt it but people end up adapting around it the technology is so powerful and so um important that that the world adapts around the technology as opposed to the technology adopting to the world um and i and i and so like in that and this is i'm sure we'll talk about d5 today like i think that's a d5 is a great example of it where d5 is to me is is the right way if you were if you started from first principles and said how how will you should you do finance in a world where we have ubiquitous internet access and you know blockchains like it's clear to me that defy is the way you would do it and that that all of the sort of legacy infrastructure would would kind of look like a ridiculously bad design um it may take a long time for that to you know that whole vision to be fully realized but my experience has always been that the the strong form wins out but then what happens is people people see the strong form they realize oh that's great but is there kind of a hack kind of hybrid version that we can that will get adopted sooner and so you see these things come in pairs and i guess the point of that blog post is i always believe in the strong form it may take longer but in the end that's the right architecture and will be better for the world and people will adapt around it for bankless listeners another term we use uh to describe these things is like like crypto native right what you're talking about is like the native version of these things we talk about that all the time internally like in to us the the opposite of crypto native is skeuomorphic right which is sort of taking uh this is the thing where you you know you take a uh you make the you know the early light bulbs they they shape them like candles right so like you'll feel like more familiar with them but in fact that's not the optimal shape for a light bulb um and this is what hap you know with early internet people people didn't know how to really use this new software-based two-way medium and so they kind of made it like magazines right so the first 10 years of the internet were all just sort of people taking non-internet ideas and putting them on the internet and it wasn't until the next wave that um people start to realize that there's sort of these internet native things like you know like social networking and youtube you know i my understanding is early early films you know around the like 1900s uh or late 19th century were um you know they filmed them just like plays because they didn't know you know it's like that's what they had they had plays they put a camera and they did a play and eventually they figure hey you have a close-up you can do this you can do that so um the skeuomorphic stuff is always appealing at first because it feels more familiar and sometimes it's a good kind of marketing thing i mean like steve jobs always you know loves skeuomorphic design because it made people more you know like the the book the book app would have like a wood grain bookshelf look to it or something like this and this is sort of a way to onboard people and get them more familiar with technology and then eventually you kind of kick away the latter and let them go into the real thing um but for sure yeah crypto native's a very important concept to me as well to us and our investing philosophy on the bangladesh program ryan really likes this metaphor where if you're playing if people who are familiar with the civilization game where you are unlocking this this tech tree uh the way that you seem to be describing this is human humanity has unlocked the ability to create computers that make commitments but to me that seems like a means to an end to achieve other goals so with and as the the lead behind the a16z crypto fund it seems to be that you guys would be going after the the whatever the the end is so what is the end what is the thing that humans can unlock now that we have computers that make commitments what are these new technologies that we're going to be able to receive as a result of this innovation well so one mental model i have is kind of concentric circles um and so i kind of think of it at the center you have bitcoin right and that's its own important innovation and we could you know you could spend an hour obviously you could spend 100 hours talking about that alone um i assume people have you know your listeners already are familiar with it um so i sort of see that at the center um and by the way i'll talk about something but okay let me just finish this and so bitcoins are the center then around that i see kind of ethereum and d5 um and and uh you know and that allows you to do all the things i think your listeners are familiar with like lending and amms and just like all these kind of new really cool things um i think that the next circle you know hasn't really arrived yet but will and that could be you know i think there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff around nfts uh gaming video games uh which i think relates to nfts in a lot of cases um there's what we call web3 which is sort of uh things that products that are more familiar from the web 2 era like social networks and marketplaces but architected in a new way where they're owned and operated by the community as being as opposed to being owned and operated by um you know a company um and so i think of it as kind of concentric circles of different things and i'm happy to talk about each of them but i think each is very profound this is one of the reasons blockchains are so profound i think each alone would be a massive innovation bitcoin would be d5 would be what three would be you know nfts would be um you know by the way there's probably five more circles i haven't thought of and maybe a bunch of people haven't thought of so you know i think we're pretty early my experience with these new computing waves like i was pretty early in mobile and investing in things um was that you know i i got some of the things right but there were a whole bunch of things people thought of that that you know no one i knew had thought of at the time so so chris i want to ask about that like so these circles that that you're talking about and this whole thing that we call crypto or or blockchain how big is this like how big is this going to get right like it's very hard to to to estimate some people end up like underestimating and some others you know end up overestimating it but you've seen some eras of compute sort of play themselves out what's your sense of how big this thing is well if you believe the i mean so i you know like i mean i'll speak personally i you know i was working in traditional venture capital and i'm still part of andreessen horowitz but i you know i i switched my and focused my entire career on on our crypto fund so you know i mean i just think that speaks for itself but but um you know i i certainly am a big believer i think that um look a couple things i'll say like one caveat is it's really i found that it's very very hard in technology to estimate kind of market sizes um and historically frankly i think most me and most of my partners at industrial herbs have have underestimated the sizes of them um so you know that big caveat and by the way the other big caveat is timing these things you know sometimes they can take much longer than people hoped i you know i a cautionary lesson for me is i i was very excited about machine learning for a long time i started a machine learning company i used to be an entrepreneur in 2008 and sold in 2011 and thought you know it was never going to happen and then machine learning obviously happened in a big way like starting in 2013. so the timing of things is very hard um you know i like i think the strong form of blockchain is ever is not only not only is does it allow technology to deeply penetrate industries that have thus far been recalcitrant to technology like finance so that like number one is it can start to enter new areas number two is it can dramatically expand market sizes so that now anyone with a smartphone which is i don't know something like four billion people has sort of democratic and equal access to basic financial services an example funding you know all sorts of other interesting you know new monetization models like nfts things like this so so there's that i think you can see i could see a world where it's crypto is not a is not a part of a venture firm it is the entire venture firm in the sense that this is just a new way to build startups it's a new and better way to build startups um is to build build mass protocols where they're owned and operated by a community i think it will look i think there will be deep skepticism 20 years from now to use a social network that's owned by a company um in the same way that you know i wouldn't want to use email or web browsing that's owned by a company i'm very happy that those are open protocols um and um i you know i think we for a variety of reasons like the internet took a kind of took a wrong turn maybe 10 years ago and allowed what should be very core protocols to be built in this centralized way and i think by the way we're now starting to see a lot of the issues with that there's a lot of people very unhappy with those experiences developers unhappy they're usually unhappy there's a whole bunch of kind of second order consequences as a result um so i think the strong form is this is just simply a new way to build tech startups and it's a much better way to build them and it's much better way to govern them chris do you think this is do you think this is what you're you're talking about many in silicon valley have sort of missed it right so like many engineers and in web 2 tech companies like google and such it's my impression that a lot of vcs quite frankly have missed this too uh not yourself of course in in not uh a16z in what you're doing you guys have a crypto fund but like many vcs have been slower to latch on to the ability of of maybe uh human beings to create like a digital store of value like the concept of of bitcoin even has been sort of uh i would say slower uh in in kind of silicon valley circles than uh possibly in other circles and do you think the reason for this is that this is all happening at a deeper level like you have to start questioning like okay what what's the what's the denomination of money right like this is this is not fintech fintech takes the banking system uh the existing banking system and creates like a digital layer on top of it this is like oh we're getting to the core the deepest layer here and we're talking about replacing the underlying banking protocols wow do you think that throws people off well yeah so i think i guess i would say in silicon valley i think the bitcoin narrative is pretty widespread at this point like it wasn't five years ago but now i'd say it's generally accepted um i i am surprised how few people in technology even know what defy is um i know very few people that have dug into it and don't think like everyone i know who's dug into it it thinks it's amazing basically but a lot of people just simply haven't dug into it for whatever reason like i think it's a bunch of reasons why by the way like a whole bunch of the rest of the technology world is doing very well right now as an example there's a ton of interesting stuff happening like like i don't want to dismiss that there's a ton of interesting stuff happening in you know in kind of traditional infrastructure um meaning like you know business software sas software you know at the firm we have a bunch of interesting investments and because i hope there's just a bunch of exciting stuff happening generally in technology so that's part of it i think part of it is just you know it's it's kind of you as you know it's a rabbit hole like if you don't go down the rabbit hole and fully understand it um and and really like i think for example the idea that that you know uniswap compound etc are fully autonomous um protocols that where the code itself um you know contains money and makes decisions and it's really you know it's not like aws and just running this you know just sort of a company running it that concept i think it's just a very different concept and until you like really kind of get into it and experience it um and really sort of deeply understand it it's just it's just kind of hard to grok i don't know so but i think it's just a matter of time um the same way with bitcoin right it just took time um and and i think you know over time people will dig into i think you know it's probably going to be this kind of stage thing where you first dig into bitcoin and then you sort of dig into ethereum and then you start going down to the next rabbit hole so let let's keep going down the rabbit hole then so we started with like the the 20 000 foot view and kind of your mental model for the space and this the idea that we now have unlocked humanity has unlocked the ability uh for computers that make commitments and this unlocks a a whole bunch of other things um let's get into like maybe the 5 000 foot level of actually investing in this space like why investing in crypto is different i thought it was interesting that uh a16z like two years ago right i believe it's two years ago maybe a bit long over that you guys decided to start a dedicated crypto fund right and so you started your first one that's 300 million congrats and the second one for our listeners that's 515 million this year so two funds in this space but what struck me is this is not in kind of the the consumer side of things right um you have it fun for consumers uh for consumer sort of applications and startups and it's not even in the fintech side it's its own thing why is crypto investing its own thing it's a great question i mean part of it's structural and so um i don't want to maybe if i go too deep in the weeds it's kind of boring for the listeners but the the short answer is uh in order to own so i i believe that the best way to have exposure to crypto is to own tokens and coins not equity um and in order to do to have a fund that does that just from a regulatory compliance point of view you have to be what's called an ria not an era and this has to do with kind of arcane laws in part of dodd-frank um you know there's this set of laws that governs uh investment firms um and so when we started the crypto fund uh you know we we knew it had to be an ria and we didn't want to make the whole firm riaa because it has a sort of additional compliance overhead things like that so we start off like that like fast forward we ended up making the whole firm in ria there's a whole bunch of other differences though besides the regulatory side there's there's um a whole bunch of like in terms of the logistics there's auditing custody um uh there's um you know governance staking validating just like you know we have a whole data science operation it's kind of different than traditional venture um there's also just the type of analysis we do you know like a lot of it will be kind of like traditional venture in the sense that you you know bet on teams and products and breakthrough technologies but then there's also this whole thing of analyzing the kind of token mechanics right um and that's different um there's the t you know over time i've learned i just wouldn't have been my reason in the beginning but now it is is that the the team recruiting people um you know i think the if you you know if you have the if your listeners uh have the chance to talk to some of my colleagues on the crypto team they'll find that everyone on the team is a real true believers um and we really look for that and we want people that that that want to be bought in and frankly like the economic incentives that we offer them are you know profit sharing in the crypto fund and they really want that um and so that's important too so i'd say it's a bunch of things regulatory logistic and then kind of i don't know incentive alignment i guess um uh yeah and you know but i do think the interesting question is if we're right about being bullish about this category long term will it kind of re-intersect into what is now kind of you know well that was my question like the the the question of if if if we're right and this is uh software like eating the world right now software eating finance then almost all of the other funds within a16z and vc funds become crypto funds in a sense right yeah because like yeah it's like like closer to some some of the stuff might be closer than we think like fintech if you take what's called people we call fintech which is not crypto so we have a separate in our main fund our non-crypto fund we have a fintech practice so we have three uh partners there who do fintech and that's stuff like affirm transferwise you know there's a whole bunch of really interesting companies in there that are kind of you know they're apps you can download that that kind of provide better experiences than existing banks um i think that we're you know i don't know if we're that far away from those protocols for example integrating with you know d5 protocols so you could imagine a fintech a lot of these fintech companies need capital need to borrow capital to do what they you know whatever they're doing like you look at a firm or something they're lending money out but they have to in themselves go go borrow money to do that um and today many of them go to wall street and other places to get that capital you could imagine i think relatively near future going to a blockchain to get that capital chris you know we we call this as uh the d5 mullet it's fintech in the front and d5 in the back i like that yeah no it's good i think the um um and so that like i guess what i'm saying there is that they could they could play very nicely together the fintech companies are very good at user experience building world-class applications you know client-side applications right all that kind of stuff that frankly the crypta side is not as good at right now like those two could the peanut butter and jelly could fit together very nicely there hey guys there's so much left in the second half of this interview we asked chris about the themes behind a16z's second crypto fund the crypto fund that chris is leading right now then we get into a very interesting conversation about the cycles of cryptocurrency and how the fact that in contrast to other emerging industries like ai or vr the fact that there are price charts to go with this industry really changes how this industry behaves and then we also talk about the web 3 technology that might be ready to finally solve society's growing demand to become independent from these web 2 gargantuans is the technology ready what is chris looking at there's so much left in this interview don't go anywhere but we have to take a moment and pause to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store chris let's talk about the incoming fund that is coming into a16z what what main categories are you guys focused on with this fund oh so yeah so we i think you're referring so we're now on our second crypto fund which we started investing out of a few months ago yes so we fully invested the first one um i guess up till i don't know the summer or something and yeah we're investing a new one yeah so i think that like i think so you said what categories yeah what are the theme what are the themes that you guys are going after what are the various theses that you guys have your fund based out of yeah so i'd say like i i'll i'll tell you and we do have theories but i will also say that i've learned maybe the hard way in venture capital that you have to uh be prepared to throw your theory out the window and if you need a great great entrepreneur with a great idea right so we we obviously as kind of you know people excited about the space develop theories and themes and things like this but fundamentally i think of first principles venture capital is investing in great people you know and great ambitious people with you know who want to change the world through technology right and if we meet someone like that and if they don't fit into a theory of we have then so be it you know and we'll we'll bet on the person over the theory by the way on that real quick what what if you don't know who they are pseudo anonymous uh it's an interesting question we've uh i i mean i think we i think if it if they'd written the code and we could look at the code you know like as you guys know all these things happening within d5 like um you know the sushi swaps and all that kind of stuff like the pseudonym cinema stuff i think we'd be open to that you know um i think in that case we would be buying tokens right so that would mitigate the risk of uh but we can do that we have a structure now this took us a long time to get to it but we have the structure now we can just go buy the tokens on exchange or otc and i i guess the fund provides you that flexibility which is which is cool but but and like obviously bitcoin is pseudonymous so you know as long as we can see the i think you know it'd be a little bit different in staging it'd probably be post launch as opposed to right right right but but but go on we're talking about sort of the the general areas okay so i mean look i think you know so it's concentric sir going back to the second concentric circles like you know we continue to believe in bitcoin we continue to believe very much in you know ethereum uh i think that uh ethereum scaling is going to be super interesting as you know i i i alluded earlier to this uh what happens when you so if you if you look at every um kind of the the metrics behind different computing adoptions so pcs in the 80s and mobile um you know from 2008 on or so they they start off kind of linear and then they hit this exponential growth um and why do they have the exponential growth um part of it is things like moore's law you hear a lot about that you know you can pack more transistors on a semiconductor um but i think the really the core dynamic is you get you enter this point kind of you enter the tunnel at some point and the tunnel is there's a feedback loop where the applications get better and that and and demand for the applications goes up and that in turn drives investment in the infrastructure and as you build better infrastructure that in turn uh makes more applications possible and i think that we're i i believe we're entering that tunnel now in the in the kind of ethereum d5 space um so you know as you know uh you know summer of defy and all the other kind of activity since drove up gas prices which in turn really kind of accelerated the need for things like layer 2 e2 like all these kinds of scaling and also by the way other you know sort of quote competitors to ethereum or complementary chains et cetera i it it so i think that will be a super interesting area for the next two years it's like finally um finally getting work workable production release mainnet um uh you know real scaling solutions that that can be used by end users right like and and and just all that will get accelerated because because because we need it now right we didn't really need it two years ago in the same way all right we talked about store value as a category we've talked about l2s as a category specifically for this uh this second crypto fund from a16z uh i said scaling i think there's three three three aspects to it there's uh ethereum itself which you know i'm excited about e2 and all the progress there there's layer two like optimistic roll-ups i'm very excited about and then there's uh other blockchains and i and i don't think of them and people often call them like you know um competitive killers or competitors i think there's a very plausible future where you multiple blockchains are interoperating and and providing different purposes so as an example i think it's plausible that you would have a different blockchain for video games for things that where and the reason you might have a different blockchain for that is it's a different set of trade-offs where you you value performance more but maybe trust less maybe for a video game blockchain you don't need uh to know you know to have sort of nation state censorship resistance but you do want to make sure that the take rate is is committed to and won't change so the developers feel confident building on it but then maybe you want a way to reconcile so that a user can take their nfts and use them on a gaming blockchain um and you know trade them etc but maybe then they want to sort of put them back on ethereum in order to use them in a defy context as an example like to me that's the kind of big dream you know you have eth with sharding you have uh you know roll-ups on top of it and you have other blockchains for other purposes and they all kind of interoperate um and so when i say scaling i mean in that very broad sense so we had a conversation not too long ago with one of the folks at um a vc firm called uh paradigm uh charlie noyes we're just talking about this idea right that um uh the the idea that because these crypto systems these blockchains require economic security the value of the underlying token matters a lot because that impacts the ability of like that impacts the amount of assets essentially that that they can host right so bitcoin is harder to attack because it's more valuable as uh ether becomes more valuable in the future it becomes harder to attack it can host more value it can be more like a global settlement layer therefore all of these blockchains that are trying to compete in the you know circle let's broaden it from store value like the money circle or the d5 circle right if you're kind of combining those those ideas together the underlying asset of those chains is competing as a monetary asset call it store value call it a reserve asset something else what do you think of this idea because this would kind of imply as well possible category winners because there's obvious network effects there do you think that ether has to be a money in order to be a d5 chain do you think other blockchains are competing with ether as a money so i ca it's very interesting i think there's a bunch of ideas in there um one is this idea that you do need a certain minimum value of ether right and of the sort of of you know to to guarantee the security the network i would argue that security that sort of trust in the network is a function of multiple things one is the price because the price is important because you can you can very precisely reason based on the price about the um about the you know how much it costs to attack the network right and the higher the price the higher it is to attack it and therefore the more secure it is um i think there's also just kind of a general lindy effect with blockchains meaning the longer they've been around the more likely they will be continue to be around but kind of a twist on it would be sort of the longer they've been around and not hacked at layer one the more you can trust them right um bitcoin and ethereum have never been hacked at layer one and and you know bitcoin is you know ten plus years a theorem five plus years like that that's a very important fact and you could you could create a new ethereum today and if you don't have that five-year history you're just not going to trust it as much right so i think the price matters for trust i think the i think the community and just sort of the optics around the community you know like how uh you know i won't say negative things about their but we know we all know of other blockchains but it's just sort of bad optics which then created kind of a negative community and a community that wasn't as trustworthy so i think there's a lot of interesting things that go into the trust i'd say it's the value i think it's the lindy how long they've been around and not hacked i think it's the quality of the community but those are all really important things which are which are new to blockchains right you didn't have that kind of that didn't matter with iphones um that you trusted right i mean you i mean it matters but you know it's a different type of trust um so now i think there's a separate question you're asking which is does ether have to have a monetary premium is that maybe another question i'm happy to ask it it's yeah it's and it's kind of rolled up into that because right it would like if if we're thinking that the the largest uh total addressable market size is something you said earlier is probably a store of value some multi-trillion dollar reserve asset for the world right like a bitcoin could become uh or an ether possibly could become that's you know part of the bankless thesis anyway then like the the blockchain that has an asset at its base that has that monetary premium uh should have an advantage in having the the highest security right and so is that an important factor are our blockchains also competing along that dimension they're all trying to compete their asset or trying to compete for a monetary premium and if they're not a monetary premium right if if the question of how do you value a token how do you value ether right you know uh maybe it's just like a capital asset it's discounted cash flows at the at the end of the day right uh or or maybe it is that plus it has a monetary premium some reserve type functionality just curious how you think all these blockchain assets are competing i think so i've heard this argument before that that that the only things like i know people that have crypto funds and they only invest in things that they think will have monetary premium um and i and it's it's a fairly common thesis out there i you know i i i think that it i okay i i think that um you know ethereum could fulfill its vision and be kind of a global uh you know kind of computing fabric settlement layer incentive layer um you know ether could be valuable enough to secure the network um and it not and i think it could do all that without having a monetary premium so i don't think it's necessary um i don't know that's my i mean i just think the opportunity to be kind of this technology fabric that every um you know that once you know we now have eight billion billion people using the internet and you know or you know some whatever seven six seven billion and we'll have an order magnitude more devices connected to the internet and if all of those things kind of interoperate or incentivize through ethereum like i just think the opportunity is so big on its own um and and the way you value in that case is supply and demand and just that it's it's this computer you want access to and there's a limited number of ether and you need to have ether to access it and so um you know i i don't know where it nets out but it seems to me like a very big opportunity from a venture perspective um so i guess i just yeah i don't i i i don't think uh i guess like like i'd say this is another just sort of general philosophical difference in the space you have people that kind of come at it from an economics point of view and they think about these concepts like monetary approval then you have people that come at it from a technology point of view i'm very much on the ladder and maybe a blind spot frankly i don't know like i could be wrong but i look at the lens everything through the lens of the internet and i see i see crypto and you know what ethereum is doing and what a bunch of other kind of protocols around ethereum are doing as as as uh the internet finally realizing it's it's kind of full um potential um and i see this is dramatically uh increasing the scale and scope of the internet and i don't know i don't need to add in a monetary story i guess to feel like it's already a gigantic opportunity well chris that is why we brought you on we want to understand how you see crypto your lens and can we talk about d5 for a minute one thing though the caveat like i very much would be that i you know like i admittedly look at the world through like an internet lens and through a technology lens and i may have very well have blind spots on this other stuff and so i will you know and i'm sure that yeah look it's one of the great things about investing and about entrepreneurship and about technology is you can have a bunch of people different views and and you know and that lets you kind of build an interesting diverse ecosystem right so so in your lens of the world chris what is going on with with defy you know how's this part of the internet story like it seemed to have exploded over the last uh you know two years it's been around probably longer uh arguably and we would probably say this bitcoin was an early instance of of d5 but really with ethereum you have these only these kind of money legos these composable protocols all on one network what is happening with d5 how do you look at that category yeah it's been very exciting i mean you know part of it for me is just the excitement level is like how you know it's gotten to the point where i can't even even if i spent full time on it i don't think i could follow all the all the developments um yeah another feeling that's to me always a great thing right as you're sort of just like fire hose of interesting stuff and just like very creative things going on um and there's just a whole bunch of lessons i'd like i think there's i think actually i would argue you can look at d5 from two different lenses okay i'm full of frameworks here but uh the product kind of lens of like okay compound is a lending platform you know um uniswap is an amm and you can look at as a product you can also look at it as a new way to build a startup okay and that way is that that the you know the the owner the startup is owned by the community like i think the uniswap retroactive airdrop is a very fascinating thing right um imagine if you know uber you know uber launched i think in 2010 imagine if in whatever three or four years post launch they retroactively gave out 15 of their cap table to the drivers of uber like that would have been a momentous thing a momentous kind of way to you know share the the growth of the network with the user base right like that just happened with uniform that's fascinating to me the those you know the the new governance kind of models which i think you know kind of compound i think was the first one to to really kind of implement that that full fully baked um i guess maker really was maybe the first um but we now have like a real model for how to do governance um and how to do token distributions and how to do kind of the whole thing right on the back end i think that's very important because i think you could take kind of let's say what compound is doing on the governance and ownership side and you could really kind of like cut and paste it and make a social network with that same governance structure as an example um so there's so there's many many interesting things happening here on the product side i think that i think the composability that you alluded to is um probably the most exciting thing there's a period uh this is ancient history probably to your listeners who are younger um it was in like 2003 to eight and if you go back and read like all these blog posts i wrote some fred wilson people like that we used to blog about one of the big things everyone was excited in that era of web 2 was essentially what we now call composability which was the idea that everything would have an api and you they called them mashups back then if you google mashups it's funny um mashup there were all these like you know their startups mashery and vet their head you know venture funds with with mashup thesis and things like this and the idea is you could take these things and recombine them and everyone was super excited about it unfortunately that that didn't really happen why uh par a lot of it's a business model right um uh uh you know instagram twitter you know they famously you can't embed at one point you can embed in instagram photos and twitter and they they disabled it uh why because their business model is ad based and there's all these incentives to keep keep people in the silo and not to let them kind of you know um uh kind of cross populate and so a lot of it's i think the the ad based model which i just think was a kind of uh just a wrong turn on the internet an unfortunate turn and i think created all these kind of weird perverse incentives um so anyways there was all this excitement about it and then it kind of fizzled uh because the business we don't really have apis anymore we have apis like stripe and twilio which are paid for by businesses we don't really have consumer apis you can't just kind of go you know google maps you know for a long time was free and they changed it to charge a lot that's what's happened too people have gotten developers have had so many experiences now where the apis the you know the either like function calls were removed or prices raised or whatever they've just so many instances of this that it just you don't build startups like that anymore and it's really a shame because that means everyone's out there just building their own silo right um there is sort of composability on the code side right i mean github open source one of the it's one of the really kind of i think under remarked on things in in the history of tech is how successful open source has been you know the vast majority of software in the world is open source including you know almost all your software on your android phone a lot of your software on your iphone and almost all server-side software these days is open source that's an incredible story um you know this idea that that you know people get together on the internet and create software for free and that would become the dominant model well i've heard you talk about the the importance of public goods as well right like you're you're a vc and you care a lot about private uh capitalism that sort of thing but there is some value in public goods oh very much i would i would liken it to a city okay so if you read like i'd recommend if you haven't read like jane jacobs is you know brilliant uh kind of anthropologist of cities um and she she has this great book where she has a chapter of a book where she analyzes a city block um and what makes a healthy block versus an unhealthy block and and the key part of the healthy block is you have this you have this interplay between the public and private right you have the streets and the sidewalks which are public and that creates foot traffic and that foot traffic sort of there's a network effect with foot traffic if you see a street with foot traffic you feel safer walking on it um tourists go there that in turn enables private businesses you know the tourists are there now you can have a whatever you know a gift shop or something right and that gift shop in turn you know make someone want to put a restaurant there and that restaurant in turn makes somebody upstairs want to put a you know gives them the economic incentive to put a put put housing up there or something right and so there's this very important interplay between the public and private and the public enables the private right what we have now in the in the web 2 world is we have these five big silos like gaff you know google apple facebook amazon and they're like disneyland or something it's where one company can pull the whole thing right it's like the difference between you know paris and and and disneyland or you know a theme park right because theme parks are fine but the problem with theme parks is there's no there's no bottoms up organic growth right it's all top down planning it's a it's a little like you know like kind of central planned city and that's why they're kind of lifeless and frankly limited in what they can do because you know you just can't live there the way that one central actor is going to compete with the whole world um kind of going out and doing creative stuff in the way that great cities are right and so the first year of the web was like new york city it was like paris right the second year the web was like in some ways was better because we had broadband and mobile phones and all these other things and those made it better but in terms of the model it was very limiting so yeah this is not i don't believe in like open source and crypto because you know i i mean i do think they'll create a better world but it's not just because of that i think that will enable capitalist innovation on top and i think you know the two combined in the same way that a great city if you combine those two you know can have a great experience for everybody i think the same applies to the internet right so yeah there's not it's not just sort of like a socialist kumbaya but this is what's so refreshing when you say about the stage we're in in crypto is that like that works like bitcoin networks like ethereum they are public goods like anyone it's permissionless it's it's closer to tcpip than to facebook i mean look the fact that these as you said this you know pseudonymia some random person on twitter i'm sure a lot of these are like teenagers in like a you know and like maybe the developing world or wherever they might be like and they are on a level playing field with you know someone like me sitting in silicon valley that's i think that's a great thing for the world it's it's more meritocratic and i think it will create much much more innovation i mean a lot you know so much of the history of you know the wright brothers were of history of innovation is is a people on the fringes right it's the wright brothers where they literally had a bicycle repair shop i mean we i think we all learned that at school but when you actually go read the history of it like all of the experts said that air travel was flight was impossible and you literally had to have you know bike repair people in dayton ohio who actually went and did it and their crew of you know you know whatever early trains and early telegraphs and just you go through the history of innovation it's always somebody on the fringes and so if we expand the fringes right if we make the whole world the fringe we're going to have way more innovation um so i you know i i think it's it's for sure and i i don't think you know i think i think of it as sort of ethereum is doing for ethereum bitcoin and all the other crypto protocols are doing for services kind of what open source did for software right so like like what another way to look at the history of crack is um software got commoditized it became open source right and as a result all of the software companies moved up the stack to services so like microsoft today would call themselves a services company not a software company right um and now but and so what but what they did is they went up to the services layer and then they and then they kind of replayed the old kind of lock-in game they used to play with software and they figured out how to lock people into these services through the data and other kinds of things and so now what we're doing in crypto is we're doing to services what open source did the software and we're going to go and we're going to create open protocols that replace those services and but then in turn allows another layer of innovation to happen on top of it um which you know which much of which will be capitalist you know and private goods in addition to public frequent theme that we discuss on the bankless program is how the people of the world and and maybe especially the united states are in my in my opinion in our opinion is are really ready for a a grand perspective shift there seems to be really shifting undercurrents that people really want something new and something different and they feel locked into their current lifestyle and i think the big web 2 gargantuans like facebook twitter amazon etc are really part of the culprits about that and we also see some of that um playing out with how congress summoned some of these these big leaders mark zuckerberg you know jeff bezos to congress to answer for their sins of being a massive monopoly that is really constraining upon the people of the united states and you know the world the world at large and you've alluded to this a little bit in this podcast so far and as well as your your previous content where you think that there is room in in this defy or crypto or or computers that make commitments world to start to offer alternatives to that sort of technological stack where you know we are we don't have to be locked into this disneyland because yeah as fun as disneyland is if you make me live inside of it every single day it's not going to feel like a paradise it's going to feel like a hell you don't want to live in disney david i don't want to live in disneyland no that's too much too much disneyland so chris from your perspective what can we build with these new tools these computers that make commitments that can help supplant some of these web 2 gargantuans that are starting to have dictatorship over our lives yeah so i think that i think for example social networking is something that could very easily i mean we already have two giant social networks that are open which is the web and email right email is an open protocol social network that's what it is right um and you know there's no reason why we can't extend that model to other types of social networking um i now that we have blockchains i think you could have done it without blockchains um there's a whole bunch of reasons why you had nowhere to so pre pre blockchains with open protocols you had nowhere to keep state you had nowhere to save data right on the web one the only place you could actually kind of save data was dns so dns is effectively a database it's a mapping of names to ip addresses that was it um i was there for this like 2007-8 with rss people were trying to create versions of rss that where you could have like a name i could be c dixon rss i could have a follow graph but there was no literally nowhere to store that there was no public state right in the first year of the internet now we have public state that's a massive breakthrough architectural breakthrough which means we can now create you know rss with you know follow graphs and with our all sorts of other extensions to open protocols unfortunately there's a cultural gap right now i think between the open protocol kind of web 2 people like the rss people and the crypto people and just they just haven't kind of we haven't put those two camps together in the right way yet but i think that will happen um and so you know look i think a world where you know like not everybody should have access to social networks if you're you know espousing you know hate speech and violence and other things you should not be on those platforms that said should that decision be made by an opaque product management group at a private company or should it be made through some more democratic process right i would argue the latter these are very very important networks i mean the internet essentially the killer app of the internet is is networks on top of the internet social networks marketplaces etc it's really it's a network of networks and until recently we had really one we had two ways to build either the web one way which is a stateless protocol or the web two way which is a company owns everything now we have this new way to do it which is it's it's a it's a stateful protocol it's a public good with advanced capabilities that are similar to the web 2 kind of um systems um and that i think we could have we could we could have a i hope that entrepreneurs start to sort of explore this space and start to develop um you know new uh alternatives so people do have a way to choose like i would like to exit a lot of these uh incumbent systems now all that said there are things like you know the hardware side for example on the iphone and it's those are you you can't it's very hard to have an open source model kind of displace that um but this is the the web 3 circle right so i mean we talked a lot like we've seen a lot of money use cases do fairly well in in crypto right so obviously bitcoin uh ethereum and its world of of d5 protocols and even like stable coins you know supplanting payment systems that sort of thing well that might be enough that might be enough maybe web 3 is unnecessary for this to have input but you still think there could be some web 3 stuff coming out of crypto just not yet i don't see why not but you couldn't do it yet because the performance right because web like you can't so if you look at what's happened so far with d5 i mean d5 there's a reason d5 is the thing that kind of that works so far it's because it's the only thing that it's the only thing where you know if you pay a dollar a transaction it's still worth it right um you can't have a social network where you pay a dollar a transaction right so i don't think we've even run the experiment yet because we haven't had a blockchain that has the performance required for anything beyond financial applications so we are we are 1990s internet before broadband yes i mean like i'm not saying i'm 100 chance it'll work i'm just saying i don't think we've really run the experiment yet until we have a blockchain with you know sub second transaction finality uh supports you know i don't know what tens of thousands and hundreds of millions of transactions a second uh you know probably you know something that's rivals aws in terms of gas costs or you know kind of cogs i don't think we're really running an experiment yet right um but the good news is i think we'll have that soon and i think it's partly driven by things like defy and bitcoin and all these other things that are happening right like it's sort of this boots tracking roof trapping mechanism like it's not like we tried and we had all these credible web three things that didn't get adoption right i think the other question in people's mind right we've been we've been talking the 20 000 foot view in the in the 5 000 foot view of you know where things look in the future a question people's mind is okay chris where are we now like uh i think listeners here or people hear crypto people all the time talk about cycles we're almost like religious about these cycles right even like the bitcoiner community it's got a four-year happening cycle um but there is something to this notion of of cycles and you wrote a post about this why do crypto people always talk about cycles and like is there something to it well you know i think that an interesting question is if if other areas of technology such such as ai and mobile phones if they had tokens associated with them like if there were an a this is hypothetical but if there were an ai took the last 50 years i think you would have seen similar cycles um and if you have people in ai they all talk about the the summer of 1970s in the winter in the 80s in the summer in the 90s the same kind of talk right they just didn't have price charts to you know like to show the enthusiasm instead it was like government funding and other kinds of things but if you had price charts right i think you would have seen a similar thing by the way that go watch i think it's on itunes um the the you know it's a documentary about um was it general general magic right there yeah they were like they tried to create like essentially an iphone in 1993 right i mean so you had mobile phones in the 80s 90s these were credible venture-backed you know these were not like fringe things these were real things um so i think you would see i think this is i think what we're seeing is now it's legible right now it's you see the prices um and i think it's it's more complicated than that too because the prices actually also feed back into the reality and that's sort of what the blog post that eddie and i wrote uh if you can find it on our site website it's um it says it's the price innovation cryptocycles um and we try to dig into we'll have it linked in this show yeah so we what we try to dig into was it it is because you actually do have these prices there is a little bit of a more i'd say an amplifying effect um versus the ai and mobile kind of hypothetical cases i gave um which is the price you know draws so we we kind of argue eddie and i argue this post that the as the price goes up that draws more press attention which in turn gets more innovators and entrepreneurs interested in the space who in turn come up with new ideas who then plant the seeds and build things which then eventually kind of uh flourish and drive the next cycle right and so we we kind of argued and we did this eddie's eddie did really the bulk of the work um the sort of data analysis worked and it was a truly we didn't really you know we had this hypothesis we didn't know if the data would back it up and we feel strongly that data did back it up um that this you really can see that pattern in the data um i think one really interesting question now if we are indeed in an up price cycle right now to me the prices are less interesting what's really interesting is will this lead to a new wave of entrepreneurs entering the space i think the big thing i'm looking for is more people entering the space more talent entering the space and i i don't i haven't seen that yet this cycle i think it's too early i think we'll see it i think if things you know i think that we probably hopefully will see it over the next six to 12 months but i remember in like 2017 all of these like high quality entrepreneurs whether they were sort of existing entrepreneurs or new entrepreneurs you know were coming and coming people like us and they were saying hey i've got a brand new idea right that was how you know i remember when robert walked in the door compound we did the seed round the a round it was just a brand new idea it was like hey ethereum i don't know what it was 2016 or 17 i think it was a seed round um just like you could you know ethereum's this cool new thing and you could build a lending platform and there wasn't even a word defy right um and you know he had been robert had been uh uh he had sold his prior company to postmates he was a he was a non-crypto entrepreneur entrepreneur before um and just that kind of thing like you know hey i just sold my company to uber and now i decided crypto is the future like i hope that happens the next year or two i haven't seen it yet very much this cycle maybe it's just too recent and you know whatever the world a whole bunch of stuff obviously happening in the world right now that is distracting people where are you looking chris like so you don't think this this talent will come out of the the similar places that's come out like previously like maybe maybe my mental model is wrong and maybe the maybe the future is the you know the anonymous twitter users and they're the ones we're gonna create you know if you look at hedgic and you know sushi swap whatever like all the food food tokens um you guys probably know more than i do of what the latest stuff but like maybe that's the future and i'm just using the wrong model there it is very strange where some of these projects are are like coming out of even like projects like uh ave right just you know kind of really small team like in unlikely locations synthetics team coming out of australia very diverse locations i think i think it's also you have to ask yourself like there's different types of innovation so there's kind of more application layer and deep infrastructure layer um i think if you're going to do deep infrastructure you're probably more likely to have to like have a long development cycle you might need more capital you might not be able to just kind of launch and you know get the community behind you so i you know maybe i'm wrong but i feel like there'll still be people that for some people in the space for whom the venture capital model in some way makes sense and they will continue to come to people like us and that there'll be other innovation happening kind of with these more kind of ad-hoc groups um but i think that tends to be more kind of app layer stuff as opposed to kind of deeper infrastructure stuff but but yeah very much more global um as you'd expect i think right um so let's assume chris we are entering a fourth cycle here right so we've we've gone through three in crypto i mean some some of us have uh i wasn't there for the early one um but like what is going to be unique about this fourth cycle it seems like every cycle has had something different about it right you know we talked about the second cycle a little bit 2012 to 2016 there was a little bit of an altcoin era where everyone was forking bitcoin um and there was a blockchain not bitcoin sort of this corporate uh private blockchain uh sort of initiative that they gained some i guess at least hype and then but in the midst of that the really interesting thing that actually happened that went under the radar was ethereum was born right um and like last cycle maybe the third cycle is a little bit of d5 do you have any thoughts on what's going to be birthed or what we should you know look out for in this fourth cycle uh yeah so the short answer is i'd love to tell you that i predicted the last the all the things you described i find this space very hard to predict in the in this you know specifically around kind of you know yeah it's just it's just very hard it's just it's a very uh dynamic fun and interesting right it's it's just constantly kind of surprising me um you know i do i do think the one thing i feel like i have a handle on that you can kind of predict is the tech path like i always think of it is how do we get a billion people using crypto on a daily basis all right and then work backwards what are the ingredients necessary to get there and and i feel highly confident when i do that the things along the way that you just need the necessary conditions to get to a billion people you know those are going to have to happen so like that's why i think scaling it just has to happen right and just like if that doesn't if that's not one of the outcomes of this next cycle like something went off right because can i ask you a question though so what if the notion of scaling is actually different in this space right so i've i've almost come out like you know i i'm not a bitcoin maximalist at all but i've like i've listened to them right and i think they had an uh interesting idea that well scaling and using bitcoin is actually holding bitcoin right is is an interesting idea if you if you're talking about a store of value asset we don't necessarily need transaction scalability if all you need is sort of meme scalability and a whole bunch of people social scalability kind of concept kind of right what what if we're measuring scalability differently in this true look i'm totally bought in on the bitcoin store value side and i think bitcoin is doing the bitcoin developers are doing exactly what they should be doing for bitcoin and and i frankly was kind of wrong about that years ago like i now see their logic and i agree with them um that you know the block size the sort of general kind of putting security above all else and focusing on social scalability i think they're making the right decisions and i you know and i i think that's i think it's just i i don't know i think it's fundamentally different in other you know when you talk about video games or something i just think the design requirements are different um and you just you just you just can't you know you just need to have you know if you're going to have a billion people doing some activity you need to do it in a way that that you know on a system that can handle that um so you know maybe it's too simplistic but i think in other areas um i i totally buy that with store value and it may be true with other kind of monetary focused applications in crypto i think in other application spaces which i still believe will will be relevant here i think you you know you do need a kind of more traditional technical scaling um so i think scaling i think like i think onboarding more people i think um you know better user interfaces user experiences i think the you know making more progress on the kind of uh regulatory front getting more entrepreneurs in the space like i think these are all the things i would like to see this cycle um so we've talked about a number of different domains and and i and i've read some of your of your work chris and and you've talked about you know perhaps even social tokens and gaming tokens and nfts what do you think is going to come first like what do you think is the most assured thing like uh from from my perspective the nft world is bubbling and it seems to be very have very strong product market fit but yet it still hasn't broken through to the real world the gaming token assets seems to also be a very promising thing what do what do you think is assured to come first and foremost are you talking specifically on gaming for this fourth cycle of crypto that we think we're about to go into like of all the different categories and all the different sectors what do you think is the most assured bet to have strong product market fit for the typical user the typical end user i don't know if anything's assured i'll tell you my candidates which is i think nfts in the and i would say there's two couple different kinds of entities that there's the creator sense of like a way for creators people that are artists musicians you know video game makers to a new way to monetize right that to me is a very very important big idea because so many of those uh creators are right now locked into centralized platforms that take most of the money right and so um you know so so there's a bunch of interesting startups working on that there's the video game side um and there there's actually i'd say sort of two different approaches there's things like what the dapper crypto kitties guys are doing they have a product called nba top shop which is doing very very well where they sell collectible um nba cards um and that's i think it's i think people underestimate how well um some of these nft companies are doing right now um a lot of the data's public you can look it up but uh like really they're quite popular um the uh um so i think that's an interesting thing kind of let's call it like kind of sports and gaming collectibles i think there's another kind of angle which is taking existing games and allowing them to have um secondary markets um there's a there's a investment we have called forte which is doing this they're actually going out and partnering with games with large audiences already and letting them take letting the users take those assets and move them onto a blockchain and trade them and take them from one game to another so that's interesting i think um there's a set of things that i that we think of as payment blockchains so this is like a company we're investing called cello this is i think what facebook's project which we're also investors in dm is doing which are blockchains that take the insight that um to have a payment system you want to have both a stable currency and a and a high throughput low latency uh uh kind of core blockchain experience and they're building blockchains from scratch with those concepts so i think i think payments i think i think it goes without saying store value and d5 so i'm just not talking about like obviously those are like the core areas but i think the kind of new areas that might become in the kind of part of the of the core would be nfts for creators gaming video games payments you know from from new payment focused blockchains what else um am i forgetting any areas uh i think web3 probably too early is probably next cycle not this cycle but but maybe um um what else i think those are probably the candidates i can't it's hard for me to handicap within that um there's definitely a lot of chatter right now about nft stuff um nfps would be beautiful because i i for a long time have felt that there's this very s like almost a tragedy that's happening right now in the creative world where you know you now have the ability to write something or create a piece of music that is instantly uh you know instantly goes to literally billions of people right so in it should be a golden period for musicians podcasters you know uh creative you know artists writers um it is a golden period by the way for video game makers they are doing phenomenally well um but they're the only ones and and they're they're the only ones doing well because the only ones that have sort of a direct relationship with the users and aren't mediated through platforms um for the most part um so you know one of the reasons that like creative uh you know nfts and new ways to monetize for creative people is so exciting is i think that could finally unlock like what i think of as like kind of the true business model for for those activities where people can directly monetize in a way that's free from kind of platform take rates and interference so we'll see there's a bunch of smart people working on it um and uh and we see you know and and the early traction is impressive every cycle chris um you know regulatory plays a role uh recently vincent proposed a rule about you know withdrawing to self-custody while it's implementing some aml kyc i know you guys had a a letter about that you know um you don't need to ask about the details of of that letter or that rule necessarily but just your general thoughts is regulatory going to be a headwind or tailwind for us this cycle yeah well i think a lot of it is the what you know i i'm you know i'm hoping the new administration will be friendlier towards innovation the last one definitely was not i would call them friendly towards big business and not towards technology or small business um so you know i think a change is welcome there um the uh um yeah specifically on that issue like i'm like i'm not the expert but we have look we've invested very heavily in it so besides my partner katie hahn who's has deep kind of regulatory and government experience uh we recently hired anthony albanese who was the chief regulatory officer at the new york stock exchange and has a long and uh you know and distinguished history and kind of the both the intersection of crypto and regulatory and he's going to lead up a lot of our regulatory efforts we have other folks in that team uh jeff amico who's great and and we're going to invest more there so we're we think of it as a major area of focus and investment in terms of specifics yeah look we have we publish it all it's in the letter we think we have a lot of really strong arguments but probably i'd defer to my smarter regulatory partners excellent well chris this has been uh you know fantastic i you know i'm curious you uh you've written so much about the next big things like starting as as toys right the idea that um you know you should be looking at what smart people do on the weekends as their hobbies i'm curious what do you do on the weekends do you have any hobbies outside of crypto uh good question yeah um i read a lot i read a lot and i read um probably my main hobbies reading um besides you know seeing family and friends and things like that um and uh i read a lot and i specifically i read a lot actually lately in science fiction before that i'd say i've read a lot of history um and what are the last few good books you've read so like i just i i'm ashamed i hadn't read this before i just read the um foundation trilogy isaac asimov which was amazing mind-blowingly good and i can't believe i hadn't read it before um i read um what am i reading um um like i i kind of basically do it by author so like i had a period where i went and read all the philip k dick books and then i read a bunch of the asimov books and i'd read ray bradbury before then lately i was reading um uh robert heinlein like if you've read like starship troopers and a bunch of other things um a lot of i've read a lot of history of technology books you mentioned civilization before i i think of it a little bit that way like you know you take each each tech in the tech tree and i kind of went i spent like years on this actually and i went and kind of read about each of them and how they developed and um i spent a long time reading about i really highly recommend i don't know if you have text we could put on after this but um a series of books around like the 19th century actually um i mean if we could put links with this podcast i could include some amazing book actually just on twitter i recommend to adam draper and we have a tweet thing about it it's called the company it's it's very relevant to crypto i believe um it's the history of the limited liability corp i'll just if i have a few minutes maybe i'll finish with this if if you guys have a few minutes um so the so kind of think of it let's do it 19th century in summary is the big thing that starts that kicks it off is you know steam engine and all this other stuff and electricity but railroad boom in the night 1830s um started in uk spread to the us the big problem at the time though was limited liability corps were they only existed if you got an act of parliament you had to go to parliament and get them to declare you have a limitless you couldn't just go form one right so what you had to do is you had to form partnerships um and and the way it worked is you had unlimited liability if you were part of the partnership which means if somebody got killed on the railroad line or something you'd go to jail right and so what that meant is that all of these companies were like eight people who really knew and trusted each other they were often families right and you basically had an era of just partnerships and what happened is all of these cities every time two cities would connect a railroad their economies would like the gdp would like you know go up 10x right so every every pair of cities wanted a railroad and so they'd all go to parliament and eventually parliament there was a line around the block to get a llc why did they want an llc they want an llc so they could go and they could they could aggregate capital right so you can go to other people who don't know you that well and you can say to them hey you may lose your money but you're not going to go to jail right limited liability this content but it was a very controversial concept it took fast forward it took 30 years or something for them for people to finally allow this to be like a standardized thing because people thought oh limited liability there's all these what's happening today with crypto it was like literally like newspaper articles about how like oh this would this would you know lead to the end of the world and criminals and all this you know the usual kind of things they say about new technologies um it turns out though if you if you if you you know by having that by allowing for limited liability corpse um you you then allowed for the aggregation of capital and the creation of stock markets right because if you know if you look today like if i give stock to apple i don't take i can lose my money but i don't go to jail if the iphone blows up or something right and so i guess what was interesting about that book to me was you know i knew the railroad was a big deal the telegraph was a big deal you know all of edison's inventions a light bulb like there's a whole bunch of exciting stuff that happened in 19th century but i think you could really argue that the limited liability corp was one of the major tech conventions well that that is such a hidden gem because there's a lens on this whole crypto space especially what's happening in d5 that this is just a disruption of the way we coordinate capital i think that's right i think it very well could be that that's what i was trying to get at before maybe i didn't fully explain it but like this idea that d5 there's really two sets of innovations they're sort of the capital formation governance side and then there's the product side and i almost think the capital formation side might be as you say the most like what we look back on that you can get a bunch of people together on the internet that are you know anonymous or pseudonymous or whatever and they can put capital together and code together and do all these things and have it owned and operated by the community that you know and then and then what you do is right if the partnership were 10 people the you know the limited liability corp allowed you to have a million shareholders or something you know crypto will let you have billions of users who own the systems they use yeah and but and by the way they're connected to a financial system and it's completely global and permissionless to anyone with a keyboard right and completely meritocratic and and and open and open source and you can study the code and it's just the way it should be done uh it's just the right way very good so what is the name of that book again we'll include in the show notes but i want to make sure i'll give you i'll give you a link um i have a set of 19th century books it's like going back to civilization you think about the tech tree that's basically the way i think about the the book theory the 19th century book series is like the the series of unlocks well chris this has been a fantastic uh conversation and thank you for leaving us with some resources we greatly appreciate it you know last thing i wanted to hear a little bit about your a16 crypto startup school because that is a fantastic resource as well i mean folks that listen to bank lists are continuously leveling up on crypto and defy and everything and this is a great resource what is that yeah so this is something that we did originally it's gonna be in person then the pandemic happened but it was uh it was it was a it was a free uh school of course that was sort of taking all the things that we'd learned and and giving them out to the people that attended the course but then we we videotaped everything and it's all on our website it's all free uh great people like brian armstrong bology srinivasan dan binet uh a whole bunch of other great people there maybe we can include a link here with the podcast um and this is really what we try to do is sort of it's the summary of like kind of you know all the things we've all learned in the last 10 years in the space and like hoping that we could package it up and share it so that the you know that we can kind of um you know help help a lot of the people that i think were there and people that uh um you know we're excited by it or are people that are interested in crypto but they may be intimidated by it or don't fully understand it or don't know how to start a company there so we want to kind of give them a um a little bit of like a guidebook so so you know that might be something that that your listeners you know especially if they're starting out in crypto i think even people that are more experienced in crypto like if you could know the crypto side and defy side but like how do you go create a company what are the regulatory implications how do you think about recruiting how do you think about there's just all sorts of other logistical questions and we tried to address a lot of them in that in that um course so absolutely fantastic resource for you guys chris thank you so much for being with us on bank list it's been such a pleasure yeah thank you guys really appreciate it all right listeners action items so a few things we will include in the show notes the first is read a whole bunch of the articles we referenced in today's conversation the crypto price innovation cycle uh doing old things better versus doing brand new things these are some of chris's articles we'll include all of those in the show let's go check them out go read them also we'll include a link to the book that chris mentioned the company and also a link to crypto startup school so that would be number two the third thing is guys we are in a crypto bull market it is the bull cycle and so that means we need your five star reviews on itunes right david absolutely we are trying to get to the top of the itunes business and investing categories and we are a little bit in a stalemate there we have not climbed as fast as i would have hoped so we need your help to climb the itunes charts faster and the way that you do that is you give us those five star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts if you could please take the time to get that done that would really help uh spread the great gospel of crypto to more and more all right guys risks and disclaimers of course the assets we talked about today are risky none of this is financial advice defy is risky crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot you
