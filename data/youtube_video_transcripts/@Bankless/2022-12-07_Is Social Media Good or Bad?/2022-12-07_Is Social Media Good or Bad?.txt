what's your take on social media in general is it good is it bad how have you leveraged it what have you learned about it and where do you think it should go you think I'd be sitting here if it wasn't for social media it's the best thing that ever happened to me it is what you make of it and you can control your user experience if you want to I think the biggest problem is self-control and maybe that's a little bit too individualistic but some of the best health and fitness content that you can consume is on Instagram and also some of the worst health and fitness content you can consume is on Instagram so it's really incumbent upon people to use these things in a way that benefit them
