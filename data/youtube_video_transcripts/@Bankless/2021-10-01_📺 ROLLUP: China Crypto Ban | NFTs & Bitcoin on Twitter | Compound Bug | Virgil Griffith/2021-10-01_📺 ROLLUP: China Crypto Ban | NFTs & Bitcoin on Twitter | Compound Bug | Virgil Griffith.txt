[Music] hey bankless nation it is the fifth week and last week of september and you know what time it is david tell them it is roll up time to time to roll up the entire week of crypto which like i always say is an ambitious endeavor in this industry uh an insane amount of things happen every single day and we are going to roll up the last week of september here on this friday bankless weekly roll up ready ryan yep i'm ready enjoy this with your cup of coffee guys and david it looks like you've had a few cups of coffee looking good man you're back in your place right off the road yeah in stark contrast to a very very tired hotel room weekly roll up i'm back in san diego with my setup uh with my coffee in the morning uh multiple cups of coffee today so yeah it's gonna be a fun weekly roll up this week all right guys we have so much to cover i think we're gonna hit the china band they banned uh crypto for the 500th time but this time maybe they mean it we're going to get into that we're also going to touch on nfts on twitter is this the new blue check mark we got to talk about virgil griffith as well guys so this is going to be a jam-packed roll-up for you a bunch of cool things mixed in with uh some unfortunate things and the china the china band actually has some silver linings which we're about to get into into the market section the virgil griffith story no silver linings there so you're gonna hear some frustration coming out of me and ryan later in the show but i think that the coolest thing is twitter led by jack dorsey who only talks about bitcoin is uh did did two things like you said one was integrate nfts on on their platform so you can get your verified mnft and you can also tip with bitcoin now with twitter so they're doing two things one's ethereum focus one's bitcoin focused uh i wonder which one the market will like more in the future we will see i i can't wait to talk about that some more so we're gonna get into those items um one a few announcements we need to share with you so if today you're listening to this it is friday october 1st then that means discounts have just launched for permissionless so permissionless is a defy conference we are putting this on with our friends at blockworks i think it's going to be the biggest d5 party of 2022 and you guys need to be there this is going to be in uh florida where we headed david um west palm beach palm beach almost forgot and so what they're doing with the ticket rollout is they're rolling out 250 at a time so every two weeks 250 new tickets get issued up they get snapped up quickly if you are a bankless premium member you can get the tickets at 30 off every two weeks tickets increase in price i think it's 300 and something but if you're a bankless premium you get 95 off this week so if you're interested in coming with us partying in florida then uh check this out in the show notes and jump on permissionless train as the resident conference goer here it's no surprise that ryan forgot where we were going but uh yeah ryan is actually going to be there too as well be there by ipad or am i actually attending in person we haven't discussed this yet i mean we you don't live too far away from west palm beach yeah i'm going to be there in person guys definitely um it's been a ton of fun organizing this event with the blockbuster team they uh definitely understand that crypto conferences aren't just about the conferences and more about how it's a cultural festival so if you've never been to a crypto conference before don't think of it like a boring conference think of it something much more closer to a literally a festival of the arts a festival of culture there's there's going to be the actual conference with with actual like good content and talks but then after the fact it's going to be just a bunch of good vibes so looking forward to that banquet gonna throw a party question mark i have to convince ryan of this i haven't talked about it to him yet but you sent it to me in discord i was definitely down i haven't commented on that but guys we are throwing a party absolutely there um also nft gallery they're gonna have like tons of cultural things too so make sure you check this out one last thing on this is uh we're working a little bit with the the sponsor team and there's been a ton of interest from prospective sponsors but we want some defy sponsors to partake in sponsorship so if you are interested in being a defy sponsor we've got a lot on the list we want the premium we want the cream of the crop d5 sponsors to show their force at this conference then uh ping one of us i don't know dm us or something and we'll get you in touch with the right people we have we are just holding the floodgates of the dam of centralized companies who are all are chomping at the bit right but like d5 companies generally a don't have the opportunity or don't like think about this as like uh as a as a place to like get their branding out because like generally d5 companies have their own community to help support their branding but like let me tell you if the d5 companies don't take it the c5 companies absolutely will so we're holding we're holding the doors closed on the c5 companies we're making room we're making room so come talk uh also this is like an offer that i think you have maybe three more days before if you're listening to this if you become a bankless premium member by sunday in the next three days you get a bankless t-shirt this is the bankless essential t-shirt it's the one i'm wearing right now the one dave and i uh are displayed in in many of our shows all you have to do i think the value in this is like 28 all you have to do is sign up for bankless premium you can see the benefits we'll include a link in the show notes but that's a full market opportunity report every monday you get to hang out with the crew in the inner circle discord chat podcast debriefs you're not catching all of the podcasts right unless you are bankless premium david and i do extra podcasts after the show and release that on a bankless premium feed alpha alpha leak emails you would have noted about dydx in advance if you got these emails also a 30 discount to the conference we were just talking about and an nft badge all of that is included in bankless premium the newsletter is designed to pay for itself so don't get left behind all you need is one alpha leak and it's like a 10x return uh i tell ya uh we'll get to one of those alpha leaks later but lastly we got to talk about zirion david so zerion uh wants us to get the word out to you they are doubling down on nfts tripling down on nfts i think we are looking you probably use xerion for your like your d5 user interface to do like for me xerion is like a go-to tool i can't be without it but right now i'm displaying on screen one of david's addresses and i'm seeing a lot of nfts in this address yeah and these are your nfts right please ignore the fidenza rocks which are 100 scams that i thought that like uh well like i thought it was going to be like these yet i i i need to send them away from my portfolio so please ignore the fidenza rocks they are scams do not buy them um i got i got rugged uh but here are my flowers look at my flowers right wait you just you just scrolled right by my fantastic flower dude the portfolio gets better as you go along right so we're looking at flowers here are my flowers uh the black and white ones are the rare ones fun fact um but i really like that rose one in the middle here uh and then if you keep on scrolling uh then uh also ignore those those are bad and you also get rid of those generated mass and cyber kongs uh the london eip1559 gift my pudgy penguins which are super cute super cute penguins they both look rare and then of course finishing off is the crypto punk one one one eight also you can see it right behind me uh yes xerion doing a really good job making an nft portfolio interface alongside your d5 portfolio sir no no no turtles in this portfolio yet what are you doing man you sleeping on turtles still tiny turtles i'm absolutely sleeping on turtles as soon as i see a twitter uh turtle in my twitter feed i put it away you you mute you block i mute the turtles you know what's awesome about this too is i haven't used this yet um but you can actually configure this interface to display a an nft through xerion on your apple watch too so something else to check another way to flex when you're off your screen where you're just out in public it becomes like your nft rolex just like that with um the new features nft features that xeron is adding so if you're interested in checking that out we'll include a link in the show notes uh thanks to xerion for sponsoring this message yeah cheers all right see how i get stoked that's awesome i love that the potential rocks are not are not awesome you are proud of them all right guys we're going to get to the markets next david you want to start with bitcoin markets bitcoin starting the week at roughly 44 000 got up to the high price of 45 000 and then it has fallen after that down hit the lows of roughly 40 what 41 000 a number of times throughout the week and then it has reclaimed 43 200 at the time of recording generally flat um down one percent on the week um unexciting it's a good day when you eat it when bitcoin is above uh 40k that's what that that's what i say yeah every 10k right yeah every 10k absolutely how about ethan how's he doing starting the week at roughly uh what was it three thousand dollars uh got smacked pretty hard fell all the way down to two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars where we did see some uh liquidations reclaimed three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars twice inside of the week and then also fell again twice inside of the week down to four twenty eight thousand dollars where we and we are now almost trying to get our heads right above three thousand dollars at the time of recording so some volatility this week between 2750 and three thousand one hundred a lot of volatility a lot of volatility yeah this is pretty crazy we're back to the chop are we back to the the the crab season once again i thought we were almost out of that at the end of the summer september was looking promising now it's let me down in the second half what's going on david well we have we have a bunch of fud right so we have like this the um the regulatory fund that scared a lot of people we also had china banning crypto which apparently the market is actually reacting to this time which is like a first since 2017. uh and then there was this whole like treasury debacle insider trading like in uh insecurity in the in the legacy markets the traditional markets got hammered this week uh the the first day that that legacy markets got hammered crypto fell right in in parallel with it the second day which was today i believe today or yesterday uh crypto markets have instead become resilient to that so like i think crypto markets are done being scared and they're now just kind of waiting for everything else in the world to solidify so they can like finally show some strength i think like i always think this crypto markets want to show strength there's just been like a bunch of fud in the last week or so um so many come from coming from so many different directions and so like once we once the rest of the world can just deal with that i think we can resume bullishness that's my take yeah i still feel like david we are in like a a major bull trend right if this kind of level of flood had had happen during a bear market when everyone's pessimistic i mean crypto would have tanked and it would have stayed down for a while the fact that we're even kind of seeing this volatility and rebounding right it still indicates to me we're in this secular bull market yeah we are not hitting new lows we are getting fun and we are not hitting new lows yeah i i do think that the fourth quarter's uh you know generally it's been good for crypto particularly in bull years so we'll see how this fourth quarter pans out but um it still could be good for crypto uh we'll uh we'll keep you updated every friday as we do all right let's talk about this updates on the eth to bitcoin ratio what's going on here uh nothing too much i believe last week it was at point zero seven something something and right now we're at point zero six nine uh so flat on the week for ebtc there's rumors of like a bitcoin etf in october you know remember rao paul said that and bitcoin has shown some resilience some strength i wonder if it's kind of feeding on that rumor i wonder if we'll actually see something i've been waiting for like a a kind of a maya copa from um gensler to just be like here's an olive branch crypto your etf i hate you in all of these other ways but i'm going to give you this etf uh maybe that's gonna happen in october that could shed some light or that that could um give some life to bitcoin but uh we'll have to see absolutely the two faces of gary gensler the nice face we haven't seen yet so maybe maybe that come on gary help us out here all right d5 pulse uh this is lower than i've seen for a while so we're at 68 billion total locked value i think it's because crypto's gotten sort of pummeled in the last quarter you know i actually think that that might be a bug on d5 pulse because if you look at the chart like that chart is definitely above 80 billion dollars it is uh so there's a little bit of a discrepancy there sometimes the d5 pulse.com front end does experience some bugs just because like there's so many different ways to count what's the real number it's 81 billion then it looks like on the graph yeah well that's the higher one so we'll go on that one as the source of truth 81 billion locked in defense when in doubt skew bullish folks crypto's in a 10-year secular bull market giving away all of our bankless secrets let's look at eth locked in d5 though that's where i think this chart gets interesting i'll focus on the chart we're at 7.8 million eath locked in which is an all-time high this is an all-time high well i think that's true let me pretty sure that's true let's scan out yeah no close close super close yeah count it tied all-time high since april right yeah uh and really close to the all-time high ever uh so that's a good sign and i think it it's nice for eth to become more reliant on this this much more trustless piece of collateral rather than all of kind of the staple coins that we've seen going around the ecosystem so okay how about d5 pulse index where are we at with d5 tokens themselves yeah the d5 pulse index start of the week at roughly can you go to the one week chart start of the week at 327 hit the high of the week at 348 and the low was 275. again you're seeing a lot of that volatility in in the dpi token ending the week at 304 overall down six percent on the week all right now we're going to take a look at this chart which is the ratio of dpi to eve it's not d5 season yet david no it's flat last week it was at point one this week it's at point one so we are flat on the week uh with some inter week volatility as well but um you sound sad about that are you sad about that you want d5 seasons come back i do want d5 season it's it's it's always so much fun um but like nfts just don't stop being bullish and so like all the attention keeps on going there yeah we should start putting some nfd and indices on this like i don't know the best one there we need some um we need some uh d5 nft infrastructure to come out people need to start using fractional more so we can stop talking about the floor price because the floor is just such a terrible metric to actually measure the value of these things um yeah it dude if there's a bankless listener out there who has a good idea for a consistent metric we could use so talk about the value of nft markets over time let us know we've seen some indices but nothing that has kind of the the mind share of of something that we would need to to report on this like prestigious high journalist integrity media outlet which bankless is wait i can't tell if you're being facetious or not oh no that was 100 serious let's talk about the bet index that is our favorite index in crypto compose 30 bitcoin percent e thirty percent dpi itself what are we looking at on the week yeah down four percent on the week start of the week at 136 hit the high of 143 hit also a low of 115 ended the week at roughly hundred and thirty-four dollars there you go you know david i think it's time we uh check in on our friend eip1559 i mean it's been great guys two months now yeah great guy doing great things just like busy burning you know every day eath is burnt is a day that i am bullish sir uh but let's look below the surface that's the title of this article itself and what does eip1559 look like below the surface has it accomplished its goals yeah so the author who is named t does a fantastic write-up uh just kind of trying to parse apart the data of eip1559 and the cool thing about eip-1559 is that like the data that comes out for it is like not known how significant that data is what it really means eip1559 is emergent as in the properties and behaviors and data that arrive out of eip1559 there is no canonical like uh definition of what these things mean uh and so this is actually one of the best no history there's no this hasn't been done there's no history like not only has it never been done in crypto but like blockchains and eip like everything is new everything is new uh and so there's a lot of data here and t gives his interpretation and analysis but he definitely qualifies it saying like hey this is just my take and like it's we're gonna need to have more data to see what these things mean uh there's a ton of fantastic graphs and and some analysis which with each one so if you want to just learn more about how eip1559 is impacting ethereum and ether uh definitely check this out it's a great homework assignment for people who are trying to dive deeper to the code of ethereum in the the the eth markets uh and um they're just some great analyses what what is this take here david like what's the uh the summary of it is eip 1559 working as designed or no yeah it's absolutely working as designed what he was trying to indicate is like well okay it's working as as designed but like how does that actually change things right like we know we know eip159 it like it makes it easier to transact uh it burns eth but what does that actually do like so like what does it do to daily minor cell pressure for example there's one exactly in here right and like how does it actually impact the eath price at all right and his his take if i remember correctly is like in the short term it actually doesn't impact the eath price at all because the ether that's being burnt is like the literally the most elastic portion of the east supply it's the most flexible that actually doesn't impact the price but what it does do in the future is that it will prevent um price drops in the future right so really it's like and this is actually set a floor it's help helping set a floor right and so in the in the future especially in the long term future this is like and this is actually what i said in my original eip1559 article is that it's paying like eip1559 when it burns eth it's like ethereum putting security in a rainy rainy day fund right like when it when there does come a time of high stress environments that reduction in cell pressure because we've been burning it for the past one to five ten years there's just simply less heat available to sell and so one of one of his takeaways which again is up for interpretation is that during future like um volatility events the downside should be dampened as a function of how much total eath was burned yeah that's why i say full circle it goes back every day that eath is burned is a day that i am bullish and that's long term bullish i can't tell you what's going to happen in the short run but long term this is a secular trend i mean we passed a billion dollars worth of eath burnt right over three hundred thousand uh today we actually passed four hundred thousand four hundred 000 today right and so like th this um this pressure is just going to keep compounding on ethereum then you get the merge everything bankless listeners know so we don't have to belabor that point but bullish i'm glad someone has done uh some deep diving on eip 1559. david let's also talk about dydx that was a story with some numbers in the market section we love to talk about numbers this is antonio antoni is the founder of dydx he's going to actually be coming on the podcast on association on tuesday right so he says five years i left coinbase i remember when he tweeted that he left coinbase he eventually founded dydx today dydx is doing more trade volume than coinbase what is the moment of reflection five years it takes that's what it takes five years for a d5 protocol to get built and then do more volume than the company that originally hired the guy like wow that's crazy congratulations antonio yeah it's it's uh it's huge antonio so like uh looking forward to talking to you soon and um this is the market share this is a graph of the market share of dydx they're up to 27 percent market share of uh and this includes some of the you know sillier dexes like pancake swap and that sort of thing too so actually even higher than that probably in terms of real dex volume totally really and like the other cool thing is like this is the second decentralized exchange app to pass coinbase in volume units while being the first uh i'm pretty sure coinbase actually i mean over time has done more volume and like sustains itself as the leader over time yeah like hey like breaking it over a 24 hour period or even a seven day period which uniswap has done is just the first step yeah well dydx is doing a lot of things right right so like uh perpetuals is a fantastic product everybody loves that um they were they were one of the first to roll out on layer two so under the hood this is all um zk roll up technology right uh and also i think what's giving them steroids some extra juice is um kind of their token roll out the token launch which they're using for liquidity mining but you have an alternate theory as well as to why it's gained so much traction recently tell us about that david uh i think these theories are definitely paired like everyone likes tokens and when tokens exist they they attract a lot of attention towards the app but also at the same time we have china banning crypto and apparently it's real this time and the reason why we know it's real is because we can see chinese actors actually making decisions to exchanges exchanges like outflows you can actually see this in the blockchain right which is like the ultimate source of truth and that is the clear differentiator between this china ban and the infinity other china bans that we've seen and so there's speculation that all of this demand out of all these chinese exchanges to trade and speculate and do exchange things has gone from these chinese exchanges to duidx to a trustless defy exchange which operates on a similar performance level because of the layer 2 as the exchanges that they are fleeing from and so i think the big takeaway here is that when a nation state like china comes and bans crypto where do they go they don't go to another alternative like more western centralized exchange they go to d5 right because they just got quote unquote censored and so they're not going to go on to another sensorable platform they're going to go on to a defy platform and so there's an article here out of cointelegraph that says the dydx token gains 80 in a week what's driving the dex token rally and their their subline is traders raise their bids for the decentralized exchange token believing as it would benefit from china's decision to classify all crypto transactions as illegal and so there's speculation that people are moving on to dydx in order to escape china which just makes sense like go on to the censorship resistance platform after you get censored by your nation state that's what they're for well yeah there's there's sort of a crypto narrative for you it's like china ban equals bullish for defy spanish that could be what's happening uh love that man love that i i think that could be what's happening um david let's also explore another trend that's happening this is uh the trend to total locked value in the multi-chain as people say so this is interesting this is a plot of market cap of ethereum and a number of other chains and obviously we've seen sort of a alternate layer two kind of uh resurgence with um you know i guess binance earlier in the year and then solana and um avalanche more recently starting to really increase in market cap and this is interesting when you look at a market share perspective but i think it's actually more interesting to look at from a total locked value perspective right so um ethereum dominance has dropped from 84 of total lock to value to 77 so it's down you know i guess um seven percent right and then binance has gone down a little bit solana's gone up from about one percent to four to five percent tara has gone up a little bit avalanche has gone from basically nothing to two percent phantom as well i i want to get your take on like what do you make of this well is total locked value is it moving into these other ecosystems and is that um to the detriment of ethereum what does that mean for the space uh is that bullish alternative layer ones what do you think yeah so the the take here and i've been we've been saying this for forever now is like during bull markets ethereum's capacity gets uh consumed and there's overflowing demand that ethereum cannot satisfy because it has not done like layer one sharding and the the l2 ecosystem is about as nascent as the alternative l1 ecosystem so uh when there's overflow for ethereum main chain demand when gas fees like you know exceed 100 of transfer people need to go elsewhere so some go to layer twos some go to other l1s and so what we're seeing here is that like the crypto industry has done a fantastic job bringing new people in and they a lot of new people don't want to or simply can't transact on the ethereum l1 so they go elsewhere the interesting story here to me is the lack of consensus as to where else to go right so um binance smartchain was like the first uh app the first like other alternative l1 to like absorb some of ethereum's overflow but we've seen that actually go down this week while solana terra avalanche and phantom have all gone up there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus as like oh ethereum is full here's where we go next everyone's just going everywhere right and antiprosynthesis one of like he's probably the only person that will actually accept the ethmaxy label willingly has tweeted out this this one tweet which i really really like is like you know what if you ask like what what if uh what alternative l1 is going to kill ethereum you'll get 10 000 different answers because like there actually isn't like a like a viable like the next uh second place to ethereum right there's just like five third places and that's why you don't see any of the overflowed with here i'm going into one specific blockchain they're all kind of getting spread out i remember um when raul paul came on the podcast and he mentioned briefly about like ethereum dominance going down from from its highs right in terms of total locked value he's like yeah it'll probably like decrease from 85 percent to like 75 maybe 70 but that's still a lot right especially when everything is 10xing right yeah it's basically sort of a you know a prediction of power law winners in the space which um you know i tend to kind of agree with but i have another take on this too which is like i think actually david total locked value can be a flawed metric in in some ways and made this point in an article that um i wrote in uh 2020 on bankless talking about trustless economic bandwidth versus like economic bandwidth that is more trusted and what i meant by that is like um it is more valuable from a bankless and decentralized decentralization perspective right to have um capital on chain which i call economic bandwidth so value on chain that doesn't have any outside trust dependencies right so which is the whole point of this whole point right so like if you're looking at usdc versus dye right die is better it's more trustless because it has less trust guarantees and it has less usdc inside of it it's backed by other things like eth for example and if you look at another asset on chain like rye which is fully backed by eth that is you know less trusted still and if you look at eth in and of itself right that is the most trustless asset uh on ethereum right and so what we miss when we look at just pure each uh total locked value total value locked is we missed whether this is like actual trustless value or whether it's just some kind of a you know a stable coin we also miss the settlement guarantees of the chain right so like if we wanted to look at this and put another i guess column here we could look at the coinbase side chain right what's coinbase it's a ledger it's a side chain it has one validator and that is like the coinbase database organization but it has like shareholders right it has dow participants anyone who owns coin shares i guess has governance vote over it right so why not include them from a total locked value percent well we don't because we don't call that d5 but there is this scale right ethereum is the most decentralized um you know d5 platform coinbase is not decentralized at all and some of these chains are like somewhat in the middle and i think a lot of this looks starts to look a bit more like um like like a phantom for example or a terra for example or even a polygon and sidechain example looks a bit more like fintech and a bit less like permissionless trustless defy that's why i think total locked value can be misleading were we talking about trusted total locked value are we talking about purely trustless total locked value that the trust list is the stuff that i care about and the the stuff that is i think the most sustainable and you know fits the protocol sync thesis of being like the most permanent and foundational for this whole operation that explain that does that make sense 100 100 and if listeners want to dive more into this i highly recommend reading the article from nick carter called it's the settlement insurance is stupid uh and then or if you want to consume something out of bank list there is um a talk i gave at ethereal called um settlement insurances and the protocol sync thesis and it describes this spectrum of just like not all when you make a transaction on a blockchain not it doesn't necessarily they're not all created equal right not all transactions are equally as trustless or it's equally have as strong settlement assurances right so like when you send a litecoin transaction uh litecoin blocks happen every 2.5 minutes does that mean when that block finalizes on litecoin that you have as the same amount of settlement insurances as when you do when you make a transaction on bitcoin no absolutely not those are different levels of settlement assurances therefore different levels of trustlessness and each one of these blockchains have are on that same sort of spectrum how strong are the assurances that you have when you make a transaction that that transaction actually settles and the answer to this question needs to go into the architecture of the actual blockchain itself but also the asset that you are also transferring right and so if you send usdc both of those things it's both of those things if you send if i send ryan usdc on ethereum well actually did it really settle or not is actually not really related to the architecture of ethereum or any other blockchain that's on because you're actually trusting circle to actually be this final arbiter of final settlement right and so these are very nuanced subjects and this is uh if you do not if you have this is a new concept for you settlement insurances um i highly highly encourage you to go go read uh it's the settlement insurance is stupid by nick carter uh and then also the settlement insurances and the protocol sync thesis video which is on the eth ethereal uh youtube and then there's also some things i will put them in there as well yeah that's it we'll just do you guys a favor and put some of this stuff in the show notes but it does require but the last thing i'll say on this uh is this david is um i don't think this is a zero-sum game either right like more value more eyeballs more entrance into whether it's a more like centralized uh side chain or some alternative layer one it's all good for the space it's all good for ethereum i think it's all good for for bitcoin right people often think that like this is some sort of a tribal game where there's going to be big losers and big winners but like even like look man ethereum is good for bitcoin like maximum bitcoin maximus don't know it but it is it's been incre you think bitcoin would be above 40k if not for ethereum right hell no absolutely absolutely no chance right and it works the other way too i mean bitcoin ethereum wouldn't even been possible about bitcoin so none of this guys is a zero-sum game either this is all going to be good and we think the most decentralized protocols eventually will sink to the bottom win the most market share and be the most dominant and that's a good thing if that happens well it actually even goes even further than that right so like when you have a maximally decentralized protocol you can build centralized stuff on top of that you can compromise on decentralization later right and so another article that that uh and also a bankless podcast i think number five uh it's called um the two faces of ethereum or the d5 risk spectrum or the d5 trust spectrum the cool thing about maximizing decentralization is it allows you to compromise on decentralization later right but you have to get decentralization first and so if you want to build a centralized permission side chain on ethereum like you can do that right like you have that option available you can't do the opposite yeah you can't exactly you can't put the card yeah you can't build a theorem on the side chain absolutely guys well we got excited about that porsche we got to keep moving on i wonder why our roll-ups last so long i have no idea hopefully you guys enjoy them we definitely enjoyed doing them so um all right well this is what's a graph that graphic that caught my eye this is from coinmetrics their newsletter is fantastic by the way it comes out weekly but this is a chart of the unit swap 3 trading pairs and you can see the various assets that are trading with you see um tether you see usdc you see dye but this big pink cloud that you're seeing that's all eth right trustless economic bandwidth trustless economic bandwidth on ethereum and um i think the position what this graph is really showing us is on ethereum and i think in general across d5 eth is positioning itself in becoming positioned by default to be the reserve asset of d5 right this is back to that narrative we talked about reserve asset of nfts talk about reserve asset of the metaverse even which is kind of a newer thing but back to the reserve asset of d5 it's bearing out on the graphics that's what uniswap is using as its primary trading pair and that's a great thing for decentralization any any other follow-ups on that david no i think this actually fits in right into the conversation we were just having yeah yeah absolutely okay last thing for you on the market side of things pretty big milestone for polygon again uh this is their um sidechain solution the proof-of-stake type solution but they just eclipsed ethereum layer one in daily active addresses for the very first time okay so this this is a great illustration of why it's actually valuable to compromise on decentralization because you can scale better that way centralization actually scales really really far because you've actually compromised on decentralization but because matic because polygon is built on ethereum they get to give all their users the ability to exit into the more trustless into the more decentralized version of the universe right so you can get more scale by cut by reducing decentralization but once you hook into ethereum you also get the benefits of ethereum yeah absolutely and look this is not a new idea either we just call them side chains and this sort of thing now but like where did you guys start your crypto journey i bet it was on an exchange a centralized exchange right which is a side chain which then you then exited to continue the d5 world same thing is happening here um but anyway i think a lot of users will start their journeys on obviously exchanges on side chains and on layer twos and um that's where we're gonna see the user growth we'll probably see the capital growth on mainnet but the user growth will happen on these layer twos and side chains 100 um all right david uh last thing total locked value in tracer just exceeded 20 million dollars so it's super cool and i know you didn't meet the nation with them when's that coming out now it's coming out monday at 12 p.m eastern time 12 p.m eastern time uh it walks us through the history of tracer dao what they have one of the most interesting genesis stories i've ever heard as well as where the team actually got the expertise where they got the idea how what their roadmap is and where they are going so if you want to learn more about one of the most promising young dals that i've ever seen check out tracerdow yeah on the meet the nation on the bank that's youtube building on arbitram perpetuals protocol you've heard us talk about it in previous rollups as well all right guys we are going to be back with the releases for the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lydo.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the leido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terror or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started all right guys we are back with the hot releases of the week the first is this david connext is launching an nxtp protocol they say to improve liquidity connects of course is uh dealing with the kind of the ethereum multi-chain space so the ability to transition and move seamlessly assets from say an arbitrarium to an optimism back to mainnet without waiting for uh waiting for anything it's kind of an interoperability protocol what are they doing here yeah if you guys uh remember ryan and i talking about hop protocol it's very very similar just hopping assets between uh layer twos connex has actually been in the ethereum space for as long as long as i can remember working on payment channels uh which we all know is a very like foundational fundamental piece of technology but it's kind of been a solution looking for a problem uh because we tried we all we used to think oh we'll scale ethereum with payment channels and then we forgot that like well you don't have generalizability on payment channels that's really really hard and so like we have this like awesome piece of technology led by arjun bhutani and a bunch of other people working on on payment channels but now with this layer 2 ecosystem absolutely exploding we actually now have the problem that we have the technology to solve for and so connex has been like reappropriating their already existing payment channel tech to expand payment channels between all the different layer twos um i think two weeks ago we uh shouted them out because they recently passed 500 million dollars in volume over their nxtp protocol um and but that was before they uh like announced the main net which is what they are announcing right here uh so they have the nxtp protocol mainnet uh which is going to help you live a life on layer two by bridging all the layer two so you never actually have to touch the ethereum l1 uh they had a blog post forever ago announcing what they were building and they had a fantastic meme called the l1 is lava as in like you never actually have to touch that don't touch it don't touch it yeah and so this is this is what it means to to be a citizen i think in the whole global nexus of ethereum which is you only if you only only if you want to do you have to actually go to the l1 these bridges are super important really essential infrastructure for for the next wave here um speaking of infrastructure andre the founder of wiring and yfi of course a famous d5 builder in the space he is launching an nft marketplace or has launched an nft marketplace but the the title of this article is the coinbase article says uh andre's new nft marketplace is a vampire attack suicide pact wow what is that that sounds like some hyperbole he's going up against open sea i guess that's the vampire part of this right what's uh what's your take here and what does this mean well i think after openc had that drama with the insider trading employee who they have since let go um everyone has been asking is like hey wait a second open c it's not a dab it's not an application it's a company uh and so now there's there's been some attention on decentralized marketplaces peer-to-peer marketplaces for nfts uh and so andre in his tweet that we're watching here he's demoing what very much looks like an open c type format um but apparently it's a p2p version of that um it's also built on phantom apparently which andre cronier is a big fan of but he's also built other things on phantom before that he ultimately just ports to ethereum because that's where all the users are and the the title of this piece the vampire attack is alluding to like well open c doesn't have a token and we all know what happens when like something that doesn't have a token gets forked and then a token is added before that original token exists right we saw this with the sushi swap drama that's how sushi swap came into existence in the first place and vampire attacked una swap before union swap had a token and so the idea is that this new nft marketplace is in theory going to get a lot of adoption if it can find a way to vampire attack open c uh open c's code is not open source and verifiable so i think that makes it a little bit more difficult to actually do that i'm not a coder so i don't know but i'm pretty sure that's true um but either way the incentive to vampire attack open c before it has a token is really really strong we were actually uh recording with devin finzer tomorrow friday um today's thursday uh and so i'm actually going to ask about this asking this question is like yeah like wait wait a second uh devin like how are you guys going to like have a moat if you don't have a token question yeah the the the other important uh piece here of course is like they're gonna be expanding each each each chain but this is all open source as well so andre's gonna release this as an open source project but in general i love competition like this david because i think it it leads to better user experience better products cheaper products for the end customer so vampire attacks bring them on it's great just ups our game let's talk about this david uh coinbase just released a direct deposit feature so this allows users to get paychecks in crypto it's not what you've always wanted if you're like working in a corporation right getting a paycheck in crypto in uscc or maybe some slice of that in bitcoin or eth maybe the bed index someday rather than getting it into your wells fargo account how much more convenient is that looks like coinbase is making a play there and it's fulfilling sort of uh um some speculation that we've had in the very early days of bank list that all of these exchanges would slowly transform into banks we call them crypto banks in the early days and this is the next check mark right oh direct deposit just like a bank yep we're doing it what's your take uh first off much better banks uh let's let's divide a line between clubs banks upgraded banks like crypto powered crypto enabled banks uh and uh we're going to talk about this later but like the more and more that coinbase becomes a bank the more and more it threatens all the other banking institutions out there uh which uh according to i think some of the incumbents will be argued it prevents uh prevents it presents a systemic risk right like if coinbase is literally so successful that it sucks up all the deposits of the other banks the other banks are literally in trouble and they are very very integrated into the rest of the financial system so this is probably causing a bunch of concern from all the the boomer banks out there that don't aren't that aren't crypto powered while they watch coinbase just like run circles around them when it comes to innovation and just consumer benefits look it's not just us saying this this is exactly what kathy wood told us when we had her from arkhamvest on the podcast a few weeks ago she's like hey you're seeing this ugly regulation because the banks are scared like they're pushing on the regulators to go do something in defy and crypto and maybe that's what we're seeing end game type stuff i think if i never have to touch wells fargo again i can get all my basic financial services out of coinbase which are so basic by the way i just need direct deposit which which they just enabled and then just the ability to like transfer money and pay my credit cards like there is not very many steps left before i just have to fundamentally question why i keep my wells fargo account oh dave we've got some more shade on wells fargo coming to this podcast wait to the news section my friend um wells fargo get ready all right usdc as well has been enabled in angel lists so angel list is a very popular kind of angel investing platform and now they are enabling not just fiat but usdc so this is another step for usdc to gain some traction and kind of the emerging fintech space which is also awesome speaking of fintech and d5 mullet type stories where you got fintech in the front and d5 in the back a firm have you ever used a firm they're like a fintech type product but they like split payments or no they delay payments right yeah so they turn some one expensive purchase into like a monthly thing that you can pay for over time okay i hate those things personally but i understand that um you know there it's an interesting product and clearly they have some adoption what's interesting about this story is they're kind of pivoting to d5 not entirely pivoting but they're rolling out uh debit cards that allow customers to buy and sell crypto directly from savings accounts as a product so you know i think it's interesting here is they've got some traction product market fit with their single killer app feature right and now where are they looking for the green space opportunity well it's all crypto and they appeal to millennials gen z sort of that demographic guess who likes crypto same demographic this is the d5 mullet thesis playing out where fintech companies start building on top of decentralized protocols and i'm here for it man i love this stuff we're gonna see more and more of this stuff uh throughout the year and throughout the like the years to come it's kind of interesting that the crypto thing about their their new product has nothing to do with the core business but that's also also kind of cool right it's like it doesn't even matter it's just they think it's valuable enough that they're doing it anyways uh and the more and more we can get companies to do this the more and more crypto gets integrated into our actual economy our fintech economy our existing economy the harder and harder it is for regulators to gut that stuff out after it already gets integrated it's a heat shield for the regulatory heat for sure when we have more adoption like this um dave this is interesting too so i guess the index co-op folks are creating a polygon indice right it's called pdi it sounds like it's an investment it's an asset that you hold that invests in a whole bunch of polygon assets like polygon apps and this sort of thing and i think it's like the polygon app layer token so if you want to not only bet on polygon by buying matic you can also bet on the polygon app layer by buying the polygon diversified index from index co-op that's really cool i was curious where index would grow and looks like they're pressing into all of all of these interesting spaces um the last thing for the week nami is a layer two scaling effort as well i don't know too much about nami but they have just announced eight eight million in funding led by dharma partners and uh they are supposedly bringing some youth scalability to layer two it's kind of a optimistic roll-up type approach plus uh some state channels but i don't know much about this project any takes here yeah i also don't know much about it seems to be coming out of left field for me um a couple people i've talked to have had some grumblings about being just a little bit unsure as to what the product actually is i think it's going to be a wait and see for me yeah absolutely but that is uh that is out now let's talk about raises david the big raise of the week i think is this social token raise with the rule protocol so we've been talking about social token infrastructure uh it's starting to attract more and more capital they just raised roll raised 10 million dollars and uh rolls kind of like the social money experiment would you say it allows people with followings communities to issue their own token in easy ways you don't have to deal with smart contracts and you know fork code they just make the whole thing easy and he takes care um i my take is that actually i think social tokens and dow tokens are actually kind of closer than what people think these things aren't very well defined and i think we're only going to define them as they get more and more used and more and more built out and so stay tuned this goes back to like thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and millions eventually of tokens are coming right i don't i don't know that regulators are prepared for that world either but uh they're coming like it or not the regulators are waiting for them to show up at their door to ask permission yeah last thing for you guys before we get into the news is jobs this is your weekly reminder get a job get a job or a dow go go work for crypto go do your part we've got a community manager of role from uh araguan uh eric goran i'm i'm lord of the rings this is like argon and also a founding blockchain engineer at highlight a senior software programmer from popcorn community lead from popcorn as well senior front end web developer for tracer dao in addition i don't know there's dozens more of a jobs on this board so if you are looking for a job in crypto best way to get it is on the bankless job board go check that out we'll include a link in the show notes and i bet you a decent number of those jobs come with tokens and everyone likes tokens never know never know all right guys news time david what are our news headlines for the week what are we going to talk about yeah coming up first we're going to lead with the fun stuff is nfts on twitter yay so if you have an nft that you think is especially cute or your crypto punk that you think is especially cool you can now prove to the rest of twitter that is literally something that you do actually own instead of just right click saving it um and so that's pretty cool uh ethereum has found its way into the depths of twitter and is doing it with nfts i've been saying this a bunch of times on the bankless program and i'll say it again nfts are how ethereum markets itself to the rest of the world it's literally ethereum's marketing surface area uh it's the social flexing aspect of things and it's also the verifiable uh aspect of things and so ryan you got a tweet here that you tweeted out saying twitter should roll out a blue checkmark for nft profile pics just validate them against ethereum every social network will be doing this it's the most obvious feature at ever and that came in august uh 29 which was a month ago and then uh just recently we have a developer at twitter teasing what an nft verified pro profile might actually look like and so that involves actually syncing up your address with some of the various options that we all know and love like metamask coinbase wallet trust wallet argent and if you have an nft in those addresses that you link you can sign a transaction to verify you own a nfc that's pretty cool this is awesome man this is exactly what crypto wanted this is exactly it all we wanted was for twitter to authenticate and verify our nfts as profile pictures on on the platform right and here they are they're doing it look at that look at that little eath logo right next to the profile picture yes do you think they're actually interesting jack's going to allow that to make it into the production version yeah so it's not an ethiopian flag right it's the logo this time and checkmate jack it's kind of cool that they'll differentiate on what chain you owe that own this thing right because like somebody could create a um crypto punk clone on some other chain and it wouldn't be the same thing right um so yeah this is exactly what crypto needs i think this will add massive legitimacy for nfts i think this is going to add value to nfts i also think every single social media platform is going to follow in their footsteps right like twitter is the lead here then next is going to be instagram like facebook tick tock everybody's going to follow this trend no one can not right now that twitter is rolling this out they're probably already working on it david right like when i tweeted this out in august uh you know i was just thinking about it was just like a shower thought like wouldn't that be cool um they were working on it at the time obviously it's a very obvious feature for these social network platforms web i don't know ryan i think they took your tweet and they ran with it i think so i've been tweeting jack to like do lots of things on ethereum and this is the only only listen to every single one he just i swear to god he just picks and chooses and at the same at the same time i'm gonna front run this we're gonna we we're gonna talk about this later i'm going to talk about right now you can now also tip on twitter with bitcoin this is the other the bitcoin thing that they integrated as well uh and so i'm looking forward to seeing the data as to what comes out who what do you think is going to be used more i know what i think dude i think people don't want to spend their bitcoin they want to flash their nfts they don't want to spend their bitcoin one's going to have product market fit the others barely going to do anything like unfortunately like it's great but payments on bitcoin we've we've tried this before we tried that we've been trying it since the inception of crypto right like people don't care about payments anyway all right let's talk uh china david so okay yeah sad face okay this this is um i guess stuff getting real in china we've had bands before this time maybe it's different we had uh saw hill on the podcast if you guys missed that earlier this week go check out our state of the nation with sawhill where we cover this in depth but what's the the high level take here what are they banning what does this mean for us yeah so what are they banning is a little bit kind of up in the air i think um it's more related to actual businesses so if you are helping facilitate crypto transactions then uh that's bad uh but i there there's um a little bit of speculation that simply holding crypto and owning crypto is still okay it's gonna be one of those things where we're just gonna have to find out after the fact um chinese regulators they kind of get to do whatever they want right and so they will interpret their own laws in ways that will benefit them by their choosing um but as far as being a business in china you are shutting down basically is what's going going on and not only are businesses inside of china but businesses that are serving chinese customers are also restricting access to their platforms to chinese customers so we've seen mining pools not allow chinese miners we see exchanges that are based in china with a lot of chinese customers have extreme outflows and this is why we know that this ban is real because we are actually seeing on-chain verifiable data and decisions being made by companies that are in china or relating to chinese customers actually change their policies so it's kind of like the easiest tell ever to figure out oh yeah this one's actually real yeah uh huobi which is a large uh exchange based in china they are getting rid of if you're if you're a chinese citizen and you're on huobi you have to exit you have to leave right they're they're blocking them all from their platform that's going to phase out also you mentioned outflows david there was a coinbase chart that just showed like ethan bitcoin outflows from huobi um on like over the last few months but then on on the on the um the news of this and it was just like this single red spike down yeah right actually exit all chinese exchanges largest largest decrease ever now [Music] to some of your thoughts earlier as we were talking about maybe some of this is going to end up in d5 like this capital has got to go somewhere and china's just squeezing the bloom they're squeezing it outside of their borders outside of their regulated exchanges seems like a short-sighted move but it's going somewhere else maybe it's going to d5 maybe it's going to us exchanges maybe it's going to the finances of the world but they don't want it in their jurisdiction this is also something that i noticed this week david is they blocked coin gecko coin market cap and trading view it's all blocked in china now so great firewall of course you can vpn around that i guess right but this is uh now more censorship of d5 maybe a direct attack on defy and crypto to make these uh these websites blocked in in china it's the first time they've been blocked ever hey as we all know you actually can't ban crypto you can only ban your own citizens from touching crypto uh and so crypto it's still actually in china it's just now illegal for you as a chinese citizen to actually touch it and there's that's an important distinction and an important takeaway i mean how much can china they've already banned video games apparently uh so like how much is trying to actually get a ban before their their citizens are just fed up with it uh i mean it's china so the answer is like a lot but there's a tipping point somewhere yeah absolutely and i i think they're just going to you you know this many citizens are just going to not listen right they'll just they'll just find other avenues and ways of doing this and move capital the way they want to um all right those those are the three well actually the third item that we wanted to talk about i think we should save to the end of this david because as kind of a deep sober topic virgil griffith an ethereum developer was um pled guilty just um on monday to some charges um we'll get into that in the detail but first let's talk about some happier subjects yeah virgil griffin happy face okay so um let's talk about this on ethereum news this 23 million dollar fee so bitfinex paid a 23 million dollar fee accidentally i believe um in just a kind of a routine type of transaction what happened here yeah so what happened here was they swapped out the send value with the gas fee value and so how much they wanted to send they actually accidentally put into how much gas they were willing to pay oopsies have you ever done that i have not done that no i've never done that either and i mean things get really complicated when you're an as large as bitfinex and you're sending that much money it's like they're not using metamask right they're using their own proprietary software yeah and when you do that and they were they were sending it on to diversify the z casing or zka proves layer 2. uh and something just went wrong in the transaction fortunately uh 90 like nine percent of the time transactions go to a a centralized mining pool and those mining pools are known individuals and like they don't miss when they just like get a random 23 million dollar transaction so that transaction actually got sent back because like hey you can just go knock on the knock on the centralized company's email address saying hey we accidentally mailed you guys 23 million dollars can you send that back to us please and like everyone knows who these people are and so they sent it back so the money ended up back in the in the right spot but the the lesson here is that layer two transfers have growing pains with them we still have to nail down our protocols and harden our code uh these are the early days of layer twos and things um go wrong every now and then yeah absolutely i i wonder what would happen if a validator in kind of eth2 received this amount of money and it was like an anonymous validator right that at that point they you would just uh pray pray and pray that that person was altruistic yeah here's your 23 million dollars back wow what a blocker what a reward though to suddenly have that pop up um all right let's talk about this ave we've talked about this before but the institutionalization of d5 that's starting to happen ave arc is a platform on ave it's built on the same protocol but it is open and primarily white listed and targeted towards large institutions now they are gearing up for launch anything to talk about here david uh nothing other than the previous firebox uh podcast episode that we did that talks about all this infrastructure that something like an institutional version of ave needs to support their institutional clients this is a huge frontier that we are just now um pulling the curtains back behind yeah i think they just want they just yeah well but it's fine it works it works on bankless uh they just want some kyc right they have to have that and this this institutional capital is kind of sitting dormant with low apys you know outside of d5 and they want access to some of these yields so this is a way to uh to get them that access also david there was a a blip a scare in uh compound earlier this week and uh i noticed it some people you know ping me on discord is like what what is this what's going on with compound um i i was concerned at first that the worst was happening which was maybe there's some kind of zero-day bug right in compound itself and like contracts are getting drained right because so much of this industry is built on uh compound yield but what actually happened was less severe what happened yeah so the actual bug was that the comp token which is issued at a regular rate to all the people supplying or borrowing from the compound application uh over time you get a trickle of comp to reward you for participating either on the supplier the demand side what happened was that i believe there was an update to the comp comp controller which controls the comp token like a week ago and apparently people were allowed to claim more comp than they were actually supposed to be issued uh and so this was uh more or less like an inflation bug in the comp token i don't think that was a comp token just a compliment just the com token yeah pools are fine deposits are fine like no all funds are seifu uh except for the comp token had a little bit more supply get sent out into the markets than was intended i don't know how much more supply apparently it was actually a decent amount i think it was like 80 million dollars um but other than that yeah a lot yeah it was um exactly i think it was 80 million dollars so i ran this calculation 280 000 comp tokens that were released which is equivalent of about 80 million dollars released into the wild so uh not awesome not awesome but i mean if you tell me that like this is the bug that compound has i'm like okay thank god jesus yep it's okay i was super relieved to hear about this and they'll get that fixed and upgraded um so i guess no big deal uh this time around we gotta wait i'm knocking on wood like a knockout you know what's cool here too david next bit of news is if you ever played axey infinity before october 26 2020 check your wallet this is actually infinity tweeting this out from their account they just airdropped 60 million dollars 800 000 axs tokens to their earliest gamers just to thank you like just a reward here oh geez you believed in us when no one did and so here's 60 million dollars how freaking awesome is that yeah that's right it's pretty great really cool i've seen people report uh they got nine thousand dollars i heard another person report they got 16 000 i'm not sure the metrics as to how they distributed this to their players but like 60 million dollars to early players when there wasn't nearly as many players as there are today uh that's a nice chunk of change you know david we ran a post on axia tactic a how to on bank list march 2020 that would have been well before this if you did your bankless homework you got some money from axs that's all i'm saying ryan did you do your bankless homework my homework is to publish the post okay you give out the homework you don't have to do it i mean bankless is alpha i'll just say that yeah maybe we have some more homework to do we can't take our own lessons we can't take our own lessons moving on let's talk about the amount that of each at a stake because it's absolutely colossal amount at this point uh almost eight million each staked so at current prices slider reports this that's 22 billion dollars worth of eth backing the economic security of the beacon chain which of course doesn't have state on it yet right but will and um it's really cool to see this amount of values far more efficient than proof of work if you guys listen to any of our justin drake episodes where we talk about like ultrasound money you've heard that meme for uh eth the asset wonder where it comes from came from justin drake episodes on bankless where he actually describes the economic efficiency and uh the importance of having a massive amount of money backing a network like ethereum any other takes here yeah with eth and ether right two sides of the same coin you have ultrasound money on the ether side you have ultra secure ethereum on the ethereum side and it's yeah you like that one i like that and as as we get closer and closer to the merge date the number of how the dollar value the capital measure of how much is staked on the beacon chain on the future ethereum chain is just uh making it safer and safer and safer when we do port over that's just more and more security towards defy there was the myth at one point in time david i remember in the doldrums of 2018 2019 that the price of eth doesn't matter that is that was so wrong i have a button for no wrong i have a button [Laughter] thank you it deserves another one please push that again please that's how rock it is uh now we know right now we can see as we transition to proof of stake it's becoming self-evident that uh the value of eve is the economic security the network is super important look at this slope up yes thank you um look this is eat deposited over time and it's just a a nice curve up yeah it does not go down at all well i mean it can't it can't go down so there's that but okay it continues to stay no it can't because it can't get withdrawn well i mean we're still at uh 6.6 um yield from staking so still not a bad yield again eat denominated yield 6.6 percent eventually this has got to drop to like something like the risk-free rate right which has got to be like three four percent something like that so this is all playing out as expected um david let's get into nfts really quick snoop is getting into nfts we talked about it last time but now he's actually got something going on in the metaverse i see a snoop car here i see what looks like a you know virtual party here you go oh wow look at this oh my gosh okay so what we're looking at here is the sandbox game and i think what's going on is that they've signed on snoop dogg as like their influencer right to get onboarding in traction uh if you're for people listening to the podcast it looks very much like minecraft uh very blocky um and and when you actually i've actually gone and done a little bit of investigating as to what this thing actually is it actually looks like a very well built out sort of like if for those that remember second life kind of like that you get to build your own assets you get to build your own avatars each of these assets are nfts you can buy it with this native sand token currency so it's very much a virtual world universe that is nft powered uh and they've gotten snoop dogg on their uh like their influencer team uh so this is pretty cool uh we'll see if this actually gains any traction attraction the only reason why i noticed it was because of snoop dogg it didn't really come from any of my like internal nft ethereum circles uh but hey like nfts are exploding beyond of what i can comprehend or pay attention to so who knows yeah this is cool do you see some bored apes in the in the screen clips here oh i missed it i'm gonna start integrating other nfts right here it is so i can run around with my crypto my crypto punk would actually or crypto punks at large would fit very well into this aesthetic because they're already very pixely yeah import you can import them into this world i'm sure but by the way do you know what sandbox is built on is it some kind of uh it's all ethereum uh i don't know if it's on a layer two i can't imagine it wouldn't be but i do know it's from ethereum if it's got bored apes it also um reads the ethereum blockchain and like imports those nfts in which is super awesome man um entire world is being built around this let's talk about another nft news dapper labs whom you know the the folks behind uh and uh nba top shots and also the original cryptokitties they're expanding into the nfl so i think they're just doing the same play in the end in the nfl as they did with the nba and um they're signing packers aaron jones as well no sorry that's wrong fdx is signing aaron jones i guess all of crypto is trying to get some legitimacy and credibility with the nfl market but let's talk about this dapper labs thing seems like an obvious play for dapper after you hit the nba to go after the nfl um and uh probably a big deal for them what do you think i mean we all know that there is this massive world of collectibles that runs alongside sports right like you can go into any sports stadium go into the uh the um what's it called like the top where is where where do you go buy things inside of sports stadiums like that by the way yeah david and i are really good at sports once upon a time once upon a time yeah um like the players drop i don't know you can go in and like you can buy signed baseball bats signed baseballs and now we can make more virtual representations of like whatever i don't know however they want to do this but like virtual collectibles uh and again like i don't think people are going to go and be like why would i buy this like digital version of like no no they're just going to buy it they're just my favorite athlete did this right like i want this memorabilia it's digital now that's even better because now i can display it on my phone it doesn't have to take up space in my house exactly so onboarding the world again again i think like i think of dapper more as sort of a side chain right and i think all of this will flow into the rest of the crypto economy it's all pi expanding good stuff team store is called a team store that's what it's called listeners needed to know that listeners are probably like what the hell guys don't you do any sports uh all right bitcoin stuff bitcoin's lightning network just reached all-time highs which is super cool to see i'm a huge supporter of lightning david like it is um a trustless way at lower cost of transaction to send bitcoin so i'm i'm pleased to see some adoption here and they're getting up to 3k they broke 3k yep uh 3k bitcoin that is so that's the equivalent of about 120 or so million dollars um so it's great to see lightning catch on part of this might be el salvador part of this might be um you know maybe the the twitter traction on tipping maybe that's too early i don't know but like other things like that um i will say if you go to d5 pulse right now lightning is number 41 on the d5 like it's not an apples to apples comparison right but um a 3k is more bitcoin than i have but like in the grand scheme of things it's not a lot yeah yeah but we'll be monitoring this and see how it goes and i think this is a good sign this is a bankless money system as well it's just always the question dave do people really want to spend their bitcoin i don't know and um have you ever used lightning it's it's pretty clunky no and most people most people haven't and most people think that they have except they've actually just used a custodial service that runs a lightning node for them exactly right and i think there's a reason the ethereum community abandons state channels yeah right um or hop across protocols but like payment channel state channels never really took off on ethereum and um until this whole l2 thing but also also like state channels built on um on an evm is fundamentally different than state channels built on a utxo model yep absolutely but anyway good news there uh david we should talk about the visa regulation or sorry not visa regulations but visas actually just released a white paper they are developing an interoperability concept so that central bank digital currencies can talk to cryptocurrencies and um i guess exchange trade with one another so this is like and other central bank digital currencies too right it's like a general interoperability network right um okay so i didn't read this entire white paper um but cool to see visa expanding the space any other takeaways for us here yeah my takeaway is they're the uh infrastructure for cbdc's is getting built out faster than the cbdc's actually are like the united states has not started china except except in china china's crushing it right crushing it right like they don't even need infrastructure they just need you know the actual cbdc which is that getting rolled out uh so visa is is like hey we have this interoperability like mechanism to bridge all the cbdc's and crypto and then like the actual like federal reserve united states is like cbdc's do we really need that i mean the answer is yes but like they don't even know it yet um but yeah the private market is like ahead of the public markets by orders of magnitude so i think i think visa is just like taking a gamble that at some point in time the u.s regulators will get their head out of their blanks and figure out that they do need a cbdc and then visa is like hey we're waiting we've been waiting for you yep absolutely visa is absolutely getting ahead they've seen the light with crypto uh even though us government has not let's talk about some more us government stuff this will tee us up for our next conversation david but one inch which is a dex aggregator did you know that they just blocked us traders for the first time so it's a geo block if you go to one inch from the us you'll be kicked off the site you'll be geo blocked out of it i know some folks use vpns but um step and i think they're doing this because they're planning to create a us-only product like bifurcate but like this is back to the story of like okay so a one-inch is an aggregator and user interfaces can be blocked the underlying smart contracts that power one inch and that power all of the assets and decentralized exchanges behind them those are things that cannot be blocked right so you can still have access to those because it's d5 because it's on ethereum but aggregators have a role and can definitely block individuals from using their platform and i hate going to these sites david and being present in the u.s and just because i'm a u.s citizen i can't freaking use it right like what's up with that right missed a dydx airdrop because of that tons of us citizens did right like it's no other country by the way it's not even like north korea and uh iraq china china but like uh it's so strange to be blocked out of this emerging financial system as a as a us citizen as a citizen of like a free country and i don't understand what's your take yeah uh so dex aggregators they are actually on the more centralized side of the spectrum they're not completely on chain i do believe there is some like web 2 infrastructure that is a component of aggregating all the dexes um sure yeah the order of routing is a smart contract on chain but i think the api pings and like getting in the information that is all done in a centralized fashion so like in theory like the dex aggregators are a a like have do have a centralized front end that can be blocked and that will actually mess up the point the choke point right that will actually mess up the product unlike uniswap unlike balancer unlike the actual true dexes out there and so like and they are and i think one of the reasons why we can definitely say that that's true is because they would well they're making a u.s version of their front end right what they actually like put on the us version versus the international version or how they differentiate those things who knows also they could say they tried right i think that's what what some of these companies are trying to do is uh we're trying to comply um speaking of trying to comply so the cftc just imposed a penalty this is the commodities of future exchange uh regulator in the u.s of 1.25 million against kraken for offering illegal off-chain digital asset trading and failing to register as required so i think this is maybe some of the futures the tldrs they gave their they gave their customers margin accounts and they didn't register with the cftc i mean i guess that's actually like pretty straightforward i won't totally i won't go harp on like yeah that that's actually relatively normal that's not like anybody targeting i see normal relatively normal things coming out of the cftc right yeah david like they seem at least to date they've been much more reasoned and rational about this and what's interesting about this is uh 1.25 million that's just like a slap on the wrist right for something like kraken yup um i mean kraken's probably like yep worth it [Laughter] wells fargo man i told you we'd get back to wells fargo here they are wells fargo has been over customers for like seven years in a row this is a final settlement from a case that that goes that spanned from like 2010 to 2017 or 2018 and what they were doing david if if you were a small business customer and you're trying to exchange say some like dollars for like euros or something they would actually give you the wrong amount okay so if it's like if if the exchange rate was like 1.08 they do like 1.052 just like switch around two judges and then pocket the rest okay and the whole cult like all of the like many the culture was to do this to cheat their customers right this is what what the settlement actually says um wells fargo created an atmosphere in which employees openly joked about and celebrated taking advantage of the bank's customers okay nice right you know what fixes this dex aggregators tell me right yeah like no person in the middle of this like you could see all of the transactions on chain on exchange that's what we're moving toward that is the reason for bank list so banks can't screw people over and it's nice for the doj the doj had to go prosecute this right in court had to catch them how many times are the banks not caught doing these things we'll never freaking know right but like the doj doesn't have to worry about this sort of thing if all of this is on chain and they could see the full transaction history and the customer does too which is important which is why what the huge missing component that wells fargo doesn't have to deal with is like report their on-train data of like how they actually got the number that they got right and then ryan if you remember i think in like 2013 or 2014 there was a big story as to how wells fargo um did so well after the oa crisis and then in 2014 they were charged with like uh the culture at wells fargo uh promoted their like sales people their bankers to open up as many accounts from their customers as possible and so they were charged with like i remember their their bankers being really really aggressive with their customers saying like hey you need to open up this account and this account in this account because they needed to make quota their bankers were sales people and so they got charged in 2014 for having a culture that promoted opening unnecessary accounts and they were also doing it to their customers without even asking their customers permission because the pressure on these bankers to make sales quotas were so incredibly strong that it became a toxic abusive relationship between the bankers and their employees right and so this is what happens when you have a financial system that is no longer innovating and growing and developing but has just switched to an extraction-based model because there's nothing left in the web legacy financial world so you have to extract as maximally as possible and there's no innovation there's only extraction left in that world absolutely rent collection gouging these are words that come to mind as you're talking about you know we need to do david is break up with our banks yeah i've heard this one that's what we need to do open finance guys this is the solution uh this is why we're on the journey um senator lemus might be on the journey as well at least she seems to be in our court we've been looking for advocates coming out of the senate she might be one in fact we're hoping to get around the banks podcast at some point in time but she uh laid out in front of the senate some principals for u.s digital currency talked about the role of stable coins talked about america's leadership in global financial services is something that the country should be proud of and they should extend that into cryptocurrency lean into it rather than trying to uh try to stop it and try to create barriers and blockers every time someone wants to do something with cryptocurrency that is a welcome message david any other takeaways from uh her notes here yep and uh i think we should keep on going absolutely good job and thank you yep well let's get to this um while we're talking about the us virgil griffith david do you want to start with this story because people might not be familiar with this story in the context uh give us that virgil griffith he is an ethereum developer that was actually before my time i never had the honor of meeting this guy for um those that know the uh the hamster dance or the skunk dance or the raccoon dance that like a lot of these core ethereum uh people did i can't remember at a devcon or something uh there's a funny little dance out there uh there are vitaliks out there carla flores they're all doing this funny funny little dance um and virgil griffiths was there too right uh and that's that's kind of where i see him in the space but like he's a very core part of some of the early days of ethereum uh very just overall proponent of how blockchains and crypto economic systems that span global communities cannot create global peace and he actually made the decision to go to north korea to give a talk at a north korean blockchain conference out there turns out north korea has crypto conferences too um and then when he came back he was arrested for violating sanctions and helping teach korea how to get around sanctions the criticism of that decision by the us government was that he didn't teach north korea anything that you couldn't have already found on youtube or just googled it apparently um but this uh so like granted there is a little bit of naivete like hey don't go to north korea and teach about crypto transactions a lot of naivety yeah but also at the same time like i like he's not doing anything inherently illegal right like according to the united states he was but like he was just promoting knowledge and education about this thing that is inherently open source right like they're gonna learn about it anyways uh and so the the guy he got arrested this news story has come out here is that he got rested a couple years ago the new story came out here that he had a trial he's been hammering on the fact that he's not guilty but his trial just started last monday and he opened up that trial with a guilty plead and a request for 6.5 years in jail whereas the maximum sentence could be up to 20 so he requested six um and there's this the story has to go from there but um that's the gist of it yeah i think it's it's definitely sad right i think that um virgil it it seemed to me had sort of a you know crypto utopian sort of vision and i think he was going to north korea which is obviously one of the worst regimes on the planet right very oppressive like terrible regime right but i think um virgil was going there perhaps with with good intentions as far as like you know uh talking about cryptocurrency and the freedom this could provide and kind of the the enhanced coordination it could provide and didn't realize um the full impact of his decisions right and um the us arrested him i think when he was coming home to visit family on thanksgiving coming to the us and he's actually been in the same for the last two months anyway it's the same prison that um uh jeffrey epstein was in uh for like the last two months so it can't have been pleasant i think there was an increasing amount of pressure on him to maybe plead guilty and not actually risk going into prison yeah yeah 20 years in prison so it's an unfortunate story because i don't think that um what he was doing was legally wrong in the in the eyes of the us government right i think his uh defense would say hey he wasn't he was just teaching them things that like they could find online and this is like an open conference and this is all publicly available on youtube and for my part i believe that that's true but like even if you think it was legally wrong i mean not not morally wrong right right and this is a very harsh sentence for um i guess the the stated crime of what virgil may or may not have done so uh kind of sad to see it david um from from my perspective i don't know if there's anything more to say on it it was so if for those that listened to the before bitcoin series we did where i read out peter pan's four-part series about the history of the cypherpunks this is in my mind a continuation of that story of people that dedicate their their lives towards cryptography in the social public systems the public good systems that they create and that ultimately runs and butts heads with nation states who don't like systems that are outside of their control of which cryptography is inherently about that um so amin soleimani who's the writer of this thread that we that we are looking at right now starts this thread off with his name is virgil griffith um it was fun to see everyone this week in new york but i'll admit i was walking around with a hole in my heart and a looming sense of dread virgil's trial starts this monday free virgil and then he goes through the history of both this case and also where it fits into the greater case of the the story of the cypherpunks um he uh he said um uh tweet number 12 he goes all of us in crypto today are downstream of the original cyberpunks we inherit their 50-year struggle to emancipate cryptography as a weapon to exclusively for militaries and provide it as a tool for individuals to use to protect their speech from illegitimate surveillance and so i feel like maybe if i put i don't again i never met virgil griffith i don't know what he's like but if i want to put my mind my brain inside the mind of a cypherpunk when you promote adoption of cryptography you promote adoption of public resources that can escape oppression uh and so maybe virgil's mind was like well i'm gonna go to north korea which is the site of the most oppression in the world and hope this information leaks out i don't know how that works but like i think from i think from a cypherpunk's perspective right and from somebody who's deep into into cryptography you're going to a terrible oppressive uh regime and you're kind of preaching the gospel you're kind of preaching like um freedom technology it's like going to a regime like this and talking about um the value of freedom of speech at least i think that's what it is like in virtual's mind right and i just contrast this it's very clear i think that the u.s government wanted to make an example out of virgil right because clearly this is not actually a national security threat in any way shape or form right um but like technically you know was a crime community just absolutely wanted to make an example out of this and i i just contrast that with like man the amount of people who went to jail after the you know 2008 shenanigans that went on it's like one guy maybe like virtually zero people right yeah we're just talking about the wells far fargo incident you know 73 million slap on the wrist right um sometimes the punishment far exceeds the quote-unquote crime committed i think this may be one of those cases so it's sort of a sad day in crypto yeah and just to tie this thread off uh tweet number 17 i mean goes today the u.s government treats cryptocurrency with as much superstition as it did with encryption in decades past i really like that framing treating crypto as superstition in that context they are attempting to cast virgil's presentation as a military military grade violation but just like encryption cryptocurrency will inevitably triumph for years now when cryptocurrency is widely adopted across the globe virgil's presentation to north korea north korea will appear trivial it will seem as silly as prosecuting someone for sharing that quote military secrets of https absolutely well said we'll leave it at that guys we're gonna cut to our sponsors and then we'll be back with some takes of the week here they are the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and

check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right guys we are back takes of the week let's start with this david this is it why don't you read this take and then i'll comment on it read your own tweet i will read it i don't want to read my own tweet that's too uh this guy this guy ryan sean adams i don't know who he has never met him before says my advice for the u.s one buy eth and btc for your treasury two issue a fed coin as an erc20 token three become the world's most friendly defy jurisdiction that's it that's literally all you have to do to win the next chapter of the internet right so what's this guy saying i mean i i couldn't have said it any better i i really do think the three things that the us needs to do and if it just does those three things hell like let's take two pick any two of those us government and crypt and you will be ahead of any other geographic jurisdiction on the planet but um i don't know they're not doing they're not doing any of these right now which makes me worried it's very simple some people think it's it's maybe more complicated than it is but it really is this simple buy bitcoin and eat issue a fed coin of some sort as an erc20 on ethereum and just be really friendly to the talented engineers that are building d5 in your country make it an appealing jurisdiction rather than pushing them outside which is what they're doing right now ryan you've made it seem really really simple but that's because you skipped a step which is step zero stop caring about all the incumbents and check your biases at the door that's why they're not doing that that's why it's not simple that's the tweet behind the tweet man some guy should tweet that out all right david why don't you take this one so this is interesting i'll read the headline here the sec is threatening coinbase to protect the public but not in the way you think okay um this is a fantastic thread that you should absolutely go and check out yourself we're not going to read the whole thing because it's a little bit long but basically uh juice uh oh juice underscore eth uh talks about how uh in because of the the like trying to get the recovery going after their pandemic the reserve requirement ratios for banks have gone from ten percent to zero percent and if we go yeah we're going to start at tweet number six here it goes banks are more or less offering the same interest rates as each other right now this is around 0.05 percent for decades there have not been any significant products with better rates whilst maintaining the convenience of the liquidity of the savings account until now uh at a five percent interest rate which is literally a 100 x improvement but then any savings account at a bank uh is what coinbase earn has offered their what was going to offer uh except here's the problem the problem is that the product is so good and it's such a no-brainer uh and can very realistically cause millions of depositors to move their savings to the coinbase earn product and then the last week that we're going to read is which means a concentration of dollars will suddenly be siphoned off into the institution coinbase banks with and every other bank would be left unable to meet that 10 reserve requirement so what they are worried about is that coinbase's products are going to be so incredibly successful that banks will never be able to actually return to a 10 collateralization requirement which is saying something about the power of these the uh the product the coinbase earned product that the sec uh told them that they were going to sue them if they've released that product okay so basically what he's saying is coinbase urn and crypto related products like this are so good that it's going to slurp in all of the money from the banking system right cause the banks to collapse and public we don't want a banking system collapse like 2008 again do we right so we're protecting you from that the product was so good that it's going to collapse the economy it's going to collapse this bank this this strong foundational banking system that we've propped up um yeah i you know i think that could be it i'm sorry if good products collapse the economy what the actual f are we doing look it goes back to the tweet that you were just talking about right which is like we don't want to disrupt the incumbents that's why we're doing this that's the tweet behind every tweet but two big behind every regular uh regulatory action that we're seeing that's aggressive towards crypto literally not allowed to have nice things because it'll break all the bad things in our entire society is built on bad things well you got a take on this right so this is actually uh well i don't know if it's your take or you know this guy davidhoffman.eth on twitter goes by the handle trustless state really smart guy he's got a cool punk crypto is going to nerf the sec is what you said this goes back to a post you wrote earlier in the week what do you mean by this yeah so uh gary gensler is coming at crypto super hard right trying trying to i think more or less do everything he can to have more and more jurisdiction over crypto basically wants everything to be a security right and like careful what's your wish for gary like if everything becomes a security i don't think you realize how trivial it is trivial it is to spin up a new token like spin up a new erc20 token spin up a new social token a new dow token a new nft that represents some in-game asset like if you do want all of those to be securities because what's more likely is it more likely that as a result of your desire to regulate all these things you actually have to ease back what it actually means to regulate those things or do you want everyone who ever issues a token to come knocking on you on your door wait in line with their forms and say hey gary gensler will you please give me my stamp like what's gonna what's gonna be more likely i think it's gonna be more likely that we're going to use this asset printing press which is the erc20 or erc 721 standard and print a bajillion tokens gary's gonna get real upset that they're all securities uh you know and but in order for him to legitimize what the sec does as a regulatory body they're just going to have to water down what it actually means to be a security right and so like sweet like this thing on my wall is a security like yay like everything's a security sec does not want to have jurisdiction and regulate like a flaming sword of god right yeah right like that's what you're saying because they're biting off way too much right like much more than they can chew and it's actually going to completely i guess uh water water down the definition of an end of a yeah yeah so if everything's a security nothing is guys let's take your next this next tweet david this is a i think a meme tweet that some people took seriously from bankless hq twitter what is this wait is the the headline isn't a meme that that's a real headline right no this is a meme dude oh is it oh okay oh i got i just ate the onion there in that case i love it got him got him all right well okay so the headline is that's that's makes more sense as to actually who's actually the picture uh depicting uh lindsey graham i believe is who that is and then the uh the bottom headline is senate bans nfts quote the trend is bankrupting our youth which i guess is a wink wing to the fact that like when you buy one nft the next thing that happens is you buy a second one and then right after that you buy a third one um that's funny because uh i'm pretty sure the guy that tweeted this michael wong he's working on a uh crypto satire website very much like the onion and we talked about how like our kpis is like how many people can we get to do you know the term eat the onion uh okay now tell me it's like when somebody like reads an onion article and then they take it seriously and they start blowing it up on twitter it's like oh yeah you just ate the i just i just ate the onion yeah and so like the the secret skunk works project out of the bank list ow is there's gonna be a crypto satire website show tv uh website like news organization very much like the onion that has meme only headlines and the kpi is like all right how many times can we get people to like actually believe some of the bs headlines that we're gonna write that's awesome i guess i'm the first victims son of a yeah well here here's here's the bottom behind this this is a meme guys but the fact that people think it's real is exactly why congress is failing us right there's a take this this this trend is uh bankrupting our youth senate bands nfts that's why congress is failing us because people actually believe that's true i have another confession for you david this this is my meme oh is this yours it's not michael i was thinking about the satire thing and everything you said and i was like you know what i'm going to throw a meme up yeah hey sometimes uh the ryan sean adams memes they'll get you they're okay they don't know they're they're great you just don't know you just don't know when they come yeah you just it's a surprise every time all right um let's do this golden age of building david we'll look back on the 2020s and remember it as the golden age of building this is another tweet that you uh put out there last week what does this mean yeah um uh once upon a time in high school i was really into the world of aviation and in the world of aviation there's the the golden age of aviation which was the 1930s uh it's just which is when so much innovation happened and a lot of the same technologies that we use today for flying in aviation was found in the 1930s and i think that that is what we are seeing here with the 2020s uh when when this decade is over uh i think we're going to look back and be like god that was fun remember when there was cool those were great times yeah so like it's actually a call to action for everyone listening just like hey take a moment reflect and remember what it's like to be where we are today because we only get to do this once uh and it's it's it's a good time regardless of all the uh regulator fomo uh out there uh or regulator fuzz excuse me yeah fomo but with denial is fun there you go um and so yeah like hey we're in the golden age of building there's cool stuff being built every single week there's cool things happening and i i'm i think we will look back with nostalgia on this era i totally agree i'm super grateful to be here like i you know i'm grateful for all the listeners and um you know that that kind of that sense of gratitude really um underlies i think the best projects that they know they're early they know they're doing something super cool and uh yeah it's it's really important to pause and just reflect on that sometimes david good thought man absolutely let me ask you this last question of the week what are you excited about dude okay so i was at uh m-con last week and uh maine or excuse me emcon two weeks ago and uh mainnet new york last week met a ton of cool people and like the number of times that i would go up to one of the booths at mainnet at missouri mainnet and just like meet with some people somebody would say like hey like the reason why i got this job at company x or project y is because like you and ryan kept on like just yelling at me to get a job in crypto either on either on the newsletter or on the podcast like you guys say like hey like you can do it like you can you can quit your legacy job and get a job in crypto and so i did it i think i ran into like i think seven people at main net and that's not even counting i'm uh emicon that said like hey like i got a job in crypto because you because you guys at bank list like really encouraged me and inspired me to do that and so i'm honored and humbled that people actually listen to us at all and the fact that you guys uh so many of you have gotten jobs in crypto uh is also thank you for helping turn this into the golden age of building because the people that quit their jobs to take the take this step into crypto and take that risk are the people that are going to be pioneering so many more people in crypto in the future so thank you for taking that leap and if you are yet to take that leap what are you waiting for like don't miss out it's a fun time as we say it's people all the way down nothing more exciting than attracting good people to this space that's absolutely awesome here david yeah and before i ask you what you're excited about ryan hey look according to twitter it's international podcast day look at that hey happy international podcast today do you know what episode number this is uh this will be the weekly i don't know what weekly rollup number this is but we are how many podcasts do you think we've done right now uh the actual monday podcast will be number 89 i think state of the nation we're up to like 60-ish weekly roll-ups we're at like 40. yeah take 80 i guess like roughly like multiply that by four yeah probably what we're what we're doing because we do like well no because the podcast started earlier than all the other ones so i say like like like three maybe so we're definitely over 200 i think we're bringing to two to three hundred well there you go okay when they will count while you tell me what what you're excited about i'm going to go to lipstick that's the account yeah i'm gonna look that up okay what's your number what's your number uh my number is 364. okay all right now tell me what you're excited about ryan all right so while you're looking that up uh what am i what i'm excited about is also the banquets podcast right now because 245. oh god i was way up 245 podcasts that's still good that's so great now how many hours is that multiply that by like at least 1.5 yeah 1.5 multiply that by 1.5 uh all right so um we just secured a dream guest on bankless right it's like when we started the bankless podcast we had a list of like i don't know five ten names that we're like hey we will we'll be doing it if we get this name and now we got one of those names another one off the list super excited about it not gonna reveal it now coming later in october well the big reveal soon but we're very excited and i think this just reflects as like one of the reasons i got into crypto and started like in you know crypto media i got into crypto first i thought all i wanted to do was invest right but then i realized like like investment and kind of like narrative and learning about this stuff we can learn about this stuff collectively right that's why we started bank uh and that's why we started the bank podcast to go on the journey together because we can level up together and one thing we realize very early david is if crypto is going to go mainstream there has to be a big tent around it right it can't just be like this isolated cult of weirdos and geeks right it has to saturate itself into all areas of culture and so that's why we're doing bankless is to saturate crypto and defy and these values into culture so that means like politicians that means regulators that means musicians that means investors anybody who's out there we want to get them on the bankless podcast and here's the beautiful thing about it david is like if they adopt crypto protocols okay they adopt crypto values all right we tricked them we got them and that's how we change the world as long as our values are embedded in the protocols when they adopt crypto they don't know it but they're adopting crypto values when they buy that nft what's that nft secured by what's it paying out right what's it propagating the economic security of ethereum which is a decentralized money system that embodies crypto values so this is a covert ops man and we're doing it by getting these big guests by like listeners tuning in by you hitting the subscribe on youtube if you haven't subscribed yet you are helping to propagate crypto values and crypto culture to the world and that's what i'm excited about today that was a great answer um i'm looking forward to talking to that guest of which we've named on this show before so i will say that of which of which we've named so you can go back in past episodes all of them every single one start writing all 200 and how many 200 245 yeah yeah it shouldn't take long you give me the week meme of the week time let's do this what are we looking at all right we are looking at that famous picture of two people getting divorced and uh they're separating out their beanie babies this was in the 90s i believe but instead of beanie babies they're nfts so we got these this couple one's pulling out a cool cat the other one's about to grab a meat bit there's a crummy squiggle in there if you get divorced make sure make sure you know which who's getting what nfts that is a very very important point sir that's awesome all right guys don't hopefully there's not going to be hopefully don't get divorced but also hopefully our nfts don't go by the way of beanie babies yeah is that what this is yeah what are those beanie babies worth now hilarious too much right guys uh this has been the weekly roll up of course none of this has been financial advice ethan's risky d phi is risky beanie b i'm sorry i mean nfts are risky as well you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is a frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot and for those
