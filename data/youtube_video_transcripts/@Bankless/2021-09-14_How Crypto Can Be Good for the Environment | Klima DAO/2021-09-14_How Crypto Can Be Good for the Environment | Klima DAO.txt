[Music] hey bankless nation today i'm talking with three members of klima dao klima is a fork off of olympus dow which is a treasury backed uh algo stable coin but clemat has repurposed that same model to help sequester carbon out of the environment and this is a climate focused dow that is generating a currency that is backed by carbon credits so there's it's one part uh offering financial exposure to carbon credits which have been a fantastically performing asset in 2020 and uh from what i've gathered this is an asset that as carbon gets more and more expensive which the trend is that it does get more and more expensive this treasury asset by clement dow also in theory would go up in value this this project is tackling the idea of making carbon production extremely expensive while also allowing nonprofits or companies that actually sequester carbon and actually earn carbon credits that make them more valuable right so it's just net positive in the sense that it disincentivizes carbon production and incentivizes carbon sequestering uh this project really gets me excited because it's one of the core like foundational principles of crypto that we can coordinate at larger scales than nation states because nation states aren't solving the climate problem maybe they can help mitigate it maybe there's some efforts that's happening but in terms of actually like really turning this whole like climate change thing around i think it's going to take coordination scales that are larger than what we've currently have which has always been why crypto has been so exciting like coordination around larger problems and that's what i see coming out of klima dow so let's go ahead and get right into this interview with the folks from kalima dao they were fantastic interviewers uh they were they're all anonymous so there's only my face that you're going to see but you're going to see their little avatars light up when they speak and then if you're watching on the podcast don't even worry about that and overall they were fantastic guests very hard-hitting very precise in their speech so they were they were just lovely to interview so let's go ahead and get right into that interview but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at bankless we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms balancers mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi all right bankless nation i am here with three team members from klima dao which is a carbon-backed digital currency an algorithmic climate protocol and today we are going to find out what the hell that means and more about what climate climate dao actually is uh so guys you guys want to take turns introducing yourself starting with a dionysus cheers david uh great to be here um so yes i'm diagnosis i have a background in carbon markets and in the environmental field ranging from project development and ecosystem restoration uh remote sensing technologies etc uh and been a big fan of d5 over the years and luckily hooked up with the right people to help make kalima happen so that's me fantastic our communities how about you yeah great great to be here thanks thanks dave for having us um i'm i'm mostly an engineer i've built everything from mvp to production great stuff in all sorts of fields in d5 under a number of names and so um really stoked to be working on something too and like i also have a background in carbon markets and building ecosystems in that space too fantastic and i'm going to try and not butcher this name but here goes uh ox silos oxilos yeah how was that and then also uh tell me about yourself that was great thanks yeah i mean again great to be here as well so i sit right between the other two basically so i'm i was an engineer but i've been like diving deep in carbon markets for a long time now and kind of building stuff at the intersection of crypto and climate kind of like merging the two and um with a special focus on daos and here we are building a diode that is actually um doing exactly that bringing all these pieces together okay so let's go ahead and get right into it what is climadow what are its goals um and why do we need it and i'll let you guys decide who should answer that first okay i'll take this on because i think i've done a thousand pitches at this point to various people um so clean it down what is it well basically we are we're using the mechanics of olympus and to basically create a non-chain demand for carbon offsets and the way the reason for this is basically you want to create demand and basically suck up the supply of carbon offsets and place them in a treasury and create a currency that's issued and backed by carbon offsets so using carbon as the denomination of currency value and why do we need this well there's a number of reasons why we need this but primarily it's it's to drive the price of carbon up and basically to create pressure on individuals corporations everybody who are basically purchasing offsets to actually do something about their footprint instead of buying their way out of it okay so uh i'm gonna interrupt you guys and just like you know check my understanding every now and then and so my understanding is that there there are these carbon credits out there uh carbon credits are not anything to do with crypto they are you know credits like uh generated by government policy uh to allow some sort of free market to help uh manage the control of carbon and you guys are trying to uh capture and hoard as much carbon credits as possible using the same using a fork of olympus dow and the idea is that if you generate a currency that is backed by these carbon credits the carbon credit treasury grows and grows and grows which is kind of like a pseudo way to sequester carbon from the world by hoarding carbon credits using crypto tools is that right it's it's pretty close um it's basically there's a difference right because you're touching carbon credits so there's a difference between the compliance market which you just mentioned which is you know governments that give out the right to pollute which are also called emission allowances and then the what are called carbon offsets which are generally uh carbon projects with actually plant trees or uh you know renewable energy projects that are created and then audited by third-party standards and then create these carbon offsets which are not really government controlled but so that's called the voluntary carbon market and uh climate starts by interacting with this latter one so the voluntary carbon market which is the only true global carbon market out there right um because the other ones are always linked to a certain jurisdiction so we start off uh with the voluntary carbon market so this is like an opt-in market no one is forcing companies but they just do it of their own uh exact incentives just to be good entities in the world in the world pretty much yeah i mean if you hear you know the microsoft or the blackboard so the world's coming out with we're going to be carbon neutral or even we're going to you know compensate for our historic footprint what they talk about is exactly this uh this market the voluntary market um which has been growing like quite quite a lot this last year because more and more companies come out and make claims um about you know their climate targets so um but you know definitely the dionysus is even is the guy to talk to if you want to know much more about the intrinsic like the all of the intricacies of this market totally yeah our communities die nice as you guys have anything to add oh yeah i just say that you know there's a number of factors right now that are really driving the voluntary carp carbon market forward one you have like massive commitments by different corporates because of consumer pressure oftentimes that you know we want to be buying products that are green or that have less impact on the environment so these companies are internalizing that negative environmental cost um and you know they're rectifying that through the purchase of carbon offsets and i think the key piece with carbon offsets um is that these are delivering finance to sustainability projects around the world that are helping to either mitigate the release of carbon emissions or actually remove them from the atmosphere so on the removal side you have things like aforestation projects simply planting trees or mangroves and on the mitigation side you have projects you know such as solar or wind energy installations that are you know basically stopping fossil fuels uh from being um you know feeding electricity into the grid instead you're doing it in a renewable way okay so uh check my learning on that one uh there are a bunch of projects nonprofits entities maybe even companies that are are able to produce carbon offset credits based off of what they are doing and uh a is that correct and then b because when they produce these carbon offset credits if they are higher valued in the market these companies are more sustainable more fundable more profitable and therefore more sustainable yeah there's a really foundational piece to the voluntary carbon market and carbon offset projects in general and that's this idea of additionality and what that means is that all of these projects wouldn't have happened let's say naturally in the market unless they were given this additional finance from the sale of carbon offsets so for instance um you know next year you won't be able to produce carbon offsets from renewable projects in countries like you know the united states or in europe because renewables in those countries uh you know they're already cost competitive with fossil fuels you don't need the additional finance to make them realized essentially but you'll still be able to issue offsets from renewable projects in places like india for instance where you know you still need that extra nudge to make sure that instead of producing another coal uh coal powered uh power plant you're instead uh erecting wind turbines for example okay so but the the original um like model that i gave i want to just double check and make sure that's true uh klima dao is trying to purchase and hoard as much credits as possible in order to like add scarcity to the secondary market which is is good because that makes producing carbon more expensive and it also makes sequestering carbon or all these renewable sources more profitable that that's the model 100 yeah so i mean you can think of essentially where we're game stopping almost the the voluntary carbon market right so we're creating we're using the um incentive structure to yeah exactly we're using this infrastructure that uh to drive more and more demand for these carbon credits so we by reducing the supply we drive up the price which makes um compensating your emissions actually more costly which will drive polluters to actually remove reduce their emissions which is what we want to be seeing right and furthermore there's like i think an additional component that we haven't touched on which is we're democratizing the access also to this asset class which you know all the experts are quite um agreeing upon that the price of garbage is definitely going to increase in the coming years and um what keema does it actually ex like allows d5 users to you know be part of that right be part of that rising market and actually um help drive the price up right because it's like this this positive reinforcement loop which means that the more people um bring carbon offsets to the clema protocol the more less there is supply on the market so the intrinsic value of the treasury grows which we are basically contributing to the price of it actually increasing so um i think this is i think this is the most powerful component of it actually so i do want to dive into more crypto stuff but one one more question on the basic incentives around these carbon credits because that's like an area i'm super unfamiliar with if the since this is an opt-in voluntary like economy if the cost of carbon goes up won't that just disincentivize participation and people will be like okay well it was fun to help be a part of this economy and do good for the planet when it only costs us like a couple basis points but if the cost of carbon goes up and it actually starts to like you know immaterially impact the profitability of companies won't they just like opt out and be like well that was fun but like now now we want to make sure we're profitable as possible so like now that this is expensive we don't want to do this anymore like what's stopping people from doing that it's a great question and i think to kind of illustrate why uh carbon offsets are still such a powerful tool and companies are really internalizing these costs regardless of some of the things that are going on financially probably the best year ever for the voluntary carbon market happened uh during this this covet-induced economic downturn so even though you know this is really hitting companies bottom lines in many cases there's just so much evidence and i think companies realize like we have to do something in the climate crisis and offsets provide this really streamlined way to deliver finance to projects which are going to have positive uh climate effects in the years to come which is in everybody's best interest yeah to add to that like you can opt out for sure like if it becomes too expensive for you um but then you're gonna face like huge backlash right because a lot of these companies that are opting in right now they are basically signaling to everyone that they're doing something about what their footprint is but you know they're only if they're only doing it when it's profitable for them then like obviously they're going to get called out harshly for that and that's not you know the route they want to be perceived at like you know you you will definitely like it'll then become a cost reduction exercise elsewhere right so like if i know that offsets cost me 300 a ton but it costs me 60 a ton to do do something internally like reduce my emissions from some sort of you know power plant output or something i'll do that instead right like you then then your commitment that you made like saying that you're going to be carbon neutral by 2030 or 2040 or whatever you said publicly you will then have to then look elsewhere to do to do something interesting for cool guys okay so like basically these these commitments are like backed by social incentives rather than like legally enforced requirements it's more backed by like social legitimacy which i mean is a powerful force yeah absolutely yeah i think i've heard somebody telling me that the voluntary carbon market is moving into a direction of being a pledge compliance market so actually all these companies who came out making public pledges now have to comply with their own their own announcements basically and i actually i found this yeah i think this is really for me it was really yeah this this is what we have right now right like it's not and the market has always been you know this oh yeah you know it's nice we can you know offset our emissions etc but like now we have a different era basically we're entering into an era where people understand that internalizing the cost of carbon is it's just like it's just a natural way of doing things and like just creating like a an even playground and playing field for for doing internal accounting so um i'm personally not very worried about companies opting out um if they are i think consumer pressure will will do the rest okay great okay look guys let's let's dive into the crypto side of things um uh so uh olympus dow is and again correct me if i'm wrong i'm not super familiar with it but uh it's a algorithmic stable coin semi-backed algorithmic stable coin project and you guys are just forking it to um do your own thing uh is that right um sort of like we so we're all original omis so we're all we've all been part of the olympus community from the get-go we really like the mechanics it's a fully backed currency so every home that exists there's at least one die in the treasury right so you know that there's an intrinsic value fundamentally to your currency which is a really fascinating concept i mean they introduced a whole new set of tools like um liquidate its own to buy your protocol like all sorts of stuff and like bond purchasing to actually you know purchase of that from users is fantastic um so we we looked at that and we said well what if we applied this to carbon markets like something we know really well we're like okay well this makes a lot of sense of these types of incentive structures like putting stuff into a treasury um you know paying for for liquidity outright and making sure that you have like you basically develop a whole market on chain with with the actual community itself we looked at olympus we're like this could be it so then we started experimenting we started thinking about okay testing here and there and then we approached them and said can we can we do it can we can we use your your contract and do so and from the get-go it's been a collaborative effort with them like we didn't want to just be seen as a fork we took their idea and kind of moved things on we wanted to be seen as like uh improvement like we're you know we're kind of advancing the tech i i myself contributed quite early to a lot of the tech that happened at olympus a lot of the design design decisions that happened and it's fantastic because it's you know we get to give back finally so like you know we've written a bunch of improvements and stuff like that but we have their not only their blessing but like also their collaboration like we gave them a significant portion of early tokens um in the form of peak limas that they can exercise at a future time um basically saying like look in the future we want to work together and we want to want to make sure that we can build something really cool we even explored the idea of like joint bonds like ohm climate bonds where you have dye exposure for climate users and then you have carbon exposure for ohm users you know stuff like that um that's all stuff that we were kind of from the beginning we said no let's let's not just you know let's involve them because it's you know fair tech that we're leveraging and you know we're using a bunch of other people's tech as well so it 100 has to be like a collaborative effort to make sure that we succeed and um and and yeah and then that's how we've been approaching it from from the start so it's really it's it's um like the whole mechanics of olympus down make a lot of sense not just for olympus themselves but like as a fundamental innovation in d5 like like as a primitive like this would be copied and worked for as needed yeah like there there's there's like a lot of talk about what pool 2 is right basically that you have to constantly provide incentives in the form of liquidity mining tokens or whatever just for people to maintain liquidity and once the liquidity rewards run out people move on to the next project right which is exactly what we saw with d5 farming you know last year or the year before where people were just thinking obscene apys farming and liquidity and then leaving right and then pulling the whole thing out and then the project would die in this case you know olympus basically presented the solution that they will own the liquidity so there's no risk of anyone ever leaving or pulling the liquidity out of their own protocol that would make no sense right and this to me and many others i've seen like people talk about it has completely changed the relationship you have with d5 projects because you now have this like assurance that the protocol is going to stay right like they they became they earn fees off the off the trading they may or they own the liquidity like there's a whole host of benefits that come out of it that are really really fascinating and you know as a primitive i'm sure it'll become adopted in in some form or another by many many protocols where they actually end up owning the liquidity of their own of their own of their own protocol because you have to like it makes all the sense in the world right like you want to ensure this whereas like you know there was a there was like this morning actually we were talking about alchemics they spent 20 million a month or something like that on liquidity incentives which is not like that's that's a huge cost that you can just reduce if you just own the liquidity so anyway like long story short like we looked at this and said like this is fantastic let's apply it and let's modify it for for carbon and all the stuff that we really understand and and you know we've been working ever since we got the lbp coming up on tuesday we had the ido which was super successful over over 575k raids from users they got a sweet nft made by sven oh my goodness like i can't talk uh enough about how awesome that was there's so many people who were telling us oh this is like the coolest nfd ever um so it's it's coming together and we're really really excited for what this could do hey guys in the second half of the show we dive even deeper into the crypto side of things we talk about the klima dow token as a currency how can it have induced demand both from inside the dow and outside the dow as well as just how can it be used as a social social signaling currency we know people social signal with nfts all the time can the klima dow token as a currency also be used as social signaling uh that's that's i think is an interesting question since we all since in the first half of the show we talked about how uh the there are these opt-in climate markets which are just done because of social incentives can we also leverage those same social incentives to get the klima dow token more just like you know absorbed into the world right because demand for the clean medal token creates carbon sequestering down the line i asked about the road map um what's necessary to bootstrap the this whole entire ecosystem uh and then also the long-term like imagine a maximally successful version of klima dow what does that look like for the dow what does that look like for the dow token what does that look like for the world how does it help change the world for a better so all those conversations are coming in the second half of the show but before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in d5 or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com okay so uh you guys have a very clear mission and it sounds like you guys have the infrastructure to achieve those those goals but one of the things that needs to happen is you actually have to induce demand of the stable coin uh there's a stable coin that results uh out of the the the klima dao fork of olympus dial right right yeah i mean it all depends on the definition of stablecoin right i i think you had this conversation on on your podcaster uh at least i heard an episode about it so it's it's not a packed currency okay it's a backed currency right so we are creating we're creating clima which is a token that is backed by carbon credits but it's not packed to any existing price because there is no global price for carbon right and this is part of the exercise here is to create something like a meta index that can serve as something like you know at least a signal for for the price of carbon even though we very much anticipate the price of time to trade at a premium um of of carbon because there's obviously additional like incentives and rewards attached to to the climate to the climate currency right so are there there are two tokens right one's the dow token one's the currency token no so there's uh the collateral which is um an index token called the base carbon ton which essentially is a carbon index token that is denominated in one tonne of carbon and which is essentially a token that is backed by a basket of different carbon offsets from different projects and then this is essentially what we place as dye which goes into olympus treasury we only accept base carbon tons and then uh on that basis we meant the klima currency which is really really that right it's like a it's currency token it is also the governance token of the key medal so it is like the dow token as the dow grows this in theory would also grow in value exactly but the whole point here right is to the more base carbon tan tokens we have in the treasury the more chemo can be minted because each clima is by you know policy always backed by at least one ton of carbon so one bct and this means that if we have more bct in the treasury the protocol actually means additional climate tokens and it does so by rewarding people who stake fema so there's a possibility to stake your clima to kind of go long you know go long on civilization and you know not sell and all the people that are staking receive the newly created uh chemotherapy so the inflation goes to the people who huddle basically right um so and this obviously creates an additional incentive or like you know a reward for people which um what we see in olympus means that the ohm which is the you know equivalent of clima in olympus trades at a premium like substantial premium compared to the underlying which uh in their case is dying in our cases um the base carbon ton so how uh how would you characterize the uh pricing of the klima dow token if it is the currency like it's not going to appreciate in value in the same way like the uni dow token or the snx dow token would because of uh its issuance right like as more uh collateral gets added to the treasury more climate gets issued which kind of kind of is what like um you know a typical fiat currency does right like as there's more in the senate the you know federal reserve with the central bank they issue more currencies to stabilize that price um the details of that we can leave behind uh but like how is the klima token how would you describe its like equilibrium of how it's going to be priced or or is it more like emergent do we even know it's kind of hard because like if you look at olympus and how it trades right like the same mechanics apply here right like they have a fundamental in theory olympus should only be worth one dollar right because each ohm is worth one die uh and intrinsically right but then there's also risk pre-value associated with how much like other assets they have on their treasury and basically other things that back this currency um and so it trades at a premium far above that right like you know two or three hundred dollars almost and and the same is true here like is in many ways yes it's backed by carbon tons and carbon tons present like an intrinsic value but predicting kind of the longer term what it'll trade out is is difficult for a number of reasons but also like you know how do you quantifiably measure carbon governance on chain as valuable right like it's a we will that'll only emerge once we know like that what the market basically values that and says like okay like you know this should trade at a 5x premium above the underlying collateral or the should trade at a 10x or 100x whatever like that is fundamentally kind of how but that that's like that's the the premium value that's associated like an olympus like there's a premium associated with all these people managing this thing you know the the contributor discords like 200 people like it's ridiculous like they they work work together on all sorts of things to actually make sure the whole thing runs and uh and you know this will be no different like we already have like you know tons of people asking to just kind of move things together and and really um work out so that premium is hard to quantify because like you're essentially signing a price to uh you know what is the dow worth like as a community right and and in in olympus 100 like it's the community is everything there right like it's 13 000 people now almost and they are it's it's a fantastic community to be a part of it's one of the coolest d5 communities i've ever been and it's that's awesome and so we're we're hoping to you know replicate something very very similar in what we're doing and maybe just to add like this is exactly the reason why we're doing a liquidity bootstrapping pool because it you know it's basically the best way to create price discovery from the get-go and we we as a team you know we don't know we don't know what the price should be we'll find out next week so yeah um this is um this is as exciting for for us as it it's uh for everybody else very cool very cool yeah so okay so like the answer to the question is it'll be emergent like we'll find out yeah yeah but i think maybe maybe one dimension to add which is important is that it's not actually about the price so the the thing is as you say right there's there's there's inflation happening and the inflation obviously means that um it pushes the price down but what happens is um given that the um people who stake actually get rebased so there's a rebase that takes place every eight hours which means that if you are staking um you actually get you know fresh climate into your into your wallet every eight hours which means that uh first of all you're auto compounding your position but you also you know it doesn't matter at the end of the day if the price goes down because you're rewarded with the additional amount of currency in your wallet okay so it's kind of a you know volatility dampened um scenario more than that it is like you know pegged or anything like that so how do you induce demand into the klima token like if it is a currency like the treasury of uh of climate dow sequestering carbon credits from the voluntary markets uh that will be easier if you can induce demand into the klima token is there a plan to like induce demand somehow yeah so that's exactly what oxalos was talking about is like the staking rewards are basically the long-term apis of you know four four digit plus basically like that's like the whole incentive in olympus right like it's just steak because um by use taking and me staking we're basically contributing to pulling liquidity off the market and basically into this staking pool and then you know further um you know increasing demand while not having supply enough supply for the actual token um and klingon basically operates in exactly the same way like it's it's entirely designed to to do so and once you have that you basically because you could get stats just like raw stats from olympus for instance 85 of people are staking 15 actually exists on the open market uh or in various pools for whatever people are doing so it's actually not a whole lot to purchase which means that you know the purchasing power every time someone does is um you know is is always increasing and pushing price up and the same is true here like you know we want to incentivize staking under the same rewards to basically make sure that you have uh this incentive to hold for as long as possible so okay so here's my concern with that um and this is like a a model almost all i think every single crypto asset largely operates on the same like every single crypto asset is a ponzi game bitcoin started the ponzi game there's 21 million units because they're incentive to to hold because they're scarce that people hold them and and then the price goes up because people hold hoard them and then at some point people start to sell because it's a ponzi game meaningfully different from a ponzi scheme which is that like somebody's actually getting a rug pulled no one rug pulls with bitcoin it's a ponzi game that we're all playing and like one of the big criticisms uh that i've heard about um algorithmic stable coins of which i know like uh olympus dow is not but and and therefore mcdowell is also not but like one of the big criticisms of uh like algorithmic stable coins is that there's like this there are they are a ponzi game with like too short of a loop right and so when i when i ask like how do you guys induce demand uh there's internal demand which is what you guys have just illustrated but there's also external demand and that external demand in my mind is what like makes these things long-term sustainable because if you have value capture going to all these people who are staking and like by that you are incentivizing people to buy off a secondary market in order to stake in order to capture value it turns it into a ponzi game because the more people that participate like if you got in first and if you got an earlier than everyone else it turns into a game of chicken as like all right like are you going to sell are you going to sell who's going to sell first and it turns into like like you know the price can only go up so much before people start to like all collectively you know tap out and play chicken and then they sell all their profits and then it turns in while it was like recursive and reflexive on the way up it might be reflexive on the way down have you guys thought about this yeah this is actually so this is uh one of my favorite points to talk about the the forever ponzi game idea because rightfully so like you know exactly as you described like we're all just playing ponzi game and who's ever selling first is kind of on the way up that being said things are a little bit different yeah it may appear as a ponzi on the outside in the case of olympus and klima because yeah stakers are getting perpetually rewarded for what but what's underpinning the entire thing is bonds so bonds in the form of basically i come with a certain amount of currency i pay for klima's at a discount and in exchange i get cleaners after a certain period of time or i get ohms after a certain period of time so what ends up happening is you have this mechanic called 1-1 or basically i bond and someone else bonds and then staking is considered a three three um basically the game theory mechanic that revolves around that and and selling is considered a negative three action right so if we both sell negative three negative three like the you know the the protocol basically dwindles as a result and there's no like you know positive um income there like loop there so ends up happening is bonds bounds basically take this whole thing away and that's that's not where so the stickers aren't just getting rewarded for the sake of staking like they're not these rewards aren't getting generated out of thin air they're getting generated out of bonds and so if bonds basically trade at a premium slightly below the market and what that really is it's the protocol paying users for particular things in exchange for assets so in the case of you know olympus they pay users for die at a discount off the market and say we'll give you homes but you want give us dive so we can put it in our treasury and so like let's say home is trading for three hundred dollars and they offer a ten percent discount that means that person can buy you know um they can buy it for 270 bucks from the protocol and after five days i'll have to be home so what that really does is it gives the treasury 270 dollars to then issue 270 more ohms so they actually purchase die at a discount from the user and the user is basically this is and this is how the whole idea of intrinsic treasury value and risk free value emerges as well is basically um over time so intrinsic value is fundamentally the idea that one ohm is worth one die in the case of climate is one climate is worth one base carbon ton over time you then basically have this the more people purchase bonds you have this over collateralization that kind of occurs you have so many assets in the treasury that if everyone pulled out their home at the same time they would get a certain amount of money uh based on basically a run on the bank right so if everyone decided i'm going to sell ohms for whatever then then you look at the risk free value the risk free value is how many assets exist in the treasury per ohm that exists in circulation so in the case of i think the last figure that i looked at was about 26 meaning that for every home that exists there's 26 assets that back it and and this basically means that there is a floor fundamentally on what you're doing and this just grows with time like you just look you look at the charts and you can see you can see the same thing so this is kind of what prevents it as a ponzi because a ponzi implies that if everyone pulled their money out at the same time somebody would be a loser and get nothing in this case everyone gets something and it's you know slightly more than what it originally is and the same is true here like you will get something and that's something is you'll get a certain amount of carbon funds and those particles have value you know across the board in terms of other ecosystems lots of nft artists are trying to do carbon offsetting you have organizations that are working on you know carbon offsetting uh bitcoin as a protocol like this whole host of things that are emerging on chain um very recently like this year almost like january was kind of like the really the kickstart for a lot of this and it's just it's growing with time like you have more and more people who are working on all sorts of things so in the same instance while it may appear as a ponzi on the outside what it really is is that you have to look at the risk-free value of the treasury and once you understand that then you say okay my you know my climate trades at this much i can get this many tons if something bad happens and fundamentally you're never go you there is no chance of you ever being on the losing end of a ponzi because on a ponzi like there's a very real chance that you you end up with nothing right like and that's not the case in in olympus dot work cleanup but i would agree with your point like creating external demand for this is obviously like our long-term goal right and it's certainly increasing the resilience of the whole system right and we can see this like very much playing into like the other happy default protocol that are all out there and you know i can't wait to get a loan out of you know my climate tokens that like or whatever or you know use it as collateral in make it out or you know you name it so i think at the beginning right we we we're here to you know prove a point we're here to establish a new currency that is backed by something that we actually care about and that actually has real impact on on our planet and if we can turn this into a sustainable model you know we can adjust the the staking rewards and you know this has happened in in olympus now as well so um this is this is a protocol that has very much the you know the control over their financial or like the monetary policy and we can tweak it to you know be functioning on different levels you know and achieving different objectives and going more towards stability and in the long run while maybe once we want to incentivize as many carbon tons to be locked up in the protocol at the beginning so um getting getting you know getting keema in into other protocols as quickly as possible yes please right um and that's what we hear people learn about it and this is how connections happen in encrypt is there a conversation to be had about these um opt-in incentives uh we talked about how there's this voluntary carbon market which is news to me so thank you for teaching me about that uh and like apparently these incentives social incentives are so strong that like it actually commits these companies to like align with their own pledges and like forces them into economic actions uh even though they're not legally bounded to these things is there some sort of conversation to be had about some sort of like opt-in social incentives to purchase the claim at dow token like maybe that's like another like social signaling things like hey like look at my look on my open c it's got all these cool nfts oh and then also that same wallet has a balance of like klima tokens because i'm a good samaritan who wants to sequester carbon from the world is there a conversation do we have about about that if i could jump in real quick on this just to point out um one consideration i think the social contract is a big part of the value of carbon but there's other price pressures as well and some of them are also regulatory uh so just as an example in the colombian carbon tax system essentially companies have to source offsets that come from domestic projects in colombia and a lot of these are actually coming from the voluntary carbon market what that in effect has done is it's actually raised the price floor for different types of forest conservation projects that are coming from that region on the voluntary carbon market right and so i think one of the the beautiful things about klima in terms of you know being in the d5 space is that there's a price price pressure to really uh you know raise the value of bct's that's not just coming from internal to to the d5 space there's actually this an external market where there's a confluence of factors that are working to actually raise the price floor of of carbon and i think that's that's quite a unique thing um that the klima has to offer and then in terms of you know really incentivizing usage in the space uh you mentioned nfts i think the nft artists have been absolutely massive over the last couple of months and really raising awareness about climate issues and a lot of them are choosing to actually offset uh you know the footprints of of their nfts you know it's calculated there's there's various groups that have looked at proof of work of ethereum and they've broken it down uh you know thinking of of groups like carbon fyi throughout cetera uh co2 also did work in this space and you know essentially they aren't just saying okay we're producing all these things let's take care of the carbon footprint and you know a lot of their audience really appreciates that as well and so then this leads us to say okay where else can klima be integrated right i think there's huge potential that if we're talking about building this next generation financial infrastructure let's do it from the beginning with the planet in mind and and that's really the opportunity here is that because we're building this token in the d5 space that's backed by carbon we can really easily integrate uh you know this this this carbon infrastructure you know the dream would be uh ave or you know other platforms like this but you can really yeah see where the potential is there totally but i like the idea of like having it as like a you know signaling signaling kind of thing right i totally agree with you i think um you know public blockchains have have this strong power of actually you know i think i think climate action should be the status symbol of the 21st century and this gives us all the tools to be to do that very cool so uh guys uh tell me about the roadmap what's next so short term we've got so we had ido was a few weeks ago short term we got the lbp coming up tuesday it's going to be a three-day event 14th to the 17th uh ideo initial discord offering so basically everyone was people had a chance to purchase an nft that gives them a claim to klimas they get airdropped to them later um and then they got a cool nft out of it but also they get tokens at an early price and this also in turn basically allows us to bootstrap the liquidity bootstrapping pool because that requires which was the lbp the the this is about a balancer liquidity bootstrapping pool which is right listeners will remember that's how we sold our t-shirts once upon a time yeah cool yeah same same concept and we're you know working with alchemist and the um copper launch team to to make sure that that goes out smoothly so that's the next short term thing after that like once we have all that done and squared away it's going to be launched to the protocol so we've been live on net since like june um so people can already test it on matic mumbai if you want to um just ping me i'll send you some tokens it's super easy and then um so then we'll basically launch the entire protocol on matic like the main net so probably not that's how old i am i remember it as matic not polygons it's a habit that i cannot hopefully you bought somatic at the time yeah yeah believe me that was like the biggest regret i bought enough that i was like oh like i'll never have to like worry about deploying contracts ever again i never really saw it as like a financial asset a financial asset i'm like this is really cool i could use it so yeah this is my my engineer coming out but um so yeah so then matic mainnet is coming out and then that's where everything's ready to go and then we'll have you know staking will be live on day one bonds will be live on day one the whole protocol goes up and up and running at the same time whereas olympus they basically release the token first and then they released everything that they were working on we have the benefit of basically being able to do um all of that at once because it's already been built and we're working on a number of other things so like co2 for instance is building a permissionless carbon bridge that's almost ready um and that's like that'll be deployed as well so people will be able to bring their tonnage from vera on themselves or they can have someone do it for them like there's a whole bunch of you know routes there that we can help people move their stuff on chain and basically benefit from all the crazy stuff that's happening in d5 um and that's that's like kind of the short term like the next few months longer term like we talked about this quite extensively but um compliance markets so we talked at the very beginning we talked about voluntary markets like vera gold center this is where people opt into this incentive to to do something great about the plan and this is where you know all the big companies um microsoft google facebook whoever whoever you are that you make a carbon pledge to and say we're going to be carbon neutral by whatever you're operating in the voluntary market there's a whole other side of the market which is called compliance and i'm going to totally butcher this diagnosis knows way better than i do but um fundamentally that's like state level actors right under the paris agreement they basically are trading compliance certificates on you know canada has to do this much emissions reduction based on its alliance and they trade with france or they trade with you know the states or or somewhere else and they and this this whole side of the market has a different categorization different level of ruling and regulation and and to diane's point like by influencing the voluntary market this also gives us an opportunity to influence the compliance markets but longer term we also want to build and we have a bunch of partners in the pipeline too for this as well but we want to basically build the same types of d5 bridge ecosystem tools for the compliance market so people can then enter and participate in this much more distributed and fair market that emerges as a result so if we prove the voluntary one it's very easy for us to then just push into the compliance one which is much bigger and we can actually have a significant impact on everybody's commitments to not just as a company or corporate like you know social level but also at like a regulatory level like if you signed the paris agreement you agreed to reduce your emissions by 20 and suddenly the price of carbon is so expensive you're gonna have to do something about it you can so i was just going to say you know um the the carbon market in the european system it's the european emissions trading system uh it's been one of the best performing commodities in the past year and the australian carbon compliance market it just reached an all-time high and i just point that out because you know the carbon market itself that the voluntary car market uh could be worth you know 50 billion by 2030. um and so you know this is why having exposure to this market and bringing that exposure to d5 users is so exciting for us right yeah so this is not just necessarily like a voluntary feel good for participating this like actually has like raw economic upside exposure incentives as well absolutely cool yeah everybody everybody who is in the space is right now buying up supply and it's like there's already you know we can also already see like a supply crunch because people understand that you know buying now while the price is still cheap is a really smart move and um yeah so i think this is you know this is really and it's frustrating because it's quite a gated market uh it's not easy to get you to get access especially it's not as an individual so you know this is happening behind closed doors and like giving everybody the the possibility to participate and like you know hedging also with uh by having exposure on carbon i think this is i think this is something that hasn't been done yet in in crypto guys are you familiar with the the whole uh slaying moloch meme that we talk about on bank list every now and then no oh oh gosh guys holy fortunately no philistine yeah okay so moloch is the god of human coordination failure uh and uh i mean climate change is like one of the core examples of this right like everyone knows that we should stop like ruining the climate but no one wants to actually do it themselves they want everyone else to do it and so it never happens right like there's all these coordination failures like uh the the negative externalities of capitalism is a coordination failure uh there's a bunch of coordination failures and so moloch is is like this representative god that we've kind of memed into existence it came from this uh slate star codex blog called meditations on molok um and like it was something i talk about with kevin owaki all the time is that like crypto is brand new coordination infrastructure to help solve coordination failures right so climate change one of the biggest coordination failures may hopefully we can use um these coordination tools that we have which are daos are very a significant part of like tokens as well ethereum and smart contracts these are all coordination tools um and so my i think my final question for you guys is uh since you guys don't know the molok meme i'll leave the mohawk side out of it but you guys should definitely go listen to the slaying molock episode on on bankless um like give us give us the the maximally successful version of the future for klima dow like five ten twenty years from now climadow is everything you guys envision it to be what does it look like what is it done and how is the world different yeah although first i'm sure everyone has their own view of it but like in my view like long term it's basically carbon price has appreciated such a point that it's a it's like a luxury good like if you're buying carbon offsets you're paying for something that is truly a premium product and otherwise you're just completely incentivized to just do better right like the the whole coordination mechanism that you're talking about like coordination failure is because there's like a cheap pop out right like opt out you can just not have you know pollution problems by just paying your way out of it which is totally not fair for for the people who actually are doing something like significantly valuable um so long term like that's basically it's like we've coordinated we've solved this and at this point like we've created a whole ecosystem that revolves around regenerative capitalism rather than exploitive capitalism right like building a whole currency on the premise that it's backed by regenerative actions that's that's like the future i want to see it's going to be super cool yeah and i just want to add to this like you know if we really think this to the end like we have the choice of the currency we use and if we get keema to a point where it's you know operating as a stable currency that is really collateralized by the things that we care about and we're starting with carbon but you know it's really just because it's a proxy for a lot of like ecosystem services you know biodiversity is something that we definitely want to see um getting more attention also in the future and this is something that keema can also incorporate in in the future so having this money which is essentially uh turned the social contract on its head and by you know just agreeing the more utility the currency has the the the higher its value right so if we get people to adopt lima also as like a like a currency and like if we the more people decide to hold and huddle in keema this means that it's creating essentially the sink that sinks for all these environmental assets um so yeah this is probably dreamland and won't happen in the next five years but um yeah i think that would be that that would be incredibly exciting if we actually established a new currency that is underpinned by different economics one one of the things that uh oxless brought up early on in our meetings together uh is that you know clemendale could really democratize access to climate finance uh for users and i think that's something that everyone's really has an affinity for and we realize the potential that which is super exciting and i think clean down itself is just a testament to the type of amazing collaboration that can happen in the d5 space we each were working at disparate groups we had various backgrounds you know we there were some overlapping carbon markets or d phi but we realized there's just a huge synergy potential by working together and producing this um and that's really what's happened so you know long term i would love to see klima really catalyze finance and accelerate the price pressure on the carbon market really make these companies have to reduce their emissions um you know and just restore ecosystems around the world there's so much potential if you really think about it of working together with crypto you know pooling capital together and then developing carbon projects absolutely i think that's something that clean we could be a part of in the future and uh it's extremely exciting to think about and just like one thing to add right we we have uh an incredible community already in discord with like i think it's over 2000 users now that are you know crypto users that are educating themselves about the climate change and like how we can tackle it and i think we shouldn't underestimate the role of you know a group that is basically focused around like climate action and crypto and like educating ourselves and creating new tools and experimenting with new ways of you know driving finance to where it's needed so um one last thing is you know come into the discord and we have office hours twice a week we've been doing this for like a couple of months now so people come in uh every tuesday and every thursday you can just hop into the discord and there and we're there we answer questions we you know um and we educate ourselves about this topic so i think there's a big gap there and if we can be a part of filling this gap like this is something that um yeah this is something that we you know is really important and it's really core to this well guys this is uh one it's such a fantastic project i'm i'm so glad we got connected by uh by our mutual friend chaz um and so i just want to say that uh when i first got into crypto it was problems like these that got me just like you know into this whole crypto thing and like uh as we got into this whole crypto thing like we kind of got a little bit distracted by like you know all these like defy tokens financial assets and decentralized finance is important right you guys are a part of decentralized finance but like it's some of these like grander problems that like nation states aren't necessarily big enough to solve themselves that we need some sort of better global coordination infrastructure and so like seeing projects like like lima dao come out of this is like oh yes this is like let's return to like some of the original like you know dreams that we had back in 2015 16 17 about like how crypto can can truly change the world and oxalis you said like uh maybe like this isn't gonna happen in five years maybe that's a dream but uh i mean in crypto we dream man like that's what please prove me wrong yeah and so like no i could uh uh clean it out like it's tackling a problem that's bigger than nation states and so the the magnitude of what this could become i hope is also bigger than the nation states so like auxilia said um we'll have the the links to both the website and the discord in the show notes um obviously you guys want engaged community members but is there any more like precise call to action about like who you want or what you guys need help with over at the dao join the lbp on tuesday i'm super stoked to watch that and participate what you think is fair um and then there's like a lot of people have been reaching out to us who aren't crypto natives which is really cool to see um that are like just climate natives and they're like oh like i'm working on this carbon project it's you know certified under vera standard blah blah blah can i bring it to clean it up and we're like yeah absolutely like you know we're starting to you know coordinate all sorts of people who are who have never really experienced deep fry in a profound way but they understand climate really well and they're like okay this is like something that i can finally you know tap into so yeah 100 anyone it's not just you know you know crypto people it's now client people too that they really want to get involved cool guys any last comments or last words you want to add before we sign off here i just want to say really appreciate the opportunity here and and david thanks for all you do for the crypto community oh hey hey thanks thank you yeah
