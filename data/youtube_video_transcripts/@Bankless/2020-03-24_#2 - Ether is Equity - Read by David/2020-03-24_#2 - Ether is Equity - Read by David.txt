hello everyone we're going to read through ether is equity for those that want to be read too instead of actually doing the reading themselves so ether is equity is one of three articles that i in my head kind of group together as um one continuation over a larger theme which is defining ether defining ethereum and so this is the middle one the first one is either a new model for money and the other one is ethereum and emergent structure and so i'll have those linked in the show notes so this is number two ether is equity defining ether as an asset is a never-ending journey excuse me of exploration and discovery crypto economic systems like bitcoin and ethereum are emergent and self-defining making their respective assets difficult to pin down and formally define this is my latest attempt to define ether the native asset to ethereum ethereum is the commons ethereum is a financial landscape it is a place where things live grow and interact with others these things are generally called applications applications on ethereum have infinite possibility because of ethereum's evm the ethereum virtual machine the part of ethereum that allows us to run software the full spectrum of possible applications are able to be built and added to the ethereum ecosystem this is what turns ethereum from a single use case like bitcoin to an infinite set of use cases only limited by the imagination and engineering skills of the builders who are building on it applications are organisms the main takeaway from my article the two phases of ethereum is that there is a vast spectrum between autonomous perpetual and computer run applications and applications that depend on humans for their operation the autonomous perpetual computer run applications are much more valuable than the human ones and lastly the absolute bold case for ethereum is a landscape of interoperable interacting self-perpetuating autonomous financial applications so in short there's two ends of it there's two possible entities of a spectrum of applications on ethereum there's ones that are totally managed by computers that's like uniswap that's uh auger uh makerdale's close but not quite compound is close but not quite and then you have the centralized end which is totally human managed which is like stuff like realty where they're centralized security assets on and on the ecosystem and then there's room in between these two ends of the spectrum to exist the reason why bitcoin is valuable is because it is the first example of unstoppable financial applications ethereum's ideal product is a vast landscape of financial applications that all match bitcoin's level of trustlessness and autonomousness while also being able to execute any kind of financial logic that humans find useful and willing to pay for when it comes to having these qualities the current set of of applications on ethereum are generally not there yet most maker dow oracles depend on centralized actors compound and dydx have backdoors set protocol is gated since 2015 two applications have emerged on ethereum that we can consider to be bitcoin grade applications which are uniswep and auger uh and bitcoin grade is just like this uh arbitrary reference anchor point we use because uh of all crypto systems it's the most of these however it is not itself uh the perfect example of autonomousness and uh permissionlessness et cetera like you can always have something more rigid and so bitcoin is just the most rigid example that we have today other applications on ethereum have a clear path to achieving being bitcoin grade but they are not there yet compound has a back door they need to plug maker dow needs more mkr diffusion and also needs more bitcoin grade oracles and many ethereum applications are not far from being bitcoin grade but simply have not made the leap the landscape of applications the bold case for ethereum is that a sufficiently large number of these bitcoin grade applications are built and make the legacy financial system antiquated and obsolete resulting in a migration of economic activity from legacy companies to applications on ethereum one of the key messages in two phases of ethereum is that one good bitcoin grade application can act as a critical piece of infrastructure for other ones at genesis ethereum has no decentralized oracle system today it has one now that uniswap exists applications can leverage unit swap as a decentralized unstoppable oracle for an eighth token price feed and this oracle only gets better as uniswap grows larger not only is una swap useful as an unstoppable oracle but unit swap also acts as a bridge between ethereum and synthetics synthetics as an application which would be much harder to access without uniswap as more of these fully autonomous unstoppable censorship-resistant applications come online it becomes easier to develop further applications of this quality conway's game of life conway's game of life is an interesting exercise in programming as well as a peculiar thought experiment in short conway's game of life is an investigation of stable and unstable structures given a specific rule set these structures are collections of square cells of a grid inside of a binary universe the state of a cell either a one or a zero or being a black cell or a white cell will change based on the state of other cells around it in discrete time units which we can call state changes while most patterns of cells are lifeless certain patterns are structures that are autonomous they they endlessly perpetuate their existence into affinity and never to die unless acted upon by an external force the specific patterns in which these structures are engineered creates a system that has the capacity to self-perpetuate forever in a in a way this feels like the creation of life inside of a sandbox landscape with preset rules okay so to go back conway's game of life it's a grid there are a bunch of squares and the squares are either white or black and according to specific rules such as if there are exactly three neighbors that are black you switch to black if you are white if there are less than two uh oh neighbors that are black then you if you are black you switch to white vice versa there's a set of rules and then uh you know there's a state change there's a we we progress in in increments in time and things happen over time as the states change and structures can be built and so here are examples of some structures that you can be that can build be built in conway's game of life so i want to draw the comparison between the sandbox landscape which is conway's game and its rule set you could also say the universe is a massive sandbox game the universe is one big sandbox and it also has its preset rules the laws of physics and then there's also ethereum this open landscape of a sandbox landscape for you to build anything and then you also have the rules to make changes which is the evm these are all the same things in different forms and different contexts conway's game of life is a state machine it has rules that cannot be broken and it offers a landscape for possible things to be built most buildable things are non-functioning or not very interesting however with some cool exploration experimentation and research you can build structures that do pretty cool stuff so this is a cool little gif of a specific structure in conway's game of life that two structures actually that are interacting off of each other and they're producing these gliders these things that just float off into existence forever which is pretty cool this is a self-perpetuating system ethereum's game of apps like conway's game of life ethereum is a state machine landscape that allows for the building and exploration of various applications in addition to conway's game of life ethereum is also a crypto economic system like bitcoin which means that the applications slash structures that exist on ethereum are inherently financial applications slash structures fully autonomous applications like uniswap or auger represent self-perpetuating structures in ethereum's game of apps ethereum is a landscape for these specific structures to be built and to take on a life of their own so like we see this structure in conway's game of life just existing doing its thing applications on ethereum likewise are built and hopefully they have the correct structure the correct pattern to exist and just live and live into perp into perpetuity so long that ethereum is alive applications like unit swap are guaranteed to exist into perpetuity the more apps that are on the computer side of the spectrum the more self-perpetuating structures there are inside ethereum and the more ethereum is itself a self-perpetuating system of systems if you want to see what a visual of the ethereum economy looks like watch this video i don't know how sand is going to sound is going to work it's probably going to not work very well let's get forward so while this is one guy just tinkering with you know what you can do if you really want to max out conway's game of life i see it as a metaphor a model for how ethereum is going to be built you know different people are going to build their own things and they're going to be stitched together automatically that's what defy is it's a massive stitching together of different applications to produce an economy this is just a top-down view of an economy in this binary state machine fashion look at it look at the growth that's pretty dope okay moving on a system of systems a fire of fires in the beginning ethereum was formless and empty there was only darkness this is a biblical reference as ethereum progressed sparks of life have caught and are beginning to explore the environment around itself fire is a metaphor for a self-perpetuating system i think it is it is an internal meta alternative metaphor to the one of a biological organism for ethereum's defy apps i think it is fitting fires consume resources and this resource consumption is is measured by the eats locked in defy metric or the gas guzzling leaderboard ethox and d5 is a product proxy for how much bandwidth the ethereum fires are consuming ryan sean adams accurately illustrates this concept as economic bandwidth the gas-guzzling leader board represents which applications are consuming up all of the oxygen the block space the only change to this metaphor that is needed is that the ethereum fires are generative rather than consumptive of resource which uh more later on more on that later maker dao has an organism the maker doubt organism saw its first spark of life in december of 2017 with the launch of single collateral dye the application has been eating up each ever since and shows no signs of slowing down so you can see up and to the right here's a little graph of an mkr dude eating some ether you know expelling some dye and tummy size goes up every time he does that agar agar has its first spark of life in 2018. auger has not yet turned into a roaring fire in the same way that maker dao has but auger's arc arc agar's architecture implies that it will be a difficult beast to kill agar's future growth as an organism will depend on consuming dye as its dye as a nutrient is much more beneficial for auger because it's stable to create liquid prediction markets for the world a combination of good ui and ux improvements die integration and easy money on ramps via wire in addition faster market turnaround will allow for augur to better complete for economic resources and ethereum unit swap unit swap sparked in november of 2018 and it seemed to catch fire in march of 2019 unit swap has been gobbling up each ever since because of the clear demand for liquid eat token markets unisop's architecture makes it a particularly difficult application to stop it's likely it will continue to gobble eath until the end of time up and to the right here's a cool little gif of ether pouring water to all the applications who are sucking it up the meta system the collective fire ethereum is a place where these organisms interact integrate and grow ethereum is the collective bonfire that is created when many smaller fires find each other the more interconnected ethereum applications are the hotter and larger the collected collective ethereum bonfire is viewed through the lens of conway's game of life ethereum is the emergent superstructure that is created when all the independent many structures combine interoperate exchange and derive each other ethereum more than the sum of its apps gestalt psychology refers to the brain as an organized hole that it is more than the sum of its parts you can compartmentalize different areas of the brain and point to where what they do the occipital lobe in the back inputs and processes visualist stimuli the temporal lobe here here-ish inputs environmental stimulus and outputs meaning and significance the parietal lobe orients the body in space and time and prefrontal cortex produces goal-oriented behavior from the signals of the rest of the brain however you cannot find the brain's consciousness center consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that is created when you combine the separate functioning structures of the brain together each application on ethereum is its own independent structure however ethereum's killer's feature is its composability the ability for applications to interoperate and interact with each other whatever ethereum's equivalent of consciousness looks like it will be from the emergent structure that is created when ethereum apps are stitched together look at all that economic activity um this isn't even the most updated one ethereum isn't its applications it's the webbing between them ethereum is the emergent structure that is created from the composability and interoperability of its applications and ether is the equity of this structure so ether is equity ethereum is an emergent financial superstructure finance requires value to function and the financial asset that the emergent structure uses is ether financial applications on ethereum grow the same way that traditional businesses grow by providing valuable goods and services to their customers ethan defy and the gas guzzler leaderboard represents two metrics for measuring the value that ethereum applications are providing to their users maker dow's product dye has convinced ether holders to part with 2.5 million ether and place it inside of the maker dao application in lieu of using it elsewhere consequently there are there's 2.5 million less ether available for other applications to use however the consumption of eth by maker dow and other big d5 protocols doesn't mean that there's less value available for others the demand for ether defy reduces the secondary market supply of ether and according to the age-old truth of supply and demand this creates appreciation in ether this means that while there is less total eth available there is more total value for others to use so maker dow gobbles up ether off the secondary market supply and demand supply just went down demand stays the same price goes up so while there's less supply of ether on the secondary market there is at least equal to or greater total value on the secondary market the market just grows it just becomes bigger because the ether price goes up so by locking up ether applications create new value outside of their respective system this is why i said ethereum fires are generative rather than consumptive of resources when ethereum applications remove eth from supply it makes the eath outside of it more valuable by increasing the price of eath other applications can continue their functioning while using less eath this means they are are this means they are more efficiently consuming resources and and there are more resources to share with other applications when it comes to consuming eth and generating new resources rather than consuming them make your dao is a great example many applications especially financial ones cannot use ether as a resource due to its volatility maker dow consumes eth and generates dye a brand new resource with a different nutrient nutritional profile that allows for new apps to receive the nutrients they need to grow this value generation is in addition to the value accrual that eth outside of maker dow receives as a result from the reduced supply in the markets maker dow has consumed 2.3 of all eth and therefore 2.3 of each is una available for applications to use however the 2.3 percent each supply sink adds to each scarcity and therefore eth price meaning that maker dow returns value to the price of eth and allows for more total value available to be consumed by other applications when applications are successful in capturing eth more value is created for others ethereum's economic pie grows when people eat it you can literally have your cake and eat it too and if this doesn't sound like an anti-fragile system i don't know what does when financial applications on ethereum grow by providing quality goods and services to their users they consume and lock up eth the supply reduction ultimately makes its way to be reflected in the price of ether the collective value that ethereum provides to the world is reflected in the price of ether the price of ether is a measure of the value of the goods and services provided by ethereum equity characteristics in addition to the value capture mechanism described above ether has other characteristics that connect its price to the success of the ethereum network the ethereum network is like a company it brings in revenue to miners stickers it inflates its supply to sell to the public in order to access capital and fund its livelihood similarly it also contracts its supply when revenue and profits are strong by issuing a stock buyback in the form of burning ether it also has employees in its own company currency and all the applications on ethereum represent a company store that only accepts the company currency get into that more later base fee is a stock buyback so this is in reference to eip155 eip1559 is an eip that is planned to be integrated into east 2 or sooner there are links i'll link in the show notes a short summary from eric connor who proposed the eip and then also a longer less technical more narrative analysis for myself i will assume that you have read either one of those two pieces in this section in eip1559 base fee represents the bulk of the transaction fee base fee is burnt removing the burn to eat from the total supply ethereum prioritizes security over monetary policy it does this by paying for security ahead of time by ensuring constant issuance for validators this mechanism ensures that ethereum always has the necessary capital available to pay for sufficient security regardless of the revenue it generates this begs the question if we don't need fees for security what should we do with the fees the answer is to burn them this is the correct thing to do for a number of reasons burning base fee is still paying for security every day that ethereum runs base fee will remove eth from supply the base fee amount that ethereum could have paid directly to validators at the time of burning is instead paid to the future ethereum the ability to attack ethereum 2.0 will be a function of how much eath is available for purchase on the secondary markets if there is high heat supply then buying back enough eath off the secondary markets to attack ethereum in proof of stake is cheap if there is a low e supply on the secondary markets then it is expensive if you need to access 30 million each to attack ethereum 2.0 and there's 60 million eth on the secondary markets well then there's double the supply that you need to in order to do that if you need to access 30 million ethan there's only 15 million supply in the secondary markets then that becomes really really hard and base fee burning base fee always reduces the supply of ether on the secondary markets by adding to the scarcity of ether today ethereum pays for security tomorrow in addition to this it is also paying for security security in a compounded fashion say eip burns one eath which represents point zero zero one percent of the supply these are fake numbers then when eip burns one more eth it will then represent point zero zero one zero one percent of the supply the degree that eip1559 is removing eth from the total supply compounds over time which means the additional security benefits it adds is also compounding perhaps even having a perhaps even having a cost security expenses also also means higher fee burn ratio because we don't need to pay the validators as much maybe that was a ignore that sentence that butchered that one burning base fee pays all ether holders equally similar to how mkr holders receive indirect access to the revenue generated by disability fees eip1559 gives either ether holders indirect access to the fees collected by base fee or what i'm calling the security fee the security fee burn in ethereum is issuing a stock buyback on eve ethereum's sf is a perpetual stock buyback on ether and it scales up or down based on the revenue ethereum brings in from selling its block space if ethereum brings in significant revenue the sf burned more east if if ethereum brings in less revenue the sf only burns a little east side though maker doubt maker dow calls their stability fees sf's too i think the security fee is actually a better name than the stability fee and this this specific asset burn mechanism for maker dow in ethereum is literally the same mechanism reproduced on both systems all apps pay homage to ether all applications positively impact the value of ether to some degree some applications like maker dow and uniswap have large positive downstream effects to ether price others just have a small positive impact but an impact nonetheless as a general rule of thumb trustless permissionless applications positively impact the price of ether the most simply due to the ether collateralization requirements in order to become trustless applications like make or dao or uniswapper auger in order for them to access collateral to run they need an asset and if they want to access a trustless permissionless asset well then they have to use ether because that's the only trustless permissionless asset on ethereum on the opposite end of the spectrum companies like realty which is my company don't have to collateralize ether to function we issue tokenized real estate assets that pay rental income every 24 hours every time we issue a token or pay rent we are paying ether to validators additionally we've created economic activity as well when our customers exchange these tokens through uniswap or transfer them around around themselves all of this economictivity activity from both realty the company and realty's customers ends up as fees collected by ether validators ether ending up in the hands of the validators is bullish for ethereum and ether because it is the validators who are the subset of people who are the least likely to sell eath eric wall in his recent piece proof of stake is less wasteful illustrated at this point above this is a quote from eric what is the cheapest capital source for staking that you'll never be able to compete with he asks if we take ethereum as an example it will be the people who are long eath a person who is long eighth who's bullish on each who isn't going to sell eth who's going along on it is going to hold it for a long amount of time a person who is long eath and who has already decided that he she wants to belong eath for the next five to ten years has virtually zero economic costs for staking such stakers will out-compete other stakers by being willing to accept lower and lower yields so the people who are staking the people who are receiving validated rewards were all are going to be the set of people that were already content on holding eth for that amount of time anyways and so they might as well stake to to collect on the feeds because they're already bullish on ether because they're already holding it and so when all the economic activity that realty provides all the rent payments that we send out every 24 hours and all the token purchases and unisop phrase et cetera any all the small little fees that all of those economic transactions create go to people who are inherently bullish on the asset and are not likely to sell so that's what keeps that that ether off the secondary market and it goes from the hands of the people transacting to the hands of the people who are perpetually bullish there are many applications like realty that don't offer that that have the minimum exposure to realty we don't lock it up we don't use it as collateral etc you know we we don't require ether collateralization we don't require yields and they're not locking eth we are companies like realty are simply doing the bare minimum buying ethereum's block space blind block block space is the minimum threshold that is required of ethereum maps this is how all ethereum applications create at least some positive impact in the value of ether by paying a small fee for every transaction this moves eth from the general supply into the hands of the individuals who are inherently bullish on ether rewarding them for being bullish ethereum is the dow ethereum is one big dow it is an open source company whose product is an open source ecosystem the genius of ethereum is allowing anyone to build on top of it allowing anyone to freely contribute work to the dow effectively receiving free labor good work results in eth lockup which has generally been associated with positive financial rewards from both inside and outside of ethereum maker dow compound uniswap dydx have collectively locked over 3 million eth and collectively raised over 100 million dollars from outside firms hedge funds vc funds that 100 million dollars of funding that's going to these companies that are locking up eth will be going to improving each company's respective product which will enable further eth lockup clearly the funds backing clearly for the vc funds the venture funds backing these protocols funding these teams the game that they are wanting that they want to win is capturing eth capturing ether's collateral company script okay script money is money issued by a company usually in a closed loop system like coal mines coal towns in in 1950s america here's an excerpt from wikipedia the town grew into a community with a variety of housing types including boarding housing boarding houses for transients and new hires all of the growing community organized around a company store the company would often give credit in the form of scrip a form of token money that would discourage workers from purchasing items in stores outside of the town so it's actually a way of to coerce employees to only buy things from the company they're basically making a mini economy and saying you're locked into our system companies realize that they could generate their own local economy in the same way that governments created their own money system the company would create the roads the housing the grocery store while also providing employment then they would also charge rent and have a monopoly on the town's groceries and be free from competition a pretty good business model thankfully no one is forcing anyone to use ethereum in david graber's book debt the first five thousand years david illustrates how governments would bootstrap money and this is how company towns would do it too step one issue the money step two charge taxes in the form of that money step three citizens create businesses products services labor etc in order to generate revenue to pay for the taxes it's just itself they just create the self-repeating loop that everyone has to fall into and then that loop just turns into the economy ethereum follows the same model step one issue ether step two require ether for economic activity step three builders create businesses product services in order to collect ether as a currency however ether has some extra bells and whistles in addition to being offered to you i offer in addition to offering you exposure to the upside of ethereum imagine if your company paid you an equity that you could buy groceries with ethereum is ethereum is a share ether is a share of ethereum it is a claim on ethereum's fees if you produce work for ethereum ether enables you the right to work for ethereum with ether you lock in the right to some degree of employment to the protocol all ethereum employees are all paid equally and thanks to eip1559 they are never overcompensated similarly bitcoin miners constantly put out the same amount of work but their compensation is entirely dependent on the fee market and bitcoin miners are likely always either under or overpaid during good times the strict limit on bitcoin's block size results in something similar to fee extortion from the bitcoin transactions transactors to the miners and then also from miners to asic producers during bad times bad miners capitulate and good miners make it through hopefully to be able to be compensated with overpayment in the future ether stakers are the fairly compensated employees of ethereum stakers receive a small eth paycheck for their labor three to seven percent on their eat year over year but are much more likely to financially benefit from ether appreciation keeping their incentives aligned with the needs of the dao as a whole this elegance and incentive alignment is the beauty of ethereum that will enable it to scale to a single global financial platform everyone is incentive is incentivized to come and build on it if ethereum comes to dominate the globe as a single financial platform it will be because of the establishment of the positive feedback loops set by the value of ether as exposure to the growth of ethereum this piece illustrates how ether as an asset reflects the value of ethereum as a whole what ethereum is and how ether fits into that definition is a constant discovery process the same is true for bitcoin the bitcoin system and the btc asset are in constant states of flux this is because these two systems are their own independent internet native organism ethereum grows it adapts to its environment it responds to stimulus it has its own nutrient delivery systems ethereums like maker dow and uniswap illustrate vital organs to ethereum's overall biological structure as ethereum grows it will be both the result of and encourage new vital organs producing new mechanisms to leverage ether that benefits in ways that benefit the system as a whole as a result of this we can directly bridge the value of ether to the health of the organism if the ether price is high ethereum is healthy thanks for reading you can follow me on twitter at trustless state i'm a frequent writer
