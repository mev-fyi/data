when you introduce a wolf into an ecosystem as a keystone predator the diversity and ecological health of the entire landscape goes up and i'm always asking how can humans be a regenerative keystone species on planet earth how is our presence here actually uh a force for regeneration instead of a force for degeneration we're in this climate catastrophe we've been pumping you know carbon from from below the earth into the atmosphere creating the you know greenhouse effect all of these other things carbon is really the least of our problems in a lot of ways this is an example of humans not behaving like a keystone species we're behaving as a species that's tending towards simplifying and degrading and making ecosystems more fragile
