there's a listener who is like well i'm one of those like i believe in crypto i believe in the ethos i see the the potential of crypto not just for 2025 but like for 2050 and 2070. do you have any just perspectives or thoughts or advice for for these types of people it's just how to navigate the murky waters of retail and actually become elevated to start participating in some of the conversations that that we've been having here the number one thing that you can do is to take on responsibility there's a lot of engagement in crypto right there's a lot of people who show up in your discord but there are not a lot of people who will take on responsibility that instinct to just raise your hand and take on responsibility is the most valuable thing and the most likely thing that's gonna one gets you a lot smarter about web3 and also if what you're looking for is compensation as a you know member of the web 3 community you're going to get there much faster and also getting invited upwards if you show up in a bunch of these discords and you just type a bunch of random stuff and get into arguments and then you know expect an airdrop that person is going to become much less successful over the next you know several years than the person who learns how to be an active and engaged and valuable community member
