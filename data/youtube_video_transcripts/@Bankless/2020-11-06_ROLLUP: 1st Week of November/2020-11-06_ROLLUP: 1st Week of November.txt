[Music] if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible bank list is brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways but a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dytx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing hello bankless nation welcome to the first week of november this is your weekly roll up a show where david and i go through all the essential things you need to know about that happened in the past week in crypto we released this as always on friday morning so you can enjoy it with breakfast enjoy it with your morning cup of coffee and get caught up on all the news as always we try to do this in 25 minutes so five minutes per second we're gonna cover market releases news hot takes and finally end with what we are excited about this comes out on youtube also comes out on the podcast so you can catch it both ways david how you doing today man absolutely fantastic there's just so much energy in the crypto industry right now and we are trying to get some of that energy and why we are so energetic injected straight into your brain in a roll-up fashion so if you don't have the time or energy to pay attention to everything that goes on in this super fast-paced world then this is we are going to bundle that information up and inject it right into your brain all right david you ready should we roll them up rolling them up all right let's roll them up roll them up all right we're starting with market david what is the market saying you want to start with bitcoin here and i'm going to show something on my screen show some bitcoin price action well we are talking about it yeah bitcoin is just marching up and to the right uh maybe it had to do with the election maybe it was going to do this anyways uh but it is really you know pushing up against its all-time high at least with regards to how long it has spent above the fifteen thousand dollar mark so it is currently at the time of speaking fifteen thousand dollars and twenty fifteen thousand dollars and fifteen thousand two hundred dollars which is which is as far as bitcoin goes that's basically its all-time high in terms of time it has spent very little time above this number very few sellers is the theory above about fifteen 000. what is this election so we've got probably a republican uh senate probably and we probably have uh biden as president i don't know it's looking that way that's what the prediction markets are telling us uh is that part of the reason you think i i think so a republican-controlled senate means that we are definitely not probably we are probably not rolling back biden's tax cuts tax plans right which is bullish for asset prices and a biden-led presidency means we are definitely adding more stimulus into the economy which like both of those things are bullish for assets and bitcoin specifically all right quick quick take do you think bitcoin's gonna hit all-time high in 2020 or no oh god i wouldn't be surprised if it did i couldn't say it because like the thing is like it's marching it's going so fast and it's really accelerating i think it's i think it's in the cards it's gonna start hitting headlines soon and then it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy okay let's talk about the next thing bitcoin on ethereum what's happening there uh the number's higher it's always higher it's a higher number one again it was last week it's gone up all right it's gone up last week i said 149 000 and this week is 153 000. all right from 22 billion to 2.3 billion it's going up all right next you want to talk a little bit about bitcoin futures volumes because that's crazy as well um this is cme future volumes which is cftc regulated that's hitting some all-time highs too right crazy yeah it's just all-time highs left and right and that's one of the reasons why there's so much energy and excitement in this space uh we are just getting more and more external validation that people are interested in bitcoin all right let's get to eath price eth how we're doing a little guy so ethan is uh 413 as of right now it hit a bit of a bomb not quite as large as bitcoin what's going on with thief price yeah well naturally the eth price hit a bump uh hit a little pump when the deposit contract got announced but it looks like it struggled to really follow through on that we're going to talk a little bit more about that but uh all of crypto seems to be moving up and to the right and eth is no exception yeah it might be uh sort of um just just waiting for the realization of staking to to come out there we'll talk a little bit more about that right now but so far the pump has been a bit underwhelming um do you want to talk a little bit about total value locked in d5 what's what's that hanging at right now we've got 11.7 billion that's about flat isn't it yeah it's it's pretty flat on the higher side of flat i would say uh you know but like we like we've known d5 is still doing its retracement some people have called the bottom on d5 yet to be seen i'm i'm in that camp at the bottom on device down but that means that uh the fact that uh total locks in d5 the fact that that's flat is actually kind of bullish while d5 retracts total locked and defies flat i guess going back to youth i know one thing we wanted to to mention is uh this this tweet of yours we we constantly talk about the three value accrual mechanisms of ether and uh we've got one we just store a value in d5 we just talked about value locked in d5 but there's two more that are kicking in here and you tweeted this out here about eats three pillars of value acryl what are the two others david and when are they coming yeah so we got we got the green check mark next to a store of value in d5 we have the uh capital asset and proof of stake on the horizon that's happening on december 1st we have an actual date for that assuming enough ether gets deposited into the deposit contract both ryan and i on our alpha leak episode indicated our bullishness that that's going to be met by december 1st and then on the horizon after that is consumable asset in eip15529 which tim baker the most most informed individual on this matter predicts a nine month uh time horizon for that yeah all right very cool very cool so uh the three pillars and it might be the case that we've often said uh 2020 is 2016 and then you know next year 2017 where everything kind of explodes it looks like the plan is coming together on ether value accrual hey we don't have much time to talk about this but you want to talk about other markets which is prediction markets for the presidential election that's been crazy in in crypto there's some markets where you can actually bet on biden versus trump and we've seen some pretty heavy volume here's one on ftx what's your take yeah i think prediction markets were the unsung hero of the crypto world during the election they did their jobs right they had high volume high high liquidity and they really allowed people to express their version of the future and make a trade against that um and one thing i think was really cool was this catnip project which uh was a a combination of money legos between balancer and auger that allowed you to buy no donald trump tokens or yes donald trump tokens right through the balancer interface you know like kyc free uh using a m that everyone knows and loves uh using the many money legos that people know how to use yeah and i understand you you uh put a bet on the the defy um prediction market poly market and tried that out and it's cool that all of these markets are changing in real time so at one point would look like trump could win this uh they were trading trump uh high but likelihood very high and when things have switched around now they're trading pretty low so they're saying that the odds of trump winning are about 10 or so 10 to 15 at this point in time which uh feels about right very cool to see them respond this way all right david that's markets let's talk about the next thing what's what's going on with releases let's talk about the big release first shall we what the what is the most obvious release other than the release of the deposit contract for ethereum 2.0 if you've been following the bankless media or other ethereum people in this space you should have been seeing this coming from a long way off uh but if you're perhaps new to the space or you're coming from people that don't really speak about ethereum maybe this is a surprise to you either way this really locks in how the fact that ethereum 2.0 is so close and we're starting with phase zero and we actually have a date for phase zero phase zero december first and david we are just pumping out content on staking uh in particular and eth2 at bank list so we've got our alpha league videos of course we've got the staking how to become a validator and stake your eth that we just published on bankless uh as well and just today we released a whole economics article on each 2.0 staking comparing it to a bond which we can talk about later man that's such a huge release this has been like five years five years comes to genesis since genesis of ethereum yeah we've we've said this before this is absolutely huge news i think the biggest news at least of this year if not of the past several years all right um we've talked about that enough in other places but maybe let's link in the ftx news so saw this on coindesk david ftx which is an an exchange we call them crypto banks is going to list beacon chain ether so that means that they're going to list and start trading not ether in eth1 but this actual derivative ether in eth2 as a product and they're going to somehow trade it um what's your take on that yeah so some people said that something like this was inevitable and the point about the deposit contract is when you put your ether from the eth1 chain into it it's a one-way bridge right and so when then you have your ether on the e2 chain uh and you can only have it on the eth2 train uh and you know you can't go backwards but some people might want liquidity between each one and each too uh and the only way to do that is through a centralized operator right and so ftx is going to enable you to stake your ether put put your ether from eth1 into e2 through their centralized system and then allow you to trade what is essentially a derivative of ether on their centralized exchange uh i really just don't think this is a big deal the people that are going to be you are like putting their ether from eth1 to east 2 are the stakeholders of ethereum who really want uh who are just in it for the long haul by definition i don't really see and who's going to be speculating on on this i don't really see what this is for yeah i agree and i think the launch of v2 is really geared towards uh hardware-centric like folks that are just running their own so there will be these these crypto exchanges that that do it too which is which is good i mean the more stakers uh the better and you know the more we have the better i i kind of agree we'll have to see how it plans out but i don't think there's any fear uncertainty and doubt associated with that um speaking of eth2 this you know trent put together this fantastic graphic of how all of the phases relate we we're showing the graphic on youtube but for folks that are listening on audio uh david could you just get give a quick like what's gonna happen in phase one phase zero phase one phase 1.5 at least how is it going to blend together yeah tren trent did a good job of kind of bundling everything up because in addition to going from phase zero to one to one point five to two there's also the parallel roadmap of rollups which kind of have their own um own place in the roadmap right now we are at phase one we are at the point where people are putting money into the deposit contract zero right excuse me phase zero straight faces yes people are putting ether into the deposit contract uh and then that uh heartbeat of ethereum which is phase zero gets up and running and then uh the the prediction therefore after that is phase one will come in nine months to a year after that uh that's what preston van loon said on our previous video so check that out uh and then we get into phase 1.5 and the way well the reason why phase 1.5 is so important is think of ethereum 2.0 as a rocket ship with 63 rockets on it right and then this 64th rocket which is ethereum one comes in docks and it loads into the rest of the the bigger rocket ship and then all of a sudden there's 64 rocket ships and once it's in there once once uh the ethereum 1.0 gets loaded into the ethereum 2.0 ship then it's all one entire thing and we have ethereum one rolled into ethereum two and that's how we do this seamless transition that's the roadmap ahead of us trent did a really good job illustrating that in this graphic dude nice analogy and the reality is we could have phase 1.5 done sometime in maybe 2022. so um that's going to be fantastic and that's when the old proof of work dies and issuance drops to below one percent how crazy is that all right um david we don't have time but um to talk about all of these things but uh loopering just put out some cool stuff we'll include a link in the show notes uh and verizon's doing more with the blockchain i guess that bleeds into the news let's talk about what's going on in the news australia joining the club they're running a central bank digital currency pilot right now with consensus so that would be on a private version of ethereum but we're seeing all the central banks do something in this space and it feels like they're all crowding into it in the last six months i think that's only going to accelerate yep central bank digital currencies are hot like there's been at least two central banks doing a central bank digital currency in the last two roll-ups right so this is like our sixth or seventh or eighth like central bank digital currency right and also tip of the hat to consensus is always there behind the scenes helping people helping these banks uh do their thing um we got into an argument ryan in the in the bank list discord about are the central bank digital currencies going to be based on ether on on ethereum or are they going to be their own uh totally centralized ledger uh that's going to be an interesting discussion yeah totally and it might be a little a blend of both where they use their own totally centralized ledger and then settle on ethereum for some things but let's talk about the other signals that are going on this is a massive one dude this is uh paypal right uh in their q3 earnings report this is their earnings call that they have with investors if you read this snippet of the trans of the transcript i want to talk about this might be their ceo talking it's one of their executives anyway he says this finally i'd like to discuss our recent announcement to increase the utility of cryptocurrencies as well as embrace new forms of central bank digital currencies again paypal is adding the ability to purchase crypto in paypal and then in 2021 they're adding it to venmo and he says this we are entering a new era of financial services where our wallets and all the services around them are moving from physical to digital sounds like he's listening to bankless david what do you think man that's pretty bullish largest corporations largest payment processors they're coming to crypto same time central bank digital currencies are central banks are signaling this way everybody is coming to crypto yeah it's just a massive convergence upon this new realm of money right this new way to host and have money so not only is the central bank digital currency room crowded the companies uh jostling to serve central bank digital currencies are also playing that same game there's a lot of competition uh for companies who want to serve these central banks yeah mastercard joining the ferrari their president this week says their crypto patents will pay off when the central bank digital currencies arrive everyone thinks central bank digital currencies are com are coming even the biggest banking uh processors payment processors in the world right now fidelity also is doubling down they're hiring 20 crypto engineers to work on their blockchain side of things 20 plus that's the a very large amount all crypto blockchain that's a large one yeah dude there's not that many there's not that many uh blockchain developers out there yeah where are they going to find them so like this is this is a trend that's happening i expect we'll update it more on this in the in the roll ups to come real quick david we should talk about this story too um us officials just seized more than one billion dollars it was funny on tuesday everyone uh you know like kind of woke up to the fact that some money was getting transferred billion dollars worth of old bitcoin that hadn't moved since like 20 2012 or something was being moved and it was one of the largest uh holding addresses in all of all of bitcoin we just found out what that was what was it david yeah so it was an outgrowth of silk road bitcoins apparently uh whoever controlled the private keys for these bitcoins stole them from the silk roads stole them from ross albrecht himself and because of that the us government was like this is ours thank you uh the unknown about this story is how this government identified this how the u.s government identified this individual and then got him to willingly forfeit the funds to him probably with threats of jail time for life or something like that because that's what they can do uh and so now these were ross's an example yep uh-huh and so now now now the big takeaway for the of the story is that the u.s government has a billion dollars worth of bitcoin they're probably going to have to auction it off uh and that's going to be an interesting development that's what they did with their last stash i wonder how long it takes them i'm sure they'll find lots of institutional buyers this time even last time they did this in 2013 folks from like the venture capital world like tim draper um stood up and bought some and that turned into a very brilliant investment for him um david it's kind of the same story right nation state is is uh raising its head and taking some action in crypto along with embracing all of these technologies at the same time so it's an interesting like it's an interesting um i guess mechanism to sort of watch yes interesting juxtaposition you found the word for me all right if you are

contract wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz let's go to take speaking of what's happening what's what's on your mind right now david what are some of your hot takes for the week yeah my hot take for the week is that we constantly hear about how there's just this lack of trust in institutions right like no one knows who to trust anymore like the the central government isn't really doing the job that we wanted to our the companies facebook silicon valley we don't trust them either uh and as we all know 2020 has been just a year of just reorganizing your brain to a new reality right people are just things are different now for many many different reasons and one thing and the underlying theme is a lack of trust right a lack of trust in institutions and so i want to pose to the listeners what's more likely to uh return get new trust back is it going to be that we are going to improve our old institutions or that we adopt new institutions and what are new institutions other than bitcoin ethereum and d5 applications specifically institutions that are trustless that you can trust by default and you know what i i don't know of any other like you asked that question what are the new institutions it's either the old governments that we have to change from the inside or it's honestly it's these digital like corporate overlord nations like the the nation of facebook the nation of mark zuckerberg the nation of twitter right i don't trust them right jesus do you trust them no they could be worse they're part of the problem right and so where are we going to get new trust well what about trustless systems like that's the whole point of this revolution and this world the 2020 world has been so crazy i don't think it's that far-fetched anymore to ask people to like learn about bitcoin to learn about ethereum to offer them a new platform because their world's already been turned upside down in 2020 like that's not that much of an ask anymore no this feels very much like a new puzzle piece fitting into the whole list of things we we trust um yeah nice inside dude fascinating thank you ryan what about you all right so one thing i've got three all right but but i'll make them quick right so the first the first is this david so i feel like for a long time um people have been talking about like ethereum will never work smart contracts will never work d5 is just a toy it will never work well guess what uniswap is now doing 4 billion in volume and trading volume on a weekly basis which is more than coinbase by the way right we can verify that on ethereum and like it's no longer an option for you to say ethereum is pointless and defined won't work right it's no longer an option unit swap was a protocol built two years ago in 24 months now it's doing four billion dollars my hot take is shut up if you're saying ethereum smart contracts define out work like just look at you in a swap and then shut up because uh like bonuses yeah what are you talking about it doesn't work okay like one developer did this right like berries to entry it's crazy anyway can't alright moving a billion dollars my other hot take is this um i don't think a whole bunch of things are priced into you eth right now the asset that's right i'm a bowl on eat you guys think of that david i know you're a bull on either but look eth2 is not priced in right now in my opinion i don't think eath staking is priced in i don't think eath as a store of value money is priced in i don't even think the potential of defy is priced in and i know fifteen five uh fifteen is not priced in either so there's no way i don't think any of this is priced in so if you know this stuff it feels like some alpha all right uh ready for spicy take yeah okay here we go i said i tweeted this out we don't need a bitcoin v2 because it already exists it's called ethereum and before you say ryan i disagree with that let me say like i obsolete i also partially disagree with this right so like i don't fully 100 agree with it like i don't think you can actually replace bitcoin that's really not what i'm saying but i do think that ethereum is executing on a few things that now bitcoin doesn't need to execute so if bitcoin ever thought it should add expressivity or smart contracts to bitcoin it doesn't need to because ethereum is here right if bitcoin ever thought it should create and layer two it doesn't need to because ethereum is a better layer too than it can come up with right yep um if ethereum if bitcoin never wanted to transition to proof of stake it doesn't need to because ethereum already has essentially and i do think like ethereum is kind of taking this bank with sufficient right to the max and that was part of the vision of the satoshi white paper so yeah what's your is that spicy or is that now i've muted it down and nerfed it and it's not so spicy i i yeah i think the second one actually innovation like trying to do something on bitcoin it just works better on ethereum right and so it seems to be that bitcoin is being whittled and whittled and whittled down to just the main l1 bitcoin chain which is just fine because again that's not bitcoin isn't trying to do other anything else other than support btc the asset but you're totally right like all the value of all the other under other innovations are going on to ethereum ethereum is an evolution on bitcoin it doesn't replace bitcoin but it just is a it's a 3d movement upon a 2d uh historical uh like whatever bitcoin is totally agree i i feel like it's all part of the the the family of religions that you know the crypto religions basically it's just another branch um all right let's talk about lastly um this is i love ending with this david so we've given you guys news some hot ticks some releases but what are you most excited about at this point first week november 2020 what's exciting yeah so again like we're all we're perma bulls i guess on the bankless podcast we don't mean to be but i guess we are but but what i'm excited about is that just the arrival of ethereum 2.0 brings in so many uh just positive and order consequences second order third order consequences that that just are are really really helpful like in in 2017 people kept on talking about like what is ether how do we define ether and people for some reason to this day still cite john pfeffer's uh ether investment analysis as which is basically summarized as ether as gas and the velocity of ether is not going to make it valuable but then people in the ethereum community like people like you and me and eric connor and anthony cesano would like raise their flag and be like that's not correct for these reasons and all of the reasons that we would give were actually hypothetical like dependent on future success of ethereum reasons right and so now that interior almost yeah right because somebody could say yeah show us when it ships right right and you're and you're like damn it good point but like once it's here like if anyone at this point in time is citing john pfeffer like the the days are numbered right like the the days of the john pfeffer investment thesis of ether are out and the days of the triple point asset are in and the again the triple point asset was just a thesis and it we are seeing it turn into reality and that is just going to ultimately be reflected in the price of ether yeah it feels like that old uh ethers oil ethyl gas kind of um analogy has totally broken down it's almost as like it almost feels as old and dated as d5 will never work d5 has no use cases winning unit swap is doing four billion in weekly volume yeah right so far the bankless takes for the past like two years have have been on point yeah we've been saying it from day we'll see all right i feel that way we'll see yeah what are you excited about all right you know what um you stole mine david i don't know i'm just kidding i mean you're going to go into more detail look uh i i think maybe my focus is this like eth2 launched right and what this eth asset is becoming is a productive asset um ran it ran a piece by stefan um coolikin who actually runs a publicly traded company in canada you know what they do they just tell me they just buy eth that's their investment thesis they buy eve and sometimes they invest as another company so it's a publicly traded company with a balance sheet full of youth and he wrote this great great post called the birth of the digital bond about how ether the asset in staking becomes a digital bond a yield bearing instrument this is somebody with a traditional financial background who is talking about this we just put out a post um today so this will be yesterday by the time you listen to this called eat the internet bond um and this basically goes through how you can think about ether the way you would think about a traditional like sovereign bond for instance when it's staked it has basically the same elements of a bond it has a face value it has a present value it has a market value and those can be kind of discounted based on um like based on time based on the horizon based on sort of the the market value and there's a discount rate so what's cool about this i think is staking will lead to traditional investors institutional investors being able to understand ether the asset i think they don't quite understand it right now i think over the past three years or so we've seen institutional investors start to understand bitcoin it's like oh okay digital gold okay now they have scarce digital scarcity embedded embedded in their head the next journey for institutional investors and for mainstream investors is to understand eth as an internet bond a digital bond as a yield bearing instrument and a whole non-sovereign open decentralized economy so i think um we're at the very start of that narrative kind of picking up and institutional investors starting to understand that david so that's what i'm excited about and by the way we're gonna have um andrew keyes i think on next week to talk a little bit about that and the folks that helped write this um white paper on eth as an internet bond to talk about that on a state of the nation so more on that soon yeah there's no shortage of eat staking and ether related content in the bankless nation and that's because that's exactly what ether deserves like ether is the most insane asset of all time and and just to keep on hammering on on this point like we have never seen a bond market with a hard money before that is something that will be brand new to this this universe yeah speaking of which david you get your validator preps and hardware yeah absolutely i already already got apparently according to preston who again you guys got to listen to the episode with preston i'm gonna make a link happen right right around here in the corner of youtube uh you can apparently stake like uh like 10 000 validators on like a macbook pro uh i won't be needing that many validators but wait how how much of a whale are you david three hundred and twenty thousand eath on my macbook yeah that's that's what i'm doing i'm getting ready for that you can almost boot up the network by yourself [Laughter] yeah well it's awesome man all right dude well i think that is all our time we kept our promise we gave you guys the week in crypto everything you need to know from a news releases market perspective and also some hot takes to end it with hope you enjoyed the first week of november this has been our roll up as always none of this is financial advice the assets we talk about are risky you could lose what you put in but thanks for joining us on the bankless journey we're signing off
