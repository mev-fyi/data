welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless Tim Ferriss is on the podcast he's an award-winning writer podcast with almost a billion downloads in a life hacker he's here to give us his perspective on crypto nfts and also to drop some Alpha on his newest project a project that very much involves crypto and I think so does David is going to take the World by storm a few things to look for in this episode number one is Tim all in on crypto now we ask him that question what does he think of crypto Tim has an interesting perspective as both an Insider in the space and an outsider a little bit of both number two Tim's been head down full time on a secret nft project for the last year or so and it's got a bizarre name what's this project about when is it going to launch why has he spent the last year year of his life on this project we're going to talk about that in the project itself which has a really cool approach I don't think we've seen in crypto so far and number three turns out Tim Ferriss had some money on FTX Dave and I asked him some questions toward the end of the episode about how to cope how to deal with that type of loss and how he moves on moving forward some excellent advice at the end of this episode so make sure you stay tuned for that David without revealing too much about the nft project we'll leave that for Tim what should listeners know going to this episode I think listeners should really pay attention to why Tim feels motivated to do an nft project and what about nfts has captured Tim's mind and what the thing I'm really happy about is that what we're seeing here is nfts the technology unlocking some like Creative Energy out of a huge like high performance individual and listener should know going into this episode that Tim has found a way to express himself as a creative individual and he's using of his own volition nfts to get that done this isn't some like this isn't this is not your typical nft drop this is not Tim coming in and doing an nft pfp thing he has created an whole entire universe and he's using nfts as a technology to get that done so I think this is going to be a an interesting just like uh unpacking of somebody using nfts to just do something that they want to do and so that being the context I think people might appreciate what he's up to in this nft world uh further on into the show we spent about 45 minutes the first 45 minutes of the show circling the nft project that shall not be named uh just getting context getting Tim's history uh but then at some point we just explicitly say hey Tim okay what are the details at that moment in time if you have kids or other sensitive ears on the show they you might suggest skipping over that part because uh as you can tell from the title of this episode uh it's not entirely appropriate but I had a fun time and it's and Ryan and I were laughing our butts off uh and so you probably will too and of course David and I give our full insights into the episode in an episode after the episode we call the debrief which is available for premium bankless subscribers if you are a premium Bank list subscriber you can access that

about this conversation we're about to have with Tim Ferriss Tim is a five-time New York Times best-selling author uh award-winning podcaster with over 900 million downloads that's creeping up to a billion uh bankless has some work to do to catch up David and he's also a prolific angel investor uh he's on the cusp of talking about a secret nft project doing a drop here didn't know he was a crypto guy but maybe he is we're going to discuss that and what he has planned for this drop Tim welcome to Bagless how you doing man I'm doing great thanks for having me thrilled to be here uh we are thrilled to have you too so um both Dave and I were just talking I think you got him into cooking I think you got me into like the four hour work week lifestyle like there can be something outside of the the grind that Society prescribes to you so uh we appreciate you thanks oh well I appreciate you guys Man Without readers I'm not here so I really appreciate it uh so I want to start with this question maybe it's on people's mind um as they're going at this episode on Bank list with Tim Ferriss wait is Tim a crypto guy now like I don't know that you have to be but there's some kind of tribe affiliation I guess but describe your relationship with with crypto are you crypto guy I mean there are some very technical very deep experts in crypto so I would say I'll put it this way I began I began acquiring crypto in late 2012 early 2013. so I have been I suppose on the playing field for a decent stretch of time and continued to be engaged pretty heavily uh all the way through the let's just call it 2017 excitement uh 2015-17 excitement and have stayed in and then on the art side I have been engaged very deeply engaged with art broadly speaking since I was a kid I wanted to be a comic book penciler for about a decade and actually got paid as an illustrator through part of college worked in various illustration and graphic design capacities all the way through college digital art entered the scene for me when I moved to Selena Valley and was trying to support a number of digital comic book startups the tech wasn't quite there but I collected comic books as a kid and still have all of my thousands of comic books poly bagged and backed to this day digital art as we're talking about it probably entered the scene for me early 2021 and I owe Kevin Rose thanks for that also Katie Han so Katie Han it had uh a tutorial for me on my podcast and then simultaneously Kevin started talking to me about I guess both some of the early days with respect to nfts on the ethereum blockchain and then things went from there so I have collected and I've been engaged with Krypton blockchain since late 2012 early 2013. so what Ryan was trying to do right there and what I want to continue to do is uh everyone in crypto has kind of their archetype their their category so if I'm getting a sense of that like not necessarily A crypto guy but as soon as nfts came on the scene nfts perhaps resonated with you a lot more and that's really what we saw out of 2021 is uh nfts as a technology arrived and all of a sudden it brought in a lot more people uh and it sounds like that it brought you in um in in that particular uh because of nfts is that is that right I did I would say nfts were of interest to me and the technology layers were of interest to me and uh so I've been engaged with that and Kevin and I always test I shouldn't say always but frequently test early Tech and what interested me about nfts was number one I could see it being a huge Catalyst for both established artists and would-be artists to generate a lot of Art and do a lot of experiments so that was extremely exciting to me number two jpegs pretty jpegs are a very easy gateway drug and onboarding ramp to get normies involved with blockchain Technologies without bludgeoning them with really really difficult technical details so I saw it also as an easy way to open the end of the funnel to get more people who are non-technical Muggles like myself involved with all these Technologies so that is that was the primary interest I suppose those were the converging lines that pulled me in so if inside of the nft world there's also like two kinds of people right there are some people who are like bullish on nfts because of like the broad General potential that it has to like change a lot of the monetization model of the Internet it's like an investable category it's an investable industry and then there's other people who are like actual artists who just see nfts as a way to like monetize their art it's just a tool for them to enable them to do the things that they do uh do you resonate with one uh one Persona more than the other I would say I'm a boundary Walker here and that may come up later it's a great book called uh trickster makes this world or makes the World by Lewis Hyde that I highly suggest to people but talks about these trickster archetypes coyote Raven Etc as boundary Walkers right and I identify with that on a whole lot of levels and here that's also the case so I am interested in nfts broadly speaking right could they replace car titles could they replace let's just say shipping around various Collectibles whereby you could have I'm making this up but a wine collection that is enormous that is stored in one place and people can buy and sell and trade these items using nfts in a verifiable way including all of the possibilities for primary and then secondary sales slash royalties and so on I am also bullish on the artistic side if secondaries and royalties can be sustained if there's a race to the bottom and I understand the marketplace Dynamics and the economic incentives and market share drivers that apply pressure downward on all these things then the artists disappear that's just a foregone conclusion so uh I would say TBD on that but I'm I'm interested in both for sure what's what's really interesting Tim about your story so far is it's kind of similar to Kevin's right it's like when we've we've talked to Kevin on the podcast a couple times this is Kevin Rose of course um you know he's talked about I've been in crypto for a while like but I didn't really I mean it was okay it was cool I respect the technology but I wasn't one of the the money crypto type people like I was interested in Bitcoin but like the use case didn't really appeal to me why because I have a bank account and like it kind of works okay and I don't it's still pretty hard to buy coffee with Bitcoin right you still can't do that and so it for him uh you know I think he said before even though he was sort of you know uh in in from the very Beginnings it didn't capture his attention he didn't get go fully down the rabbit hole for for like David and myself is probably a little different in that um we're very excited about like the money application of crypto but even more broadly we think of this as like it's digital property rights for the internet exactly like wow what did we just create and so like money is just one app on this digital property right system but like the whole idea of social reorganization here around like things that you can value on the Internet is super cool anyway it feels like you're you're kind of in the camp of coming at it from like you're interested in these applications but you didn't go full in body and soul until you saw this really cool way that creators are using are using the medium uh in this in this fantastic way and that that's why by the way I know we're going to talk about your project but it's very much it's an it's an artist talking about this project and that's why you're in it but yeah what do you have to say on that well what I was going to say is that I've dabbled in D5 for instance and I'm very fascinated by it but it's not a core area of expertise for me Finance to begin with financial instruments derivatives Etc are not a core competency of mine I mean I'm not completely financially illiterate but I am not a finance person and therefore I I tended to stay on the edges of that I did experiment and I've used my own money but I didn't go Whole Hog I didn't feel confident enough to do that whereas nfts and more broadly and we'll talk about this probably but once you start to expand and look at the potential of say storytelling and having various layers that intertwine one layer of which or one component of which is artwork then we start to get very quickly into a Venn diagram of overlapping strengths and core competencies of mine and that I think is what has kept me up so many sleepless nights with hair brained ideas I think some amazing ideas I just can't [ __ ] sleep yeah it's been the story of the last I don't know let's call it 9 to 12 months and I would just wake up in the middle of the night laughing and I would have to you know at the time turn to my girlfriend and uh just say you should be like what are you laughing about and I'd be like you know what I'm laughing about and she'd be like oh God here we go once again and uh that's exciting to me right there's bad insomnia and I suppose any insomnia if it's night after night after night ultimately gets bad but there's bad insomnia where it's stress anxiety and then for me there's this physiological quickening that is good insomnia where you just can't stop the ideas from coming related to some project you're really excited about yeah it sounds like you got bit by the bug yeah yeah yeah I think it's I got I got bitten by the bug and I also had a number of bugs from Christmas Past meaning these latent passions that I have had for a very very long time that also woke up and bit me in the ass in a good way that's a yeah that's really cool another piece of this because I know you've had um many people from crypto on on your podcast before right so you've had Katie Han you mentioned right I think he did an episode with um uh Chris Dixon and maybe it was um also also people like vitalik has been Metallica so so you you've definitely uh heard the crypto perspective uh for a long time but this is the thing that got you in I'm also kind of looking for like maybe you probably so one thing about Bank lists and I think about people who are a crypto so like Dave and I have been bitten by the bug for a while and like it was defying money and organ reorganizing the internet but like but that can lead to um a silo right that can lead to like we have this um yeah this bubble around us of like permeables like even in the wake of what just happened to him like FTX and all that we're like this is good for crypto you know because like it promotes decentralization um but but I'm curious kind of your perspective as your sort of this uh this boundary Walker as you say can you get us in the head of like some of the things that um give you trepidation about entering here because I censored that when I when I was when I was hearing like you and and Kevin talk about it on the proof uh podcast I could get the sense that like there were some qualifiers from Tim you're like it's this type of nft but it's not this and I don't want to make promises and guarantees and like the speculative thing it felt like to me you weren't quite like you didn't want to be associated with the scam element of crypto which I totally understand or maybe I'm reading things into it but tell me about your your trepidations totally I would say with respect to the the many caveats that I gave in the proof podcast with Kevin it's not so much that I don't want to be associated with the scam elements I'm not too worried about that uh at least if for anyone who has followed me for any period of time I'm not worried about that but I don't want people to buy my pretty jpegs as Investments and yeah who knows what the future may hold but ultimately I want people to view engaging with this as entertainment all right would you take your two kids to Disney World does that cost a few hundred bucks great will you potentially get that much entertainment out of this or two trips to Disney World maybe or if you go to a Broadway show how much does that cost with a few people right or two nice dinners are you gonna get or three nice dinners like do I think I can deliver that much entertainment for people that will not provide necessarily a financial return I think that's a healthy way for me to approach this rather than what a lot of people do which is pump pump to the moon this is going to be amazing oh my God take out a fourth mortgage sell your car forego your kid's College tuition this is going to be a a thousand bagger I don't wanna in any way imply that I can predict the future and certainly I don't think a lot of people could have predicted this past week with with FTX some people perhaps had a window into the possibilities but very few people who we would assume are tracking the space incredibly closely could have predicted anything like this with any type of precise time frame right and I do think there are a bunch of ways that this could be good long term for a lot of ecosystems that we're all involved with but the the caveats I would say uh sort of lead into and the hesitations come in a few different forms on a personal level I will say that a lot of once a lot of let me rephrase that a lot of what was old is now once new again in the sense that People Are People human nature is human nature and money is money on some level and therefore we're gonna see a lot of the same bad behavior that we saw in the non-digital financial markets before there was regulation or let's just say some degree of of competent regulation and there are many forms this bad behavior can take let's just say we're going back to before any type of centralized banking where people were stuffing dollars under mattresses and putting gold bars under their floorboards what happens people get robbed right as as one example and therefore there's a part of me and this is probably going to upset a lot of people listening so I'll for I'll ask for forgiveness in advance but there's definitely part of me that that is operates along the lines of thinking you know would I rather have Amazon see all of my purchase histories or would I rather the entire internet see all of my purchase histories right there's there's definitely part of me that's more comfortable with Amazon uh with lots of Regulation lots of internal rules lots of policy lots of I know in internal yet centralized technology having a window into that and I do know people who have who have had uh wrench attacks attempted on them and for those who don't know it's really cheap hack it's a five dollar wrench or a crowbar and using the threat of physical violence or real physical violence or the threat of physical violence against someone you care about to extract in this case say crypto or assets that are denominated in crypto so uh I am wary on some level of being my own bank now it doesn't mean I'll never do it but uh I do think there are some risks that for a lot of people are very abstract and low likelihood for a lot of people the likelihood of them getting scammed or having their wallet drained is maybe the same likelihood of having a shark attack he's probably getting their leg bitten off by a great white for me or for anyone who's public facing I think the risk is actually pretty high and therefore I'm very very careful about it so I I do think there will be decentralized options that are very attractive for some people and there will be more centralized or maybe sort of medium-sized centralized options that are more appealing for others so so some of my hesitations are from a security standpoint I mean when when concerns like this go from abstract for a lot of people too real right I've had I've had death threats I've had people come to conferences with guns threatening to kill me I've had bomb threats I've had stalkers I've had to escalate things to the FBI once those types of things happen to you and your house is full of guns and so on you just think about security risks a little differently so those are those are some of my hesitations beyond that I would say it's primarily like look and this doesn't relate to my project necessarily but web3 and D5 and all these things crypto in general from a personal level I think about security a lot right multi-sig everything you can imagine and then on the project side I do not want people with poor impulse control or who have somehow become intoxicated with the space to view this as an investment I just think that's a terrible terrible terrible idea doesn't mean it couldn't go up it might but there's also a chance this thing goes to zero I mean just you can't tell in these in these markets and with so many not only micro factors involved but macro factors that even I mean I know a lot of top investors globally including some of the top macro guys in the world it is hard for them to place bets right now very challenging so Ted Talk complete thanks for thanks for listening no no like that makes sense Tim and I I kind of get you on the money use case right so I think um you know two things you emphasize that um crypto hasn't yet solved one is like on-chain privacy that's just not trackable and traceable and it really hasn't solved that so if that's a use case that's important to you like crypto really hasn't solved that in the money realm and then the other is like um good kind of like smart contract wallet multi-sig so that you are more immune from wrench attack where you have some sort of social recovery that's maybe like a piece of your key is with a lawyer and like you know five other people so that it's just like you can't be wrench attacked something like this but we're not there yet either I mean I think that's coming but but well you know the other piece I guess I wanted to talk about though is um I really respect and get from a Creator's perspective that you are playing the long game and always have and so what I what I see in you you and what I hear in you is you want to over deliver for your community anything that Tim Ferriss creates you want to deliver more value than it costs on people right and so that's why you don't want people to lose money you don't want to over promise things in fact what I what I hear from you often about this project that we're about to talk about in a little bit is a downplay of just like this thing could go to zero like don't buy it don't be but but let me ask you this question because this is key at some level Tim isn't it out of your hands like once this thing goes to Market that is the thing with D5 that's the feature and the good and the bad which is like Tim Ferriss can say all day you know Tim Ferriss is tweeting this Pro this this uh nft is overvalued don't buy it this is absolutely ludicrous these prices don't believe me and then somebody goes and is like oh Tim's downplaying it that makes me so bullish right now and they like get up the price higher like how do you said the word that yeah don't buy this what I heard was buy yes uh it is out of my control absolutely it's 100 out of my control uh really all I want to be able to do what I really really hope I don't get and there probably will be some of these where people are are like I just took out this loan or used my last few dollars to buy this jpeg and I really hope a b and c right and if it doesn't go well and I know this is like the anti-sales [ __ ] but if it look I'm trying to create something awesome to be very clear right I am I'm I think I've already created something that is actually pretty amazing I'm very happy about happy with it and proud of it but if it doesn't go well and then someone's like oh my God my life is in shambles I want to be able to point back to at least me very publicly saying do not buy this unless you have a hundred X the cost of this in your savings a thousand X the cost of this in your savings right do not buy it at all period And do not view it as an investment period full stop I want to be able to point back to me publicly saying that so that I at least feel like I've done what I can control and that's just the messaging in the beginning but yeah once it once it goes to Market it's got totally out of my heads I mean you know with Bots and day Traders and whatever that's like you know I know I know people are going to come in to trade but I want to feel like I have been as ethical and moral in how I've presented this thing at the outset yeah you want to you want to clean conscience here so yeah totally and to your point I'm also playing the long game right it's it's I want to be creating more art for a very very long time so yes I mean that's and for those who don't know me I mean I've been in the game for a while now right first book came out 2007. five books and like you said the podcast close to a billion downloads now of 700 FPS a 600 700 episodes like I've lost count something like that so I have uh been in the game for a while and I plan to be in the game for a long time so we're kind of circling around the details of this drop and I think we'll continue to Circle at least for a little bit more because I got some more questions before it plays great um one of the questions I have for you is like well when you commit to making an nft a token is a financial asset uh so whether or not like you intend on people like investing in these things the choice to make a financial asset is a choice and so we'll kind of unpack what the utility of making these things into tokens unlocks but we'll kick that one down the road because I still have some other what questions I want to get to uh the something you said earlier resonated with me I want you to unpack it a little bit um and like nfts and tokens are really just like form factors they're just vehicles for expression uh and when I see Tim Ferriss I see a guy who like really wants to express himself like if you look at your body of work it's a bunch of different books across a variety of spectrums like optimizations biomechanics bioengineering uh like workplace how to work a a full job inside of four hours and that's aside from all the podcasts cooking yeah right uh so like Tim Tim is a super creative guy and that's a size from all like the the artistic side right the the drawing the graphic design uh and so I've always thought of like nfts as like these new form factors to help uh artistic expression cultural output uh and I'm wondering if if if that's also what you see and how you see nfts and the intersection of just like cultural expression is that what nfts are doing for you and is that what you're trying to do with this project yeah and I'm almost curious like what your nft portfolio looks like a little bit like not portfolio I'm using the wrong word right that's a stupid Finance word what does your collection look like yeah well let's see so on the creative expression side of the questions I would say yes and yes what's most exciting to me in my circle of friends about nfts I mean there are people who've done extremely well financially and that's great but these are generally people who are already doing pretty well financially so you can only eat so many M M's so that's not in and of itself very interesting what's interesting in my circle of friends is musicians graphic artists designers who during covid through nfts were able to make a living and put food on the table and sock aways some savings maybe actually continue to make art even though they had to cancel touring with an ongoing royalty stream from art they were producing that's interesting all of a sudden these folks who had maybe been dominantly in one medium were suddenly creating pieces that were multimedia for the first time and they were collaborating with people they never would have collaborated with otherwise meeting people they never would have met otherwise that is exciting just from the potential of some type of I this is going to be maybe a strong statement but some type of creative Cambrian explosion of sorts where you have all of these emergent life forms and creative art forms that you couldn't have predicted otherwise or couldn't have predicted period and then on the collection side of things uh I have a I think beautiful collection of nfts and it's mostly inexpensive stuff or moderately priced stuff because I do not trade I've never sold aside from my own which yeah they're all jpegs because there's like music nfts there's like gifts but like jpegs is mostly yeah yeah these I do have I do have music as well uh but in this case I'm talking about visual right like you can see behind me like I care about the visual like it's it's the Arts all over my house and it's also mostly inexpensive uh and the reason for that is number one I don't trade the only nft I have sold is actually one I've sold through Grails and Kevin Rose which was my first ever published fiction short story which was part of the Grail season one but of my Personal Collection I've never sold anything and I would say a few that come to mind for me that I really have enjoyed meridians I think are stunning some of them uh in particular the ones that have ended up looking something like Chinese watercolor landscape paintings are just I think mesmerizing clonex caught my attention very early and opened my mind and my eyes to what could be potentially done with 3D art and me bits prior to that but I don't own any mebits and there are there are many others they are almost entirely things that pass a sniff test for me and this is going to sound so primitive the sniff test is would I ever take this and blow it up to several feet by several feet and stick it on a wall in my house where I look at it every day would I do that yes or no pass or fail and Tim do you know that I have a five foot by five foot crypto Punk blown up on my wall in my apartment oh that's amazing yeah yeah so that's that's a great example uh crypto pucks I mean look larva labs and just from an innovation perspective and you know guys who have set Trends in motion that were never maybe intended to be trans holy [ __ ] I mean they've done amazing amazing work so you know I track what they do uh but uh those would be those would be a few examples it's all it's all stuff that I like to look at so it's all visual for you Tim you're not like looking at the community or are you like also doing uh I don't know investigation on the artists like whether you kind of oh yeah is it purely just the visual this is like I like this thing I've studied I've I've studied a lot of the artists and have been lucky enough to spend time with people like Tyler Hobbs I think fidences are [ __ ] gorgeous I don't know if I'm allowed to curse hopefully I'm from Long Island I apologize you can bleep those out if this is crypto my friends oh yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah that's right not the right business to be in if you don't like lots of acronyms and lots of cursing so uh I am interested in the artist I've spent time with a bunch of artists and have gone to now the first and second Marfa Texas meetups hosted by snowfro and art blocks and have spent a lot of time with artists so I am interested in that but I'm not primarily I the art has to be good for me right I mean I've designed every one of my book covers outside of tools of Titans like I sketched and hand Drew out I laid out all the specs of course had a professional polish it make it suitable for printing I'm so maybe people won't get the reference here but Monkish meaning I'm so OCD with my visual Acuity if I go to somebody's house to have dinner and a painting or a or photo on the walls slightly crooked like I'll get up and I'll correct it I'm very sad I'm buried that guy I'm that [ __ ] guy I'm very sensitive so if somebody just takes you know a bunch of otter [ __ ] and smears it on a wall and sticks like an LED spinner next to it and then they have a four page explanation for why this is Art and why people should care about it I'm not interested does that make sense like the the the the visual component has to have something redeeming about it and that's just my programming I can't evade that so yes it matters but I'm also studying the artists I'm also studying older artists like if if if we actually that red book if you can see it right up there that's a book on Rodan the famous sculptor who made The Thinker among other things and I study a lot of older artists I have for a long time I study comic book artists I mean I just interviewed uh Todd McFarlane on my podcast we did two episodes when we're recording this they haven't yet come out but childhood hero amazing comic book artist reinvented The Amazing Spider-Man created Spawn I mean the guy's a legend so I do study all of that including a lot of Japanese influences too I've spent a lot of time in Japan I lived in Japan I collected Japanese comic books read and write Japanese right so I'm paying attention to all that the communities are interesting to me so I have studied for instance Yuga and board API Club I don't own any Apes sadly missed that boat but I find what they're trying to do interesting I find some of the CC zero stuff interesting and I've I've looked at how that has begun to play out in different ways I find what uh you know nouns and nouns down Doodles and so on are doing really interesting but the I suppose where I lean is a little closer to the Disney Yuga side of things and further away from the cc0 from a creative standpoint you're talking about like IP like licensing how you view that I'm not necessarily talking I mean I am talking about IP yes that's a piece of it but I'm I'm talking more about creative the core of the like the who decides the core and the kernel of the creative Genesis and uh I I do think that very often uh and I I'm not going to get the attribution on this I don't know who originally said this but a camel is a horse designed by committee yeah and you got to be careful with crowdsourcing your creative decisions you can have feedback and input and pay attention to that which is something I've done forever right a lot of blog posts ultimately led to books from Geek to freak which was my first blog post to go super viral forgot about that my thousand plus blog posts that I've put up since 2005 or six yeah did those too but uh geek to freak that post was the initial Market testing and Genesis of the four hour body which came out in 2010 and became a number one New York Times bestseller so I pay attention to what people react to and respond to and the feedback but I think allowing the crowd to dictate your creative decisions is generally a terrible approach yeah so I I like I think of a lot of designers like this one figure the archetype stands mine is like it's a Steve jobsian way to kind of design yeah there is a decision maker and like if you had tried to design the original iPhone without a Steve Jobs Visionary who's the final decider it would have just never done anything yeah yeah totally and I'm not I don't want to compare myself to Steve Jobs that's I think that would be the pride coming before the fall but um but uh don't buy Tim's nfts don't don't buy my nfts but I will say that uh I do think for me and for a lot of projects not all not all not all but especially if you're trying to do what I'm doing which is and we'll get to this I'm sure but you know what I'm calling an elf project an elf emergent long fiction project there has to be someone in the driver's seat there has to be or it just becomes spaghetti and it's just like a narrative made of spaghetti and it it turns into a complete [ __ ] show is my opinion yeah so I think we're starting to get uh further into the details of this nft project so maybe we'll unpack that that angle of it just one last time before we actually go into the details so what is your role in this what is your role in this project are you like the creative director are you like The Mastermind the orchestrator like how would you describe your role in this project and how many other people are also working on on this with you are like how big is this team yeah team is team is Tiny But just just for reference right because let's say a lot of top podcasts out there have teams of 30 40 people now and I have are you serious yes yeah they have they have huge huge teams and they they also build out and most podcasts now if they want to compete I have not done this because I refuse but are are becoming television shows so I know of podcasters who are spending and these are I don't think even top 100 podcasters uh on Apple rankings who are spending five to ten million dollars on build out of studios and they are hiring 10 20 people at a time to build out that's not always the case but I just bring that up to say I have one full-time employee who works on my podcast and this one-time employee and then we have all contractors for those people who Wonder does Tim Walk The Walk of things in the four hour work week with respect to architecture and lean operations and capital allocation with distributed uh Talent yes I do I have one full-time employee working on the podcast I have another part time and then I have lots of contractors who are excellent at what they do so to come back to your question on this I have uh one person who is a full-time employee who is allocating a lot of time to this right now and probably will continue to do so I am spending right now the majority of my time on this and have been for a while and then I have contractors and that's it I'm not building out a startup operations team with a road map and a Discord and a community manager I am not doing that I refuse I think it's foolish in most cases I think it's putting the cart before the horse and uploading a lot of cost to mollify loud people on the internet who should not be dictating your business or creative decision decisions that's my feeling and it's unnecessary in most cases so so so the team is lean who am I in this entire thing I would say creator right so all of the conceptual framework around it all of the writing so far is from me the writing that has yet to come out right I mean I've I've put together quite a bit for myself the maps I've drawn all the maps myself and they're being put together by someone who's professional but like you know like this is literally you know my my SketchBook that is on the on my my desk AKA kitchen table [Laughter] and uh so I'm the Creator I'm the writer I am the benevolent dictator and very heavily involved with the artwork very very very heavily involved the artwork but I recognize my own limitations and for the type of artwork that I've teased already if people are paying attention the level of detail is beyond belief uh I have not seen anything like it in the space I mean I've I don't think I've seen anything like it period maybe outside of some animated features not to say these are animated but just the depth of detail on 3D figures that are going to be presented in the nfts as two dimensions I have not seen anything like it so very involved with that I mean twice weekly Art reviews providing references and Direction indicating the types of weapons and armors that should and should not be included with different Clans or greater houses it's become very elaborate it's very very very elaborate which I'm excited about and I'm having a lot of fun with so since this is giving me so much energy I'm going to turn around and pour that energy right back into it so the word World building definitely comes to mind I don't think very many nft projects have ingredients that require a significant amount of writing for example that's that's like a new element that I I don't see many NT projects have it's a lot of uh a lot of [ __ ] work right yes yeah there yeah it's not just like oh let me like have a bunch of attributes and slap them and see if the combinations work it's uh there's like a whole universe that it seems like like you're creating wind or what inspired you to do this because like Tim you're a busy guy there are a variety of choices of time of time well spent that you could choose but yet you seem to be this kind of seems like it's it's like living in your brain rent free and you're gonna do that do this thing until it doesn't do that anymore why when did this idea come to you and and why have you decided to to spend so much time here yeah I'd say the the the original the original Sparks and seeds were more than eerio I'd say maybe 14. months ago if I'm looking at the timing yeah 14 15 months ago so while and it just kind of spun out of control from there and it got so ridiculous and all of these ideas were constantly popping up and preventing me from going to sleep and I thought you know this doesn't happen to me that often maybe I should pay attention to this as completely absurd as it seems and at least start putting things down on paper ideas sketches so that in case it goes somewhere at least I have a little bit of momentum and then when I started to expand the scope of my imagination and ambition a little bit and I thought all right how can I make this more Dynamic how could I make this a lot more interesting and engaging how can I create different warring Clans and houses that have various alliances and intertwined histories and long-standing conflicts and different degrees of access to various natural resources for instance different types of expertise different religions different belief systems different uh different systems of magic I think they'll probably be soft systems and not hard systems for you Brandon Sanderson fans out there they just got [ __ ] crazy and uh and then it just grew and grew and grew and grew and I was like okay I'm getting so much energy from this and quite honestly the last year and a half was incredibly difficult for me incredibly difficult and I just seem to be getting uh [ __ ] punched over and over again where we have like like people you know people dying literally who I know and then like a five-year relationship ending and like just uh crazy things happening uh lost a ton of money with this uh uh FTX stuff recently I mean just like hit after hit after hit after hit and I was like you know what maybe as a as a as one musician once said to me like take the pain and wear it like a shirt Amanda Palmer was so somebody calls her Amanda [ __ ] Palmer over and over again so she took it and she literally put Amanda [ __ ] Palmer on the shirt and started asking people to call her that and I was like that's very clever you're like taking the thing that hurts and turning around into something that gives you energy uh so this project in a way became that in part because I realized also it was a hand and glove fit with what I was thinking about anyway and uh so uh yeah that's the uh long story long of how a lot of this came together and then I would say for the last six months especially like this has been my this has been what I spent the majority of my time on it's kind of I mean I have to laugh thinking about the whole thing but I can't really help myself because it is what's giving me the most energy and if I do the thing that gives me the most energy that transfers to everything else and uh yeah I'm having a lot of fun so until that changes I'll keep going so so Tim what piece of it especially is giving you energy right it's like I think of different world Builders right you think of kind of like uh like a Tolkien for for example classically and he he like I mean the guy created languages before five or six five five or six languages right that's like World building extraordinary which I've also studied just as a side note okay so this is crazy so like is it glossopia I think it is called the creation of languages yeah so what piece of this is most exciting for you is it because I know there's an art component there's a World building component you call this uh elf and remind us again what that stands for there's like this fiction emergent emergent long fiction project yeah okay so because this isn't a pfp this is not a pfp project it's an emergent implies that it's going to you it's not here 100 all of the way like it's going to kind of emerge over time and long form of course is like long term and then there it's fiction so long form means higher volume than most projects are willing to put into writing okay so it's more a volume thing than a duration thing but the way I've been thinking about it let me answer your first question first what's most exciting about me I am able to take something that I've loved my whole life which is Art specifically creating art not just looking at art making art and if people go back on my Instagram long enough you can see some of that and resurrecting that giving the the fuel necessary to let the Phoenix Rise From the Ashes of this thing that I I discarded in a way after college because it seemed not grown up enough right like okay now I need to get a job and make money and do this thing and drawing uh like it was fun but it's not really helping me go to where I need to go next so let me put it to the side and then I put it aside and have have really not picked it up much since then because I don't have real accountability even if I have a teacher which I've I've done in several cases I don't really have timelines or deadlines that changes once you have a project to launch now you have a team now you have deadlines now you have slack now you have calendar reminders and that forces me to engage with art which is great so those are some productive constraints that I've applied that also then applies to something I've explored a little bit in the last year or two and have loved and really want to explore more but it's hard to create the time or Justify creating the time if it's just a side Hobby and that is fiction that is World building I've always been a huge fantasy and sci-fi nerd I still have all of my materials from my DND days as a kid I mean I literally have I don't know hundreds of modules that I spent all my allowance and I you know like part-time busboy work money on and read Classics never-ending story was my favorite book as a kid love Tolkien love Ursula K Le Guin wizard of Ozzy go read it if you haven't read it and dozens of others right Philip Pullman to use a more kind of contemporary example incredible and uh if you if you want sci-fi I'm not doing sci-fi just to be clear but go get exhalation which is a short story collection by Ted Shang or his previous collection one of the short stories from which was made into or adapted into a rival one of the I think greatest Sci-Fi movies of the last five to ten years okay so I wanted to do fiction and this gave me the incentive and the deadlines and the accountability to write a bunch of fiction and to get better at it you don't get better unless you're practicing and I have gotten better I've gotten a lot better just in the process of putting the stuff together and the World building and the fiction is exciting to me for what reasons the first is because I get to surprise myself and this will lead into your question about elf and why emergent is important with fiction I get to surprise myself with non-fiction right five books they're huge I mean you guys know because I showed you before we started recording I needed to elevate my mic so I just stuck two books under it uh two books of mine Each of which is like six to seven hundred pages long it's a lot of hard work but there are very very few surprises I outline these books meticulously I have a blueprint I execute to plan and there are surprises for the reader but there are very few surprises for me it's mostly bricklaying and that's great but I prefer to try something new and in fiction there are many ways to write fiction and I'm still learning this right I am a novice although I'm very happy with what's come come out of my brain so far with enough caffeine and maybe the occasional glass or two of wine but but uh with fiction there are a lot of ways you can approach it some people spec everything out in advance with this I wanted to set some initial conditions characters Clans uh conditions meaning landscape territory constraints and then to start writing and see what happens and that's what I'm doing so it would be akin to let's just say taking a trip to Europe with five friends and you decide on a few things in advance it's going to be the five of us we're going to land in Spain and we're going to walk to the east there are some constraints no flights allowed and people can fall from the group or be added but it can never exceed 10 people let's just say and so on and so forth and then you just set out and you see what adventures and Misadventures develop that's what I'm going to be doing with the writing the long fiction comes in because I want to set a Quantified bar that prevents people from casually using this label when they are not putting in the requisite work what does that mean I thought a lot about this and I may have some more rules that I set for myself related to this so it'll develop over time so it's the elf emergent emergent unlocked fiction but so the long fiction to me right now means if you look at most say anthologies that collect short stories and there are many of them most short stories not all there are some exceptions but will not exceed five thousand to ten thousand words so what I decide to do then is say all right if 10 000 words is the cut off for short story that's the beginning that is the starting point for long fiction so if you are going to have an emergent long fiction project that means you have put in the work before you launch to have 10 000 words minimum of polished Pros that means you cannot say this is an emergent long fiction project this is an elf fiction project and you throw up one page of half-assed lore on your website and then say the rest is coming later that doesn't work now to be clear that doesn't mean that in my case I'm going to be putting out all 10 000 words that I have immediately right so there's a little bit of wiggle room here but I do have that much done and we'll see where it goes I'm definitely not promising that I'm going to be writing you know the next Game of Thrones series or anything like that it does it's almost certainly not going to have an output like a novel it's going to be very very different and the the what happens at launch and what happens over that opening month will inform a lot of the decisions I make how do people engage with the Easter eggs and the Mysteries and the weird bits that are already baked in and they are already baked in how do they engage with that what do they find what do they not find what's too confusing what isn't confusing enough right what is which Clans develop the most incredible communities right do people actually gather around this this clan identification if so what happens and so on and so forth that will inform the emergent properties of this long fiction which is absolutely an attempt at coherent World building sequence is the

any further without the bankless nation starting to get mad at mad at me mad at us uh Tim what the hell is it what's going on all right so uh first of all can we start with it I'm just thinking about it yeah we can you know and it just it's like like me cracking up just like thinking about how to present this is part of the reason why I'm doing this right like oh dude we're already thinking through like this so I'm I'm so childish but it's it's what you're saying you're clicking through no we're thinking through the episode title like what should we call this thing actually yeah oh yeah how full frontal do you want it to be so so the name of this project is [ __ ] punch no it's not yes it is the name of the project [ __ ] as in rooster kids all right or like adults yes uh hopefully if you're listening just caucus and rooster for the rest of this episode of course punch so the name is [ __ ] punch and I I do have cockpunch.com and at [ __ ] punch on Twitter and these are going to be very important so the name of the project is [ __ ] punch the full name is the legend of [ __ ] punch and all of the known characters who inhabit this realm are roosters and they are anthropomorphized roosters there are eight greater houses as I mentioned so the roosters are the nfts The Roosters of the nfts yes I'm the Cox and there is I I won't give away too much because this is going to come out in the podcast so we haven't talked about that I'm launching a new podcast which podcast [ __ ] punch uh possibly the legend of [ __ ] punch and I have already hired voice actors very good voice actors to uh act as the narrators for the reading of the histories and the bits and pieces of mysteries and so on that will be put out as podcast episodes all right so why is it called [ __ ] punch well yeah that's a great question great question and fair question it's called [ __ ] punch because at one point in the Realms history there was a Warring States period And there's a lot before and there's a lot after but the important piece that I'll disclose here is that there is a Warring States period where civil strife ruled and it was chaos from all four corners of this realm to the center and then there was a means of peacekeeping devised and agreed upon which was similar to the Olympics for humans in the sense that the Olympics are effectively geopolitics and Warfare by other means and Nations attempt to exert and prove Supremacy through athletes so now in this realm there is a what's called a ftz or the free trade zone and that is a demilitarized zone within which there is an arena and in this Arena you have one-on-one battles and the battles include combatants from these eight creator houses who have proven their medal through qualifying rounds of competitions in these various territories owned by the way are we caught fighting well we're [ __ ] punching and cockfighting punching yeah so you have I mean they could be cockfighting yes so you have in this huge Arena imagine a sports arena where you could have like a hundred thousand Spectators you have to [ __ ] punchers March out much like they would at like a WWE event right and cause they Coliseum and they meet in the middle on an elevated platform and each of them have a gauntlet like a power Gauntlet on one arm and they punch the [ __ ] out of each other and they have and they have different strategies they have different strengths they have different weaknesses they have different capacities and I'm sorry are these are all attributes in the nft like strengths weaknesses attributes is that is that what they are no they're not they're not all embedded in the nft so the visual components are and the traits are and there are a lot of traits I think we have close to 300 traits it's absurd how much time I've put into this and I mean I've gone through every single one not just on the visual piece but also on the naming conventions and everything so they fight and the narrative is is is going to be what bolsters all of this with some of these additional details that I'm mentioning later right so people have to pay attention and part of the reason that I hope people will pay attention is that yes if you are a Trader and a Speculator and no judgment there that's that's fair game as long as you're not a complete dick on the internet I have zero tolerance for that like if you're just playing the game and you're playing the financial game that's fine although I'll probably exclude marketplaces that push to zero and I will probably make it explicit that anyone who tries to circumvent secondaries I reserve the right to block completely from anything I do and any uh including any future projects to the extent that I can right I and if anyone's an [ __ ] I'm just gonna block them uh in every way conceivably possible I think that one of the cultural norms and I do think a culture is whatever uh let's see a culture is whatever the whatever the worst behavior is that you'll accept and I'm I'm paraphrasing a tool gawande but I really want this community to be fun and supportive and not what you experience day to day on Twitter if possible and I will enforce that however if you are trading one thing I want to make explicit is that yes I'm sure that some value will be attributed to Rarity traits and people will sort by that as quickly as possible but what happens then if say I take some not extremely rare traits but I tie them into the narrative in some way that makes them very valuable what happens then I don't know never seen it done I'm so I'm curious to see if I decide to do such thing what happens like what happens in the activity uh so so Tim I'm kind of confused here um is this like because as you said there's a bunch of lore you've written a ton of words to go with this this universe yeah they're these things that happen there are these [ __ ] that punch each other where for for so say I'm a user I've gotten uh a [ __ ] punch that's the thing you buy right is the you buy the car you buy the car it doesn't have traits but that's an art piece right that's the nft piece it does have traits just to be clear like there are weapons there are attributes that will have varying degrees of Rarity but it would not have it would not indicate in the nft what say the defensive capacity is of your particular character that is going to be decided by Yours Truly in some fictional narrative way okay and so like am I as an nft cockholder am I going to www.com am I going to a website and like my nft shows up and then it walks into like the Coliseum and then it fights like how do I receive this story as a user podcast you receive that you received the story through the podcast which will also be published as text probably on my on tim.blog which for a long time was one of the most popular blogs in the world it may still be I mean people have forgotten about blogs but they're still a thing uh so probably will be published in text there and which by the way will mean I'm not just preaching to the choir right like what I'm doing is going to be routinely exposed to the mainstream which I which gives just makes me laugh all the more uh but the to be very clear I'm not saying I've built a metaverse and you go to this place and you authenticate and you Vlog in and suddenly like you throw on your Oculus and you're suddenly in the head of your [ __ ] and you go out you fight no no no no no no no no none of that none of that none of that okay but how do I see hold on hold on hold on I am going to ask lazy [ __ ] out there to use the most incredibly powerful imaginative computer on on the planet and that is in between their two ears it's going to be very old-fashioned but guess what you're gonna have to visualize a lot of this folks and it's going to be [ __ ] awesome it's old-fashioned right it's not like PornHub plus Holograms plus nft jpegs it's not that it's not that engaging from like an immediate dopamine like OCD ADHD perspective but I'm putting in the heavy lifting so that it will engage the thing between your ears a lot more so that that is that is the plan and look I mean if if I'm not comparing myself to any of these people but it's like there's a lot of power between those ears right if you look at what Harry Potter did what Game of Thrones has done what certain cartoons have done right with certain comic strips have done what certain comic books have done you don't need automatically a lot of bells it starts with the lore I mean that's where it starts it starts with the writing it starts with but okay but as an nft holder like will my [ __ ] be able to punch Ryan's like is that something happened so so but as an event on ethereum yeah as an event on ethereum TBD uh I do like I don't again you know how I'm I'm so tentatively wading into these Waters I don't want anyone to buy a [ __ ] to buy [ __ ] puncher thinking Tim's talking about this amazing road map on Bank list therefore like my kids college fund can wait because I'm gonna 10x this with [ __ ] punch it's called [ __ ] punch people just to be clear like if you're not not getting the transmission all right so just keep that in mind you should be ashamed of buying it what are you even thinking you should be you should be if you get one you should you should think okay don't buy one of these things unless you're giggling like a [ __ ] idiot like we are because because that means maybe maybe there's a chance that whatever you spend you'll get back in the entertainment and the giggles and the Soul enriching Chuckles along the way okay so I'll just say that the event piece it is something I am thinking about I've been thinking about I've tracked a lot of projects who have done this with on-chain Dynamics or mechanics rather uh my rule of thumb with this is whenever possible make it simpler make it simple make it simple make it simple I have seen what I consider otherwise very interesting projects bury themselves in complicated mechanics and confuse the [ __ ] out of anyone who's trying to buy or use their nfts I don't want to do that my My Hope Is that I can do some very interesting stuff but I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel with my smart contract it's it's not going to be I I'm gonna I know I'm using a lot of quotes here but one Guiding Light I've also used is a quote that I got from Morgan Spurlock the documentary filmmaker who did supersize me an inside man great show by the way and he said once you get fancy fancy gets broken and that's with gear in the field for for videography I agree with that with everything and so will there at be at some point the possibility of David your [ __ ] puncher attacking Ryan's [ __ ] puncher and having him send you know defend himself parry and return maybe some incredible magically powered boot to your balls and send your [ __ ] flipping over backwards Never Say Never all right damn I feel like I'm getting punched possibilities though you're not getting pucked this is where the emergent comes in I do not want to lock myself into anything because what I have found so far even in the development of this project if I had tried to internally set a creative roadmap for this I would have screwed this whole thing up I would have screwed the whole thing up I do think at some point there will be the possibility let me rephrase that there's a non-zero chance that people will be able to fight or compete at some point but I'm not promising that all right so so Tim can can you give us um a tease here a tease of the Cox yeah um oh my God don't say that I'm not gonna say it you got you gotta say it you gotta say it can you give us a little yeah okay a rooster yeah no no I want to see some art so I just want to say from the get-go I didn't even tell Kevin the name of this project because like the memetic potential energy in the name cockpunch is [ __ ] irresistible like I knew that it was just gonna film a tsunami of childish behavior that would make me laugh and would make other people laugh and would would just suddenly cause this proliferation of things like [ __ ] tease for instance just as an example I blocked someone from the at [ __ ] punch account today I only have come across one troll which is pretty astonishing given that you know the sandboxes that I'm playing in right now and I was like you know what he just got [ __ ] blocked and and there's just so many options for incredible memes so yes cocktails what type yeah so I don't know how I will best share some of this but I can show it to you on my phone that might be if you have anything that we can show on screen too like we can have shredders yeah because these are like I said I just want people we're not talking about your average looking rooster here right no I can't even tell us I'm thinking of a cartoon rooster with a big uh Thanos like gauntlet so let me show you I'll show you this would be hard to see but I'll show you so we'll take the JPEG and put it on screen yeah yeah so I'm going to show you a couple of are we looking users pictures of Tim's [ __ ] on his phone yeah are these cockpits Tim's showing us so we got like we got these right which are which are uh various teasers and what's what's important to note about these I know it's hard to see is that what's incredible about these is uh oh I don't want to be kicked by those yeah the resolution those are frog feet this rotates wow that's a mask that's a wolf mask this is way more 3D than I thought it would be yeah it is very 3D so this is a this is a a gauntlet that will probably I don't want to be punched by that wow no which will probably or shop by it this is a dachi which is a type of Japanese sword uh that will be involved and uh let me show you I'll show you another one let me just find a good one so I'll show you say I'll show you say an archetype okay of of one so one of well let me just put it this way one of the spell casting Clans will have this kind of look wow you have like Mages like there's going to be we do have Mages wow we have [ __ ] magic and and so all of the teasers I just showed you I want to be a [ __ ] Mage who doesn't want to be a cockmate so it'll be you at the end of this conversation it'll be pretty funny when you get a transcript just in the intro you could say before Warren we did a search on the transcript and we do say [ __ ] 74 times but it only means rooster it only means rooster so so those teasers that I showed you I'll give you a peek behind the curtain here which gets me very excited those were all generated by moving cameras and lighting within 3D modeling software with the 3D files every one of these nfts will ultimately have a 3D file available and you'll be able to rotate 360 Degrees around your character all of those teases which I think look incredible I mean they look cinematic were made simply by taking something that would be could be a random generation and moving cameras and lighting around like doing a photo shoot basically with a 3D character that's so cool it's very involved and I want to be very upfront in saying the 3D files are huge they're like a lot of them are one to two gigabytes so those will probably not be available for at least two to four weeks after mint it's just two it's just it's too gigantic and we also think about this we're not just looking at identifying say clipping issues with Generations in 2D when we need to do quality assurance on a 3D file we need to look at it from 360 Degrees horizontally and from the top and possibly from the bottom so it's really really labor intensive uh yeah I love how like the first half of this podcast was like Tim Ferriss like he's this multi-disciplinary guy he's got this idea he's like doing this long form lore World building he's putting so much effort into it it's called [ __ ] punch so like uh what does owning one of these nfts unlock for me yeah what it unlocks for you is this you get a a very amusing and pretty jpeg although ultimately there will be these larger files so it's not exclusively jpegs but you get this nft and it gives you skin in the game to be invested in engaging with a very I hope entertaining experiment in real world Fantasy World building can express my interest in this world and as like if I'm hearing this podcast reading this world I can imagine my [ __ ] running around yeah and and look there may be more stuff later I don't know but I do not want to be one of those people who's like this is a utility nft and you're gonna unlock this and this and here's the 12-month road map I don't want to be that guy so I'm not going to be that guy it's just a visual representation it's a visual representation and TBD if anything else but the artwork I think is I think it is more it is more detailed than anything I've seen in the space it is more detailed than a lot of what I've seen coming out of major animation houses it is incredibly detailed and some great Clockwork it's a real great cogwork and we're paying or I say we I'm using the Royal we I'm I mean the amount of time I've spent on the writing is just stupid like it's unbelievable how much time I've spent and it's all you've written all of it Tim right you've had all your fiction I've written all of it I've had proofreaders and I've taken like it's gotten in areas it gets so serious which is so fun right we're talking about like adoption of Orphans and education and like tithing to churches and like deeply uh well in some cases yeah I'm hoping what will be like highly developed mythologies and religious systems and Magic systems and it's like I have to and then at the end of the day I'm like this is all for something called cockpot but you know what and I have to have a tequila and just be like that's awesome that is kind of awesome that I have done so many things in my life and they've all they've all come together in this defining moment of creating something called [ __ ] much but I forgot to mention something very important and that is part of the reason I did this also is that I've spent the last uh five to eight years pioneering support of early stage science in psychedelic Therapeutics and mental health research for conditions that are conventionally very hard to treat or impossible to treat practically like complex PTSD and War veterans and victims of sexual abuse like treatment resistant depression and many many other yes different types of trauma and that was initially started because I have a history of both abuse in my childhood and then uh recurrent major depressive disorders slash treatment resistant depression and I started a foundation called scissor Foundation s-a-i-s-e-i size foundation.org to fund these types of initiatives and it's funded a lot of Firsts a lot of groundbreaking firsts and people can see them on scissorfoundation.org all of the primary sales from this are going to the foundation 100 of the primary sales are getting donated straight to the foundation and that's not because I expect people to do this out of the goodness of their heart or anything like that but my driver for this in part was to create a an unconventional way to raise funds on an uh you know on on a very creative level for size a foundation and in fact when I was fundraising for the Johns Hopkins medicine psychedelic Research Center which was the first ever established in the United States which is a very big deal ended up uh having I think practically a full page in the New York Times and it was uh and it was one of the headlines at the bottom of the New York Times at that this was quite a few years ago so it was a huge groundbreaking event for that entire space uh when that happened I was trying at one point to put together an auction of physical contemporary art to do an auction which would be something uh well ultimately I then was like well maybe I can do with nfts but it's too early it's too hard uh maybe something digital so I was thinking well we could do something like crypto for Consciousness but initially it was intended to be conventional Contemporary Art and it was just too difficult because a turns out artists hate doing that generally their agents aren't excited because they're not making anything and it's really difficult but I spent a lot of time on that I met with gallerists I met with artists I tried to make it work and I just couldn't get it to work so in fact that has been a seed in my head for a very long time how can we use unconventional means and ideally now with nfts blockchain or other Technologies I'm agnostic to raise money for a foundation like this and what's what's really uh exciting to me also because let's be honest dealing with say graphic stories of abuse and Trauma and uh end of life anxiety and people with with terminal diagnoses and so on which is a lot of what I'm dealing with day to day through the foundation gets really heavy and really dark sometimes and it it can be depleting and so I've worried at times about my endurance to continue to do that work because it can be so overwhelming with this I mean [ __ ] punch for [ __ ] sake I'm doing something that is completely absurd it's fun it's it's scratching every creative itch that I have and it's giving me tons of energy and raising money for size a foundation and recharging my batteries in a way that I can do the serious work but not always in a serious way so that that's also a main driver behind the whole thing that's super cool this checks a lot of boxes then in like in kind of your personal Journey too and okay so uh scissor Foundation that you just described so um to some percentage of the minting of 100 of the primary sales 100 of the primary sales yeah 100 of like any dollar that flows out of the mint in the primary sales right secondary is is a separate thing I'm going to figure that out because I'm I'm like you know it's like it's heavy six figures into [ __ ] punch and I'd like to actually not not not be totally in the red if it's possible so I'm gonna see like I'd like to use uh you know secondaries to to try to to cover a lot of that uh but the primary sales you know which I'm I'm hoping will be decent we'll see in today's market conditions but that is intended to go entirely 100 to size a foundation it's not well it is a percentage it just happens to be 100 and for people who might be wondering Foundation is not a foundation that just holds money and kind of lets it marinate and deploys the minimum necessary of five percent per year like it's generally deploying like 50 percent uh per or more per year and what that means is when this money Flows In it's not just going to sit there it's going to get it's going to get deployed very quickly I mean probably with within 12 months I'd say all of that will get deployed uh so Tim I know at the time of recording um we are a short time away from the launch of [ __ ] punch right but I I don't think you're ready to announce dates at least if you do announce dates between between the time we record and uh the time we want to publish this Dave and I might might talk about it a little bit in the intro but are there any other details like coming soon sort of thing I don't know if we're weeks to months away and then like are there any details around the kind of the numbers or the first the the mint price at the early stage or anything you can share yeah you know I'll I'll uh and I'm sure that my advisor would advise against this I I've been on the mint price side I will say that this world gets so complex when you start to dig and the dine the game theory and the economics and the sort of auction mechanics and psychological components everything currency prices for God's sake right I mean when we're talking about different types of crypto and macro events all of these things should inform uh how you make certain decisions I think uh creative is number one however uh as things are in this market uh you want to do whatever you can feasibly within your control to try to sell out and I'll try to do that I'm not overly concerned about it it's not going to stop me from doing what I've told you about with the fiction and everything but uh the I'll tell you this the supply will be less than ten thousand I haven't decided how much less but it'll be less than ten thousand the mint price because at the end of the day I want to raise money for the foundation and I don't expect everyone or anyone to really care about that but that's one of my main reasons for doing this so I'm not going to do it at some giveaway price I also think that a lot of the decisions made by creators in this world are very fear-based and they let the mob make decisions for them and I don't think that's actually a great way to create projects or live your life and they do by the way bleed over if you start doing that in one area it's going to bleed over into the rest of your life so just be aware of of letting that in the door so for mint price I you know I'd be curious to hear your thoughts actually I've been thinking about somewhere between 0.25 and 0.5 there is a lot of downward pressure for people to just go lower lower lower lower because they're terrified of not succeeding but they haven't defined success very clearly for themselves for me it's really clear it's right like I want to raise at least a million bucks because I already have projects I want to fund through scissor Foundation that are at least a million bucks and uh I don't think at today's prices for if people are looking at it as entertainment and they're like ah could I justify like trading a couple of expensive meals for this or a trip to Disneyland or two trips to Disneyland or going to a Broadway show with a few friends or whatever right then I'm like I don't think it's totally insane uh but I would be curious to hear your thoughts I mean I'm leaning towards between 0.25 and 0.5 what are your thoughts there's I think there's there's two variables to pay attention to it's kind of hard to talk about a mint price without talking about a total Supply so if we if we just use the anchor of 10 000 uh and you can like we can Tinker with that number and you can address the they've been pressed accordingly uh 0.25 to 0.5 is expensive uh but it does uh change things that you're donating all the money the the some thought about like nft drops is that like if you mean if you drop them into like one eath like you're taking away room for upside from the uh token holders right because if it goes from 0.25 up to five eth as a floor price then that's a huge gain if it goes from one to five each that's only a 5x if it's a if you drop it at 2.5 Ethan and it doesn't really have too much room to grow uh like some people consider I intend to make my community wealthy uh and they give up that upside uh by lowering them in price if you were just trying to maximize inflows into this charity that is very normal or organized then like maybe that doesn't really impact you um but I think the variable is like how much Roi do you intend on having your purchasers uh and I'm gathered that you don't really actually uh want to encourage that behavior um so something to consider yeah yeah I would say and then Ryan I'd love to hear your two cents too so here's what I would say my intention is not to Crater things let's be clear right you're like I would prefer that people not lose money uh but I I'm absolutely not stupid enough to guarantee that they're going to make money because that's crazy and if anybody promises that to you they are delusional or a liar or both so don't believe the hype uh end and uh all things being equal everything you said makes a lot of sense but I am also a firm believer for instance none of my books I've ever gone to to uh paperback or soft cover people may not realize that why is that uh because I feel like I put so much effort and time into creating quality product I'm not going to cut the price by a few dollars and have my royalties cut in half so that I have to sell twice as many to make the same amount of money it makes no sense to me uh and in the case of books if you want something cheaper just buy a Kindle but but the these are certain economic decisions or with uh say Todd McFarland the comic artist I mentioned who makes some of the most detailed toys on the market and everyone was selling at 5.99 and he decided to sell at 6.99 he's and they're like you can't do that and he said well if you're making something that's worth 5.99 and then you charge 6.99 I agree but he said if you're making something worth 7.99 and you charge 6.99 I think it works and that's what he was doing it did work uh so which is not to imply I'm selling something that is going to be worth more I'm not saying that but I do feel like all things are not equal in a way which is not saying this is the greatest project of all time but I'm doing things differently and I am I have already this is not future work I've already created more than I have seen in any other nft project which is again not to say it's going to go up and stay up I can't say that but it's different it's different and it's called [ __ ] punch this is the thing so people are going to talk about it the X Factor is like how how much like meme Lord magic Juju do we attribute to the [ __ ] punch the nation in itself but yeah anyway Ryan what are your thoughts well I think that's magic right so what what I think that like um you can't fail to underestimate is the memetic power of this thing honestly we just spent like 30 minutes here just like kind of laughing about the names and all of the like part of me is like Tim what have you just done to the internet man like this is like I think that this could totally blow up um I think uh honestly 0.5 eth would be on kind of the low side and I definitely like personally I wouldn't go lower than that and like here here's the thing um you know 0.5 eth is worth a lot in Fiat terms than it was you know a year ago too and so that's kind of like I guess partially self-adjusting and then the other piece of this yeah well yeah can you say that I kind of Wonder it's worth a lot less in dollar terms oh yeah you know than it was a year ago and the other thing I I I sort of Wonder is like uh worst case scenario if you have a high floor price what if it doesn't completely sell out like from the get-go is that like I mean you're going to continue to to release the story you can you know yeah it's not like a one-time thing right so it's not a one-time thing now let me actually let me get your your two cents here because I've had I've had so many conversations and there's there's just no consensus right because how could there be all this stuff is so new uh the one argument that I've paid attention to from from one friend and I just love to hear your thoughts as he said you know what if you want to continue to do this Beyond this collection and you want to continue developing this over time uh you may want to have the price lower just so you have the buffer of feeling very confident that this thing is going to fly out the door which I feel pretty confident already I mean I've done a number of pre-med Pages by this point and the demand is the demand is solid I'll put it that way uh let me yeah the demand is very strong so I feel good about it but what are your thoughts on on that I I really try uh you know there's a quote I think it was from Maria Popova it was one of my favorite people she runs uh it's called the margin alien now but it was brain pickings and she's one of the most prolific amazing writers and curators on the planet uh and I think I'm attributing this correctly she said uh there's something like I think she said actually pride and guilt are both terrible reasons to do anything but I would add fear to that in most cases I think fear is a terrible motivating force to ride when you're making decisions so there's part of me when someone says like ah like you should like push down push down push down because you really want this one to be guaranteed to sell out and do well because then that will buy you permission to do the next one how do you think about that I I think you should go with like what would Tim Ferriss do right because this whole thing is like is you right it's kind of your DNA and if Tim Ferriss is not not one to kind of let fear motivate the price then just don't do that and you're authentic to yourself and I mean uh I think look are there does Tim Ferriss with everything that you've done the community and 900 million downloads and the books that you've written and the time that you spend on this project do you have 10 000 like true fans that are like at least right and then you've got this whole intersection of like a group of people that maybe the in crypto that don't yet know much about Tim but like are just interested in this really cool experiment and can you wrestle like you know eight thousand ten thousand people to spend 0.5 eth on that to a good cause uh I don't know it's I'm pretty bullish on it but like you know David is more The nft Collector among the two of us so what do you think David I I think it was good to consider the price is certainly important uh I think it's more worth your effort Tim to consider how to optimize allowing uh ensuring that the people that are able to buy these nfts are the people that you want to own them the Tim Ferriss nft is going to get gamed by Bots and and like hoarders and people who are going to suck value out of your out of your project to whatever degree that you can identify your fans that are just as bullish on [ __ ] punch as you are and make sure that they are able to buy the nft that I think is a much more uh a better use of your time and I think the price is going to I think you can kind of sell the thing for anything honestly yeah can I can I hop in for a second just to talk about that sure so I've spent at least dozens of hours thinking about exactly what you just said so we're on the same page good how can I Ensure that the people I want to own these own these the first is by not promising any utility or roadmap uh that's a dog whistle well what is a dog whistle I know what a physics what does that mean yeah it's like you say a thing but it's like a wink wink uh I'm actually gonna do it kind of thing like I'm gonna say well I could I can assure you with me it's not this is this is like I I I'm sure they're going to be some surprises but that does not mean uh that I'm gonna be uh you know as I put it on the proof podcast like twice a year taking people to NBA games and given unenthusiastic hand jobs under the bleachers like I'm not I'm not let me let me say it this way you didn't dissuade anyone who's trying to game your drop made me more excited about it during this episode by just no game about it well we'll game the drop in what sense and then I'll come back to what I was gonna say like flipping them buying and flipping them just because it's Tim ferriss's nft and I don't really care about the [ __ ] punch universe there will also be a reveal delay just uh to throw that in there um but which which I think is going to be entertaining and I think it'll be actually very exciting to watch but the this Merc on your face tells me all I need to know yeah so so so here's what I'd say how how do I how do I uh try to get people to buy this who I would like to buy this or like if they're gonna buy it then I'm gonna like actually would be okay like sitting at a dinner table with them and instead of wanting to like drop kick them in the face uh that one is I say don't buy this as an investment I want like I'm in this not because I want to make a ton of money it to be honest there are easier ways for me to make money like this is so labor intensive uh I'm in this because I want to entertain myself and uh that's [ __ ] it I want the energy also the gift of energy and the drafting of energy the absorption of energy off of this so that I can apply it to all sorts of things right uh namely the foundation work just to offset how how in intense that can be but it's It's Entertainment right so I want people who are somewhat aligned with that and that's why I keep bringing up the analogy like are you willing to trade like a handful of dinners for this given the price right and I'm running off of current pricing it could have changed right but if we're talking about 0.5 East right it's like whatever 500 600 bucks something like that uh at least as we're talking right now I think obviously moves around a lot uh so I keep using these entertainment analogies very very deliberately the the other thing I say and this is going to be in the the FAQ on the mint page is like if you're a dick I'm gonna block you like I'm gonna block you from every interesting thing that I can block you from so just because it's become a norm that on the internet you can act in a way that would get you slapped in the real world those rules are different here those you will get [ __ ] blocked and not only blocked from this but like if I do anything in the future if I can conceivably block you I will block you um and I I really want there to be a community which which to be clear doesn't mean I don't want feedback I love feedback and I love constructive criticism but like if it's delivered in a way that you would deliver to me in person or like at a dinner right not in a way that has become the norm online which is just being a total dick uh that's not gonna be okay so that's another way for trying to filter those people out um and I have thought methodically of how I can to the extent possible lose those folks who are not who are going to be just a drain on not just me but honestly on the whole Community where people are gonna be like ah this guy again I want to avoid that you basically want people who are going to hold long term then Tim yes much yeah I would love long-term holders I mean they're going to be people who flip I get it you know another way of I've thought about it and I haven't figured this out yet but you know do I limit the number of efts per wallet I almost certainly will but like what is the limit is it three is it two is it one I mean you sort of discourage flipping as soon as you decrease that number uh especially with a reveal also still gainable however yeah yeah gameable for sure gameable uh the other way that you can discourage that is what I'm what I'm doing right now which is my the communities that I have reached out to to offer say pre-mint Pages where they can apply for allow list are all people I know every case has been somebody I know whose judgment I trust who has cultivated I think communities where they're less likely to be problematic so I've also been very deliberate about that uh which might be the best way to to sort of achieve the objective but I'm thinking a lot about this a lot about this because like for instance on the like what I wish I could do on Twitter is block somebody so that no one could see them in the comments on any posts that would be a great feature and it would because it's high consequence right like if you have no impulse control you better cultivate it because if you're a dick you can just get you can get vanished and I mean you can block someone and they wouldn't see your tweets or whatever like that but uh I I have found that on my blog for instance after a thousand blog posts or whatever that having it in the comment rules like Hey we're going to be cool here like the fonts if you're not cool you're gone and the the community gets it real quick uh they get it real quick and they also start to self-police right which is important so by like laying out the rules I mean let's be honest the people who are being idiots online are being idiots because they think it's going to get them some cheap Applause from the from the from the seats where they'll get a couple of favorites and somebody will be like yeah boy yeah you tell them and if all of a sudden for every one of those they get 20 people being like dude you're a dick by the way like you know why don't you eat some more SpaghettiOs and yell up from the basement to your mom to get some more you know like they're gonna get like they're gonna get enforcement um so that's going to be good um I do think that Founders DNA contributes to this like there's clearly a lot of nft projects that are trying to like pump the price of their project like you know celebrities to kind of use it and talk prompt promise all sorts of utility Promise entire future worlds and so I you know I think you'll get some natural effects from kind of not doing some of those things uh I guess you know what what Tim I'm this kind of reminds me of as we sort of zoom out a little bit is just what I love about about how you've described this project is you are experimenting with telling a story using a new medium and I think that's really powerful right so like back in the day of Tolkien right writing books that was the way you sort of explored that and then we had like different movies of course you could explore telling a story that way I remember um when I was young like many listeners very into video games and I remember really getting into the lore of uh Warcraft right it wasn't just a video game like you could read about Azeroth and the Orcs And like the dark portal and there were different characters that would come down and for me it was just like a more immersive way to use my imagination to get inside of a world using this new form which is like a video game and now you're starting to bring that to nfts in a new creative way that I don't think I've seen like focusing on the the story itself and telling that story through a digital collectible that is on you know on a blockchain I think that's what's most exciting about this project to me yeah I mean you're singing to the choir for for me you're preaching to the choir I guess is the proper way to put it I think I'm a writer am I supposed to use words correctly uh I mean I I'm excited about it I could not be more excited and I will say folks if you have not read Tolkien stuff go back and read it and you're gonna think to yourself oh my God all these things that we take for granted now different types of elves and Orcs And so like these wizard archetypes my goodness this guy came up with a lot and codified a lot that we just take for granted now it's ubiquitous it's the Water Fantasy that we all swim in if we engage with fantasy it's incredible uh there are some New York Times pieces also on his notebooks and there's a separate New York Times piece on his language invention and I I recommend everybody take a look at those to to get an idea of just how insanely obsessive and detailed he was with this uh also rid a lot of wrote a lot of his books during wartime by the way uh so all the more impressive uh yeah I'm excited I'm excited there's there's a there are a lot of new elements I have played in a handful of sandboxes now and been able to play well right in books and then in podcasts and then in producing audiobooks a lot of people don't realize that like I experimented with producing audiobooks for a while and did I don't know 10 or 15 some of which have done super super well like uh the obstacle is the way by Ryan holiday which I recommend everybody excellent book uh so this is a new sport for me where I can see like okay what can I do here what can I do here and uh you know which which tools do I want to pull off the rack and play with here and uh I have not had this much energy and been having I've not had this much fun for I don't know five six seven years with any major project so I feel like that's a good sign well I I think listeners should feel like they've been sufficiently [ __ ] punched uh by the end of this conversation okay so I have um tell us just summarize the release plan really really quick and kind of next steps if people are interested in seeing what's coming next tell us about that and then I have one more question for you before we close it out yeah next step is simple uh it's emergent and therefore I would suggest people follow at cockpunch on Twitter I would suggest they also follow at T Ferris my main account which has 1.8 or 1.9 million followers right now so follow at T Ferris t f e r r i s s so at cockpunch on Twitter at T Ferris and then cockpunch.com will also have quite a bit that was awesome Tim all right um how much did cockpunch.com cost you uh you know I can't kiss and tell on that one but the fact that I spent so much time and had so many people involved in getting that is yet another comical absurdy related to this project um last question for you because um I couldn't resist he you mentioned it a little bit earlier um I think a lot of people listening now when this episode comes up they will have also been in the place with you where they have been like hit by FTX and some of the damage that SPF and others caused for sure is there anything you could say about that I mean you could divulge whatever you'd like about that about like kind of I I don't know but hopefully um I guess my ass to you do you have any any advice for people listening who've just been hit hard by that because it sounds like you've found yourself in a similar position just describe that for us yeah it's it's been brutal and I I I I I know people who are in really bad positions right now uh because of all this and we're super heavily weighted in crypto I was very heavily weighted in crypto I mean I still am but that percentage has gone down a lot right I mean a lot of folks are down 70 80 plus percent depending on what they're looking at and I think it's uh I don't think I know that it's scary I mean I remember in 2008 when I just bought my first house and this is less than a year or might have been late 2007. I bought my first house shortly after the book which by the way four hour work week I mean I got a 75 000 Advance paid over like 17 installments so it was not it was not much uh I got then that was paid out over a long time like a year plus I want to say and bought my first house which was a stretch and then put a bunch of money into stocks because I was told that's what I should do and then 2008 right uh subprime mortgage crisis Financial implosion everything just craters and I was on I made a big mistake tactically I was on an adjustable rate mortgage and that turned into a real problem and it was terrifying it was really terrifying for me and what helped me then and what still helps me and what might help some people listening is to do an exercise that is always in my hip pocket for when I need it called fear setting and I actually gave a Ted Talk on this for people who want uh that type of explanation they can they can find it it's got I think 10 million plus views uh and fear setting is this process by which and I think if you just go to tim.blog slash Ted actually Tim dot blog Ted you find the Ted Talk and then you also find the text and the text I believe originated the first time I put it down on paper was in the four hour work week I've uh made some slight tweaks to it but the general process I'll just tell people how to do it is you in one column take a piece of paper and you break it into a handful of columns on the left hand side you make a long list of all of the things that could go wrong all the worst things that could happen and you get and write them down in detail if possible then in the second column and there are a few different versions of this but the second column you write down what you could do if anything to decrease the likelihood of each of those things happening okay so get a big piece of paper for this or multiple Pages or you could do it digitally I like to do it by hand because I'm an old bastard then in the third column you write down what you could do to minimize the damage or recover if these things happen at all like what could they be right so if if you're say if you're if your savings are down and you're worried about getting laid off because your company is letting people off or maybe it could lay people lay people off what what what's what could you do right like what could you do to minimize the likelihood of that happening it's like go to your boss ask for if you could do an early performance review or ask what you get proactive about improving and demonstrating performance making yourself indispensable right learning how to use different tools for sort of optimizing your workflow and uh and output maybe you're not even communicating what you're doing well to your boss right I mean there are things you could do to like minimize the likelihood of getting laid off just as an example I'm making this up off the car off off the cuff and then if you did get laid off what you what could you do well maybe there are and I'm not saying these are desirable right these are lesser options not ideal options but there are things you could do to minimize the damage you could get a job at Starbucks right you could download Uber on your app and start start uh driving on Uber or doing something else in the gig economy you could let's just say you're a designer hypothetically right you could throw yourself up on any number of sites that allow you to do per project projects kind of on demand you could start your own business I actually I happen to think that recessions are some of the best times to start business because there's a lot of talent out there that is available at Bargain Basement prices and all of my best investments by the way were made between 2008 and 2010. dot com depression all of the practically all the best ones were made during that period of time uh what else could you do you could ask friends or family to give you a loan I know this is going to sound very unappetizing but it's not outside of the realm of possibility for a lot of people like you could do that if it came down to it uh so on and so forth right and when you put all of this on paper what it does at the very least is it allows you to down regulate your nervous system so that you're more emotionally stable and you can make decisions from a clear place where you're not constantly inside the snow globe that's been shaken up being bounced here and fro here and fro to and fro here and there by every bit of craziness that you come across while you're Doom scrolling on Twitter uh I would say stop that too by the way don't do scroll on Twitter just stop stop looking for bad news on Twitter would be one I never look at my feed I only look at ad replies and stuff uh basically never look at my feed so give an all a and a corollary a compliment to the fear setting exercise would be go on a low information diet immediately a selective ignorance low information diet I wrote a bunch about it in the four hour work week I still follow this I don't have any social apps downloaded on my phone I used to and I realized I'm outgunned their phds data scientists and algorithms are going to defeat my self-control every day so they're not on my phone I can still access them but I have to go through the trouble of going to a browser or getting my on my laptop and using them so those will be a few things that come to mind and if people want bonus points they could they could do some reading of stoic philosophy stoic philosophy is very good for times like this I think it builds incredible resilience and just makes you it gives you a higher threshold of stress tolerance in volatile times so you could do that in a number of ways the moral letters to lucillus by Seneca the younger the the penguin Classics version is letters from a stoic I believe by Seneca the younger by Seneca more typically I put out free PDFs this is a while back called The Tao of Seneca you can find these on Tim dot Blog The Tao of Seneca you can download these I think incredibly well put together PDFs with original illustrations and calligraphy and incredible maxims people can find that for free so those are a few things that come to mind I mean this this is scary it's really scary and especially if you're in crypto where things are more volatile it's a very manic depressive community in my experience right like the the Mania and the fear and depression is so extreme uh it gets Amplified to the ends of the polls and uh it can make I think people less resilient when you're exposed to that day in and day out so I would also say to the extent possible spend time with friends or find friends to spend time with or follow people online if you're gonna follow people online who exhibit a calm measured demeanor that'd be another one uh who aren't panicking constantly online uh someone who comes to mind who's a friend and I don't spend that time a lot of time digesting his Twitter account but like Sam Harris I think would probably be a good Exemplar of that and he walks he walks the talk in in real life I mean he's he's he is what you would hope him to be uh so those are a few pieces of advice that come to mind no one can control the macro nobody does and you can't predict what the fed's going to do you can't predict what Putin's going to do he can't predict what anyone is going to do you can only control or try to cultivate the ability to respond with a little Gap so that you can consider your response as opposed to being hyper reactive and I would try to spend time on that because that that's the equivalent of the seat belt or the airbag in the car crash is having that awareness that you've cultivated so that you are not subject to being tossed by The Winds of news cycles and so on because things could get a lot worse uh you know I don't want to predict that I'm not necessarily predicting that but uh things could get a lot worse I've been through this is one of the benefits of maybe being in my mid-40s is I've been through quite a few of these you know I've been through 99 2000 where I got laid off and that's when I started my my first real company which turned out great and I used my Severance and at the time Healthcare in California Cobra to cover me for enough time for me to really get motivated and try to get some cash in the door which I did enough to at least pay for rent and so on uh so I've been through that I've been through 2008 and I've been through you know various Wars and so on and then um coming through this and the good news is once you go through a few of these you do get a little calmer uh and I know this is probably a day late a dollar short in terms of advice but I I always I do not Place Investments or bets or certainly not gambles with money that I cannot afford to lose right and uh I've made mistakes with this just to be clear early on I did make mistakes and I was like [ __ ] there goes my entire bankroll now what uh so I've learned over time but the way that I'm talking about this project maybe a kind of a Debbie Downer to end on this but the way I'm talking about this project and I'm saying like hey guys view it as entertainment could go to zero this is exactly the conversation that I have with friends if I'm an advisor to an early stage startup and I go to them to see if they want to invest if they ask me like what do you think this has the potential to do like 10x 100x 1000x because some of these startups thousand X I mean it's crazy but they do and most of them go to zero I'll give my answer whatever my answer is and then I'll say there is a chance as you know very good chance this goes to zero there are a million ways this could go to zero and you should not put anything in that you are not perfectly on some level happy to lose because you know this is completely asymmetrical it's binary it's it's zero or one and one being hopefully some multiple but not always and you know I've been involved with startups where I have advised and put in work for seven eight years and end up with zero uh or I end up with a check for like 1200 bucks and uh that's just kind of part of the world that I've become accustomed to operating in so I'm very accustomed now to volatility and and playing any of these Mar not playing but being involved with any of these markets with that in mind so I always look at my maximum downside potential and I only use what I'm comfortable losing but I realize that for a lot of folks they will not find that useful for the events that have just transpired but it is a very very good guideline for any of this stuff moving forward and there will be mobile markets there are going to be more bull markets and there are definitely going to be more bear markets and if you're in it for the long game and I encourage everyone to be in it for the long game you benefit from and I have benefited from over time learning from my mistakes and developing a philosophical safety net by cultivating certain beliefs and practices through things like stoicism and fear setting which is adapted directly from stosis and by the way and cognitive behavioral therapy was also based largely on Stoke philosophy just as a side note for folks and uh it's hard man from a political level from a geopolitical level from a economic perspective things seem really scary choose your sources of information very carefully uh and titrate it down to the bare minimum and focus on in my opinion focus on creating not consuming right and that might sound strange coming from somebody who's launching this project shortly but focus on creating uh I mean part of my hope is that people who engage with this will actually engage with creating maybe related to this world maybe not but uh things are gonna things at some point will hit that rebound and they will uh I I expect that uh there will be more bull markets it would be it would be a first in history if that weren't the case uh but it could take a long time it could take it could take a while right so also don't believe people on crypto Twitter who are like look at this chart it's coming back next week it's coming back next week don't miss every single chart and it's got a green line that points up yeah yeah don't do not base your long-term financial decisions on any of that uh bear markets can last a while right I mean it could be five six seven years maybe longer I mean it could be that long might not be but uh I would say uh be optimistic when you're making any kind spending money don't spend money you can't afford to lose or if you're placing it anywhere and uh I will say also for creativity for entrepreneurship everything that I've done everything that I've seen all the best stuff comes out of bear markets same same here and I think that's been the the story of crypto and uh Tim I think we're kind of concluding with the you know what people love about you so much and the conversation is when you asked him for for advice he comes back with like mental models and tools and books and references and TED talks and things you can go download because he's worked through many of these issues and we certainly appreciate that about you fear setting low information diet letters for mistoic um we could be in this bear market for a while in crypto and these are some of the mental tools you need to prepare yourself uh Tim it's been a pleasure man it's really cool to meet you in person I like you know you have to show us how to get to a billion podcast downloads where I think we just hit 30 million I think last week we got a long road to get to a billion my friend but um yeah 2014. so yeah what I would say all here here's here's my here's my advice on the podcast this will apply to anyone choose something you can sustain so so create something that is sort of wide enough and flexible enough that you can keep it interesting for yourself so you have the energy to continue ideally something that feeds you otherwise you're just not going to have the endurance and that's why I designed my podcast and the way I designed it and continue to experiment with different formats and that is how I've approached my books that is also how I'm approaching [ __ ] punch is how do I set the parameters and conditions and expectations in the beginning such that I can continue to create and it's true for the podcast I think it's true for your podcast I think it's true for all podcasts and that's why when people are like I've never done a podcast I'm gonna I'm gonna try to out This American Life This American Life and I'm like oh oh that's a risky one that's a risky one and then I've talked to them two months later I'm like how'd the podcast go they're like yeah I did two episodes there's so much [ __ ] work I quit I'm like yeah could have seen that coming that's what we've learned too is you have to make it a passion and that's certainly true I think a sage advice to uh to end with for for you and I David is um you know get getting energy for the last two weeks I will say Tim have been kind of energy training in a lot of ways in crypto and even a podcast game but all right man uh we appreciate it uh [ __ ] Punch coming soon I love that we open Sirius and then we had [ __ ] punch in the middle and then we kind of ended serious perfectly the book end of this
