I know it's corny but like we're gonna build our way out of it and now the amount of signal that we're going to have over what's being built over the next six to 18 months is going to be so high all of the hot air is out of the industry which just lets everyone progress forward faster and I remember in 2021 as soon as the bull market got frothy and manic you and I were like this is tiring like we need to wash this stuff out I didn't like it we got our wish everything's washed out too much I mean we're on the other side and so like now there's only signal and so I am thankful for that
