there's a possibility of actually earning a lot of very valuable assets just like that mechanic exists today except that you can actually go out and sell for example a rare skin for like a million dollars or something and that sort of almost like a gambling mentality will potentially also be a a drive for a bunch of gamers too to play some of these website games welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys super exciting episode of amy wu this is crypto gaming 101 this is like your intro to crypto gaming how to invest in crypto gaming how to find the next axi web3 gaming nfts all of these things we go over a few things there's five things i want you to look out for the first is what crypto gaming is and why it's a big deal then why a casual crypto game something on mobile might be the next thing we also get into how to identify the next axi infinity why guilds are a good investment how to earn from games and not just invest in them finally we talk about the importance of meaning value and identity in crypto gaming amy calls this fun it's fulfillment that's what sustains crypto games david fantastic conversation man what were some of your takeaways yeah i really liked the the meaning and purpose conversation because amy had a lot of thoughts about that and really at the end of the day all humans just want that they just want meaning and purpose in what they do and while the first part of this show is all about going from zero to a hundred about crypto gaming trying to answer some of the skeptics takes what happens if we accidentally just suck the fun out of games uh what really makes a crypto game playable in the long term all of those basics and then it leads into uh the conversation as well when we finally figure all this stuff out what is the end result and hopefully the idea is that the end result is we have these fantastically engaging uh high just like livelihood uh crypto communities that are also gaming communities and they're all just playing games together uh some some version of the utopia the future utopia that we're all trying to build just involves a bunch of people having a fun time in the metaverse uh and so hopefully that's where crypto gaming takes us and that's definitely where this conversation took us this is another story of you know humanity digitizing itself and the things that humans value in the analog worlds become the things that humans value in the digital world i think gaming is such a big part of that as we talked about it but you know what what i loved about this conversation too david is we we dove right into the skeptic's criticisms okay and uh crypto gaming had a breakout year in 2021 an absolutely massive year and with that comes skepticism with that comes some haters and much of this pushback uh this blowback even is from the traditional you know gaming industry right and so we have examples uh you know we're which are going to talk about the episode of like you know crypto or a gamers traditional gamers basically pushing back on ubisoft and saying like we don't actually want nfts in our game stop voicing that on us and so what are their criticisms we got into those and why they made those criticisms and one thing i love about the the crypto space and doing this podcast uh with you david is like i think crypto people just want to have a conversation right it's like i would love to bring on uh gaming skeptics on the podcast a bit more and have a conversation with them about why they're skeptical because i think there's so much more common ground than there is things to divide us like one of one of those things is probably the populism we all want bottom-up movements we all want community-led movements and i think that can be a real possibility in gaming in crypto gaming specifically maybe some traditional gamers aren't seeing it yet but i believe they will i think we want to win them over too i think we can definitely pull a leaf out of bitcoin's book which is bitcoin had the most haters from like its inception 2008 until basically until 2020 right and now people really get like okay yeah then the money printer went burn like oh i get it now and i think crypto gaming is kind of in that same early stages where there's a lot of conversations and potential about crypto gaming but it's really not here yet we had one big w as an industry with axiom infinity and even maxi infinity is so unlike almost every game that you would see on steam or epic games or activision blizzard so it's really easy to critique it because there's nothing there and so as soon as i think this industry actually gets built out and we actually start doing real stuff in the long term perhaps hopefully the skeptics kind of melt away because there's actually something here there's something real but it will take time like you always say ryan crypto is a battle for hearts and minds and gamers are like really a picky set of people uh and i think if we can win the game over gamers over we can win everyone over and we definitely have the tools to do it we just need to make sure that we do it right and and do it and get it done in the right ways if we win the gamers it's game over that's the quest today and guys for you guys if you're looking to invest in this space you don't want to miss the next big thing this is a fantastic episode for that a lot of alpha that drops about investing in crypto gaming if you like this episode make sure you like subscribe review tell a friend also we're going to get right to the episode but before we do we want to tell you about these awesome tools from the bankless sponsors that made this possible the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to

bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest and our next topic this is an exciting one amy wu is a partner at lightspeed a venture capital where she leads investments on consumer crypto and gaming the triad there these three things i feel like are becoming one maybe united they become crypto gaming that's what we're gonna figure out we're gonna talk about how she invests in crypto gaming today on bankless amy it's great to have you welcome to bankless thanks so much for having me on guys okay so here's what we're gonna do today i wanna really orient ourselves and orient the audience right because um look if you're in crypto you're listening bankless uh crypto's really fun but it's also hard and the reason it's hard is because this industry moves so quickly so just when you feel like you wrap your head around bitcoin and ethereum there's d5 and just when you feel like you figured out d5 you got nfts and then you got d5 2.0 and they got layer twos now you have crypto gaming this happens at light speed i guess that's why you guys are called light speed capital but here's the thing on bankless we don't like missing the next big thing and i feel like crypto is about crypto gaming specifically is about to become the next big thing so we're looking for your help today amy help uh help us make sense of crypto gaming are you ready to help us do that absolutely all right why don't we start with explaining crypto gaming so i've had some of these conversations you know around the holidays i expect to have more of them with uh all sorts of different people you know so let's explain it from three different vantage points if you will amy so first the normal person okay the normie you know your grandma your maybe not grandma your mom your cousin somebody you meet at the holidays uh then we'll do from a gamer somebody who's like played world of warcraft eve online these you know classic types of games and then finally we'll do it for maybe a typical bankless listener who is a crypto native so first a normal person then a gamer then a crypto native so let's explain it how does this one i think it's really smart um because yeah the vantage point is pretty different right now it totally it makes the explanation totally different so let's start with the the the normal person the normie we'll call them how do you explain crypto gaming to that person yeah for the normie i think they're actually wrapping their minds around what is crypto in general right now um and you know it's exciting some people seem to be making a lot of money and for them um crypto gaming is you get to play a game and earn tokens and nfts as well that so that's as simple as how you explain it what if they ask okay amy what are what are tokens and nfts and why do i care like why is that different from a like a coin i used to collect in super mario that usually starts going down the rabbit hole and uh much longer conversation i think a lot of interesting thanksgiving dinner conversations for for people in the u.s this year um and but you know you know and you can take as academic of approach as you want there but i think at the end of the day i i think that you know what it is for a lot of people is that it's fun um it seems to be a big trend happening uh you know there's a lot of ideology around it the world seems to be going that direction certainly um a lot of consumer companies um you know facebook and epic and otherwise are talking about it and i don't want to miss this trend and the potential to make some money like honestly it comes down to to that for like a lot of you know people just learning about crypto for the first time amy i remember trying to explain d5 to people thinking that d5 is the way that crypto is going to go mainstream in 2019 and explaining d5 took hours and then if nfts came around and sometimes you'd have to explain nfts to people that really didn't get it but a large amount of people just accepted nfts at face value and didn't really need to take any convincing and so like the trend has been like it's easier and easier to explain these things and do you see that maybe some people are like oh yeah crypto gaming but when you pick up gold on the ground you can actually sell it on on in this d5 world you can actually just like turn it into real money is it easier to explain gaming than you've seen with other crypto things in the past i have found it easier i mean first like nfts has been so much easier to explain than even tokens and certainly defy um you're right that people seem to just take nfts at face value and um and i think because it's just naturally fun it's uh you know people are like oh this is kind of like gambling a little bit you know um but also they get emotional connection with uh owning one and they it's aesthetically pleasing it's fun or cute and also yeah they they get it's almost like membership to a to a club um with uh with nfts and then on the gaming side it's really an actual extension of that sometimes it's as much as just saying oh imagine if you can actually use those nfts well that's basically what you know buying nfts and playing with that in the game is um and i mean this kind of maybe shifts over to like what does it mean for a gamer right but on the mt side i would say that farm i have far more kind of like quote-unquote normie or like friends just like learning crypto like that asked me about nfts than anything any currency and i've actually have very few people ask me about d5 so i mean it's just like a um the power of of nfts i think is an entry point for a lot of people into as a first step into crypto do you know it's hilarious i totally feel like this is uh flipped right so in the in the older days right i i 100 agree with with david it the way i would go about explaining it is like okay first let's start with bitcoin and let me tell you about digital scarcity and then we talk about that and then it moves to ethereum and then it moves to d5 and like that's the trajectory now i feel like it can start to work from the other end right and it's like people are oh your first crypto experience was with a crypto game or with an nft that you saw and then you could work backwards and start to explain like bitcoin at the at the other end of the spectrum because their first experience with digital scarcity might be these new things it's it's it's totally different than the way it used to be and i guess that is the uh the benefit of having use cases use cases are the best education for the world for sure but let's talk about the uh the gamer then i'm talking about the the typical gamer who's you know kind of grown up playing all sorts of games you know first-person shooters like the fortnites of the world the eve onlines the the world of warcraft all of these things how do you explain the value of crypto gaming nfts and digital property to the traditional gamer yeah this is the really interesting question right now obviously with you know discord ubisoft news um because that answer is nuanced there's a few different buckets right i would say um for your um there's your casual gamer and then which honestly i think has more overlap with how i would explain it to you know a friend who actually is getting into crypto more recently and then there's your hardcore gamer um you know the community that we in sort of gaming investing uh gaming investing know very well and the answer usually there is i mean you know we've actually had this concept in gaming for the last 20 years is somewhat of an answer to that um and they're absolutely right to a certain extent i think that um the sort of og mmo games like eve online and others actually really pioneered the um the idea of these open economies digital economies um and uh uh and actually have taken the concepts like the philosophical concept of of of digital assets like further than even a lot of play to earn games today without actually using link blockchain technology right i mean in for example in eve you actually have for example bankers like central central bankers that actually are taking deposits and um uh you know it's like um catching up with um hilmar the ceo and he's telling me about how some of these guilds or corporations as they call it have their own hr and it teams to manage their guilds in eve online and so that's why like when you look at these hardcore gaming communities they've they've been like embraced this concept of digital assets for many many years and then if you think about you know even play to earn right the concept of gold farming in mmos um and you know and also just the the concept of playing to earn let's say like you know you're helping somebody actually level up a character and escape from tarkov has been around again for for many many years and so for them the skeptic the skeptics are saying well what do i need blockchain technology and um and by the way all i see is like this ruining my discord experience and then there's also so many scams um and then you have the more bullish people um you know community within kind of like the web 3 believers in the hardcore gaming community who are like it's pretty cool if i can do all of the above and i actually own my assets now um in a much more open economy way for them it's about this like wow now there's like more liquidity i like own this asset versus the game studio ultimately owning this assets right so they actually really do embrace this concept of ownership yeah well that's what's interesting and i wonder i almost wonder if that that's what makes it harder right it's like explaining defy sometimes to someone who's already in uh you know in finance and kind of invested in the existing you know financial banking system can be a little bit harder sometimes because they say why do we need stable coins when we have you know uh digital currencies inside of bank accounts right i feel like the same sort of thing is happening with traditional uh gamers it's like they they've already basically invented all of these digital economies you're talking about these guilds and eve online well that's isn't that a dow right that's like that's what a dao is you know a guild it's more advanced than i think what a lot of dows are today it totally is and and they see that and so they're looking at uh the present you know um the the present state of crypto gaming they're saying like oh that's just a step backward like the graphics aren't as good the gameplay isn't as good i have a much more immersive experience in like the games i'm playing today so is it a matter do you think of explaining why decentralization matters and even using the term decentralization i feel like eyes glaze over and you lose people is it more about like explaining open economies and what that can bring talk about that for us yeah i found um that it's a really interesting time right now where you have um there's this um a strong segment of of gamers i would say that is just without sort of being more open to learning um equating crypto or specifically nfts with with scams and you know sort of environmental unfriendliness a lot of negative things um and i think that it originated with this i think there's a few few things that um peel apart here gamers are very very kind of possessive and defensive and um about and serious about their their games and the communities they build really similarly to web3 communities you know and um uh just like web 3 communities are i think very sensitive to whether it's institutional investors or others sort of not disrespecting this concept of decentralization that we have all kind of in in a space come to really we're both very hard-headed and picky yeah um gamers have a similar protection instinct against people that are just trying to play a game to make money um and also and also just you know scams and um and otherwise and also the um the kind of like the how you know polish and sort of like well thought out the integrity of the actual game right the game experience community is is absolutely sort of like religious to them so i think like um they've kind of seen what are the earlier um phases of like play to earn games and one they've seen kind of just what they feel like are non-serious game developers that are creating these games and then um with the intent of like making money from them like from raising tokens and selling nfts and um you know there's hundreds of blockchain gaming teams right now and there's definitely a large number that have probably thought out game mechanics a lot less than their tokenomic model for example and and um and i think gamers see that and they're like well they're losing side of what's actually important and also again i'm going to come back to like the scams and the environmental concerns that they have and have decided to write off that sector you know what three kind of entirely um and i would say that this mentality is very similar and this has been brought up to the um the skepticism faced by mobile free to play um you know studios when they first launched as well and to this day there are like many aaa developers and gamers that aren't casual mobile free-to-play players even though like you know we have the huge successes of supercell and you know king and um playwright so many others um genjin and you know genji and impact and hoyo um they're still like you know you know we believe in like hardcore kind of like triple a shooters and um and they're i mean they're probably never going to change their minds so i think that there's going to be a large segment of gamers that will not change their mind about web3 um that web 3 gaming will also kind of give birth to its own sort of like um believers and people who really love and embrace the concepts of decentralization ownership whatever you want to call it um true open economy and uh and i'm really optimistic that that audience will eventually grow and just like today actually mobile free-to-play players is the majority of the gaming audience today and is the fastest growing audience today like i i think in the future that will happen with web3 games as well amy i feel like we've heard this story before it's it seems to be like there's just something new comes about in the world of crypto that is similar to something that already exists uh pre-crypto and there's just a lot of resistance to change humans just don't like change a lot of people are just very comfy where they are and they see something shiny and new and they're like well i'm comfy here i don't i don't want to change is is it like when we is that too reductive or is that kind of just what you're seeing here i think that's part of it but i also think in this case uh they are also thinking about like well how is this better um you know how is this like a more authentic community um and um and i think part of that is like not really seeing for example like the axi infinity community and realizing that yes there's actually people just farming and making a lot of money from that but there's a real like you know community there otherwise they wouldn't have the retention rates they do right like i think something like over 40 like d90 which is just crazy in the gaming world and and yes it's like a different use case right it's earning but um so i think that like a skepticism is a big part of it but also um i think we're in early stages very early stages of blockchain gaming and um some of these bigger like or experienced studios will will come out with a more like triple a gaming experience in um embedding blockchain pretty natively and reinventing ways to use the technology and i think that will also convert a lot of people as well do you see this gaming world maybe perhaps like being split behind the the traditional hardliners that just just want to play and then this new like asset powered gaming world do you think like this the the concept of gaming is going to go like diverge into two different worlds i think that it may be it may follow a similar path to mobile free to play which is that there's going to be a whole segment that you're totally right like are not going to be ever believers and um and and actually like there's the um converting the developer community and then there's converting the gamer community right and these are actually two separate like segments of stakeholders here that at least in the mobile free to play scenario both needed to be convinced um and a lot of actually people in gaming industry have thought about this and have looked back to the mobile revolution to track how this evolves and um and so there's a number of for example the king one of the most successful mobile studios in the world um actually had its roots for example in browser gaming and so they really understood this casual audience and they actually never were in triple a gaming or were forced in that and they basically went evolved from mobile to essentially like trailblazing and creating new genres within like mobile free to play from browser to free to play and so i think that the um i think that there might be some aaa sort of develop like game developers that make the switch as well but not necessarily we may actually be looking at a whole different category of people that are going to transform what this looks like um and i personally am probably most foolish around um the casual audience embracing this first and also sort of mobile developers also looking at um you know applications first although there's some complexity there because the uh mobile platforms the app stores like apple and google haven't um and android you know hasn't actually allowed direct uh crypto transactions right and so that definitely adds a lot of friction in a gaming category that thrives on no friction in terms of or like very little like in terms of gaming so that will need to be solved but i think you'll see that um and uh and so yeah i think you'll see a splintering i want to highlight that for folks because possibly that's some some alphas what we came here for amy is like so yeah you know your thought is that maybe um a casual gamer start and it's going to be sort of mobile first rather than these big massive games in crypto and that's definitely something that we can watch in in the future years um but but for folks that aren't familiar then the reason why we're camping on trying to explain uh crypto gaming to gamers is i think if you're in it look we're all in a bubble at some degree or another okay i consume a lot of crypto culture a lot of crypto content and so uh i'm somewhat in that bubble right i try to break outside of my bubble whenever possible and uh sometimes reality kind of catches up with me and there are some recent news items that maybe we could talk about that were where that exactly that happened so there is one where the the discord ceo the ceo of discord which is uh you know a um a chat app that everybody uses but it's also very popular in traditional gaming circles you've rolled out some features it was talking about rolling out some features to integrate like uh ethereum wallets and metamask and web3 logins that sort of thing it's such a backlash from just the the screenshots of these features that he two days later not less than two days later he went back and said oh nope just kidding like we're not really doing that this is just a you know a test and uh we're you know we're we're not going to actually implement these web 3 features something similar happened just this week as we're recording this amy uh with ubisoft which is a big traditional game publisher and they announced that they were going to first big game studio i believe to announce that they were going to incorporate nfts in their games they're going to use the the tesla's blockchain to do this and they released a teaser video okay apparently what happened with this teaser video is that it got downloaded to hell right i'm talking like five percent upvotes on youtube and 95 down and the comments on this thing were absolutely crazy and i thought to myself wow like i didn't realize so many people not didn't know about nfts not like um had sort of a neutral opinion on them but like downright hated them hated them in crypto gaming so much so that ubisoft actually pulled the uh the youtube video about this so this for me was like oh my god i got to figure out why right it's like why do why do some of these traditional gamers seem to hate nfts i think you talked about some of the surface reasons right um scams you see it as many scams uh i've also seen other things like environmental concerns which of course crypto has an answer for uh we stole their gpus apparently like that's been something raised but there also seems to be these substance reasons too amy and you were getting at some of them i think and the the one um i guess as i was researching some of this in the gaming community which i'm not like a intricate part of these days but um the one thing that popped up that feels like something that is commonly shared i'm wondering if you can reflect on is this feeling of populism okay so what they didn't like is the ubisofts of the world and the big corporate gaming interests of the world trying to foist this upon the community it was like top down and the sentiment in the community was like hey they already manipulated us with like micro transactions and all of these downloadable content costs and now this is just another way for them to milk the community okay and very much because it was like top down rather than bottom up and i resonate with that okay because like what is crypto crypto is a bottom-up populist movement i'm like i'm on board i hear you guys when you say that and i'm wondering what you think about that sentiment and if you think does that make you bullish on more new game studios and more like bottom up sort of crypto native type experiences rising to the top or do you even sort of reject that do you think this like populist narrative is not a real reason that that crypto gamers um are so anti or that traditional gamers are so anti-nfts what are your thoughts on this all right you brought up a lot of nuance topics and obviously we're still thinking through that but um i think a couple of things um the it was pretty brave for you know discord and and ubisoft certainly ubisoft to take the first step i mean ubisoft was the first aaa studio to do that and you know i think everyone the world had been waiting to see what would happen um and and like i mean to be honest like i thought that they had long i mean they had announced the rollout of the nfts very thoughtfully it was a pledgement type of you know type of launch you know the nfts are free to to earn right instead of like costing a lot of money which is one of the concerns by the way for a lot of people but certainly that didn't um that didn't kind of quell a lot of the the negative um you know sort of lash back from from a lot of the players and we had a first taste of that with the discord announcement um and you know i don't i'm not an investor so i don't know exactly what happened but it seems like a combination of employees and um and you know customers were taken by surprise and very and had a very negative reaction and i think that is probably one thing that the two announcements had in common which was not necessarily at least not not that i saw right like um having this kind of grassroots bottom up let's actually discuss with the community on what this means and um and then get their feedback explain it in a way that's not scary and um and in a way that's very player friendly um and um and take it from there and i think even if they had done that to be honest there'd probably still be a lot of negative feedback but perhaps it would have been a little bit um you know more like easier to understand instead i think and i also looked at so many of the comments and a lot of the comments around like you know players being taken surprised by surprise by ubisoft's announcement and then also um and also just they they obviously had uh had put out some disclaimers around you know well fyi we're using tazos and by the way like you know these are the transactions that may these are the things that may happen and we don't have responsibility for them and um and i think you know gamers not understanding anything they don't know they don't know what tasos is they don't understand blockchain seeing that for the first time is honestly pretty scary and uh and so i think all of that was um probably kind of not yeah not the most positive reaction led to that but there's also a lot of just a lot of gamers basically immediately equating nft being bad and without even going any further from there right and so i think that there's like probably two sets of people that need to be um spoken to and um i i think that not every gaming community has sort of had that reaction so for example our first blockchain game investment was um mini royale um uh and uh they uh it's founded by alex paley and dennis zenanoff they're long time game makers you know probably over a decade of experience in mobile free to play most recently as um code gms at scopely and their game mini royale um fairway games they had actually a you know discord community in the tens of thousands very passionate about their game mini royale and um they took a very different bottoms up approach you know they did discord sort of community chats they um really explained this concept of open economy and ownership to their community without using kind of scary crypto terms i would say and um and they have actually the majority of their nfts will actually be sort of played humans rather than um pay for for drops um and uh and i think like so far the community has been really positive about it in fact i think when they publish their white paper in the next week some of their um discord members immediately translated to other languages um which was amazing to see so i i see that in i'm very i'm still very optimistic that there are ways to have like you know a web 3 approach to this involve your community explain what it is that you're trying to do which is to actually allow a player to own their game assets right and um and actually help them you know play a fun game but also um have fun with like tokens and fts um explain the fun explain the ownership part and i'm so optimistic that you'll be able to convert at least like the the core segment of the gamers and there will be a lot of there will be a lot of gamers that are never going to like this concept um and by the way gamers re revolt and react against changes to the game all the time for and this is like something that we've all known for example just back to eve you know they they actually tweaked their monetization um i think they were rebalancing like um something in the game and there's currently minor strikes going on like in the game right um and uh and so i i this is like you know gamers are and this is just testament to how passionate they are about preserving the sanctity of their game i like love that's one of the reasons why people just love gaming so much is just to see how much passion there is um but of course that also means that people will react negatively if they're um if they feel like they're being harmed or misled miscommunicated to and surprised i'm reminded of every single time back in like middle school and high school that like facebook would change its layout just the entire facebook like community would just like say oh god we all hate it and then later we're just like oh wait no this is actually way better uh it's always the reaction to change like people just don't like change um amy after talking with uh jiho and also ariana simpson from uh a16z we kind of had this aha moment where the incentives of game studios changes when it goes from trad gaming in his current form to web3 gaming in hopefully its future form where the the business model previously was how much revenue can we extract from our users and now we kind of think that the new business models is how much value and wealth can we create inside of our game that our users can therefore access right it's not how much can we extract it's how much wealth that we can create and that's why all the crypto natives are so bullish on the concept of crypto gaming in general it's just there's more alignment behind the developers and the users and so maybe if there's any developers that are listening to this maybe the takeaway and i want to get your thoughts on this maybe the takeaway is not like what the users are fearful of which is hey come buy our nfts it's your new skin it's exactly what you said which is hey come earn these nfts they have monetary value you get them by playing the game and so it's much more bottom-up rather than like hey let's here's a new product that we can sell to our to our fan base it's more of a hey here's new value that our fan base can earn by playing our game is that is that kind of the takeaway that we should run with i think it is one of them but there's i have a slightly different take on that which is um i think people with um who maybe have spent less time in the gaming industry um immediately like in web 3 um go to this cons decentralization and earning however gamers have poured you know like thousands of dollars and um you know tens of thousands of dollars in their lifetime in and and hours into the game with the expectation of zero earnings right that's the baseline and and at the core of this there is a whole segment probably you know hundreds and hundreds of millions of gamers at least that are that love this industry for the game and the community um and the earning actually comes way after that and so i think just actually explaining oh you can earn money a gamer would be like that's not why i'm playing yeah i don't know like a thousand hours of like you know fortnight um and yes it's cool and um and you know like if i have the opportunity to earn some tokens and maybe make a bunch of money from it or um it's essentially like a gambling kind of um mechanic right like maybe i'll i could if i play this game maybe i'll make a million bucks or something is this is this maybe where we're also talking about different gamer demographics here too because this is what's interesting so when i asked that the community hey like how come gamers hate nfts and a lot of different responses but one of the responses was actually hey i'm from the philippines someone else said i'm from indonesia we love nfts i don't know what you guys are talking about in you know in in the us maybe maybe u.s gamers european gamers maybe they're sort of behind it seems like it's taking off in other areas of the world or maybe your other segmentation was not among the hardcore gamers yet but the casual gamers can you talk about that at all is this like just a demographic difference do you think i do think so this goes back to i think that some of the casual gamers are just more embracing of um of new concepts uh and you know having fun your core kind of consumer audience actually um which is also which is basically the casual gamer one um and yeah i think the hardcore triple a gamers are a pretty distinct segment very large segments and traditionally actually more revenue driving than um from western markets right than the rest of worlds but actually it turns out if the rest of worlds combined is like course they're orders of magnitude actually more people you don't need to actually monetize them as deeply with um and have like an amazing business model but also you know and also you know this concept of like earning as well right so absolutely i i do agree with you um i i think that you'll find different populations and segments of people embracing um play to earn weaponry games um and this though is like a separate concept of are some of these game economies sustainable by the way um and uh and so i want to separate the two um but certainly i think you know asia for example even in traditional gaming have always like led a lot of the trends in terms of free-to-play um dynamics and you see like studios in in korea and china and japan actually being some of the most inventive around uh monetization game mechanics etc because their audiences are much more open to experimentation and then actually a lot of western studios then look at that and copy some of the mechanics and like we're like followers in some cases right um and uh and it's like you know um for example me hoyo like one of the leading um i think experimental uh gaming companies the world will catch an impact and i think this is where you will see um some of the biggest innovations in web 3 as well from both developer mentality and gamer adoption um i am hugely bullish on korea for example as a market where you have the intersection of that game development talent and an open uh you know attitude towards web 3 and crypto um combined is going to probably bring a ton and then of course like southeast asia um is one of the biggest the fastest growing markets in gaming obviously green is their free fire one of the biggest games in the world um you know they also recently led the forte around also you know um uh investing in other crypto companies you see this more openness to this um to web 3 from that region so 100 agreed with you there's one incentive that i think web 3 crypto gaming can bring to the table that we haven't touched on yet and i want to get your take on how powerful it is when it actually lands on like the traditional gamer and that is the concept of owning the things that you buy in the game um the example i always use is once upon a time there and still to this day that magic the gathering is a huge trading card game and you own your own cards you buy the cards and you get to keep them you get to trade them with other people if you want to sell them on ebay you can but the the drawback is that magic the gathering those are physical cards you gotta you gotta be right next to the person right you don't you lose some of the digital coolness that something like hearthstone has hearthstone a great blizzard game kind of the same model there's a lot of cool game mechanics that exist because it's in the digital world but when you buy hearthstone cards from blizzard they just they you don't own them you just have access to them bestowed by you inside of the blizzard app and blizzard players rehearsal players funnel hundreds and hundreds to thousands of dollars into hearthstone to purchase these cards and then blizzard just like mints more expansion packs they lose their they lose their power inside the game and they never were even able to like actually sell them like they were with magic the gathering yeah uh future card games really an example of that i was actually playing magic just last night um because um there's a couple of things that i'll um i'll say magic the gathering is actually like a bigger business than um than hearthstone i think hearthstone is the most successful tcg game uh trading card game you know digitally but actually magic the gathering had is probably bigger um yesterday than uh sorry last year than it has been previously it's actually growing um and not like shrinking as an audience from like a dau daily active user perspective is bigger than hearthstone today um they probably have something like and they call it like 15 million or so like active players um even today and from a revenue perspective is uh significantly larger today um and like and so um i think people don't realize how big magic is the um and actually i think it's a great um example of why i actually think the gamers um will embrace the concept of ownership because of magic you own the cards right and um magic is like the og collectible sort of um uh and almost like a progeny progenitor of like um what nfcs are because right you know these days um some of the magic cards are worth literally hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more like each like and um and the ownership of it actually means a lot to people and is why one of the reasons why it's so um it's like both like amazing monetization and also has this massive audience because people are still buying the cars and they're very proud of like showing off like the cars that they have from like you know older sets um and uh and so yeah i actually think that this concept is one of the reasons why i'm so bullish that over time gamers um in the digital world will embrace um owning the items that they have cared so much for playing so many hours with um and uh and as you know as soon as they kind of wrap their mind around some of um you know what what what this all is you know we're still we're still uh trying to explain crypto gaming to uh to traditional gamers uh but but there's one last area that i i think i wanted to cover here and this is an area of interest maybe back a little bit to that theme of populism but something else like above when you dig down and you get above the surface issues what are the substance issues that the traditional gamers have and one is this question of like how many people use games as escapism from real life right it's like they wouldn't use the term escapism it's just where i go to have fun i work my day job it's a dead end i'm in a cubicle all day you know i'm whatever doing something i don't love doing during the day but at night i'm transformed into this alternate world where i have my people my tribe my guild i'm a badass there i've you know warrior armor i'm like level 60 right people think i'm a big deal i'm good at this game all right different world now when you inject real world economies into this type of environment all right you inject all the crust from the real world all of the wealth inequality that we have previously and now suddenly i'm fighting against you know three arrows capital for my dragon armor right like i have to bid against them and they can buy their way in and so i get all the outside gaming economics that have just invaded this world and i don't like that not only i don't like change it's just like you're ruining the thing that i had the one place i could go where i wasn't affected by all of these real world troubles what do you think about that maybe that's like a a bigger kind of picture thing but does this sort of wreck some of the value proposition for for traditional gamers yeah absolutely it does um and and it basically you're touching on the concept of pay to win and actually um the a huge amount i mean i say the majority of the gaming population um uh really don't like this idea of paying to win in fact some of the most passionate communities whether it's um you know guild wars or um or uh some of the biggest mmos are uh are not paid to win for a reason which is um very different from pay for power i would say like um you know if if somebody wants to spend like ten thousand dollars and you know decking their characters out with skins and also maybe speeding up some of the progression in order to get certain items um then they sh that you know they should be able to right it's it's an open economy and many of the top games have um have actually embedded this kind of dynamic into their game but at a certain point even if you spend i don't know a million dollars or something into a game you will still not be able to beat out somebody who is more skilled and the best like i would say pvp competitive games in the world balances this out very very well and uh and i think in in the future i think a great web 3 game is going to need this similar balance otherwise they will not reach the scale um or longevity of of another game that actually has figured this out because if you're competing against three arrows or a fund maybe you're competing for certain skins and rarity of skins and by the way that happens today too is like you know really rare gaming skins will also cost tens of thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars but if i feel like with that item a fund can beat me in the game well then the game basically loses all fun and um and so like i think that um what what three game developers really need to do is think about balance and um you know how do you make it so that at some point it doesn't matter how much money you spend like you're still playing the game in an equal basis whether i'm playing free to play like um and have never spent a time in the game but i'm just really great at it or if i spend you know like i don't know a thousand dollars in the game we need gaming economists is what it sounds like to go figure out these these wealth inequality issues for us in game maybe we can export some of that to the real world too maybe we'll learn a few things um digital world autonomous or some of the um are actually very very essential to the most complex games whether it's like an rpg or an mmorpg um and uh and other like complex games and it's not like you set up the economy once it's a it's totally a live operated um skill set right like for example a um you know a game economist or a game designer is introducing a new economy into the game a new mark into the game which is a new item or something like that it impacts the behavior of you know how people react and they'll um change their behavior they'll haven't they'll have a assumption or a hypothesis around how impact it but then they will start like tweaking the levers of the of of like the game in order to balance that right maybe one item is way too powerful and therefore it is really ruining the competitive dynamics the game will then they'll they'll balance it um and usually you know if somebody had really grinded a lot of hours or i paid money for a certain item yeah they'll be pretty upset for a short period of time but ultimately if the players trust that the game developers is trying to just optimize for the best experience for the player and that trust is something oftentimes built over a long period of time then um then they will you know accept these changes one of the challenges of web 3 and introducing nfts um is that this cycle is vastly accelerated because any imbalance in the game is immediately essentially taken advantage of just like um arbitrages are immediately taken advantage of in d5 and um and so um therefore and some sort of these changes might actually be irreversible right there are some i think providers out there of blockchains that offer reversibility and sort of private blockchains and i mean to that i truly question well what is the difference between that and an internal ledger that is actually not like web 3 and um and i think some game developers may not understand that nuance yet um but i think over time hopefully they will and because i think over time gamers will realize that if you do that then you actually won't actually own the item and so then what was the point of adopting that quote-unquote blockchain internal ledger in the first place um but it does create like game um design challenges that um i think game developers will need to figure out yeah i'm all about uh bring on the the the game economist right bring on the game central bankers so long as we preserve the right to fork to fork them if they mess things up that is important for decentralization okay so we promised three explanations here and that was the uh the gamer explanation uh the last and final one is for the crypto native okay so crypto native knows all about nfts you know knows the c is the value proposition of digital scarcity knows all about decentralization i think generally the crypto native is pretty excited when you when you tell that person about crypto gaming because they're like oh my god bring on the metaverse this is what i've been waiting for i understand digital scarcity these have already been the early adopters um i i don't know a single person i think who have embraced f3 that haven't been excited about gaming and web 3 um because i think they've already embraced this concept of decentralization more ownership more governance and control like for um for the creator and the end user versus the centralized um you know sort of stakeholders and um and so it's almost like yeah i don't even need to do any explanation explaining yeah you don't i mean people in this space we've long felt that gaming um and you know maybe like social tokens and things have been are the best use case and um and actually will give utility for nfts and actually will just drive the next adoption wave of them um and uh because i mean there's still like very few i mean call like maybe hundreds of thousands of people that have bought nfts right now there's like the next 100 million billion people to onboard um and so and of course like we didn't want three we're like the minority right and so we're really excited to find like um people to reptil and and bring on board um and uh but i would say i would really say that for for us in the community it's important to have patience there's a lot of jargon um there's a lot of i think i don't know like you know elitism and um and i think for people who kind of experience that um and some of the toxicity i would say um they kind of react against that as well and you know we are in the minority here you know it's on us to actually provide a very friendly open inclusive environment to bring on people onto sort of this platform so amy say somebody is listening to this and is like i'm sold i want to go play some crypto games uh i think they might be a little bit disappointed if they were a gamer if they if they know all about gaming they might be a little bit disappointed about what the current world of crypto gaming has to currently offer them so what would you say is like you know axe infinity it has a bajillion players but like as far as like what people are used to it's very very off the beaten path it's a new kind of game the graphics just are very rudimentary uh it doesn't it doesn't feel like fortnite it doesn't feel like hearthstone uh what would you say is really holding back the current state of crypto games that we really need to work on as an industry yeah i mean uh you know first uh calling out i mean ashley finney basically was the first to go mainstream and so i think everyone is learning from what they've done right the the things they've done right the things they've um made mistakes on and the team is super open about the things that they're working on the challenges with um uh with the game um but the reality is is that games take years to develop uh and you know i think ballroom took seven years um and even some of the best like um free to play mobile games that are more casual in nature to take a couple of years to develop and therefore uh some of these games that are going to be super exciting to play or i would say most of them are still in development and will probably not come out for a couple of years um i think that there are certain genres for example browser games uh as a genre i think are making a comeback right now they were big call it 15 years ago and and then mobile took over in the last year um in the last 10 years and because of the red ocean competitiveness of user acquisition in the space browser is slowly coming back that's why we invested in fairway games and so i think you know people are really excited to see what that might feel like they can play mini royale um and it's live today right and not with all of the blockchain components of course um but over time it will it will launch and so i would say i always tell gamers to be patient you know like um and you know if they're really excited about the concept they should tell their developers um the the game that they would love to see and hear more about what they're thinking about in um in blockchain be involved in the conversation that is the spirit of web3 and uh and it starts there we often like to say on bankless that crypto is speed running the history of money and finance and then we've also added on that dows are speed running the history of human governance systems and there's just a lot of previous stuff that humans have already done that crypto is redoing once again and when you tell me that like browser based games are making a comeback i remember spending hours on like arcadegames.com or miniclip.com when i was a kid do you feel like we could do are we kind of following the same pattern like crypto gaming is speed running the history of gaming once again yeah well i mean i do think that the constitutive like these um distributed ledgers and decentralization is is quite new and exciting i mean i guess it's not new i mean it's been around for probably like eight years now um and finally taking mainstream adoption so really it's more around you know like just like browser games finally some of the leading developers um are re kind of rediscovering it and moving over and creating like these great consumer experiences as that happens in crypto right i've always thought like what will bring on the next like billion users will be an amazing consumer experience in application form whether it is a financial services app or you know a game or social network et cetera um and this audience is much larger than financial services um as like you know in d5 as a use case even though even if that's like a deeper sort of use case from an asset total asset perspective the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lydo is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the una swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless okay so here's what the um the crypto native is going to want to know so that you know the traditional gamers may be going to want to know what games can i play the crypto native is gonna want to know okay what do i buy how do i get exposure to the space right tell me what to ape into this sort of thing and on bagless we don't get into the details of these things but i will remind audience listeners okay we're talking about axi infinity uh last year at this time when no one else was a lot of people weren't ignoring it market cap 32 million dollars for the axs token all right that this was one year ago as we're recording this looking on coin market cap it's at 6.8 billion at the time of recording today this is how fast these markets can move and the opportunity cost of missing something right which is why partially amy we're having this podcast we want to try to identify what's next but give us a sense of if somebody wants to if a crypto native wants to get exposure into crypto gaming what do they do because it's different than like just do i buy a token do i buy an item do i buy digital property do i get equity exposure i uh there's a game i was i was looking at it's kind of a loot fork it's called dope wars anyway i was looking at dope wars and i didn't know whether to buy their in-game currency it's called paper or like the royals royce loot item right it's like what's going to appreciate more should i buy the the collectible the item or should i buy the the currency itself do you have any guidance on how to get exposure how you evaluate things as a venture cap you know venture capitalists on do i buy token do i buy item do i buy some property do i do i get equity exposure are they all equal does it depend give us a sense yeah i think there's a few different ways to think about it um first of all i think triple a weather gaming will be one segment in the gaming but play to earn is just actually another segment in web3 gaming um i don't think it's going to go away anytime soon first and foremost because these guilds um that have come up which you know ygg is leading right now but there's at this point thousands of guilds in the world which are i think essentially like a a yield farm fund so um have actually raised vast amounts of money at this point accumulative capital that now needs to be deployed into these games um which will sustain sort of like the next generation of um of play to earn games and um in that world i actually don't think the game needs to be fun the um and all i think what what needs to happen is a really keen sense of tokenomics because i think of them as essentially like d5 means gaming um and uh and i think that there's a few different places to invest as you mentioned you can invest in a player in games uh governance token in-game currency um assets there's land assets items et cetera and then there's also um uh there's also there's a game studio themselves and then there's also the guilds right um and so the thing with these games is that the majority of them will go through i think a fairly short cycle like kind of like you know you have kind of hyper casual gaming dynamics there where um you're usually you're actually using incentivization to bring people in bring them into the assets and so getting in early is very very important and when they stop incentivizing um the asset value appreciation whether it's a token or the nft the thing is that there there will be essentially like hundreds and hundreds of these and so therefore the rational thing is that guilds and then also players will move to the place where they're going to get the most return which is probably going to be another new play to earn game that is heavily incentivizing new users it's not unlike a lot of d5 apps right have the same mechan mechanism where you see this huge drop off as soon as they stop doing um you know air drops and and uh and yield incentives and so um i think there's a couple of new ones how the token is structured in the game economy is really important and therefore for an investor you should probably read the white paper and understand exactly how the economy is structured because for example if the governance token is actually utilized as part of a soft currency so it's a soft currency and a and a a play to earn game right has unlimited um circulate uh supply and so they will continue to print it and therefore it's never going to experience like long-term sort of huge increase in in value because the the point is that that is used as almost like a stable coin esque or that's the hope um way to like um to to pay out earners right however for example if there are breeding mechanisms or um or that that involve the uh in-game governance token as part of the fees to do so and that is a fixed supply then it basically is a naturally built in like value accumulations you know mechanism into the governance token and so kind of like at least in a short to medium term it's it's going to increase until the um until the game studio decides to start air dropping and releasing the token from from their own treasury and so there's i and so i think if you're like a savvy trader and that i would really look at how the token is structured because you can use that to predict like token appreciation at least in the short term um depending on what the game studio does and then on the asset value side of it um because like there's so much money in these guilds to be buying these assets you'll also likely see um a lot of accumulation of these assets and so there it's like look to see where does a play to earn game have accumulated a lot of community um and because that's where the guilds will be looking to see where they actually make their next investments as well and um you know if you are able to get on these asset sales early um then you know that's like i mean there's there's a lot of ways to to find returns there um and uh and i think you've seen that play out with these like very you know very public land sales and also appreciation of these like nft assets i actually think in-game nfts like some of these games are starting to realize that um quickly appreciating in-game asset nfts are detrimental directly detrimental to the retention of players because they quickly become unaffordable right and so therefore like there's new mechanics around placements you know releasing potentially millions of these items and trying to keep these asset prices down which is beneficial for game play but maybe like not as beneficial if you're an investor looking for appreciation of asset value yeah it's really interesting i guess there's no clean answer to the question of do i do tokens do i do items do i do property or do i invest in a guild here and it really depends but if you're evaluating a game right you definitely need to look at the token uh token economics yeah behind the token itself but like what do you guys do when when when you go do you ever buy items or is it primarily like tokens and um you know investing in the the equity of the game studio that sort of thing and then and then maybe is the the idea behind investing in a guild is that like oh you get exposure to a wide set of games so that's sort of an indexed fun type of investment any thoughts on that for sure um so we're not traders and so um when we invest in a game studio in which we have we're really investing in equity and then the governance token um with the expectation that we'll be investing a studio in the long term um i think that there's like a trading strategy around play to earn games but then there's like a long-term investment one and we're very squarely in the latter and that's why we do equity and governance token deals with these games um studios and then i absolutely do think that the guilds are an interesting part of the value chain because like i mentioned um these game these titles will rise and fall and i actually think a player earned for a lot of them like in a pretty short time frame um and um however if you're a guild you sent in and you command over time a distribution of tens of thousands hundreds of thousands eventually millions of players right in these emerging markets then you um that is the mode right first you need um they have accumulated a lot of capital in order to buy assets to then accumulate the distribution and once they have the distribution they essentially can move players from one game to another they're almost like king makers they can actually produce like you know probably like at least jumpstart a lot of these games as well and therefore um it has not been lost on a lot of investors that guilds are an interesting part of the ecosystem i think the challenge right now is that as you have mentioned there's just aren't that many like live uh play-doh and uh games and so therefore uh while gills have been trying to diversify their treasury into a lot of different gaming assets um you know most of them are still heavily invested in axi because there's just not that many other live games right now right and so um uh and so i think there's going to be a time when there's like a lot of concentration of these guilds in that one game so a lot of the web3 community is definitely interested in just like oh how do how do i get exposure like what what do i buy as ryan said but as you just uh said the the whole play to earn movement it's not about buying it's about playing you're so a lot of these assets you're supposed to play the game in order to earn them and i know we really just only have axe infinity and maybe a few other examples to really know what that really means but in in theory projecting forward what are the different vehicles in which people that don't want to invest their capital but rather instead they want to play the game to get upside what's the generalized model how do people actually make money playing the game yeah people making money playing the game i mean um i i personally think kind of in the future um my hypoth my hypothesis is that there's going to be this classic place to earn gaming model which will cater to um which will cater to sort of like the emerging market where actually like the replacement for income is just much lower than a western audience right um and so there's that's going to be a thing and you know if and that's more of like a trading mentality i think of it as like you know i think western traders will look at that and find our opportunities and and otherwise and um and and but a good gamer looking to earn maybe like you know play and earn at the same time let's say like you know i can be playing like cod you know call of duty but then i can also play something like this but also earn some tokens and have fun doing that i don't think it's going to become like a replacement for income ever in fact i think if it is then that actually will that is not sort of correlated with um longevity of that game and so in that kind of segment you're um most likely going to um play and earn you know you can probably earn some tokens if some people spend thousands of hours in these games so they'll probably earn maybe like a substantial amount of value and nfts and and tokens from doing so um and because uh and because there's like um and i think a lot of these aaa games will actually incorporate a mechanic in which ice you know there's a possibility of actually earning a lot of very valuable assets just like that mechanic exists today except that you can actually go out and sell for example a rare skin for like a million dollars or something uh and i think that will be a component to it as well and that sort of almost like a gambling mentality will potentially also be um a a drive for a bunch of gamers too to play some of these web 3 games one of the favorite things in my mind about both gaming and crypto is that everything is really really community based and we're seeing overall the whole entire world move closer and closer towards communities towards tribes people are finding their their tribe on in the metaverse in wherever they they identify with themselves and the web 3 world definitely runs on communities gaming has run on ran on community since day one and now we are seeing the intersection of the web 3 communities and the gaming communities amy can you can can you just talk about the the role that you see community playing when we talk about the world of uh crypto gaming that's coming oh yeah i mean i think communities already play a vital role in web3 gaming and it will absolutely continue to and um and i'm very hopeful that they will also come together you know game gaming community and web 3 communities finding a common common ground and we're honestly just not seeing very much of that right now they're very separate today um and uh in in these like if so when i look at actually infinity like you know these communities love that game right and they help each other on board and teach and teach each other sort of like how what are the best strategies to earn and win matches etc um and i think um uh say what you will about like sort of like the pros and cons and the mistakes and and the and how they manage their economy however the community was with that game from day one and um and it's one of the key reasons as to why that platoon game was so successful and any player and game developer who don't realize that i i don't think we'll have a success um like you know a success he's anywhere near that of a axi um and so the the community is absolutely key especially because even in traditional gaming there has been the biggest trend and that has been the convergence of gaming and social um and uh you know browser is one of the sub trends with that because you know they're instantly shared you know um and so theoretically you can go on social network and share a link and potentially get tens of thousands of people playing one instance in a browser game immediately but also if you look at the rise of roblox and um you know the core use case of roblox is kids going to a library like playing with as friends and playing hours in i don't know one of their you know um what is like actually very basic fidelity games but just super fun social games right like again you don't need high fidelity like ballerina to have essentially hundreds of millions of people playing your game it turns out that people are going to games um like the bigger population is going because it's fun to play with friends um today mostly friends in real life that they bring in but in the future like friends that they meet actually in the game environment and so um because of that i think the concept of community is already growing in significance in traditional gaming and already important in web 3 and so this trend will just continue i think i'd like to remind listeners that the web 1 and web 2 world both came out of social use cases like the web one world was people wanted to chit chat on forums with like-minded like interested people and then the web two world just supercharged that with social media platforms so the internet the growth of the internet always kind of seems to be trending towards just how do we make things more social how do we make more communities and how do we enable them to exist uh amy when it comes to all of these you know play-to-earned games and you talk about how uh there's the potential for people to earn uh more than a living wage uh when it comes to playing these games what about the concept of like meaning and purpose and career when it comes to working in these web three games how does just people always want to discover meaning and think that they are working towards some sort of bigger purpose when when they do their labor when they do their work and that that's why it keeps them going uh how does that role fit into the world of crypto gaming yeah i love that concept um in my opinion i think that is the most important core of a future metaverse you know um this idea that people are um spending substantial amounts of time in like a digital world um well they won't do that unless they derive significant meaning value and identity from that and i think people talk a lot about the form factor of that digital world but actually it's sort of like if you think about a person's a human needs um and this need to belong and find meaning it actually is the core concept of it um i and and honestly like when i think about some of the greatest like mmo designers of our era like that's honestly what they think about all day long um and so yeah i think you know i i love like um eve online and you know their some of their largest skills or corporations have literally like 10 000 people in it and um and you know i've spoken and the ceo have has often said that players over the last 20 years how long this game has been around have come to him and be like i actually derive more meaning and learnings from this game and my role in that than i do in real life um or i'm porting learnings from the game into real life um and uh and you know i am somebody in this game very important whereas you know i don't find as much meaning in my day-to-day job you know and that's why they have spent like um so much of their time energy love and also like you know money into this game um and uh and this is and and so you know these are these are kills in which there's like leadership there's a ceo there's again like i mentioned i t departments and and hr and and people have jobs and um all within this digital world i think it's the og honestly like metaverse um and so therefore like this concept of meaning and value um but also this concept of scarcity and um and potential loss the things that are actually really important to a person sort of in real life um is uh is actually what will drive how they spend their time um and uh and so if there is going to be future metaverses this is going to be core to that so once upon a time i absolutely loved going to the gym and i'd be in the gym every single day and then i became a personal trainer and it just sucks the fun right out of it and i just did not want to be in the gym at all and i'm kind of worried that everyone wants to play games and then as soon as you put money and assets into games people think that's a great idea but then it goes from like fun into work and it kind of sucks the fun out of it do you have this fear that like crypto gaming will just kind of suck the fun out of gaming and just make it more like work i think that meaning and value creates fun this concept of fun is a pretty like you know like a nebulous one and this is one that i've sort of debated a lot with people as well um if you are tasked in an mmo guilt with just grinding like in the like dungeon crawler levels to create a certain amount of goals so that the guilds can um you know buy certain resources to to like win their next battle or whatever like is that is that work or is that fun or is that somewhere in the middle or is it fun because that person feels like they're adding a lot of value to their guild and um and so therefore i think that the lines are blurry and more important is that meaning and connectivity and social creates fun um and uh and that's sort of and and like and that's like a more kind of direct tie than necessarily like okay this is a beautiful sort of like first person shooter experience and that creates fun actually i always argue that the the social experience but then also like the fun of going through the game mechanics and and the level combined um great fun you mentioned earlier amy that um and it's been one criticism that some of these crypto games are unsustainable what's required to make a crypto game sustainable is it that fun element that we talk about and realizing the term fun again is you said nebulous but it's also very broad right it's like what are we kind of optimizing for in life if you boil it all down right it's like yeah there's money there's stuff you have to do there's also fun when i say fun it's like it's like leisure it's like stuff you want to do it's the life fulfillment stuff so money and fun these are the two optimizations is fun required to make a crypto game sustainable um so again like i have a very broad definition of fun right and so when i say the game has to be fun um i actually mean like a bunch of different things and i don't mean necessarily the graphic fidelity of the game et cetera i mean you know does the game create value and social um it's like it's like fulfillment right yeah that's what you're saying yeah and and find kind of the classic sense you know the gameplay is super fun and addictive so i'm just going to play it and and that translates to retention of the player wanting to actually come in you know we always talk about the concept of like the thousand hour game right what does the game need to have in order for somebody to play for a thousand hours it's difficult i mean we have really short attention spans we don't do a lot of things more than like i don't know a couple of hours me like time to fun in a game right you have three minutes to basically get somebody um into and um and engaged and willing to invest time into a game or something like that um and so all of these concepts are really important and what i mean sustainability i mean definitely the fun has to be there in this broad definition um and i think social elements will really help that potentially competitive elements you know pvp will help that as well but also what what takes away from sustainability is also these is this optimization for quickly appreciating assets basically what happens then if you have guilds and investors and um basically investing in all of the early like assets in the game that then appreciates a thousand x and then the normal the normie players come in and they're buying these assets a lot more expensive after the tokens launch it's already worth like billions of dollars of ftv then essentially you are setting these people up for significant i would say disappointment when inevitably once you stop um once the game maker stops incentivizing them and asset value comes down um then you you have a player that otherwise may have actually wanted to play the game but is actually sitting on um like having lost a lot of money and assets and they're going to basically and it's going to lose it's going to destroy the trust between that player and the in the game and that's like a really that's a really subpar experience and leads to unsustainability and so when i say sustainability it is kind of like both like the like the positive and the negative side of that and really taking care this is what makes investing in this space kind of tricky and it's easy to say like hey uh you know amy tell us what the next axi is but it's actually hard like to identify what what that's going to be but a few of the things i feel like you mentioned are community a community is super important token economics are actually important finding the right balance is important making sure the gameplay is fun the broad definition of the word fun meaning fulfilling um lots of other things i'm sure but what else do you really look for so when you're looking at hey i'm trying to invest in in uh in the next big crypto game thing what are you looking for beyond the things we've already discussed in this episode i think a lot of that but i also think that um we um that some of the most brilliant game makers are still thinking through how to reinvent like the um the embedding of washing technology into the game to to solely enhance the the um the player uh experience you know um for example you know like um some of the best game makers in the world whether they're at riot or supercell or you know epic and otherwise are thinking through this and i'm actually super excited to see what these game makers will invent in this genre um and um and some of these and whether and it may come it may well come from indie studios as well right um and uh but i am bullish that it will come from new games created with native blockchain um you know sort of integration uh and uh whether that's happening within a large gaming publisher or an indie studio um rather than necessarily just porting over an existing huge franchise to blockchain i mean it could happen if it's done really thoughtfully but um i think that we have yet to see a lot of really creative mechanisms that have yet to be invented so it comes down to the comet and i'm denominator we always talk about on bankless where it's back to the teams you're kind of investing in individual people because they're the ones that are trying to navigate this uncertainty um just two more things amy uh we want to cover and uh then i think we're good for for this episode um the first is this question of timing right so you'd be right about the thesis of crypto gaming but get the timing wrong and it feels like now there's a lot of i guess excitement about crypto gaming on the back of axey excitement we we didn't see frankly at this time last year and i almost wonder if some of that might be overextended or over hyped uh kyle simani from multicoin said yeah there's a lot of crypto funds turning into gaming vcs right now it's not going to end well according to the block roughly 42 of the last 3.8 billion dollars worth of vc funds uh that was from november went into crypto gaming do you feel like the market's maybe a little bit frothy now or does this feel like a right size and what does this mean for uh how you think about this as an investor yeah i think the market is absolutely frothy i uh i would agree with kyle on his uh on his prediction but actually kind of the cycles of gaming investing has been uh that has happened far before y3 where you have these cycles of a lot of enthusiasm from non-gaming investors coming in and not quite realizing i think how title um sensitive like successes there is i i don't i'm not sure there's like a more power law um you know sort of uh uh distribution of success industry than than in gaming where actually you know the vast majority of the success accrues to the top it's possible we won't see another play to earn game as successful as axi um like it wouldn't surprise me um i i wouldn't be surprised otherwise as well and so um what happens even in traditional gaming as a bunch of people come in um and get super excited drive up like game asset value and then the reality is when they launch probably 99.9 will fail and as a reminder there's basically a hundred thousand games launched on um you know i think like on mobile um on like a monthly basis or something like that i mean it is a massively competitive uh field and so the um and so i mean the vast majority of these games will fail in the longer terms and that's just the distribution of gaming i think in web 3 you might see some of them reach like initial um success from like token and defined by token about appreciation um as they're incentivizing but if you don't have retention like you will not get these like long um you won't get long-term success and uh but but as a um as an early stage investor right you're hopefully the game studios are locking us in for kind of like two three four year time horizon which will long extend beyond that initial period and so therefore i agree with kyle i think that the majority of the games we'll see today will fail because that's also just the natural distribution of title success and failure and gaming in general and um and so therefore um you know i i believe in the portfolio construction of game title investing um and uh and you know this is only a growing industry and so i'm still i still remain incredibly bullish myself in terms of finding the right teams to back in the space our best not financial advice for for the casual investor in this space is like go find something you love to play go find the game that's fun that's giving you fulfillment and you know chances are if it does that for you it's going to do that for thousands maybe millions of others that is exactly exactly it's a you know it's a buffett thing but it's but it's actually true and i don't think buffett plays video games maybe uh you know or he'd be here i guess with us um let's talk about 2022 so we're getting ready to close out the year amy feels like 2021 has been a breakout year for crypto gaming what can we expect in uh 2022 is this going to be another up only year are you uh bullish on specific categories i know you mentioned casual mobile crypto games is that one are there others tell us about 2022 and the outlook so um yeah i mean we're very excited about crypto um in different categories in the very long term absolutely nobody can predict the crypto markets uh i think even on like a very short time frame horizon the next week right i mean um sam bankman free can't predict it nobody can predict it um and uh and so but i think that's why as venture investors we think in much longer arcs uh and you know we're we're really bullish about the space kind of you know if there's a bear market next year there's a bull market next year but some of the i think the trends that i'm super excited about are um certainly web three i think that would be massive i i think we will see multiple launches of social networks in um in decentralized social networks next year uh and uh some of them are in production you know aren't developing now and we'll see more um more creative use cases and um deployments of of token and nfts um and blockchain in games and also in social uh consumer companies and um and then also kind of on other sides i think that we will continue seeing like the next uh iterations of d5 right how do you tap into non-collateralized funding these are areas that you know teams like ave are innovating on and um and i think a big category that will arise is infrastructure um in in crypto and i would include security as part of that you know there's so much rock pulling and and hacks in the space you know how do you prevent it with interesting kind of like decentralized uh reimagination of like security uh protocols in crypto but then also insurance and also how do you make building applications significantly easier for um for developers so devops tooling and um you know built on top of blockchains these are all super interesting categories that we're excited about amy wu thanks for taking us
