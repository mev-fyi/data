foreign ation on the Pod today we have Sam sperlin who is a partner at the ready the ready is an organizational change and transformation consultancy and uh Sam is co-storiting the Reddy's efforts to contribute to Dallas and the web 3 space more broadly why does this matter well uh there are human social structures and complex systems built around Dows the ready offers a thing called the OS canvas which helps you work through your purpose strategy workflow membership Authority in your organization resources how they're allocated meetings how do you develop Mastery how do you create structure how do you create Innovation how does information flow and how does compensation work those are all different apps in your organization's operating system so uh back when I was at git coin we engaged with the ready in order to figure out our purpose and essential intent and I gotta say that Sam is a really great person to have in the room as you're trying to figure out what you're doing and and within the space of Dallas there are not a lot of people who can figure out how to create high functioning organizations within a dow because it just hasn't been done before so Sam and the ready are kind of inventing it from first principles I found Sam to be a really useful partner in the work that get coin and the later super modular is doing um for me as a software engineer running an organization is quite different than programming computers leading people is way different from computer from programming computers and just creating common knowledge and culture and social structure and creating consent based decision making has all been new to me but Sam uh Sam has been a great great great friend and partner and to me in that journey and that's why I wanted to have him on the green pillow podcast sort of have this presumption that other dials that are in the struggle of the bear Market that if you can spend time tuning your organization and your operating system that's tuning your Your Vessel that's taking you where you're going and so um a different different kind of episode that I think that we've done on the green pill podcast before but a fruitful one and an important one for people who are involved in dowels and trying to figure out their Dow operating system so uh that's about all the praise that I can sing for Sam in a two-minute bumper you're gonna have to listen to the episode in order to get a piece of his brain and I think it's it's definitely worth it so without further Ado I give you Sam sperlin from the ready working in web3 is awesome but

about Dow organization and DOW operating systems with you so maybe you could tee us off by telling us a little bit about the ready I would be happy to uh so um I'm pausing here and Gathering my thoughts because the ready is always involving kind of how we how we talk about ourselves and the work uh that that we do so I always feel like there's like a slightly different angle that I'm bringing to it I feel like seven years in I should really have my answer dialed but every time it feels like it's totally it's totally new um so what the ready is uh at least originally conceptualized uh was um it is an organizational transformation consultancy and seven years ago uh when we kicked this off um doubt obviously we're not on our radar and our clients uh were generally really large uh often you know kind of Fortune 500 sorts of of organizations who were feeling like they were kind of getting crushed under their own bureaucracy and we wanted to help them find better ways of of organizing better ways of working and that's what we uh did for and have and continue to do for for a while now and um only in the past year or so actually a little over a year at this point did we decide that you know as a kind of future of work consultancy we should um really make sure we have a foot in the future of of organizations and realize that we would be doing ourselves a disservice and our our especially our future selves a disservice if we did not get into Dao's in a major way and really try to understand uh what was uh what's going on there and that's what has been a decent part of my portfolio over the past year is kind of leading our efforts uh as a as a regards to us did you say that dials are the future of organization I mean they could be they're not yet maybe uh but we're definitely we're definitely throwing down that bet that uh Dows or whatever they're called five ten years from now are going to be a a major player in kind of how we're thinking about work and how this work gets gets done so yeah we're we're trying to uh figure figure that out and make sure that we're around and relevant and maybe even more than that like actually helps steer things in a in a in a better Direction right yeah I I think it's a fun prompt like ardales the future of organ of organizations because it's such a wide aperture that I feel like it's almost meaningless like saying dials are the future of organizations is like saying like buildings are the future of housing like okay are we talking about schools museums airports houses apartment buildings like there's so many different subtypes of Dao and like the Dow monikers just like catch all this aperture is almost in my opinion too wide to even be useful yeah yeah no I'm I'm right there right there with you and even kind of on the other end of that too like well what is even work going to like what what does work mean in the future uh as well too so both sides of the phrase are uh are are pretty uh can can get vague pretty quickly yeah well you know I'm curious what you think the future of organizing would be and how does it differ from maybe companies as they would have existed before web3 maybe that's a a good place to start is just where are you where are you all excited yeah yes I think maybe the way to kind of tackle this is like what what got us interested in in this in the first place I mean the ready from the beginning we have been um very interested in kind of like alternative ways of of organizing so we were not trying to Fashion ourselves after the the Consulting companies that everybody knows and you know that sort of work we were really inspired by things like holocracy and sociocracy and you know Reinventing organizations Frederick La luz's work basically this whole um this whole body of thinking about can we can we come together as humans and organizations in a different way so that's that's like our our um our our ancestry and in terms of like how we think about this work so then if you care about what does it look like to decentralize organizations what does it look like to push autonomy out what does it look like to have self-managing organizations and then you become aware of this thing happening over in this weird crypto world called decentralized autonomous organizations like you're hitting some major keywords that we cared and care about at the ready so like that was just kind of the very beginning of us being like oh like we should probably like figure figure this out because you know these are these are the types of things that that we care about so when I think about what and it's relevant to the work we do with our regular organizations our Legacy clients uh as well like we when we think about the future of work we think about organizations that are not these top-down hierarchies of command and control um that we they're they're much more like networks and and self-managing in places and you know there's a certain amount of reality or pragmatism that we have to bring to our our traditional work you know our our Fortune 100 company we're not going to our client we're not going to turn into a self-managing organization but we can bring principles that are relevant you know people positivity complexity Consciousness that I think are kind of more um natural uh in Dao's to to these other uh sorts of organizations so all that is just to say that you know there are there's so much opportunity within Dallas to really fundamentally rethink what it means to be an organization and how to get work done that we were just naturally uh drawn to it so the last year has really been about learning as much as possible getting up to speed seeing where we had something to offer seeing where we could learn from Dallas and that's kind of been my own personal uh journey in this space over the last year yeah um well I guess you know maybe one way to to talk about it uh I think we're kind of circling it right now but maybe talking at the object level about the kind of work that you all do would be a good thing to do next so what's what's the what's the readys operating system canvas and how does it help you sort of illuminate these design criteria in the dials that you work with yeah so the the operating system canvas is just a tool we developed using the metaphor of an operating system for an organization so if you think about um you know what a a organization's operating system might consist of it's things like purpose strategy workflow membership the other things that are that are in the canvas there which you can think of each of these uh spaces each of these areas as having practices and assumptions and principles about how we do this thing within the organization and the way that you would fill out the canvas is basically the way people experience your organization so I can give you a blank canvas and you could be an employee at the most top-down horrible organization in the world you could fill out the canvas that would kind of describe your OS I could give a a canvas to a dow really high functioning dial they could fill out kind of what is how do we do these things what do we believe about these things so our work is really helping organizations make visible what is usually invisible which is how the operating system manifests in in what it feels like to work there and then make decisions and experiments around how can we do the things that we that that are currently holding us back how can we try them and do good things differently what can we do to actually make meetings or authority or purpose better in our organization so that's the the basic idea behind the work and then obviously the work looks very different whether you're focusing in on meetings or whether you're focusing in on purpose uh the work you know manifests differently well I mean I guess these are maybe like a a naive like straw man reaction to what you just said Sam is like wait Dallas I thought we were talking about autonomous organizations and the things that you're talking about in the operating system canvas purpose strategy workflow membership resources Authority those are all like human organization things so I think that one of the things that I want to sort of disambiguate here is that there's going to be a lot of organizations that are uh partially autonomous and that they run on trustwear and there's also going to be ones that run on social wear and it feels like you're helping to like bridge that gap of working in a like Reinventing organization's teal away for the humans that are augmenting the code in the organizations is is that fair I think that's fair and I think I think we could maybe even take it a step further I bet you and I haven't I mean I'm literally kind of thinking this you know for the first time right now I bet you there are Dows where parts of the OS are locked in to you know the protocol are locked in to the soft where running the doubly you know purpose or resource allocation it's the obvious one uh there but if you're go even in these um examples if you're ever gonna have humans kind of coming together and having to talk to each other or do anything to to decide how to set something up or set initial parameters I think you know there's there is room for this OS concept for um all organizations mm-hmm right I don't how does that how does that hit you I'm curious I think I think it's not as straw Manny as maybe you made it feel so I'm curious oh you know I'm just uh and I I well you know if I if I had started an organization that Ronda a little bit more on code and uh uh from the start I I think that some of our Builders out there are really smart enough to be building decentralized organizations from the start I'm not that smart I will get quite centralized back in 2017 so there's a lot of social error to manage as Bitcoin started its Evolution from a company to a Dao and actually we're recording this this week Alpha Protocols are actually going live so yeah TM uh and uh so you know I uh I think that that's totally fair but I just wanted to speak to the members of the of the audience that that maybe don't don't see things totally that way yeah no I think I think that's totally fair yeah and so what are the most common misalignments that you see and and through this process how do those get resolved yeah so I think over the last year kind of bringing some of these ideas to various Styles and and doing some of this work um you know the areas of the of the OS canvas that I have seen or where we've done the most work have been around uh purpose and strategy and then um I think the kind of the the workflow meetings information column um are um off in a place where there's some low-hanging fruit to start even just like capturing um some like how we're doing things right now and making and making it more visible which I think has been valuable um you know in a dow context where perhaps people are joining permission permissionlessly or close to permissionlessly and trying to get the lay of the land uh as as quickly as possible there's often a lot there but the purpose and strategy stuff I think is often a interesting place to to do some work uh because I mean as you can imagine you know if you don't have a a great sense of like why we're here or what we're actually trying um to do it can be difficult to make uh other other decisions um you need to be able to Anchor it in in something and that's not to say that purpose can't change or evolve uh over time but if you're making decisions about scarce resources and don't have a good sense of what are we what what even is good for us then it's hard to hard to do that so it's kind of an anchoring kind of foundational bit of work for a lot of organizations that was included I think yeah you know I think that like as someone who's tried to work in or who's worked in web 2 startups and in web 3 startups uh and using startups and like a broad encompassing way just organizations in general uh it feels like there's a lot of hierarchy that's trained into US you kind of have two types of people in web three there's people who came from the corporate world and they're trying to unlearn that way of thinking and you've got and then you've got people who came out of Academia which have a whole bunch of other things to unlearn but they don't have like the the corporate stuff to unlearn in them they don't have corporate hierarchy but there's a insane amount of hierarchy and Academia though too yeah I think that's true and um and you know so it's like unlearning the old world and then also learning the new world but it also feels a little bit like we're um building a muscle here like we have to we have to figure out purpose and strategy and workflow like running a 5k and then we can go into running running a a half marathon and then a marathon and then we can be ultra marathoners of decentralized working but you know what are the things that you think people need to unlearn in order to be able to build those muscles I mean I think one you just kind of pointed to the temptation to take huge leaps or think that only huge leaps are um worthwhile um I think it's really challenging for Creative intelligent people to not fall into that uh that anti-pattern of thinking like all right well I can picture how like I can see where we are right now and I can see where I want us to be and I can picture it I can imagine it I can almost feel it so why can't we just go from here to there and that's like the same thing as basically deciding I am a I have never run a mile in my life but I really want to do an ultra marathon so I'm just gonna get out there tomorrow and do it so like that that isn't a a bit of an unlearning kind of some humility that you have to uh really kind of bake into yourself to be okay with the idea that the only way organizations truly complex organizations change is by the continual iterative effort to change them and it is frustrating sometimes because you the the the the size of the bite you have to take in order to metabolize that change is sometimes very small and where people kind of fall off the path is that if they just take that one small bite and then never go back for the next one and the next one the next one so so I I really love the metaphor of building them also we often use that with clients because that's exactly what you're doing you have to build some some self-efficacy in the idea that you actually can do this and you have to show yourself that taking small action continuously will get you to to where you to where you want to go and our role often is kind of that role of the trainer right like the trainer can like help you get to the gym and show you what to do but if your trainer lifts the the the the weights for you you're not getting any fitter if the trader does the run for you you're not getting any any fitter so I think sometimes that's the the role that we play is to try to help you know bring that bravery that courage to organizations to actually give a about how they function and take action towards making it a little bit better continuously hmm yeah well I'm wondering if we can um maybe talk through the work that you did with Git coin because you and I are on different sides of the table when git coin was going from company to Dao and you know before before we go down that series of events I just want to say I've disaffiliated from Bitcoin as of I think it was July of 2022 and get coin is now a dow without a CEO and um I think like part of me disaffiliating was like unlearning that hierarchy as an organization and I also when I disaffiliated from Bitcoin wanted to send a message that like the way we operate in this organization the graceful thing to do is to let go of power and to to hire people under you and have them do a better job than you could ever do and to gracefully exit because in a lot of the organizations that I've seen in the past there's been too much clinging of of power but but anyway like that's all just to say that like as I go down these questions and ask um uh I've just Affiliated from Bitcoin so I'm now on the outside but you and I have this shared experience of doing um operating system and purpose stuff at Bitcoin so um maybe we can kind of pull that thread uh I think it was around this time last year that get coin engaged you and said hey we're trying to figure out how to how to organize as a dow and um you came in and you you took us through this OS canvas so so maybe we could talk through that a little bit yeah yeah and I'm this is where my you know in terrible memory uh is going to foil this conversation in places so if I if I remember something incorrectly and you remember it differently please please steer me uh down the the right path uh but you know so the way this work often starts is simply as you said kind of like let's let's put the OS canvas in front of us and let's just talk about reality right now and you know our terminology is like let's map the tensions what are the tensions we're feeling in the operating system right now and what is that telling us about where we should potentially put our attention so I don't have that you know original um OS canvas in front of me but I'm assuming given the work that we ended up doing some of the tensions that uh emerged and from what I remember was um around the budgeting process like how do we make decisions about how we spend our money and then if you follow that that trail back not even particularly far you get to the the question of of purpose and strategy So you you're like oh well if we only have X amount of resources and we have to decide among all of these things then what are we grounding these decisions in so the the so the decision was let's do some work on purpose let's do some work on strategy and that will help uh any other sort of decisions related to our our operating system that we'll need to make does that track with kind of your memory of how we set up our initial sort of work together yeah oh man maybe I shouldn't have started this line of questioning since we both have hazy memories and don't have enough in front of each other but yes people will tell us if we're wrong yeah that's true uh hopefully not angrily on Twitter but uh we will we will um uh so so I mean I think that basically I mean like you know and let's first acknowledge what we're trying to do here we're trying to turn a company into a Dao or at least one product Suite of a company into a doubt and those are two really different ways of working not only from like a financial and governance perspective but like the product needs to be Rewritten Soup To Nuts And so there's a lot of work to do and there's not a question and there's kind of like the first thing is like well who's in charge of driving what now that like we don't have orders from the CEO on high to to do these things and so there's a little bit of nuance there but I do think that like starting with I I just remember the difference in like the company had a mission of grow of build and fund public goods which like I ratified from on high as the CEO of the company but then we did this like purpose exercise and the purposes and essential intents coming out of Bitcoin were sort of derived from the collective intelligence and the governance mechanism of Bitcoin and I think that there was like a stepwise Improvement in engagement and sense of ownership from team members from Dow contributors that they actually had a hand in ratifying that so that was a really eye-opening moment for for me of like oh giving up control means like it's like this stepwise dance with the contributors where where they're going to take more ownership I'm using ownership in like the emotional sense sure um and and and I'm gonna let go and we're gonna kind of like do it together so I thought that was really interesting and it was really a breath of fresh air that that the purpose was something that we collectively ratified yeah yeah for sure I mean that's you know part of the the power of something like a Dao is that you know when you start to get more voices into everything I mean obviously the downsides of that are are easy to point to in terms of like if everybody has to vote on everything then nothing ever happens like that is already a well-trod path but in terms of the unexpected um things that can emerge when you just have more voices and I think that's what you're pointing to with the purpose like ideally the one of the the benefits of the doubt is just that we get better stuff because of just the cognitive diversity of what is as coming up and then it's up to the operating system of the Dow to be able to have the processes in place to actually do something with all that raw material which is what I tried to kind of work us through to the purpose and essential intent that we got to mm-hmm so that that essential intent was a phrase that you just um dropped that people may not um be familiar with so I'll just share a couple of words on that if that's helpful yeah so so the idea of essential intent for an organization is if you think about something like the purpose which is you it should be like a you know call A Hundred Year purpose we're not generally revisiting that particularly often and it's something that will take a long time to actually if ever uh manifest so that's inspirational but not particularly concrete maybe not uh super useful for kind of any sort of day-to-day or shorter term decisions and then if you think about the other end of the Continuum something like an outcome or a goal or an objective if you do okrs anything like that those tend to be hyper tactical quite short term they give you a lot of clarity about uh about what to go do but they're not particularly inspirational uh so is there is it useful to articulate kind of that middle layer between purpose and between between purpose and objectives um to that is both inspirational and concrete and getting an organization to talk about what are those bets that we're placing that most important work those most important outcomes that we need to make happen in that kind of two to four year range if the the conversation that you have around that is incredibly valuable for clarifying what are we going to go do and more importantly what are we not gonna do and you know if if your essential intent is 10 essential intent long if you have 10 different statements I'm questioning whether or not essential what is actually means anything in in that case so if you can having just a couple of phrases a couple of statements of this is our most important work it's going to take us you know a couple of years two to four years to actually make happen establishing those arguing about those fighting of those but then and then consenting to that list now you have something that's in between your purpose and your really short term where you can start to get alignment around what are we going to go do what are we not going to do what are we going to fund what are we not going to find how are we going to organize around this and I found it to be yeah useful for for organizations and particularly for Taos yeah well I'll say that um we found it to be so useful uh so after this after the split of the like the Dow split off into its own thing um there's this company called super modular um which used to be called get coin Holdings but the Dow the Bitcoin name has been transferred to the Dow of course um so now it's called super modular and we were doing our Charter we actually use purpose and essential intents uh so you you kind of like you didn't just fish for us you you taught us to fish I love to hear it what was it like you know getting you know kind of a new crew together around a new a new purpose or a new Mission and and trying to articulate that like what what was that experience like well it wasn't a new crew because so basically you're saying that I realized that they weren't new yeah new in context I guess yeah um knew in that like everything was just called get coin like it was Bitcoin kernel and hackathons and grants and we had this thing called Kudos and like an ad Network and like now we're modularizing the whole thing right so it's like a new module um and the crew that that I inherited was the hackathon business so a lot of people don't know this but get coin was actually like Bitcoin grants was the thing that people loved the public goods uh uh for but hackathons is how we kept that like we paid the bills um is by running virtual hackathons with people and you know of course um I meet people at ethereum events and they either uh give me kudos for opening up a space in their career by hosting a hackathon or because get coin grants got them through a rough period with their project or whatever and so um you know they're kind of like equal equal parts of the Beast that was Bitcoin and and so we inherited the hackathon business and so the team had known each other and been working with together for like two years it's just the first time they've been invited to come up with their own purpose that was independent of the brand and yeah the the Chimera that was uh there was git coin and so um I thought it went really well of course it would have been different I am the CEO and like founder of of super modular and so I'd be curious if an outside facilitator had had done it versus like me had doing it but the the purpose we landed on was cultivating a more regenerative digital Frontier and um you know this podcast is part of that right we're talking about regenerative crypto economics on this podcast and so it was it was just kind of it was nice to to define a purpose and to just have like a small module that we were doing it for and um yeah so I have positive memories of it and I and anyone who's working in a dow that feels somewhat aimless I would I would encourage them to to do do this exercise as well yeah and I I'm really happy to hear that and you know just to talk a little bit more about this idea of essential intent because I don't want anyone to leave with the idea that all right well you just do this you know you do this one Workshop or whatever and you set the you write these things down and you're good forever no essential intent are designed such that it's part of an iterative strategy process so when I teach organizations how to do essential intent or do any sort of purpose work I try to embed that in at least like roughly a quarterly Cadence of coming back and looking at those essential intent and asking ourselves what have we learned that has either validated or it or invalidated any of these essential intent should we tweak any of them ideally you get to the point where you can say like hey actually we did this essential intent like let's retire this one like let's give it a little send off and let's do something let's figure out like what the next thing is so the essential intent are meant to give you structure for continually coming back to your strategy and making sure that you're always on that right path because the world around you know this is changing really rapidly and at least coming together quarterly to look at this stuff lets us have a a container to have the conversations that we need to have around prioritization mm-hmm yeah and so you know I'm wondering if you can if you could sort of paint us a picture of like how how is how how it started and how how it's going for some of the dowels that you've worked with like did you come into Dallas and there were tyranny of the structurelessness or totally hierarchical and then they become they become less orange and they become more teal uh they they seem to be more on the rails uh you know like what what are some signs of a good of an organization that's on track with with uh building a style operating system versus not on track yeah there's so there's so much and so many paths I could take that that question so it's going to be a little disorganized um so help help bring me back when I when I wander too far right um but the first thing that I remember thinking uh when I was first getting into the space you know over over a year ago in that at this point you know the first I don't even I don't even I honestly don't remember what Dao uh it was because I was just joining in and joining discords left and right trying to wrap my mind around like what is actually going on here and I finally got on a call for some doubt you know where they're ostensibly going to be talking about some some work that they were doing together so I finally got on a call and you know like 20 minutes in this call I was having this feeling of incredible Nostalgia because it felt exactly like most of my regular clients uh meetings in the sense that you know someone had maybe put together a couple of thoughts about what the agenda was and we were kind of sticking to it but not really we got a little bit sidetracked and spent like 20 minutes maybe talking about something that didn't seem particularly relevant so I had this moment of like oh this feels familiar which means I maybe have something to offer here because I think you know and that's not probably true for for all doubts but I would imagine some listeners uh right now have experienced meetings that didn't seem particularly structured for the moment that maybe they don't really have different structures for different types of meetings you know meetings that have different purposes all seem to have the same sort of structure that sort of thing so I guess early on I remember being like okay we maybe have have something to offer here because I wasn't sure you know coming in not knowing anything and knowing that the ready is good at helping organizations kind of change how they do things so that was a breath of fresh air at first which is kind of messed up to say that I was glad that this meeting was bad um but it just meant we get red I had stuff to do there um yeah it was familiar which is familiar in that and also in in the sense that like I've met I I have helped organizations get their meetings right like there are some like pretty set moves that can help organizations like not experience that anymore it's not hard it's it's simple but not easy I guess is the best way to say it doing things with default operating Rhythm and having certain types of meetings on certain types of cadences to hold the right conversations that we need to have like it's knowable work at least I would say it that way the other thing um though that I uh was was experiencing um and this is at the kind of the complete flip side of what I just said there about feeling very familiar is kind of that structure that that tyranny of structurelessness that kind of chaos um that can at least at that time really um describe what was going on in in these Dows I think it's useful to think about a Continuum with on one end is pure bureaucracy and on the other end is pure chaos and my career up until last year was really playing on the bureaucracy end of the Continuum and even some of the most Progressive kind of traditional organizations are still like past the halfway point probably on bureaucracy we can help them kind of move a little bit more towards that self-managing self-organizing side but it's still very much bureaucracy Dows were like completely on the other end like just nothing was bolted down everything was up for debate everything there was because there was there was no structure which in some ways is overwhelming and and what I eventually left with and what I continue to feel is that that is huge opportunity in most organizations in Legacy organizations there's no there's very little degrees of freedom like we have to scratch and Claw for the ability to do anything differently and it's a battle and at the end of the day you've maybe just moved a little couple of steps down that Continuum in doubt I think because there are there's so much degrees of freedom it can feel like well where do we even start like it's so overwhelming but the opportunity of like what you can bring to that that space is for people who care about making organizations more autonomous you know more self-managing is just really uh really exciting so I think the main thing and I think this will actually finally answer your question and we'll see here in a second the main thing I look for for an organization whether it's a Dao or a legacy organization to know whether or not they are on the right path is do they have any sort of cadence around disciplined experimentation so are they actually articulating experiments that they're trying within their organization or is it just pure chaos uh and then part of that discipline experimentation is actually extracting what we have learned from those experiments and either kicking off new experiments or bringing that same idea to other parts of of the organization and creating this Rhythm this heartbeat of experimentation that is actually being internalized back into the organization and not just spinning in chaos all the time and that looks like lots of different things whether you have a a routine a ritual of retrospection whether you have ways that teams can share what they are learning about best ways of working whether that sort of thing is um gains your reputation in a in a space or or honored things things like that is where where my head goes when I think about what a good OS looks like for a Dao yeah I'm sure that there's a lot of little little Milestones or signs that you're either on the happy path or wallowing into the abyss or uh you know there's there's probably a lot of different trajectories there and you probably get to see a lot of it because you see so many different inside so many different organizations yeah yeah for sure and and because yeah basically the path is it looks very different for each for each uh for each Organization for each style I mean if you think about you know putting a a canvas of 12 fields in front of uh any sort of organization especially one that has been functioning like okay for a while like different things are going to pop up in terms of where we should do um some work I mean a pattern that I've already kind of mentioned is that that purpose and strategy is often a place that that starts um but I think it's been really interesting a lot of our um our clients uh we don't ever really do anything with Mastery or compensation or really even membership because membership in a traditional organization is pretty clear like here's the hiring process here's how you get hired like maybe this is some onboarding stuff there that we can do to make it better but it's really clear but like membership is a very interesting Concept in a lot of dials like what does it mean to be in versus out or like when you're in what does that actually get you or are there love different levels of in and I know there's like juicy interesting things there same thing with compensation you know as well obviously that's a a whole um conversation that's ongoing in in this space so I appreciate the fact that the work that we do with Dows allows me to explore other parts of the canvas that I don't necessarily get to touch in my regular day-to-day work right so we'll have a list of a link to the operating system canvas in the show notes so that people can can check it out um I'm curious I'm curious if you could tell me a little bit about um consent based agreement as a mechanism for evolving organizations why consent based agreement why is that such an important mechanism yeah so when we talk about uh making decisions in organizations you can kind of think of it as consensus based decision making which is kind of the default in most organizations like we all before we make this decision we all need to agree this is the best way forward and we're gonna you know lock ourselves in this room until we can make this decision but there are other levels of agreement that you can get to to make a decision and one of those is is consent so you can think of consent as if we all have kind of a uh uh we will what we need the basically the the line that we're trying to get to is not that we all think this is the best course of action because that can be a pretty high line to get to a very narrow overlap that we have to uh reach as a team what we're trying to get to is an agreement that this path forward is safe to try and if you can agree on the fact that this proposal whatever it is that we're considering is safe to try then we can actually go and use it in the real world and get some real data about whether or not you know it was the right decision and we can always come back and and change it over time so bringing that idea of consent to the agreements that we have with each other in our organization has been really huge for how we work at the ready and how we think about kind of a really Progressive uh organizations and agreements by agreement I mean basically anything that you would potentially uh fight over uh fight with a colleague about so you know the way that we Define the roles in our organization could be an agreement an agreement could be um you know the the process that we use to to do a certain thing a policy that we have about how we spend a shared resource things like that so if you can move an organization in the direction of like noticing that there are agreements that we should probably probably codify and then we can use a consent based agreement kind of algorithm to align on these agreements and then do our best to actually live into these agreements and I think this is where there's some interesting things that Dows may have in their toolbox that traditional organizations don't which we can talk more about that's that's the basic idea around it and for what the ready did a few years ago is we figured out and so the way we've helped organizations do this is it's very high touch you know using something called integrative decision making it's this way of considering a proposal with a team and getting questions and incorporating reactions very high touch very time consuming is there a way to bake that into software so that teams can do that for themselves and do it in an asynchronous way which became even more important you know over over covet or at least where a lot of our traditional clients pre-dow work were having to wrestle with working remotely for the first time so we spun out a company called murmur which is building a product to do that and we're the biggest customer of murmur for running the ready uh itself so we have all of the agreements you know over a hundred of them that kind of dictate how the the ready works and we really believe that if you are subject to an agreement at the ready you have the opportunity to consent or not to that uh that agreement so that's the basic kind of theory or idea behind consent-based agreement making for articulating the operating system of an organization mm-hmm so I mean a couple things there that I just want to say back to you the um so it feels like 100 consents US is uh too high of a bar for most organizations about directions that are going to be taken and so in these governing bodies of Dao's having consent based decision making just means that like if something is safe enough to try then that's the bar that things that things clear which creates a permissive culture of innovation and so that's why consent based decision making is so important to you and then the second thing I heard was that murmur.com is a way of building a product around the work that you do at the ready in order to do Dao organization co-work and murmur kind of bakes in some of this consent-based decision making into its product yeah basically murmur will will walk you through how to make a consent based decision if you give it a proposal it'll and and who needs to consent to the proposal it'll kind of own the process of like right now we're just asking clarifying questions all right and now that round ends and the proposer answers the questions and then now we're just doing reactions and people are leaving advice on the proposal how to make it better and then that round ends and the proposer is answering the or incorporating those reactions and now it's checking uh four objections and if there are no objections then the proposal has passed and if there is an objection then the objector and the proposer are working together to to integrate that that objection and that's all living within uh the the software so that you don't need a facilitator you don't need to sit in a room for an hour you can let this process kind of run over the course of a week start a start over start a week on Monday with a kind of ill thought through proposal and by the end of the week have a really tight consent based uh decision that has been made by the people who who needed to consent to it um I'm sure your customers love you for uh making the number of meetings slightly less in their organizations ideally ideally hopefully we're not just like recreating like a I mean there's there's always an element of like oh there's a new tool in my in my uh kind of tool set that I have to get used to or there's I have to build in what is my rhythm for like checking to see whether there is an agreement that I need to ask questions about or react to so there are new habits to develop but I think they are smaller a smaller muscle movements than kind of sitting around in a in a meeting or or something like that mm-hmm right yeah well we'll see I mean we're we're you know we're they're building I mean so we have they they're not a uh okay we're the ready does not own them they're their own entity at this point we are just their their biggest customer and kind of evangelists out uh in in the world so I'm always happy you know if someone is curious about murmur I and my colleagues at the ready are great people to talk to uh about it but I think at the same time you know murmur is continuing to figure this out too like how do you how do you bring this idea that an organization should take the time and effort because it does take time and effort to actually capture these agreements that normally just kind of float in The Ether uh pun intended I guess uh or they're just implicit and doing that extra work of actually making the implicit explicit I think is really powerful but it's not necessarily obvious to folks until they've kind of lived under it for a little while so it's been an interesting challenge to kind of like help bring people along far enough that they get to start to actually feel the benefits and it doesn't just feel like a bunch of extra work I'm curious you know like if you take us forward 10 or 15 years in a world in which the ready and your work is maximally successful what does that world look like gosh I don't know if I I don't know if I'm if I can like think big enough I'm always so like focused in on kind of like all right the day-to-day like how am I gonna get this organization a little bit better a little bit better I mean I think I think the world of work becomes fundamentally different which is almost so obvious has to not be useful to to say I mean we talk about two primary principles that we try to bring to organizations so people positivity and complexity Consciousness so I think to answer that question I would just have to take each of those and like really get to the heart of what we're talking about there so with people positivity if if the ready is massively successful nobody should be going to a job or feeling like they have to work in an organization where their dignity as a human being is not honored and and celebrated which I think is like pretty like those are big words and big aspirations so I'm trying to I'm trying to like lean into your your question here but like I've I've experienced for myself and I've people that I love who have spent the majority of their lives going to shitty jobs that for whatever reason you know they they could not do something else for lots of good reasons and it was just their reality and I can't think of many things that are more depressing than than that basically signing yourself up for a lifetime of kind of slogging away at a at a an organization that doesn't recognize your dignity as a human being and I think the work that we try to bring to these organizations the one the one angle on it is the organizations that we work with um as the ready they should be better places for human beings by the time we're gone and sometimes that's only a little bit of a move and hopefully it can be a major move and if we're massively successful in 15 to 20 years maybe we've fundamentally changed that so most people feel like you know maybe maybe work will never be something that people actually um you know want to do all the time or anything like that but just I hope that there are far fewer people that feel like they are in soul sucking work conditions and then on the complexity conscious side of things I think more about how what that means is basically organizations really understanding the fact that they are complex systems and that complex system just fundamentally cannot be predicted and kind of planned and controlled the way a complicated system is and so much of the bureaucracy in our Legacy clients at least is the remnant of believing that they were simply complicated systems that if we got enough smart people together and we put them in a room they could design the optimal perfect system and it will always function well so I think the the flip side of that the complexity Consciousness is what does it look like for an organization that is really responsive and adaptive and able to react to what is happening in their environment in the appropriate way and that's you know that's there's so many different kind of things there and I think it's a little bit that one's a little bit less clear for me than the the people positivity one but there would not be any more of this bureaucratic theater it wouldn't be people would feel like they would be actually using their time on the most important work when they're working within organizations and I think that's relevant to Dallas too there are plenty of people who I've talked to who who spend all of their time working for for Dows and they don't necessarily feel like they're always using their time on the most important things there's lots of administrative stuff that can get spun up if in a dow um and I would hope that um that stuff goes away in in that kind of maximally successful 15 20 100 Year sort of situation hmm amazing um well we've got a few minutes left is there anything that I didn't ask that you want to say hmm no I don't I mean I don't think so I feel like I rambled enough if people want people want to know more I'm I'm on Twitter at least for at least right now I am I mean we'll see we'll see what continues to happen in the world of Twitter maybe that doesn't age well but right now I am um you know I I continue you know the ready continues to um you know invest in letting me kind of like hang out in in Dao land and not have to worry too much about you know bringing in Revenue to the ready so like if you're curious at all about anything like you're not signing yourself up for some sort of uh weird and aggressive sales push like I just like talking to people and I want to learn from more people who are thinking about org design stuff within uh within Dallas especially folks who have been in this space longer than than I have and I know there are lots of you out there I follow a lot of you on Twitter I try to interact with you but I would love to just have more conversations with people who are thinking about things like an operating system or org Design Within you know this new construct that we all that we all love yeah totally well that's that's a good segue into people finding you and maybe engaging with you in the ready so where do people find you in the ready online yeah so the ready is just the ready.com uh I'm uh I have a website samsperlin.com or just samsperlin on Twitter um that's probably the main places uh shoot me an email if you want Sam at the ready uh.com you can uh you it doesn't take doesn't take much to find me online great well you know um I think that uh we found you at a time in which Bitcoin was Reinventing itself and you were really useful relationship for us and so I I hope to pay it forward in that uh tens or maybe even hundreds of listeners can start to listen to your thoughts and help organize their dials in their communities in in a way that is much more functional so appreciate everything you've done Sam and likewise right back at you I appreciate kind of the the leap of faith I think that you kind of showed us letting it letting us come in and and do some of this work with with all of you um I'm very appreciative of that yeah yeah I think that we learned a lot so it was a fruitful engagement all right Samuel thanks so much for joining cool thanks for having me [Music]
