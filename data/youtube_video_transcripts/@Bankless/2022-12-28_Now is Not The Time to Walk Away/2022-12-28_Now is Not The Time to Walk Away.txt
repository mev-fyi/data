DC what if we made somebody so bullish they're like oh second mortgage I'm yoloing in they're just like all in is that what the way to do this first of all I'd say definitely don't borrow money to buy cryptocurrency certainly not at a bottom I mean because you never know where the bottom is rather than give advice to you I'm going to tell you what I'm doing I'm accumulating in a bigger addition to my ethereum Holdings over the course of the next at least one year probably up to two years if you're looking at this and you're saying hey I'm really excited about ether I would say start dollar costing averaging in the important thing I think is being consistent as Justin said over the 10-year time Horizon the full case for digital assets being ownable is absolutely massive I was talking to my neighbor and he was telling me how his daughter prefers to be paid in ether when she babysits she's like 14 years old and so I really think that paradigms are changing that doesn't happen overnight but it will happen over time you want to be here for that don't make the mistake now is not the time to walk away
