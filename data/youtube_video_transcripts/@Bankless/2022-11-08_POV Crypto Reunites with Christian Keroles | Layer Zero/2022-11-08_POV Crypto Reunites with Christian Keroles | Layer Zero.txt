welcome to layer zero layer 0 is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the Bitcoin community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto Community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because Bitcoin is people all the way down and always has been which might be an offensive statement to many of the bitcoiners and the reason why we're talking about Bitcoin today is because I have on my old co-host CK snarks of POV crypto so long time bankless listeners will probably have known about POV crypto but it was actually the podcast that I started with CK with the guest here before starting the bank list podcast uh P it was the the precursor podcast and POV crypto point of view crypto was me the ethereon and CK the bitcoiner and we also happen to be College friends so we were friends before we discovered Bitcoin and ethereum respectively uh and that allowed POV crypto to be a different kind of podcast in it got started in 2018 2019 and it was like a bear Market darling of a podcast if people loved it at the time and it was really because it was something different where two differing perspectives were able to come to the same place and sometimes like aggressively yell at each other yet still hug it out at the end of the show every single time and so it was a nice relief where it was a very important conversations about like the philosophical differences between Bitcoin and ethereum from two people that very much believed on each in each other's respective casts and so the fact that CK and I were College friends I went to his wedding uh and and we have you know we're friends and so we can yell at each other yet actually not it and then still be respectful and you can actually move the needle with conversations and so it hosted a lot of very important conversations I say in 2018 to 2020. um sin twins once a bull market started CK who is operations at BTC media Bitcoin magazine uh the the Bitcoin conference all that stuff uh and so once the bull market started I doubled down on Bank list he doubled down on BTC media but we've always kept in touch of course uh as our respective ecosystems has built out it's been a year since we have recorded and so this is the reunion of POV crypto so for the long time POV crypto fans sorry for going over a year without recording an episode I hope you enjoy this one though uh because we have a lot to catch up on but without further Ado we'll get into the conversation with the CK snarks right after we can talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure

for bankless listeners that don't know who are you I'm the general manager of Bitcoin magazine but uh David and I are old friends from college days and uh we're we kind of were partners in crime for a while we started both of our careers in the Bitcoin and crypto space uh doing a podcast together called POV crypto yeah the PV crypto pod was like I think it was the uh there were definitely other podcasts that were a big deal like Laura shins podcast was a big deal but I think we kind of like dominated the 2018 to 2020 bear market in terms of just like we had we had good listenership but also just like who listened to POV crypto as I think uh it was an interesting set of people uh for again for the listeners who don't know you want to describe POV crypto and how it came to be and what it was so pretty much David and I kind of started our careers with similar ish uh perspectives on the market uh David was a lot more into the blockchain ecosystem really into ethereum you're mining ethereum uh I was already pretty captivated by Bitcoin uh and I've since become more captivated by Bitcoin and I don't know we we tried and failed to do a podcast one time and then we kind of just started I was like November 2018. I think late 2018. I think we tried and start I tried to do the first episode like two times like two or three times two or three times and then we did it like the fourth time and we're like this still wasn't what we wanted but at some point we were like we just have to ship a goddamn episode so we just needed the episode and like got like 15 lessons or something yeah I think it was just her friends but pretty much pretty much the whole point was like I was the bitcoiner David was the etherean and like we were gonna talk about the market what we saw uh you know we felt like these communities were already very siled um and they were really talking at each other on Twitter a lot so we were kind of the only Forum that I feel like had honest conversation with uh with both perspectives respectfully over an extended period of time yeah yeah I think that's right the way I describe Poe crypto is like during the 2018 to 2020 bear Market there wasn't the communities that you see today like there was just Bitcoin and ethereum like there were there were like other like bull market like ecosystems that all went away during the bear market and like basically all that was left was Bitcoin and ethereum like all the people that like were bullish on public private key cryptography and some sort of crypto system the only people that were left were like Bitcoin and ethereum and these communities couldn't talk to each other because none of them were friends they were just like too ideologically like separated and so like that's where we had the privilege of like being College friends yet one of us was the ethereum one of us was the bitcoiner we made POV crypto because we were the only two people that could come together and like argue with honest arguments and so we had like these hour long we call them like fight nights uh we also did interviews but basically we were the place where like the Bitcoin perspective and the ethereum perspective met yeah no totally and uh we had awesome guests on and it was a very unique setting because like David would bring in the cream of the ethereum space and I would just drill them with all the questions that like bitcoiners would want to ask them and then vice versa I would bring on like uh someone who's pushing forward Bitcoin in a big way a developer uh you know a an entrepreneur in the space and you know David like well why not this why this won't work that kind of stuff uh and I thought you know one it was fun but uh I thought you know we really added something unique to the ecosystem yeah yeah it was like okay so there was like the Bitcoin episodes the Bitcoin podcasts and then there was there was the ethereum podcasts they made maybe there was actually only two of us and two of them there was ours and then also into The Ether but like the difference was that when we would do an ethereum interview we would bring on an ethereum guest we would also have a bitcoiner and like vice versa yes uh and and so you would and and be and because we did so many episodes we got we were into like two almost episodes like 200 episodes yeah so our listeners got to like kind of know us and know our perspectives and saw kind of like the character development of the actual episode of the conversation and you would see where like the ethereum influence would influence you and you would see the Bitcoin influence influence me in our thinking but we also like never wavered from our positions until to this day to this to this day yeah and so it's been like a year or so since we've recorded a podcast uh a little bit less than a year it's been a little bit less than a year uh and it was like it really kind of things started to pause when slow down when uh the bull market started like the Bitcoin communities and the ethereum communities we were in the same spot during the 2018 to 2020 bear market like the Bitcoin communities and the ethereum communities very different communities but they were still together right it was like we were still on crypto Twitter interacting with each other even though we were different communities and then as soon as like the bull market happened like the bitcoiners did their own thing like we diverged as communities I'd say would you agree with that take I mean I I always like a little bit more yes and no I definitely knew that that was very much your perspective uh you know this time last year uh but at the same time I think it's fair to say that like these communities are still definitely um you know rubbing up against each other in a big way although like let's just call it like the ethereum only ecosystem and then the Bitcoin only ecosystem have definitely both developed a lot um you know back in the day there was just crypto and blockchain conferences now there's you know very specific Gatherings very specific um meetups you know all of these things definitely have defined themselves and become more independent for sure so I I want to definitely get into uh like since since it's been a year and a little bit more since like the POV crypto was really at its height uh we want to kind of reflect on like all right who who was right because that was the whole point of the episode or the podcast was like one of us was right and one of us was wrong and it could only be one right that was kind of the air of the podcast that was the vibe that was I don't know how true that is though well so yeah so let's ask that question because I think you and I do agree on like uh there's going to be one blockchain two that's going to be the winner like that sits in the throne and there was another there was an argument that I remember having on Twitter where I think it was West Coast Waka shout out west coast Waka who's always been with us ever since the beginning uh we were they were like uh how do you know oh who's right in the end and we both agreed like market cap market cap is the determining Factor do you still do you still align with that well I definitely think that the journey every metric and every sacred cow is going to like get challenged you know across the spectrums um as more intense and malicious actors uh you know with lots of capital come in you know I don't know if market cap or any specific metric is like the key metric I think the the what what matters at the end is where is economic activity happening and and what I think you why it makes sense that there's going to be one settlement layer for global economic activity and we're going to consolidate around whatever works the best for a number of reasons many of which a lot of people know about many of which are a noble to this point but um because of efficiency so right now there is massive inefficiencies in the the Wild and massive like in like not connectediveness uh like the financial system is very very fragmented and I think what is going to happen is I think governance is going to become way less unified I definitely believe in the sovereign individual thesis but that's going to be enabled by using a lot of shared common Tech similar to I think it's going to be the Bitcoin blockchain but let's just call it one global settlement layer for the world you know almost like that you don't have to trust that person in order to settle value with them like that's what having one Global blockchain does right okay so so you do believe in like one uh the dominance of one ecosystem in the long term yeah yeah I mean Humanity requires yes like we that we need this to move forward like right now there's just too much uh it's it's difficult to make economic calculation right so um I think that this is an economic advancement on the levels of the world converging on gold or I mean much much but greater than that but uh it's gonna bring about an enormous amount of efficiency gain productivity gains uh and capital allocation improvements if we can uh you know gather around one and I think that we will because we we need it right and so like 100 percent I 100 agree there's like one if there's one single standard if there's one Global coordination focal point where we all like hey this is what we use to coordinate that's that is the point of crypto and I I think one of the reasons why people resonated with POV crypto is because like a lot of the same stuff we have we agreed on a lot of stuff like we have very similar principles and I think where we disagree is like the execution of that like how that actually manifests and so like that that's kind of like why we could come together a POV crypto because like so much of our foundation Foundation about like why this stuff is important is the same thing but you think it's expressing Bitcoin and I just think it's expressed in ethereum yeah I mean I I don't know if we necessarily have the same vision for the future but I think part of the show too is you can also look into our base assumptions on life our political perspectives and that kind of thing and then see how that's reflected in you know how we look at the the crypto ecosystem um so I mean I don't want to get into like too much of like generalizing but I would definitely say like even when I was in high school and I didn't even understand politics like you know take like a stupid test and be like yeah you're a Libertarian you know like that that was like kind of always part of my character um and then you know obviously you know you know you can describe your own political leanings but I do think that it was interesting to kind of just see how yes Bitcoin crypto that changes your world view a lot but it's also really colored by what you already believe is like how the world works and I think that was definitely something that we explored at POV crypto where we talked about like people's ideological backgrounds and like how they kind of would naturally find themselves in one ecosystem or the other definitely um I started off very very liberal and then since getting into crypto I found myself going just more moderate definitely more conservative but not conservative holistically but yeah I would say like coming into the crypto world it was an interesting exploration of just like all right who are you as a person and what values do you have and how does crypto Express those values and that was the other thing that was interesting uh on POV was like all of we had a mix of listeners right we had the Bitcoin listeners and we had the ethereum listeners and all the ethereum listeners were like that seek hey guy just rubs my rubs my just rubs me the wrong way man that can't stand that guy and like all the bitcoiners would tell go to you and be like that David guy that guy's an idiot man people will be like how can you guys be friends like bro you guys are so sad like come on you can't disagree with someone I think that maybe that is a reflection of the times but yeah you know yeah I mean people like if you can't disagree and then still respect someone like do you even know them right that's what that's why I think people like really listen to POV crypto and like really appreciated it because like it was it was the conversations that a lot of people wanted need to have but no one could do it in a way that wasn't like disrespectful for some for some reason I mean even at times I would get disrespectful yeah but we both we both would but we would also like not let it interfere with the conversation yeah no I mean you know it would cool cool back at the end all right good show talk to you tomorrow that kind of thing who's gonna edit this one blah blah blah yeah yeah no I remember like my wife with you know then fiance but now wife you know she would always like clown me like man you must have had a really even episode because I could hear you all the way in the kitchen there was a lot of yelling yeah the the names Fight Night episodes were definitely true to their name um all right so we do do we want to like recap uh the reflect on the year thus far since we haven't done a POV crypto episode in a year yeah man what a wild bear market so do well also bull market right so yeah did so say we we stopped and we stopped doing POV stuff in like uh 2020 ish maybe so we were like doing it two to three times a week up until 2020 all of 2021 it was like two episodes here two episodes here two episodes here that kind of thing uh and then you know just shy of a year ago it was like our last episode so did the 20 because there was this air on POV crypto that like the bull market will return we we were Trials of the 2017 bull market POV crypto was a bear Market podcast yeah uh but it was always under the assumption like okay the bull market will return once again and then it did uh and then like you double down on bitcoin media I double down on Bank lists um did if we want to put ourselves back in the shoes of like 2018 to 2020 Christian and David uh did the 2021 2022 bull market go how you expected it to go I would say yes and no uh this is something we were talking about yesterday like as the bitcoiner the way to have made the most amount of USD or SAS or whatever would definitely have been to listen to David like there's no question there um but on the flip side like the bull market push forward Bitcoin adoption in an insane way like you know we we now have Bitcoin playing on the the playing Ground of nation states I mean in you know that's opening the door for a lot of crypto to happen as well um and we're also you know we're seeing uh Bitcoin mining being integrated into energy infrastructure in a very quick way like I I think that real Bitcoin adoption definitely aligned with my perspective of of the bull market um but if you're just like you know trying to make as much USD trying to make in let's just assume not even trading just like you're participating in this market like I definitely think back then there's very clear answer there so know sure you know and I'm on my end like bitcoin's supposed to give you peace of mind so like if you understand the protocol you understand the system you understand the end result like how could you not have peace of mind so uh being working in the space where you know I'm fully aligned with my ideology and my vision for the future like that's increased my earning power an enormous amount obviously I own more Bitcoin now than I you know ever thought possible but at the same time like it is what it is you know being on the being on the alpha end of the cantalon effect is I would describe it it's definitely really [ __ ] lucrative there's no question about that uh to explain that metaphor the alpha end of the cantalon effect you're saying that ethereum is where issuance occurs and so if you're on the ethereum ecosystem you have the net effects of the cantalon effect yeah well so the candle on effect is this idea that uh if you're closer to where the money or the assets or the whatever is being issued and you get it first then you have a lot to gain and people get it last you know get let you know they gain less or they're even maybe uh on the on the short they get the short end of the stick um so yeah I mean you're not creating Assets in Bitcoin and like really it's just like there's there's Le there's not that much Alpha in uh in being a part of the it's like in like like the alpha is not the same as like hey I can be an Insider in ethereum and I can understand where the trends are going and I can get tokens that you know will appreciate or whatever get speculated on uh it's almost like people like people like I want to buy Bitcoin so that way I can get the next airdrop right like a hundred a thousand percent of that activity all went to ethereum like they haven't stopped being even a thing in Bitcoin I do yeah I do remember that during 2017 one of the things you were saying in our group chat was like Bitcoin pays dividends because Bitcoin would keep on getting forked and forked and forced that didn't that did not I mean it did get Fork just the forks stopped being valuable yeah like no it stopped being relevant yeah uh which is good for Bitcoin and what do you mean oh because the Bitcoin meme is more dominant yeah I just showed like hey you can't just Fork this thing sure yes yeah not successfully but then I would say okay so yes a lot of that same energy of like the desire to Fork the desire to create new assets then got captured by ethereum right so like the Bitcoin Fork phenomenon like kind of was the same thing a similar thing to like the ethereum D5 summer like uh for fork and fair launch phenomenon like same kind of deal yeah yeah I mean I would just summarize it down to uh it became the PlayStation tokens and there's a lot of alpha to became if you know you can uh if you can have you can be on the right side of that so I can't remember I I think this was true but uh and during the POV era days I think you kind of thought that like ethereum would just like go to zero and if not you then like a large percentage of the bitcoiners that we had out of guests would be like yeah all of you eat heads like sorry your blockchain is eventually going to not work and be gone in the future do you still believe that um so I would say I've always had like a I've always had an independent thought in terms of like the crypto ecosystem although very heavily influenced by uh Bitcoin intellectuals um I never thought that like ethereum was like heading straight to zero but I did think that on a long enough time Horizon it's going to continue to depreciate against Bitcoin uh still true right now but at the same time still way too early to see um personally wait so you you currently you still think that ether will Trend towards zero in Bitcoin terms over the long term well I think that ether is just like every other asset in the world which all of them will Trend towards zero and Bitcoin terms okay so you're you're you are a hyper bitcoiner hyper bitcoinization ER I mean yeah we we must move towards a world where we have a unified uh settlement layer for Value that's uncorruptable I think Bitcoin is the best technology to do that and I think that there's many layers in which Bitcoin has enormous advantages and implementing itself as that uh as that settlement layer so like for that to be true therefore all other assets that store value will Trend to zero in Bitcoin terms like I I 100 still believe that and so there's there's nothing about the 2021 bull market that made you question that idea no no no no at all even so like even the so like we'll say that like the 20 I'm gonna claim that ethereum won the 2021 bull market do you agree with that like if like if the yeah there was there was a bull market there was an event ethereum dominated it and like categorically like Solana didn't win Avalanche didn't win Bitcoin didn't win ethereum won um so I've said this on POV crypto I think like the whole crypto ecosystem is part of Bitcoin right yeah so I think you remember that line yeah so with that perspective like Bitcoin had to gain from from the world getting onboarded into the ux of leveraging crypto into understanding that there can be value um that is on a public Ledger and like the world is getting educated we're at no matter what anyone says okay we're at less than one percent adoption right just world population people who actually are using and understand Bitcoin and crypto less than one percent adoption so that means 99.9 of the planet needs to go from like not understanding this stuff at all and being on the Fiat mindset and they have to transition all the way to bitcoin so like that is going to be a messy process that is a long process uh people will be making mental errors and mental Mis and uh Mis uh assessments on the way to Bitcoin in my opinion so like of course like they have to love nfts and all this other stuff that's like on the way to this very kind of extreme and different future that Bitcoin like a hyper Bitcoin nice standard would have so I don't like okay in the short run could you have made a lot more money if you're in the crypto Space versus Bitcoin only definitely but in the long run I don't know if that is actually an indication of like who won I would say like the things that got the most Mass Appeal to the most fiat-minded people are like yeah nfts that's the big okay the biggest number one winner is nfts because like that everyone wants to do that but like guess what what everyone wants to do right now like in a world that's not a Bitcoin crypto world it's not what everyone is going to want to do when the like the kind of like the games are changed everyone's playing on a different playing field so I think we're still living in Fiat land so yeah hey you know on the S curve of adoption while we're over here at the bottom of the S you know there's gonna be a lot of volatility there's gonna be a continued misallocation of capital so I already you know I already gave my Spiel like if you wanted to make the most amount of money in this past bull market you should have listened to David but I I don't think that that is like uh I don't think I think it's way too early to say winners and losers and I mean Bitcoin Advanced an enormous amount so I know what do you think I I I I feel like you've been asking me questions obviously they're interviewing me but uh what do you think uh how did you respond to that so I think the the bull market that happened uh as soon as the bull market started like the the Paradigm that we were used to we as an ethereans that were on crypto Twitter the Paradigm that we were used to was like we fight with bitcoiners we definitely think we're right uh when the bull market starts people are gonna people are gonna resonate with ethereum more than they will resonate with Bitcoin uh and it went from like the as like in D5 summer like D5 summer like the ethereum app layer grew significantly even though ether price didn't and then The Ether price started to respond aggressively at the end of D5 summer into 2021 like January 2021 I went from like 700 to like 1500 broke through all-time Highs at that moment in time the collective ethereum community that had stuck around during the bear Market I think mentally claimed Victory as in like we we all the arguments came through in ethereum's favor in a big way and also at the same time like going in through 2022 no 2021 like we as a community stopped caring about the Bitcoin Maxes takes on Twitter like don't remember the whole like Supply gate the East Supply gate from Pierre Richard like stuff like that like oh you don't know what the total supply of ether is and we were we just like were face palming at that except it was such a big deal because the bitcoiners had dominated crypto Twitter for so long and did at that point but we were like face problems like this is a dumb argument that No One's Gonna care about in the future and like I do believe that that was the right take uh and uh other along with other things about like the the takes that bitcoiners had about ethereum as soon as mainstream adoption came around like uh I don't I think the bitcoiner like memes and narratives and like lessons just did not resonate with them as much and so we stopped paying attention to like fighting with the bitcoiners because we actually became like as an ecosystem as a community concerned with Solana and Avalanche and like we actually learned that it wasn't Bitcoin that was going to be the hard fight it would be people forking ethereum and spinning up at the this new ethereum killers in the same way Bitcoin had Bitcoin killers in 2017 like it was turns out the actual the bigger fights that we had to deal with were scale like like our own problems like ethereum turns out it was our it was our own issues that we needed to fight with not like a public perception about Bitcoin versus ethereum so like the bigger fights that we had during 2021 were like Solana Avalanche uh Tara uh and so like as a community we kind of just like stopped thinking about Bitcoin because we don't we didn't really consider it like a threat to the ecosystem and again this is coming from the perspective of people who think that there's going to be one dominant blockchain that will ultimately win which both you and I think this probably is is true uh and so from the ethereum perspective like yeah Bitcoin is just like significantly less relevant than it once was I mean Bitcoins chronically chronically underappreciated and chronically chronically uh I guess like talk down to or uh you know bitcoin's the underdog so uh that's that's a pretty comfortable position for me is betting on the underdog Bitcoin is the underdog is like a crazy thing to have said if you have said that like on POV crypto like two years ago so I don't I don't think like Bitcoin in terms of like its place in the ecosystem is the underdog I think it's 100 dominate across what matters I think Bitcoin in the minds of the populist has has almost always been you know written off and the underdog like mainstream media has been very happy to be like bitcoin's not going to happen but d5's interesting blockchain's interesting it's always been like this other thing is interesting so it you know you can win this like little battle here which is like convincing people that are so far away from what I think is like the future to like like your thing but I don't think that that actually matters for the future so what do you what do you what's your take on uh tornado cash and the fact that the biggest government in the world made something on ethereum illegal and I'll Echo Nick Carter's uh uh words from Nick Carter where he said like because of this like you know that ethereum is like over the target as in like uh it's on to something when a big nation-state feels threatened by something like tornado cash and actually bans it and so Nick Carter said like ethereum is now like this spearhead of the cypherpunk movement and like and I see this in stark contrast to bitcoin where like I I called Bitcoin like impotent because it's just like not a threat it's just like Bitcoin it's just like it's got this this thing that happens yeah it's written off you you say you love it but I say like yeah it's because like it's just if you want to be a threat you want to threaten the nation say and if you are it's because you will be super high yeah definitely in threatening the nation-state that's why is the thing that is being attacked most by The Narrative I mean I don't think that it's mutually exclusive I think that nation states want centralized control anything that gets made like any sort of volume and traction that you know doesn't that that takes away from that like they're gonna attack so like I can view ethereum as like a if inefficient more censorship resistant no kyc exchange and then if you frame it that way then okay well there's been plenty of exchanges that become illegal and attacked by the government that's still part of the Bitcoin ecosystem like okay you came up with the ux that like got on their radar they attacked it like that's great that's like saying like this is now the spearhead of the cypherpunk movement like it's [ __ ] ridiculous can you I think you'll have to explain to the listeners like why if something like ethereum is inside of the Bitcoin ecosystem can you explain that perspective okay well firstly like Bitcoin is what started this ecosystem sure secondly like ethereum and all other chains like relied on bitcoin to even get bootstrapped the proof of work was the very first thing that can enable a decentralized currency everything else was either directly or indirectly built off of that existence I don't think that that can be argued with but beyond that like all of these things are interoperable with each other like I see exchanges as layers on top of Bitcoin I see the app layers you know whether they're centralized decentralized whatever like whatever their server architecture they're either directly or indirectly plugging into Bitcoin and I just see ethereum like the best way I could describe ethereum is like a it's almost like this giant app layer for crypto that is much less efficient than a centralized one AKA you can call it a BMB or an FTX or Solana but much more censorship assistant and much more permissionless and it provided kyc free activity like those are the things that it solved for there's a lot of ways where it like it's obviously independent and it's done its own thing since it's bootstrap of Bitcoin but I don't see it as being outside of like this layering of like the crypto enabled ecosystem and at the heart of that the only thing that like is not fully manipulated by Fiat even though it is still slightly manipulated by Fiat is the is the price of Terror like the the the energy conversion into Bitcoin ratio like that to me like that is like that is like the root of all of this stuff so that's definitely still true in my opinion okay so your perspective is like uh there's um you have Bitcoin as as the base layer you have ethereum as a layer on top of that you have Bitcoin proof of work as the thing that grounds Bitcoin into the real world that's outside of Fiat systems then you have Bitcoin then you have ethereum then you have the ethereum app layer and all the other and then all the other varies like and then you go up the stack and you get into the [ __ ] coins as you go further up the stack I mean up sideways around you know maybe maybe instead of like a root or layers maybe it's like uh it's like a solar system you know with like just stuff orbiting around it but uh I mean I don't know that's uh it's definitely my perspective I think it's a unique perspective I don't I don't think that most bitcoiners think that way and you know to the ethereans or eth heads who'd be like what a crazy [ __ ] like eth had been writing off Bitcoin and had in my opinion incorrect uh world view and and perspectives on how Bitcoin is is changing the world so of course you're not going to get it how is Bitcoin changing the world uh it's changing the world in terms of it's creating that settlement layer it is creating a monetary uh it's creating a monetary ecosystem where you can count like this divided by 21 million like it's that is like that's the ultimate goal is being able to count and price things right this is the meme of infinity over Bitcoin Infinity over 21. just yeah the human world divided by itself everything divided by 21. yeah it is literally it's as simple as a system that you can count that is it we live right now in a system where we're trying to allocate Capital where no one can effing count um and then and then on top of that and this might be even bigger than the sound money Revolution AKA a system where you can actually count is Bitcoins place in the energy infrastructure like we're seeing how wrecked our energy infrastructure is in the world how inefficient it is how corrupt it is uh how political forces uh are attacking it how uh just narratives the whole thing is just it doesn't work and and Bitcoin is like it grounds the world and energy the the money monetary system and energy it also does an amazing thing to the energy system which is it becomes the the buyer of First Resort and the buyer of Last Resort and it is geographically independent you can plug it in you know connect to the network from anywhere and that just never existed before the closest thing that almost existed like that is being able to smelt aluminum uh but even still like that's like you can't do that on the level of hey I'm just going to cap this one methane flare in this random field mine Bitcoin like you that requires an enormous amount of unexportable energy uh in a very specific place so like Bitcoin is a thousand if you think of like Bitcoin proof of work as an improvement on being able to export energy via aluminum smelting like it's a million x Improvement you can set it up anywhere and you can ship the you can export the energy with Bitcoin to a liquid Market anywhere with no physical constraints so I mean between like revolutionary or energy grid which is something that we need to do it is huge in between creating a monetary system that's uncorruptable You Can Count like that's a lot and I don't know what world you guys are living in but that is those are two massive problems in the world right now yeah I mean bankless listeners will know that I kind of think almost every single Bitcoin or over indexes on like how strong the relationship between Bitcoin and energy is I don't know if you want to go into that or not do you want to go into that I mean look around like energy producers big and smaller getting into it so right but it's like Bitcoin and proof of work is a boon to energy producers at the cost of bitcoin and so like all of it because Bitcoin when you produce energy you are able to mine Bitcoin and then sell Bitcoins to pay for the cost of producing that energy so energy production gets cheaper and then also Bitcoin that and that the reason why it gets cheaper is because you can sell Bitcoins to subsidize it and so it pulls away the value of Bitcoin and then it adds value to the energy grid so the energy is good for the world man it's not about the cantalon effect oh sorry it's not about insiders being able to hold on to their coins it's not about maximizing value for right whatever Bitcoin is about making the world a better place making energy the cost of itself value comes out of Bitcoin to pay for energy not true that's 100 true that's what you miners mind the Bitcoin they consume energy to do that they receive the Bitcoins and then they sell the Bitcoins to pay for their business value leaves Bitcoin and it goes into the energy energy grid the energy infrastructure so Bitcoin is a mechanism to bootstrap out better energy infrastructure I don't know at the cost of itself no I think that that's just a healthy ecosystem like yes there is selling that has to happen of Bitcoin like there has to be a bigger there has to be a bigger Market of buyers like that is part of like let's just zoom out really quick Bitcoin is binary in my opinion right which means that the incentives work or the incentives don't work so if bitcoin's incentives are flawed AKA miners are going to Leach onto it and then bury the system which is what you're saying yep okay the incentives don't work okay but I don't think that that's the case I think the incentives work and if the incentives work then miners will Bitcoin will help energy infrastructure bootstrap and improve across the planet Bitcoin is going to become literally at the center of all energy infrastructure across the planet Bitcoin buyers are going to increase as they see Bitcoin becoming a greater and greater part of the real world that is 100 needed to make any of this stuff that we're enjoying and leveraging in the modern world possible and it's going and it's going to increase some buyers we're at less than one percent adoption right now there's only 21 million Bitcoin like if you actually think through what adoption looks like I'm not concerned the miners can sell the Bitcoin actually we need that that's called healthy distribution of coins that's how you actually create a monetary system that's fair there's a reason why the world converged around uh you know metals because metals are everywhere on the planet they're distributed they're not just in one spot so I think that the distribution of coins is is actually a healthy part of bitcoin's incentive structure like you need that yes yeah it's it's good for it's good for distribution the equal and opposite net effect of that is that it actually creates socialization in security but we'll go down that path uh later look I I just think that the way that you're analyzing these systems are just wrong I know I know it's just yours you're you're you're like hey that's going to create centralization here like I don't think that you fully understand the Bitcoin system in all of my years

miners right now the Argo or whatever like go through at the beginnings of like being able to like not make ends meet and go through consolidation as the inefficient miners get washed out by the efficient Miners and like Yay like miners are becoming more efficient through the bear Market as the inefficient ones like burnout but that's just centralization of security but that's also not the point I want to make okay wait no hold on so the largest miners in the world the ones that have been centralizing A6 they're all going under and they're selling their Asics for pennies on the dollar to whoever is willing to buy them so that's a distribution effect that's actually that is the destruction of centralization hey you only you either get the distribution and decentralization of BTC the asset or you get the decentralization of Bitcoin security you don't get both those are I disagree with that because your assumption is that Bitcoin mining there's only benefici benefits to uh in scale so like the benefits in having large scale the economies of scale that's the phrase you you only think that Bitcoin mining equals economies of scale period correct I think like Bitcoin mining is a very complex ecosystem that economies of scale are not the only element to that and that there's actually in many use cases there's a diseconomy of scale like if you want to use Bitcoin Miners and and collect their waste heat there's a diseconomy of scale to that because you can only use so much heat in one place and then all of a sudden heat becomes an issue then you have to spend energy and resources to get rid of that heat so if you want to use Bitcoin mining heat to power a greenhouse well like there's an efficient size of a greenhouse and there's a standard you know Market delivered uh scale that makes sense and then all like Bitcoin mining is an Energy Efficiency catalyst so anywhere where you need Energy Efficiency Bitcoin mining is going to help there so there's actually this economy of scale because not everyone is located in the same place not everyone needs that efficiency in the same place so I disagree completely with your assessment of I think that's how the mining works and Order consequence like it doesn't upset the rule like it's perhaps it slows it down but it still doesn't break the rule at one dollar of capital produces certain amount of hash like X number of hashes and then ten dollars of capital produces more than ten dollars of cap of hashes so the thing that breaks that rule is that energy in specific quantity is not located in the central place people needing or could benefit from the energy efficiencies are not located in one place so unless you think the whole world is converging on a geography like that's the beautiful thing about Bitcoin mining it's it's geographically independent it hits it just hits the geographies entity independent okay well you know I've yet to see an entity take over so there's literally zero history of the game theory not working uh okay I want to go back to the point that I I wanted to make in the first place before we go down we went down like the energy thing yeah the this and go this goes back to um Bitcoin miners uh mine Bitcoin cost some energy sell their Bitcoins to pay for the costs and that I'm I'm saying that that is a transfer of value from Bitcoin to the energy grid I think what you're saying is that people who will they'll see Bitcoin being integrated into the energy you create across the world Bitcoin will be like baked into the energy system so well that people just notice that and it'll be beneficial to bitcoin and they're noticing it like it will be continue to get pressed in like Bitcoin will be important a bullish thing to be integrated into the energy grade that's the point I want to make is that like I can't think of anything more bullish than that no because it's this one it's this it's one way transfer of value from Bitcoin into the energy system and if Bitcoin continues to like go up in market cap then the energy system can get better but it's always a one-way Street and so the only way that value goes back into Bitcoin is if people like just appreciate that fact and but it's not a codified mechanism so there's this codified mechanism of Bitcoin gets sold to pay for energy and there is no equal and opposite codified mechanism where value goes back into Bitcoin other than just like the valence of like positive perception of it being around the energy grid when people research it and they see that Bitcoin only gets sold to pay for energy that's not like the perception that you want that's bearish and so people aren't going to appreciate Bitcoin more because they don't want to be the bag holder it's because all the miners are able to dump their Bitcoins to pay for their energy like it's not a good Association it's it's a negative association I think that if you're trying to sell an investment scheme to people then maybe that you can make that argument if you're trying to make the world a better place if you're trying to create an economic system that integrates into the planet and helps humans economically coordinate and manage their energy then it's gonna be okay but but like Bitcoin I don't know what else to tell you but Bitcoin doesn't work if it doesn't go up in price like it has to go up in price look bitcoin's incentive work or they don't if the incentives work I think it's going to be the most competitive money on the planet and it'll continue to out compete and it will reach hyper bitcoinization if the incentives don't work it's going to zero I hope you got some guns and bullion because we got some big ass problems in front of us um maybe ethereum can escape that uh that dichotomy I I just I don't know like whenever you're like hey guess what like the miners it doesn't work pretty much what you're saying is I don't think the incentives are going to work into the future and my response to that would be well if you pay attention to what's going on obviously that Dynamic isn't that you're describing is not the actual Dynamic secondly there is continuing to be increased people who have faith have comfort want to continue to hold and accumulate this asset greater than the miners being able to sell and then on top of that if that stops then Bitcoin will break so I mean maybe you should diversify like I've always been a proponent to like hey if you're actually bullish enough on bitcoin you never have to fully leverage yourself against Bitcoin like you can be comfortable in your life you can hold other assets because one Bitcoin is going to be worth an insane amount of money the whole point is you need to get Bitcoin from the beginning of the s-curve to the other side any amount literally any amount that you can buy on this side if we retype or bitcoinization we'll be more will be an insane amount of money on the other end because it's a fixed Supply currency that's also technology so if we go from less than one percent adoption to 99 adoption and then on top of that Bitcoin is a better system theoretically because you can count and it helps with the energy grid so theoretically it will help us create more value then any amount that you own right now the getting it to the other side is going to make you insanely wealthy um so you can like you don't have to be over indexed against Bitcoin you don't have to put yourself in a position where if the economic assumptions don't work if the game theory doesn't work that you're wrecked like that's bad Personal Finance in my opinion so I mean like hey if you if you you could argue with me that bitcoin's incentives don't work until you're blue in the face I will just keep telling you that the history doesn't show that all the trends moving forward doesn't show that and I don't think that ethereum like onboarding people onto public key cryptography and and signing with your with your private keys and putting value in Internet protocols I don't actually think that that takes away from Bitcoin like I just think we need to onboard 99 of people like there's not one way to onboard them all because they all have different base assumptions on how the world works so actually it's a benefit to bitcoin that someone can be like hey I'm gonna take a system similar to bitcoin I'm going to change the Dynamics a little bit to make it fit my world view a little bit and and maybe that will attract more people to the space like most people are not aligned to the Future view of where bitcoin's taking us obviously because Bitcoin is a paradigm shift if everyone was aligned with it then it like it wouldn't be that big of a deal because everyone's was mentally able to deal with that but guess what before we had electricity only Nikola Tesla saw the future right like you asked the average person hey is electricity getting a big deal like what's that but once it became a thing they couldn't lay down the fiber fast enough they couldn't lay down the lines fast enough because it was a game changer it's undeniable so I just think that's what Bitcoin is does Bitcoin work if it's not the number one most valued crypto asset definitely yeah yeah and if anything like that's coming 100 percent something is going to flip Bitcoin well I mean bitcoin's already not the biggest currency in the world so like does it matter if that there's a bigger currency that is a cryptographic one like I could definitely see like a stable coin flipping Bitcoin soon like does that mean because like they're partially like settled on ethereum that ethereum is flipping Bitcoin like I don't necessarily know like I think like every single sacred cow that's why the framing of like a market cap it's like like that yeah Bitcoins have always hated the market the market cap yeah I mean but regardless like every sacred cow is going to be broken all the way to hybrid bitcoinization in my opinion wait so if we are in hyper bitcoinization is Bitcoin the largest money market by market yeah and the end result but like on the way there yeah going from zero you know less than one percent adoption and 99 you know to 100 adoption there's just a lot of confusion like there's gonna be a lot of experimentation do you remember H the HD DVD versus Blu-ray debacle and then guess what actually got my mainstream adoption digital right streaming like the consumer was wrong the whole time they were wrong the whole time so like hey you know did did video did streaming you know did it matter to streaming that DVD HD DVD and Blu-ray are all bigger at one point didn't matter at all I think the the biggest difference between you and I ethereans and bitcoiners is like we all agree like there's a paradigm shift that's coming we just don't agree on what that Paradigm Shift actually is yeah I agree with that and so like my big paradigm shift is that we can take human systems that we have already created throughout history that we've been recreating throughout history and make them better uh and that the better form factor is like a much much much better but it's still the same thing that we've already had so like the Dutch East India Company in in in the Netherlands and then then the Delaware LLC in the United States now Dao's on ethereum and so like one of the reasons one of the reasons why I have like such conviction ethereum is like we see these principles and these structures that humans have been doing for generations for centuries and now we're seeing them again on ethereum but with more and more just like codified cryptography shared truth like objective nature to them and so like that gives me uh confidence in that like okay we've already been doing these things things and now ethereum allows us to do these things better since we were doing them once before now we have a better way to do it that's bullet for ethereum once people can wrap their heads around it and so we were taking these like systems that we've already created in the world stock exchanges uh like like securitization like assets non-fungible assets like a mortgage non-fungible tokens like a crypto Punk we've already been doing all of these things and now ethereum does it better and it does it in a more trustless way that is more like more liquidity more user participation more freedom more software probability a more interoperability yes and so like same same but better and that's a paradigm shift the Bitcoin Paradigm Shift the paradigm shift I hear you make is something that is to me it's like way bigger of a paradigm shift it's way more massive of like a proposed what it what it actually means and I'm not going to do it justice so if I try and do it but maybe you can like articulate what your paradigm shift is yeah and I I think that was great framing actually so you know that the the longest monologue that I agreed with that you've said so far and and uh if anything like I agree with you that like a lot like crypto in general is effectively codifying ancient wisdom to some degree 100 so what I would say is like sure all of the but everything you described to me in terms of like how the layers of society like we're talking about the layers of a blockchain the layers of money all this stuff yeah Flex Society is built on layers right so like everything you described to me is like the app layer of society right like the revolution is gonna happen at the foundation and that's why foundations the foundation in Bitcoin is to also codified in ancient in ancient wisdom and technology and Lindy which is like you know looking at the foundation of the monetary system was like okay in the past there's a lot of arguments on like the history of it uh Nick Zabo has a great article uh shelling out which kind of talks about you know this Evolution But ultimately you know the world we converged around uh you know gold and silver around precious metals Bitcoin is codified in the mechanism similar mechanisms like inherently similar mechanisms but code and dematerialize and a 10 100 x Improvement on those same mechanism at the very base so I guess what I'm trying to say is like I think if anything ethereum is like more like this sandbox but in the long enough time Horizon like the actual Evolution happens at the base and it's built off of the base of Bitcoin um so I do think that we're we're seeing a similar Trend I'm just focusing on the foundation and I I think bitcoin's attacking that Foundation very very effectively yeah and I think my like uh my response to that would be like well ether has a money is also going after that same foundation and also if we take away if we take like Bitcoin is gold and gold has been around forever I think that's over indexing on like how big of a deal gold is it's like yeah Gold's been gold transcends like Empires it transcends organizational structures but like it doesn't actually like one of the one of the reasons why Empires are created is because they were able to make gold do things like coinage right like we were able to make Fiat gold Fiat issuance of gold and like that created temporary Boons then it created a bust uh but like golden perfect I know yeah we've been we've been like creating other monetary systems around gold sometimes completely unrelated to Gold that created their own Innovations as well it's like one of the bold cases for ethereum is that like you can express any monetary policy on ethereum that you want uh with you know issue a token and make that token do a thing and if that thing is liked by the populace then it sticks around and so any sort of just like monetary policy that we enjoy as humans as money enjoyers like we can have that expressed on ethereum like I I I don't think that money in jurors enjoy monetary policy I I think like do you have a specific like preference of kilowatts or Hertz or Whatever frequency that is used in order to like make all this Tech happen around us no I don't like you use what works use what has been built into the system like that perpetuates itself like I don't think people are going to choose a money I think money is literally shoved down people's throats because you either adopt it or you get [ __ ] it's a massive efficiency gain or it's [ __ ] poverty like it's I'm not gonna be a money enjoyer who's like you know I kind of enjoy this flavor of money it's like no it's like you're holding pesos and getting [ __ ] or you're getting into dollars in the most efficient way possible like that is the Paradigm right so like you know do you you don't give any sort of like uh credit to the argument that like if ethereum recreates the Global Financial system it's more likely going to be ether the currency than Bitcoin the currency that flows through that Financial system I mean like if you see something that's [ __ ] crumbling and looks like [ __ ] like why would he want to recreate it like I'm trying to like because the form factor that you recreated and is not crumbling it's actually the thing that replaces it so like hey you like is your Stock Exchange bad because uh like we still need stock exchanges we'll just use uniswap instead of the one that's breaking yeah no so I mean uh do you remember that famous uh Henry Ford uh quote um something about horses and cars it's like if I were to ask the people you know what they wanted they would have said I want a faster horse right yeah everyone Everyone likes to leverage that quote but like I can say that you can you can always it's like unfalsifiable right it's just like yeah that's a fun quote and you can kind of make that about anything like pick pick any sort of thing that you believe in and you can apply that to like the Henry Ford quote I mean I guess that's fair but I I was just trying to illustrate my perspective here is like okay it's nice that you're trying to recreate The Current financial app layer on ethereum them and maybe ethereum doesn't have some of the Corruptions that the current Financial app player has but I think that remains to be seen we haven't seen the game get lucrative enough and the game get big enough and enough big players uh fighting in that game but I'm saying is like wow that is misallocation of capital on this allocation of capital misallocation to Capital misallocation of capital like the whole thing we need to burn the whole thing down Bitcoin is it just a New Foundation built in first principles and I think that we're going to build a new system based on that because if you don't like I think it's like a a capitalism communism Paradigm in the Cold War it's like at one point the president of Russia visited America the average grocery store it was like wow the average American has more than the richest Russian ever could imagine because the system just created much much more wealth and optionality and I I really do think like Zoom forward six or seven years like we'll be looking at the traditional system we'll be looking at the Bitcoin ecosystem I don't know if you want to include crypto or not in that it depends on who your opinion is I think the the crypto system is like a bridge almost but like it's gonna be the dichotomy is gonna be the same it's poverty it's like poverty and destitution or Bitcoin and energy and wealth like that's the Paradigm No One's Gonna choose poverty yeah you said like uh uh one system is like is poverty the other system is like wealth and optionality I think one main like core philosophical difference between bitcoiners and ethereans is like Bitcoin is like all right no more senior age no more issuance no more cancel on effect just Bitcoin it's the best so much more simple so much more efficient one selling point you can count yeah you can count you can count to 21 million so ethereum is like uh everyone gets issuance everyone gets the cantalon effect we all get to print money now like and so when everyone can print money no one can really print money because since the power to issue is now in the hands of the most marginal user then it's actually a check on the bigger issuers of the world it's like we all get to create tokens we all get to Mint nfts we all get to do it no longer is the power of asset issuance constrained behind the doors of Wall Street and behind nation state like threats of violence now the individual can make their token and do their weird yield farming thing uh and I think that is wealth and optionality for as many people as possible I mean the current world that Bitcoin has created for us is a world where there's Bitcoin and it's also a world where the blueprint for blockchain technology allowed everyone to Mint stuff and guess what that actually drowns out I think it actually drowns out Fiat more than it actually drowns out Bitcoin yeah so I think what we see is like there's gonna be Bitcoin maybe you say they'll be ether and it'll be everything else and it'll actually be individuals drowning out like governments who had a monopoly on money printing maybe it's government and corporations right right but like I think that's part of the revolution is those things have to be drowned out and I've I've said this on POV crypto I've said this on the internet like [ __ ] coins are good for Bitcoin because there's two things happening there's Bitcoin and then there's a Hydra of [ __ ] and both things are attacking the state together the real Revolution is individuals and sovereignty versus centralization and statism so if you see that as the Paradigm all of these things are Technologies to empower individual and sovereignty that's why we're mostly on the same team even though we disagree on you know how that how this Omer T Tech is going to play out I think if if you're saying like it's [ __ ] coins and issuance that drowns out the nation state the nation state is the incumbent right so whoever gets to Dethrone the incumbent is the new Chad and so if like if bitcoin's not doing that and this goes back to like the Nick Carter quote where he's like oh yeah the things that are going on on the ethereum app layer are the new like spearhead of The Cypher Punk movement it's because like if if we are the ones who because we have the issuance that we are now drowning out Old Nation say issuance that makes us the Chads and if Bitcoin is not doing it then bitcoin's not the chat see this is like I love that framing great great rhetoric excellent rhetoric fantastic David um look that's fine personally I think that like what the [ __ ] coins do is they DDOS Regulators yeah so it's not like the [ __ ] coins are disrupting Regulators I think Bitcoin Bitcoin is actually what's disrupting the incumbents because bitcoin's creating sound money for the people that doesn't have the cantalon effect Bitcoin is helping fix the energy infrastructure in a decentralized way but what the Hydra of [ __ ] does is it ddoses the regulators and it acts as a shield for Bitcoin so that would be my framing but I like your rhetoric all right I don't have any other topics in my head uh you have anything else you want to talk about um no man uh beautiful apartment great Studio I need to get some Shore mics on my own I need I need to upgrade my studio for sure yeah I see you with your your you still have that Yeti Nano microphone yeah we got to get your microphone yeah you know we we got like a little studio in the Bitcoin magazine office but we like distributed the the equipment to the people who are on camera all the time so I just like don't podcast as much as you anymore yeah you're a big uh big operator now I missed the days of uh the simple days yeah I miss the simple days don't get don't get too big but uh yo I mean uh [ __ ] is just getting interesting uh I think uh Twitter and uh regulation and Bitcoin and crypto all of these things are gonna continue to become more important and like frankly they're already kind of part of like the political conversation I think the next presidential election is going to be a key topic sure and yeah to everyone out there who's saying like oh crypto is going to be adopted over the course of like 50 years not in my lifetime you're all [ __ ] Bears right like none of you are aligned with how fast this [ __ ] is gonna go so if I could give anyone on the bank list side of things a pep talk it's like and this technology it either improves the world it's either undeniable it's going to if those are if that's true then it's going to take hold incredibly fast like I really don't think that this stuff is going to take our lifetimes right no not at all I definitely agree with that and I think like we're starting to see it accelerate like that that's the main difference between I think this current bear Market versus the last one is like the rate of development is like 10 times faster than it was and it's going to keep compounding the only yeah and I I do feel like we are at the part of the s-curve where you can actually see the slope starting to increase I think we're done with the s-curve by the end of this decade yeah yeah that's gonna be that's gonna be wild I agree with that I think I think 2030 like that's gonna be a key marker um see where the hell we're at oh boy if we're going from the flat part to the to the up part of the S more volatility right yeah that doesn't get less that doesn't mean that's what prices do that just means what adoption does prices can go up and down left and right throughout that oh yeah well I think prices will go up but it's good it's gonna like right effectively go up and down against that but when it's going like this that's going to be a massive volatility to the upside like yeah it's just gonna get wild man Asia's gonna get wild yeah 100 well CK it's been a a thrill being on the ride with you thus far and it's gonna be a thrill taking this rest of the decade by the horns all right let's eat some food
