take me 10 years into the future say filecoin green is maximally successful what does this look like in the year 2033 I think what that looks like is not just within web 3 but in the economy as a whole we have really robust reporting processes that allow you to know no matter who you are at what position in the value chain what are my effects on all of these planetary boundaries right what are my effects on land use for doing this what are my effects on fresh water use and allow you to see if I decide a versus decide B what are those effects going to be and then allow you to verify those effects at the end of the day and then the next piece is connecting that to incentives so that we really have the scalable system where we're driving all of those variables through impact certificates and sort of variations of impact certificates
