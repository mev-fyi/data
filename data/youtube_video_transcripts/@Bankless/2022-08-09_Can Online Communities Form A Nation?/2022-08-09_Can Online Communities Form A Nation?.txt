a discord room or a subreddit is going to found a nation state they're going to create their own country is that literally what you're saying here so so what i'm saying is a message board created their own currency 13 years later it's a sovereign currency of el salvador and of you know a central african republican probably more it has led to every government in the world reacting to it with cbdc's even if they don't like bitcoin even 10 years earlier the concept of a kid from a dorm room could build a three billion person communications network i want to like put that out there for some degree of suspension of disbelief a other human beings have started new countries b we've seen recently people have started new companies and new currencies within our lifetime people we know now why do i bring all this up well it's of i think extreme importance to crypto people because if the question the 2010s was what is a currency i think the question the 2020s will be what is a nation what is a legitimate nation that is both deserving of and capable of some degree of self-determination
