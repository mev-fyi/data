and they're saying why can't everyone in crypto be compliant like us they don't even have a product that anyone's using or it works and meanwhile David you have Kraken you have coinbase actual companies demanded by the Marshall companies have been in the space servicing people in the crypto industry and protecting investors giving them exposure to this asset class for over a decade american-based companies pristine reputations and the SEC is busy sending them Wells notices and somehow this guy gets in front of Congress it just seems a little odd doesn't it bankless Nation it is the third Friday of June and it's Friday morning I said that twice David what time is it it's the bank is Friday can we roll up Ryan the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor which is why I'm on my third coffee uh how are you doing I drank a pot this morning so I haven't gone to the second pie yet just a pie you like a pot can be a different size you know this this is probably like a pot is unequivocally a large that's a lot of coffee let's start all right topics of the week uniswap V4 we actually have some crypto news this week yeah so we got unisotv4 announced this week and why I'm calling it The Hook Centric road map yes forcing it I am forcing the topic all right and uh while I'm very very happy that all this crypto news has happened in addition to a uniswap we have eigenlayer going live we have the polygon roadmap update we have BlackRock that wants a Bitcoin ETF these are all give me more great and snooze and half of this goddamn weekly roll-up is going to be dedicated to the SEC Shenanigans which I'm sad to say but they were extra Shenanigans this week yeah is putting it lightly we love uscc uh I don't know what's going on man but it seemed like the SEC may have put a Fed plant in front of Congress all right that sounds like conspiracy tin foil hat stuff but we're gonna drop the details on that and you guys can decide for yourself what is going on also the Hyman emails were released this is the Ripple case it kind of exposes the SEC with sort of two-faced with respect to its stance on whether eth is a security or not it really undermines the sec's current words with the sec's previous words ordered the SEC to not edit or and change anything about his historical statements out of fear that it might do that the fact that you have to say that as the court right right wow okay we got some Shenanigans to deal with but lots of shenanigans and also Warren Davidson is fed up with the sec's shenanigans and he has proposed the SEC stabilization act AKA hashtag fire fire Gary Gensler and completely rebuild the SEC that's literally that was his hashtag fire Gary Gensler fire Gary Gensler wow it sounds like something you would tweet out David not not me of course I've tweeted out a little bit worse than that and I still want Gary in the agenda I still want Gary on this podcast okay not coming on this podcast I would welcome him though and I know you would too we would have a productive conversation Gary Gensler if you're listening from the podcast have a productive words for him to hear I don't know if we'll get them back anyways speaking of productive you know what's really productive is having a smart contract with good security making sure it's audited our friends and sponsors at scifrin want to let you know that they are some world-class smart contract Auditors okay so if you're building a protocol ciphon wants to make sure your code is secure and using the most modern tooling and best practices available you know Patrick from the cyphron team he's a a YouTube content creator too where he talks about solidity blockchain development and smart contracts is a lot of views on this content all right yeah he's been doing this for apparently like five or three years every yeah he's releasing course every single year with a combined 5 million views which uh I mean the five million views of onboarding solidity devs into web3 that's a lot of onboarding work yeah uh and so not only can sipher audit your smart contract it can also teach you how to be a good secure solidity Dev because if you have 27 hours this bear Market because I'm sure you do is why they call it the Boar market you can go from zero to 60 using ciphon there you go well speaking of Education why don't you educate us on the crypto markets today David it's a bad bad uh yes if things go down everything things go down no the color is red right blood in the street so Bitcoin started the week at 26 700 down six and a half percent down to twenty five thousand dollars Bitcoin down 6.5 is not great that's not great I've seen ether uh down almost double oh now that's starting the week at 18.50 ending the week at 16.50 double digit percentage down feels bad not great not great yeah the ratio of course takes a beating down 5.5 that was a lot for the ratio so we'll tell you why uh why is the ratio done no no why are we dropping like what happened this week I I totally think that this price action could have totally happened in a vacuum um we were talking about that mid bear Market high that we have recently been to that kind of matches where we were in 2019 if you're into that kind of voodoo stuff um and then also at the same time Gary gunzler told us that basically crypto assets 3 through 15 on the crypto market cap are all Securities uh and so I think that has also set in as well um the the mood is bad and then like things become real when the price drops I remember talking to you about this remember in March of 2020 early March everyone's talking everyone is talking about covid but no one was taking it seriously and then the covet dump day happened and like the Trad Market dumped crypto markets dumped and then everyone started taking covet extremely seriously after the markets reacted I think that's kind of what's happening with the crypto Securities is like for the first couple days it was like oh Gary just Sue in coinbase and binance and now we're like we're gonna fight back we're gonna right back yeah and now I'm like oh [ __ ] this is gonna be bad I think that's what that was I mean it could take it could take a while for the US to turn course on this right this is doing some damage I would say in crypto right now so I think you might be right about that it's the market sort of realizing Coming to Terms yeah coming to terms of the fact that the US regulatory environment might look ugly for some time uh we're still above a trillion though in terms of market cap so there's that 1.05 David should we go down Market a little bit and take a look at the the other assets besides Bitcoin and ether so this is one of my favorite um it's not a chart exactly but kind of like a metric to look at right percent down from all-time high just to recap where we are so just to really just be masochistic yeah just just because we we want to hate ourselves this week for just a second and we'll bring some hope near the end of this episode bitcoin price down from all-time high about 64 ether price down 66 by the way those on themselves not too bad those could be worse like yeah and they have been worse which is insane to say 66 not that bad it's not that bad I mean this just feels like a flesh wound to me but then we go down market and we look at some of the um non-eth non-bitcoin uh tokens xrp down 85 interestingly up 30 on I believe I don't know the day or something uh so it's a year to date your day okay that's year to date uh so up on the year which is uh interesting but down 85 percent cardano down 91 Dogecoin down 91 Solana down 94 polka dot down 92 percent um there's definitely some pain down marking you even get to some of the like the D5 Blue Chips you want to swap down 90 wow still a lot of pain a lot of blood in this market particularly when you get outside of Bitcoin and ether yeah the altcoin market cap has been absolutely pummeled holding holding our ultimate bear Market has proved to be very dangerous and that was before Gary deemed them to be Securities so here we are thanks Gary thanks Gary thanks Gary hi so protected you know something we actually haven't talked about in a while that was in this news this in the markets news this week Ryan what's that uh I remember the word inflation oh yeah remember remember the word raising or lowering or pausing interest rates yeah something happened this week what happened the FED had a announcement basically so the fomc had their meeting of course where they tell us what they're going to do with interest rates and uh you know what they did David tell me nothing they decided to skip but that's news that's the news that they decided to do nothing it that is actually big news that they decided to do nothing um this is kind of a skip the rate hike type of uh announcement wait and see approach they're holding at five percent the reason that's notable that this breather is notable people is this is the first time they haven't raised uh of the last 10 times so we've had 10 consecutive increases that stretch all the way back to March 2022 when I the FED basically can capitulated at that point in time they said ah yeah inflation's not transient it's a thing it's not transient it's getting out of hand they had the previous summer in uh summer of 2021 been saying ah don't worry about inflation it's transient don't worry about it they had been kind of late to the game to start increasing rates but then they did and they did so 10 times all the way up to five percent here we are they're taking a break this particular time and why it's because the FED says inflation appears to be easing and they want to assess whether they've already raised enough and I will say inflation is at about four percent at this point in time so it's definitely off of the highest seems low actually that's a low number it's considered look at this chart David what are you seeing in this chart here this is uh C API yeah I am seeing a chart come down to a what was previously considered high but in recent terms can now be considered very low so I mean in 2022 inflation got up to nine percent uh it got in in previous years 2017 it gets to three percent in 20 late 2018 it gets to three percent again uh it almost gets back to three percent at the start of 2020 and now we're down to four percent and so it feels like we are in range of historic levels and we are down from nine percent so like it looks good it is a trailing indicator so let's remember that okay this is all kind of past past data so we're not looking at kind of the current month inflation but yeah annualized at four percent not too bad now keep in mind the fed's target is two percent so um the FED is basically saying yeah it's a wait and see but right now for this time but we expect to continue raising rates later in the year and I think the market kind of uh believes that what's interesting about this is this you know stock market equities uh risk on type assets they don't really know I feel like they're in this undecided territory is it like a bull is it a bear we don't know and so on this news you'd think a pause would be good news for stocks uh stocks traded like a little up but basically flat I think the Market's trying to figure out what's going to happen next and hasn't quite uh decided on that yet I want wonder if the Trad markets forgot I mean I'm just speaking for myself I've completely forgot about this whole like inflation interest rates phenomenon for the last quarter like this is this is once again like oh yeah have you forgotten about the bank runs do you remember those I do remember those uh that was like that was almost a quarter ago yeah uh it seems like uh but yeah SEC is just completely dominated that I wonder if the tread markets are hanging on tooth and nail to inflation like we once were it just doesn't feel like people care anymore yeah am I being naive here I don't know I we've got a lot of interesting indicators in the economy right now so we've got inflation that's about four percent we unemployment actually isn't so bad right now 3.7 at this point in time right does we haven't seen the kind of the unemployment that you might see if we're creeping toward a recession that said there's like just some weirdness in the market I mean go ask a millennial uh about like who's trying to buy a house how they feel about the current economy not too good uh and so there's a lot of weirdness going on and uh I think the Market's just trying to figure out where this is going so that's the FED David uh what do we got to talk about in the rest of this episode oh my God uh so we're gonna probably have to prepare the bank location for like 30 plus minutes of SEC Shenanigans uh it's gonna it's a lot of shenanigans there's a lot of shenanigans like we said there's the Hinman emails there's this Walmart SBF person that SEC loves to parade in front of Congress allegedly so who the hell is Aaron cap plane in promethium um and then the SEC also wants a 120 days to respond to coinbase we got the responses from polygon and Solana about being a security or not a surprise they don't think there are security also these things and more including the SEC stabilization act where we're going to try and fire Gary Gensler um all of this and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible especially Kraken our preferred exchange for 2023 the one that you

from the other layer twos you may be familiar with mantle is a modular layer 2 built on the op stack but uses eigenlayers data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80 compared to other layer twos but it also reduces gas feed volatility mantle has a decentralized sequencer set eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network and because mantle implements multi-party computation nodes layer 1 settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two mantle is the first layer 2 built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest Dow treasuries in the world bit down mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dao for the world of DSi and buy bit for tvl liquidity and on-ramps check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle all right guys the SEC Shenanigans we're gonna go through them uh the first one one of the most bizarre things I've seen in crypto it's kind of inexplicable and um not exactly sure what is going on but let's go through some facts this is a this is I guess a take for me of what it looks like I'm not saying this is what it is because we don't know this is what it looks like I think Gensler and Warrens anti-crypto Army may have actually rubber stamped a shitty ATS quasi-scam alt one in order to hold up to Congress as an example of a compliant crypto exchange but the work quality here is 2017 era Ico scam laughable that's what I tweeted and I said this has got to be Rock Bottom David this tweet thread from Matt Walsh gets into the story it's almost an investigative journalist type story and what I mean if this is true if this is what it looks like I think this is Rock Bottom for the essence zombie a real story all right let's get into it so this is uh Matt Walsh in the Tweet thread uh do you want to kick this off for us yeah so uh Matt Walsh I remember him actually talking about this on his on the bring podcast that he does with Nick Carter every last week so he was talking about how weird this was last week and then apparently since then it's gotten you're even weirder which is how he starts this tweet thread he goes has anyone actually looked into this Beyond bizarre last month in the midst of the SEC bringing cases on coinbase and Gemini and giving the stiff arm to Robin Hood and others promethium gets approval for a first of its kind special purpose broker dealer for digital asset Securities then promethium CEO somehow gets a seat in front of Congress yesterday and starts reading off pre-written notes clearly coordinated with clearly coordinated narratives with Democratic members of Congress or the SEC and so if you click into this uh we won't play this clip because it's like a long clip but there is a section where a democratic member of Congress Miss uh Villa Velazquez uh is asking questions that you like this is pretty common I think we're like staffers will underhand questions to the the congressman or women um this congresswoman clearly does not understand the question she is reading the question uh and you can tell because like you know crypto people know when you are not talking crypto language that's very obvious and so she has a scripted question which she asks Adam the the CEO of of promethium and then as soon as the question ends he looks down at his notes and gives a very scripted answer let's just put the whole thing is scripted yes here's the answer from uh Aaron system is the separation of banking and Commercial activity the republican-led stablecoin legislation we are discussing here today seems to fail to recognize this separation for stablecoin issuers this would allow non-commercial businesses to own a stable coin issuer can you explain the harm to both consumers Financial stability could arise from failing to clearly Define this separation uh consolidation of consumer and banking activities and reading from these conflicts of interest and potential systemic risk essentially potential systemic lack of strong Frameworks were properly regulatory oversight for the entities involved particularly when they're commingling consumer and I know these words activities presents additional levels of conflict and potential exposure to the underlying customers either on the consumer side thank you Mr Kevin gentlemen uh man God that is so cringe and you it just sounds like it's like Gary gensler's like like son like giving these these words it's definitely part of the Gary Gensler uh fan club speech Yes dumb speech and uh there's some interesting conflicts of interest here you should go on with Matt Walsh's thread here okay so Matt Wallace goes as Rodrigo points out Rodrigo does legal and policy at Paradigm this ATS will absolutely not work unless the Project's first register the tokens with the SEC and there are no tokens currently registered with the SEC because the regime game is not viable for public blockchain networks and so you know how Gary genser is always like some projects have come in and registered why not the rest of the industry some guys have done it all Bad actors yeah some people have come in and registered right it's totally possible because some people have done it apparently it's this Promethean thing come in and done it right and so promethium is like okay now that Gary gunzler and the SEC has deemed Solana and Matic and filecoin and xrp to be Securities great we have this alt layer one ATS blockchain exchange for you to trade your crypto Securities on in a compliant manner the point is is that no it's like Solana polygon they don't they don't want to trade on these platforms because they are decentralized Global crypto networks and they can't do that because of of that is against the whole entire point of the whole entire thing we're doing an ATS um so what is an ATS this was a kind of a an idea that was very much popularized in 2017. it's interesting we'll get to this part of the story but this promethium thing seems like an uh 2017 era like almost Ico token launching it's certainly a narrative and it has its roots there which we'll get to in a second but could you define what an ATS is for for people who haven't uh ever heard that term yeah so this actually goes back to the world that I was in in 2018 I was I was in I worked for a security token company so we were trying to figure out how to issue security tokens how do you do that you do you do your token issuance and trading on an ATS an alternative trading system which is a thing that exists before crypto inside of crypto and then once everyone realized that the Ico Mania was actually like selling unregistered securities every like Ico agency like stopped and started pivoting to a security token company because we were like selling unregistered Securities uh and so like there became this like Rush this Gold Rush towards ats's so like T zero was one of these startups there were there was I can't remember all of them I wrote blog posts about this uh there was like five or six startups I had to do market research no products that could fit for any of these no right because because everyone wanted to issue their tokens in a decent decentralized public way but also because an ATS system right um that's wild garden it's kyc it's not only kyc also it's a credit investor law so if it if it's not a publicly traded company that would be trading the SCP s p or NASDAQ right if it's kind of like some sort of private uh placement then you have accredited investor laws which is basically you have to have over a million dollars net worth in order to actually access this stuff and use it it's just a very small niche market that nobody wants nobody's going to use it's the reason it's never taken off no one in crypto wants this but here's this guy who's like right I came in with Gary Gensler I met his office like he's inviting everyone and I get my ATS license and this is we are a compliant exchange and and the rest of crypto is non-compliant you should just do what I I did and it seems like it is a plant it seems like it really does it seems like this guy works for the FED in some capacity or has some hidden incentive here because this uh project is so bizarre this guy looks like a can we go to the Laura Shin clip and play that clip yeah okay this guy looks like a oiled slicked back suit this is uh this is what he is this is um from a podcast that Laura Shin yeah Aaron Kaplan I believe that since the uh Ico in 2015 ethereum has been an investment contract and there is no legal precedent where a security meaning an investment contract that therefore is a security morphs into a non-security there's been sort of ideas of sufficiently decentralized posited out there but they're not really based in legal precedence always a security under the you know legal precedence and as such while we're not announcing anything at this current time here it is Chairman Gensler has noted and I'll sound like a broken record the overwhelmed majority of digital assets basically everything besides for Bitcoin is a investment contract in there for security the whole point about crypto is that it is unprecedented I think that uh applying laws from 1933 and 1934 before the stapler was invented to this new asset class in like digital assets to cryptocurrency is is unworkable it doesn't work and Aaron Kaplan is is not admitting that so basically um the things he said with Laura Shin on her podcast he reiterated the exact same thing in front of Congress uh he said Gensler is Right basically the SEC is Right crypto Securities laws are already clear we don't need new laws everything but Bitcoin is a security it's possible to be a compliant exchange just look at promethium and all the success that we've had being a compliant exchange do you know if it was just that that would be weird enough uh it doesn't end there though David that is one half of the story that's the tip of the ice okay so um it gets even more interesting remember you were talking about the 20 2017 narrative around very short-lived Gold Rush for ats's crypto atss yeah apparently promethium actually got their start right there in 2017. they got their reg A-Plus license they aimed to raise 50 million dollars there so that's where promethium actually started the reason it sounds like a 2017 Ico kind of scam narrative it because it kinda was a little bit um they were stacked though when it came to kind of former insiders government insiders people from the New York Stock Exchange people from finra people from the cboes they're very plugged in oh uh they're coo from the SEC that's quite interesting and then what happened David is they went dormant for a period of time okay so they went silent for years um until about even though they had this was their roadmap that's what they were planning to do you know they had a Genesis block and everything this was a sort of a blockchain ATS of course so you start in 2017 by 2019 you have your Genesis block issued with your fantastic ATS system all right so they go quiet for a few years and um now they're suddenly back on the scene it also turns out David they are funded by some very interesting companies uh what is this tweet from Adam Cochran say now this is where Matt Walsh and Adam Cochrane turn into investigative journalists and there's just a lot to unpack here I'm not I'm not the one to do it but I'll just summarize some of their findings their fundraise was done with this uh affiliate from China called Wang Zhang Wang Jang I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce this a purported CCP affiliate okay great so the ties to China they raised 48 million dollars without a product hired former SEC and finra people they paid 1.5 million dollars to this thing called Network One financial securities which has a very dubious compliance record for people who care about these things but the point is is like the the big thing about Network One Financial do you remember when uh Long Island iced tea you know those beloved like Iced Teas that that and Shout out uh shout out D5 Dave who always wears this shirt in 2017 they changed their stock to their stock ticker and company name to Long Island blockchain just to pump the stock price yeah so that was actually done by Network One Financial oh interesting yeah yeah and so yeah the the Iced Tea Company uh and then they also had another offering that was another blockchain pivot that the SEC charged for fraud so like being connected to these people not great like and if you scroll up you'll see like the again for people who care about compliance stuff they have 23 disclosure events of uh things that just like aren't great like marks on their record um so it's just like it's just not it's just not pretty it's just like not a there's not a cool so that's what's so weird about this is suddenly they're just back and now in front of Congress back in front of Congress and they're saying we just got this ATS license and they're simping for the SEC and they're saying why can't everyone in crypto be compliant like us they don't even have a product that anyone's using or it works and meanwhile David you have Kraken you have coinbase actual companies demanded by the Marshall companies have been in the space servicing people in the crypto industry and protecting investors giving them exposure to this asset class for over a decade american-based companies pristine reputations and the SEC is busy sending them Wells notices and somehow this guy gets in front of Congress it just seems a little odd doesn't it it really it's just weird it's just very weird Adam Cochran I think summed it up nicely with these three possible answers so why the hell this is happening uh one these are plants who have been given a sweet regulatory deal in exchange change in exchange for engaging in the way the SEC wanted them to just like how Gary was working with SPF so there's precedent for that conclusion two these guys are using their SEC and finra connections to push an agenda to get certain assets deemed Securities for them to be the only approved player to capture the market bold um and three these guys are grifters who have been raising money from scratchy sources and for years have been twisting and pro and can and will continue to grift so AKA they're grifters so either grifters um I think it's all three of them or plants and maybe it's some combination of all three um very weird again who knows maybe the SEC maybe Gensler had absolutely nothing to do with this maybe that you know it just seems like something that the Elizabeth Warren anti-crypto Army is behind I don't know why it just disgusted questions and scripted answers thing is like it's hard to look at Oh weird and on top of that that is the first of a series of shenanigans that we've uncovered this week uh shenanigan number two more hypocrisy talk about hinman's emails David what are we looking at here so this came out of the Ripple case so Ripple has been in a fight with the SEC for a very long time the SEC deemed drippled to be a security forever ago exchangers like coinbase and Kraken like delisted Ripple like because they're like all right we don't want to fight that fight um so like this Ripple's been having their own fight with the SEC as a part of that fight a bunch of documents get released from the SEC uh that came from a famous speech that bill Hinman in June of 2018 came and said where he said ether at the time of sale was perhaps a security but in its current shape and form when it is being traded on on a dexes or being traded on coinbase or or binance or whatever is not a security then and it was Bill Hinman remind Bill Hinman was uh director of the SEC uh he was an SEC official at the time in 2018. so this is an SEC person making the statement Gary Gensler and the current SEC Administration have said that bill hinman's statements were his actions as an individual just his own personal opinion his own personal opinions doesn't reflect the opinions of the SEC and Bill Hinman said like perhaps the investment contract of ether at the the pre-sale perhaps that was an essay a security but at ether as it currently stands being traded in the public market is not a security and so that was a statement from Bill Hinman can I read his exact statement sure yeah Hinman said this and putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of ether based on my understanding of the present state of ether again this is 2018. the ethereum network and its decentralized structure current offers and sales of ether are not Securities transactions that is the exact statement so the crypto industry was very excited saying hey the SEC has finally given us Clarity here's a very clear pre-written script saying ether is not a security in a speech from a senior SEC official and you're saying what Gary Gensler and the SEC have since said is oh that was just his personal opinion exactly and all of this all of this is not from the documents from the Essie from the Ripple case here's what was revealed from the Ripple Ripple case so here's an email of SEC officials like working together to come to consensus about what Bill Hinman ought to say and so Bill Hinman put forth in the emails put forth what his like uh his speech that he will give and he asked for comments from other SEC officials and they say as written the language remains vague as to whether eth is a security if you want to make an affirmative statement that is not a security the language could be stronger as in just say it if you don't want to take an affirmative stance we suggest using language similar to what you use for Bitcoin read the disclosure is deemed to make it more consistent and that's one what one person said here's what a second person said we thought you were going to say that you don't believe eth is a security we think that that message is a helpful message this statement on the other hand appears to likely create more confusion about the status of eth to the extent that you don't say eth is not a security please consider confirming the policy of rationale to the disclosure regime of the federal Securities laws as you did with respect to bitcoin earlier in the paragraph basically saying hey Bill what do you want to do do you want to say that eth is on a security because just say it and then and then bill then later made this speech and then just said it just said it and then in an email him and responded and said the language around ether would be used if we are all in agreement so he's like okay so guys we're agreeing to say that eth isn't a security here and then he made the speech and which said that ether wasn't in security and now these scds Ripple docs are revealed to show that makes it really hard for Gary Gensler in the current SEC Administration to say that bill Hinman was acting of his own accord because there's emails of the SEC saying like Hey we're all in agreement about what we're going to say here right David this just makes it so obvious that the SEC the current leadership the SEC changed its mind right change things around had previously said ether is a not a security in 2018 and now want to retract that and take that back yep yep very so this is this is why in the court uh the judge for the Ripple case was like Hey the secs are not allowed to like edit its previous statements not it's not like changing on the record as the SEC is not allowed to go say but what we really meant was this and so the the court is sealing Bill him in statements as real statements that the SEC cannot say like that's not what we meant seems fair because right so they they are not allowed to go yes basically no takes backsies is what the court said no takes backseats on the bill Hinman thing is that's this that's a great summary actually no takes vaccines this is uh Nick Carter uh saying when this came out uh the day has barely started and already a big setback for the SEC they argued that Hinman was just a loose cannon going off in his own clear now that he got signed off from the highest levels great news overall it comes to a court system holding our Regulators responsible that is a good thing all right so that's the uh the second shenanigan that they find themselves in oh and xrp is up on the news interestingly xrp is the only coin in the top 20 that was green because xrp is like oh you guys are all getting sued as Securities too welcome welcome oh wow all right no Clarity here we go um last thing real quick what did they do what are they doing with this coinbase thing not quite the last thing we got more shoes oh yes right so this is Shenanigans number three the SEC wants to 120 days to respond to coinbase's petition so one uh here is is Paul graywell's summary of of uh the sec's uh filing to the response uh last week in the third Circuit Court this has been the the fight for clarity that coinbase is like hey can a court please make the SEC tell us whether they're gonna make rules or not and the SEC response to that was like we want 120 days uh and so Paul just summarizes three four main points here saying that SEC repeats the fallacy that they haven't made any decision on new crypto rules two they refuse to commit to any deadline despite the Court's explicit order three instead of and three they three instead they anticipate and making a recommendation in 120 days and four they ignore the clear statements of the chair that confirm that they have no issue to they have no intent to issue new rules and instead conflate the evidence of a decision those statements provide with an argument that the statements are themselves a decision blah blah blah they're just throwing it I summarize this and basically the SEC just told us to go FR cells yeah this is called stonewalling yeah they're not going to do it no you know sorry like they're just not gonna play ball with coinbase not going to provide any Clarity to uh to the industry and David two weeks ago do you remember in those complaints filed with courts against binance and coinbase they just called a whole bunch of crypto asset Securities including tokens like Matic which is the token behind polygon tokens like a soul which is the token behind Solana and um the token projects themselves have fired back they are responding what are we looking at here so this is a statement from polygon we also have a statement from Solana both of them basically say the same thing is like they disagree with the characterization of them as a security polygon said that they sold polygon outside of the US blah blah blah Solana will say the same thing here's a here's a quote from the Solana article that I really like um here's a from a Solana developer in a hacker house in New York City actually I just the one that's not too far away from me the hacker said I don't think any developers give a [ __ ] Soul being a security doesn't really affect anyone building on top of Solana which is just great Cypher Punk fashion um the terrible thing Ryan is that Solana polygon filecoin all these tokens that were deemed to be Securities are not defendants they are collateral damage where the defendants are binance and coinbase and so they don't even they don't even get to have a seat in the court in the hearing really because they are not the defendant they are just being charged with being a security as like collateral damage inside of the suit between coinbase and binance and the SEC but can they be deemed to security without fighting that out with these projects in court I don't know but that's yeah well let me ask you what you think about that so that this Lana Hacker House guy said I don't think developers give a [ __ ] okay that's true however look Seoul is down 94 I meant like there's FDX there's all sorts of other reasons why so I say it's all this but it also has an insane 2021 yeah but this sure didn't help okay and so it does impact the economic security of these alternative layer ones right I mean if all of these tokens are deemed Securities in the US but here's the thing I think the rest of the world will continue to march on right right like Gary Gensler does is not the emperor of the world and while he has some networks are bigger than Gary uh Robin Hood though de-listing so yeah boo car Donovan polygons you are the only ones de-listing Robin Hood it's unfortunate we're the only ones doing this it's unfortunate uh it's very unfortunate it would be nice if they joined the battle and fought the good fight like Kraken coinbase and others are doing because uh we need all the ammo that we can get here's a tweet from Ryan sulcus this is what SEC protection looks like and he basically is he's showing the Missouri chart that we were showing up earlier where uh everything's downstairs yeah this is when yeah this is when the token stops so yeah it's not great it's not great he says uh aren't you grateful your tax scholar dollars go to Gary Gensler who already made 100 million I hate the fact that I pay his salary I hate that I hate that so he can pull up the ladder behind himself and screw you yeah okay so we are not we have two more sections of SEC Shenanigans oh can we play the clip of Gary Gensler in 2018 oh yeah this is a great clip uh yeah here we go this is Gary again I love 2018 Gary by the way over 70 percent of the crypto Market is Bitcoin ether Litecoin Bitcoin cash why did I name those four they're not Securities let's play that back let's play that back um there's four they're not Securities I love 2018 Gary Gensler that's a great guy looks like him could be deep fake David I don't know yeah I'm there I can't trust these days yeah my how things have changed though um this is your take me earlier I want Gary Gensler out of office me now I want Gary Gensler in prison well he's not gonna come on the podcast now David thanks a lot I I have spoken why do you feel this way because Gary it's one thing to be a uh incompetent to regulator but Gary has shown to be competent and to have positions and stances in 2018 and he has shown to understand crypto networks he has shown to be a competent functioning person who deeply understands this crypto industry and now he's as far as I can tell exclusively playing the political game of climbing up ladders of power and is a single player PVE game that Gary is playing inside of a world of people of humans Gary we live in a society you do not get to treat the rest of humans as your environment that you are PVE eating but he that is what he is doing but you said something you said something stronger you said you want Gary Gensler in prison all right using the authority of a public office to elevate himself and tear down an entire industry of hundreds of thousands of people he is misusing the authority given to him by his role for his own self gain there's some law I don't there's probably some law out there find it we can find it I is doing something against the people this is Gary Gensler versus the people I think what you're reacting to here and of course like before someone goes to gets prosecuted or there's criminal charges there has to be evidence of of criminality right so just because you don't like somebody it doesn't mean like I don't like this guy go to prison going to prison I think that if you looked hard there would be evidence of corruption here and I think that's what you are reacting to so strongly it's not just an abdication of responsibility of shirking your duties and playing as self-interested games like lots of people do that CEOs do that there's tons of psychopaths in corporations and government I think that there is actual corruption that could be going on here and if we find evidence of that that is a reason to hashtag fire Gary Gensler that's where we're going next uh this is I will settle for a firing of Gary guns this is Warren Davidson here today I filed the SEC stabilization act SEC stabilization this is not stable coins here we're trying to stabilize why because it's gotten volatile I guess today I filed the SEC stabilization act to restructure the SEC and hashtag fire Gary kensler he put it in hashtags because you know he wants it to Trend right right right yes here he goes uh U.S capital markets must be protected from tyrannical chairman including the current one it's time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as chair of the SEC Warren Davidson is a crypto friendly Congressman I believe um I he I often see his name associated with Tom emmer who we've had on the podcast before who I believe is saying something similar him and Tom emmer have co-written that very Progressive productive of crypto bill that that Jake Stravinsky and other crypto lawyers are like big thumbs up which one's that did you guys talk about that last year how the the digital asset Market structure bill yeah ah right and now they've got a second Bill to fire Gary Gensler do you think this is actually like going to get legs uh you know I don't know how bills like these work or is this just if the Republicans win the 2024 election then big big time yeah but I mean Gary's out anyway if they're in 2025 yeah you're right he is out yeah um okay that's the SEC we're done with the SEC Shenanigans for this week anyway um my question to you is do we have to start worrying about the cftc cftc all right quickly before we get there here's a very quick yeah this is this is why this is a this is a Democrat versus Republican issue yeah this is a this is a great tweet from Nick uh tomato the Biden administration's crypto timeline first Sam bankman freed is the second largest donor to Biden's presidential campaign second Biden at points Gary gensler's chairman of the SEC third Gary Gensler hosts meetings with SBF and FTX with no action letter discussed next after winning favor with the FTC at the CIA the SEC FTX is exposed as the largest fraud in history by the crypto community and last the SEC attacks sound legal businesses that have been attempting to work in good faith with Regulators for over a decade coinbase and Kraken I sent this tweet to my very Democrat family and I got crickets back well the problem is like I don't think that corruption is a right versus left Democrat versus Republican issue it's just corruption and that's what this smells like and that's what it looks like and wherever it is doesn't matter what side of the political Spectrum you're on you should be in favor of getting corruption out of government uh certain it's certainly looking like it can we turn to the cftc for a corruption-free uh regulation uh are they are they friends also not great okay so this is the cftc versus Uki Dao this is something that a lot of the legal Minds in the crypto space have been paying attention to as the thing to pay attention to because what is being judged over here what is being ruled is the liability of Dao members of actions of the Dao so ukidao formerly called bzx I think was it was bzx it was exploited uh and so there is I think a class action lawsuit against ukidao this is all directionally correct uh and so there it's a suit over whether the Dow members can take responsibility over the uh the the damage caused by a Dao the cftc has uh won that court case the court has deemed cftc two have won which is bad which is terrible this means to be clear if you had like if this kind of precedent continues if you have a token in a particular data governance token something it happens the Dow does something in which you are um you could potentially be legally liable in the same way an equity holder our partner is if this was some sort of a uh you know corporate entity or a business entity in the US and it's basically the worst possible ruling for a douse why are we not completely freaking out about this um so Lex node um there's another crypto lawyer says that this is a default judgment Uki Dao didn't defend itself so the cftc won without needing to prove its theories so that is very limited precedence legal precedent so that is why we're not freaking out about this but if this this could have been much worse uh the ukidao has to pay 645 thousand dollars ukidao members um basically this is the cftc calling a bluff on decentralization theater specifically around ukidao but um the worry is that this would happen again and the next one would fight uh have more legal precedent um yeah it is important to know here that no ukidao members were held personally responsibly uh liable for anything in this particular so it's a very mixed bag reaction but the ukidao story is now closed I guess yeah the idea that like a token holder has kind of like Risk um basically that torches I think totals in the US like I like Dao's in the US in particular and so and it's interesting because uh token holders don't have the the legal rights on the benefit side of things they just have the downside right so no investor protections only investor life it's a backdoor way to kind of like torch the asset class and really uh cause some harm here yeah wow God I Ryan I hate that we are 49 minutes into this recording and it's all it's all SEC CFT I hate that you know what it's been that kind of year though it is a regulatory Warrior but we got some great things coming up next which is more build Market material uniswap version four getting ready to ship it's awesome announced uh some really exciting things eigenlayer hits mainnet and also awesome the Bank of China just issued 28 million dollars in digital structured notes on the ethereum blockchain it's awesome it's trying to trying to fill the void here uh we'll be back with that um but before we do we want to thank the

that's what I'm calling we're gonna try to make that happen I think it's a great meme it's pretty good you get it right like ethereum's roll-up Centric roadmap uh uniswap's hook Centric we'll tell people what Hooks are so they understand so uh we'll start with unison V3 and why we needed av4 in the first place um so the idea behind unisot V3 was that V3 had certain features embedded into V3 into unisot V3 pools one of them was like an oracle for example uh and so like the every single unit swap uh pool whether it's like ether USD or ether die it came with an Oracle in every single unit swap exchange yeah so anytime you ever swapped on a unit swap V3 pool contract you would update that Oracle and that would cost gas and so that is an opinionated feature that is costing money for swappers for perhaps a feature that not very many people are using especially on the long tail of uniswap pools and so that is an example of a feature that's placed into unisaw V3 that you cannot pull out you're going to swap V4 is a massively reduced feature eliminated uh base protocol with instead of features hooks hook what are hooks hooks are just expressive ways to input new code into a uniswap V4 pool contract and so what does a hook do it can do anything that's that's kind of the point uh it's kind of like a smart contract not a full not a fully expressive smart contract but still very expressive way to make widgets for uniswell it's almost like so it's just a smart pool right or like a smart pool yes yeah smart smart feature smart widgets you know it's not fully turned complete but it's most of the way there the other reason I look I like hook Centric red map you know and compare that to roll up Centric red Mac which ethereum map 2 is because this is like ethereum in in the way that um the the roll-up Centric roadmap for ethereum made ethereum modular we've talked very much about modular ethereum this is modular uniswap this is the reason they're doing hooks so that the Primitive can focus on kind of the base layer types can be primitive yeah and you can it's much more expressive you can build all sorts of other things on top of it just in the same way that the beacon chain and ethereum really focused on the consensus layer the core stuff that only ethereum could do in it out it was like outsourced execution to uh the Roll-Ups and that's what uniswap is doing with these hooks yeah that's that's exactly right so like what can you do with hooks like it's really your oyster you can do you can make a transaction that does DC Yang over blocks for a year's Long worth of time you can put back in that Oracle that I was talking about you can do anything I think there's going to be like two classes of hooks there's going to be hooks that almost everyone uses because they're just so good and useful that most uniswap Pools use them and then there's going to be completely customary custom hooks that maybe just one unisot pool wants for one specific purpose so it's kind of like having a generalized optimistic roll up or an app role app or app chain except for app hooks right does that make sense yeah it does now we should say this isn't live now a lot of the code is out there but it's on GitHub and uh uniswap is doing a different approach with respect to the launch of V4 V3 was just like boom it's here launched on Main net right a V4 is like hey here's what we're doing go take a look at our code go read our white paper give us some commentary and we'll roll this out in the months ahead I don't know do you think like Hayden we had Hayden Adams on the podcast uh earlier this week do you think that V4 is going to release by the end of this year do you think it's that soon or could it take a little bit longer it's going to take so it's got a dependency it needs this thing called transient storage from eip1153 okay so what what does transient storage do does I have to explain one more feature which is called the Singleton construction this is a design term in computer science a Singleton contract is just a single contract that hosts all of the logic as opposed to many different contracts for every single pool so you swap V3 and V2 we're all done with unique contracts so when you spun up with every single token on uniswap V2 and V3 has its own uniswap contract address with a Singleton contract design all uniswap is one single contract address that pools exchange pools are inside of that one contract so instead of one contract per token it's one Global Contract a Singleton contract and so what does that do that reduces minting New Pools the cost to Mint new pools why 99 yeah so new pools cost 99 less to Mint um I mean that's a one-time fee so it's just like the long tail of crypto assets get cheaper unit swap pools um but then importantly it makes this thing called flash accounting so with every single unisot pool is under one single contract it makes order routing between all of the uniswap pools extremely efficient and then this flash accounting thing is what they need transient storage from eip1153 to do and so it when we rebalance all of the pools because everyone's doing all these trades all at once the transient storage allows for Flash accounting so that every all the unit swap pools can all settle without making a big footprint on the ethereum layer one why are you smile I'm just smiling because um imagine a crypto Noob just listening to what we just said there there's so many words there that they're like transient storage and like flash would you just say flash flash flash accounting all of these things give us like the the really I explain it like on five kind of version of this too okay how to explain unit swap like I'm five there's it's just two main there's two main things apps which are the hooks so uniswab has apps now and they're going to be developed by the open source world it's free and permissionless to build apps for uniswap so unisoft's gonna have apps uh flash accounting um it doesn't cost anything to trade across multiple unit swap pools at once and it used to and so the complexity and gas costs and fees of trading throughout the uni unit swap universe is almost zero all right and so that's good yeah more Pools Better pools more liquidity that's what we're getting yes better defaults overall it's a huge emphasis on gas reduction um so gas reduction is a huge theme in V4 and also expressivity so I I have two big questions uh Ryan that we want to bring up here's the Discord this is from Scotty Scotty from the bankless nation Discord what's up Scotty Ryan and David do you see uniswap V4 as a boon or a consolidation I love the architecture and the composability however the hook concept could turn any competing amm into a uniswap surf by reducing their product to a hook that feeds the unit Swap and the smart question it's a very smart question I actually went into the Discord I was like yo bro Scotty continues and says the comparison to ethereum is apt thank you Scotty roll a hook-centric roadmap for uniswap uh put that one in your brain it's now a meme but breaks down because Hayden and Company own the fee switch after V4 when all competing amms collapse into Hooks and uniswap has captured most on-chain liquidity what do you expect V5 or V6 or the V switch to look like does the centralized or decentralized you know swap in your mind do you have an answer because I don't know uh go for it you you start with this one all right first let me drink some more he's preparing his answer Scotty get ready for it I think Scotty is just like he's got the bead he's he's on he's on the ball right now okay so do you see uniswap V4 as a boon or a consolidation the answer is both and I want to put this into uh alt layer one to see me because I think validation of what of liquidity of I think Scotty's saying like all of these alternative amms that have different design structures and patterns are now like made obsolete because they can just become a hook onto yeah unique Force gonna eat those in the same way I think that um Roll-Ups kind of eating roll up Centric road maps eat up all the layers the same pattern so like why would you spin up a lot here's here's the words of the eth Maxi right like why would you spin up an alternative layer one just make it roll up on ethereum why why would you make another amm with different logic or just make it a hook on top of uniswap and so it's it's both a boon and a consolidation I think as a ethereum biased person that the roll-up Centric road map to ethereum is a boon for many many networks because they do not have to be burdened with having to deal with the complexity of the decentralized nature of the layer one hooks on uniswap do not have to deal with getting new liquidity becoming a a completely resistant hardened protocol like you just hook into uniswap and you have all the all of the liquidity it's going to be easier to get your logic built into liquidity if you just make a hook on top of uniswap yeah you know what I think the patterns are so strong I get I'm much less worried about kind of consolidation and network effect and one particular uh your pro like thing owning like 90 of Mark share that sort of thing if it's a incredibly neutral public good primitive right and I'm not saying that uniswap is as much that as ethereum is because it's not all right there's like a uniswap Labs type entity there's other things there's a there's uni token governance there's kind of fee switch right they have uh not quite open source licensing it's like you know like a four-year thing then it becomes open source but it's pretty close and maybe as close as we've seen of any defy protocol there's things like curve that are very close to the bare metal too and I you know love those things but uh so I'm less worried about kind of consolidation of kind of uniswap as long as it preserves those core properties of decentralization yeah and I think a lot of those core properties about uniswap are like that's not an option they don't have the uh turn on centralization switch right on unit swap they just have turn on the fee switch and so like yeah if you want to be like kind of cynical about it I think the the idea of uh what did Scotty say um that Hayden and Company have the fee switch I think that's a little bit of a cynical takes like well like this tokens starts somewhere Hayden invented the protocol he invented it in a way that you cannot make it centralized like yeah he has a lot of uni tokens but anyone else is one of the biggest areas anyone can spin up um a pool right and yes and the fee switch is configured based on the pool like that I don't know about that one more to learn about this yeah okay now another question from spartansolution.e uniswap V4 announces hooks this week one of the hooks discussed in the podcast was the ability to enable trades using t-wop for buying and selling tokens would this hook be some things someone can use to DCA into a token on uniswap yes and that is actually the exact point of what that app was talking about you can use a hook to do DCA and into unit Swap and it's actually just one transaction and you can set the logic and it's only you only have to buy one dollar cost averaging that's what DCA is if you want to right exactly put a little bit of your paycheck every every two weeks into crypto that's exactly right okay if you want to listen to the podcast with Hayden we had a hour-long hour hour and 10 minutes with Hayden I'm talking all about it so that podcast as well it's already in your podcast feed so so here's here's Hayden uh okay are you ready eigenlayer I reckon later mainnet launch all right audien layer is on chain is on mainnet so there are three Milestones to the eigenlayer mainnet we are at Milestone number one so we are off uh what is Milestone number one uh this is when 3200 of each of the following staked tokens are allowed to be deposited into eigenlayer that's Lido rocket pool and coinbase wrap staked ether so s-ce r e CBE 3200 and each of them can be deposited into eigenlayer uh they all got filled up within hours of mainnet launch uh and so now it's awful so you can't do anything right now so now you can't do anything because it's too late they already did it uh they're going to open up that more it's like very guarded slow launch very protected very secure um so that's phase one where and so I guess Milestone one's already done Milestone two is when operators join the network and these are the people who do the actual validation tasks of restaked networks AKA doing the work so that's what's coming up next and then in Milestone 3 is when we launch actual Services uh so these are the actual eigen networks some of them are already like being worked on some of them are just theoretical but totally up to the free market to build that's eigenlayer data availability espresso which is shared sequencing witness chain um that's going to be so cool I can't wait to be an explosion this is his biggest Roll-Ups and we talked about this two weeks ago we had our episode with sriram about restaking you basically take your eth you stake it you stake again take it again another Network and that transmutes some of the economic security of ethereum's validator set into the new thing that you want to bootstrap an oracle an app a chain whatever you can think of uh it's such a fantastic concept and the fact that this is coming out already is very exciting I remember when we first learned about Roll-Ups we had to like wait for like three years oh my God way too long were you staking that is actually a really good point the Inception of knowing about eigenlayer to it going to mainnet I learned about it in October of 20. why didn't you think of this earlier three wrong why didn't we think about making it again yeah why didn't we think about Reese I guess we have to have staking first and that like happened relatively true that is true all right that is true well the other thing is like okay so yeah we waited forever for Roll-Ups and now now we finally have them people were building their eigen layer restaking components before mainnet was even around there's infrastructure ready to go to be using eigenlayer data availability yeah uh polygon just an announcement as well so our vision for polygon is simple to build the value layer of the internet they're doing an announcement where they're kind of starting with a series of announcements I would say so what is ahead of us for the next month or so um of a few things we have an announcement of four announcements yes okay so the week of June 20 or excuse me the week of June 19th is when they are going to be talking about the future of the polygon proof of stake chain I'm gonna guess that it's gonna become a ZK roll-up uh I'm just making that prediction uh the week of 20 the June 26th the next week is uh the architecture and stack of polygon there's a bunch of other networks maybe they get tied together uh then July 10th the utility and evolution of the Native Matic token and then the week of July 17th the transition to Greater Community governance and protocol in the treasury sounds like a very holistic large move by polygon all in all uh so this kind of feels like the big the big the biggest one I'm excited about is any idea of the polygon proof of stake chain turning into a ZK roll up a ZK evm that would be absolutely amazing that would be like promises made Promises Kept type of moment and uh with just cement Roll-Ups as cement ethereum's roll-up Centric road map is hey it works we had a big kind of like side chain type thing convert interesting that The Branding on this tweet our vision for polygon is simple to build the value layer of the internet does that trigger you do you think they should ethereum I mean ethereum is the internet I saw some lots of people getting uh upset at this saying like polygon is kind of disaligned or like you know the marketers that kind of thing um I'm not seeing it yet but um it's a take out there I will get to this like the current mood and the SP like the The Vibes say that for later all right what's optimism last Layer Two thing optimism Bedrock got uh released last week and so now we are able to check out some of the data on the gas fees so if you open up that Doom board that comes up next so we can just see the gas fees on Bedrock are like one third one half reduced uh versus the Legacy uh optimism uh just lovely to see this is all before eip4844 so when you reduce uh optimism gassies by more than half before 4844 gosh gas fees getting low uh David is getting low over to nft stuff Kraken out of beta Kraken nft new gateway to buying selling and learning about nftas what is what is this about from Kraken yeah so they have their new nft platform that is launched buying holding selling and learning about nfts they say they're integrated with uh polygon you also can trade uh Reddit collectible avatars right as having its blackout moment but you can still trade snooze on on polygon using a kraken uh cool um so you can also pay with whatever you can buy and sell nfts using uh your credit card or crypto which is interesting and then also they have their F1 car so if you want to get your nft perhaps if I do this my crypto dick butt the Kraken uh F1 car you can put your nfts into the Kraken nft platform so congrats on Kraken for getting their nft platform out of the gate and of course disclosure Kraken is also a sponsor of the podcast also should mention because we talked about uniswap earlier that uniswap is also a sponsor of the bank list podcast as you've probably noticed and I'm an advisor to Matic and David and I are both advisors for optimism we've mentioned all of these projects so want to keep disclosures always front and center with you guys as always bankless.com disclosures you can find out what we are doing in crypto at any given time David this is pretty big news BlackRock filing a Bitcoin ETF soon close close to close to soon okay soon Tia but that would be huge but the the reason why yes BlackRock like biggest asset manager on the face of the year a lot real hard for Gary Gensler to ignore it's like you're gonna think yeah right yeah uh and so there's two partners here both coindesk and Kraken have been partnered with this so Kraken is providing the pricing data and coinbase is being the custodian uh so coinbase will store the Bitcoin Kraken will provide the pricing and black hole Rock will provide the ETF and Gary Gensler will approve it right Gary will he right Gary who's who's stronger which which influences stronger is it kind of the big asset manager institution really good question it is I mean this will be this will be fun to watch uh that that squirming happen um very exciting though we certainly need a coin ETF David Hong Kong is putting pressure on three major Banks to take on crypto exchanges as clients Hong Kong I saw I this is so I'm so jealous let me read this to you uh the Hong Kong monetary Authority is putting pressure on hsbc's Standard Charter and Bank of China to take on crypto exchanges as clients the Hong Kong monetary Authority is putting pressure on its own Banks saying quote due diligence on potential customers should not create undue burden particularly those for setting up office in Hong Kong to look for opportunities here imagine I am so jealous imagine I imagine if you had come like I think it's a matter of honestly the you know the US ziggs and Hong Kong zags I think that's what's what's happening in China's going the opposite direction right now so Hong Kong China kind of the same also not though this isn't mainland China this is yeah Hong Kong is kind of like the financial Innovation Center I would say of like you know China now um but Bank of China issues 28 million dollars in a digital structured note on ethereum also out of Hong Kong uh so they there's a 28 million digital structured note I don't know what that means on ethereum issued by Hong Kong that's pretty cool that as uh yeah that is interesting why are they doing that it's interesting that's interesting David there are some First Chinese financial institution to issueize a issue a tokenized security in Hong Kong big deal using public permissionless rails to issue Securities you can totally do that as long as you traded on an ATS from Aaron Capital no no no ATS just here to swap uh this is a release this week tell me about this Taiko Alpha 3 testnet is live what is Tycho Tycho is another layer two on ethereum it is a ZK evm uh it is uh of all the layer two ZK EVMS that are out there the ZK sync era polygon scroll and then Tycho taiko's defer this behind the newest on the scene also sitting shoulder to shoulder with the rest of them at least the social categorization all of all that so they are now on testnet so congrats to uh Matthew finestone and the team very cool good people Matthews from that formerly a loop ring right in GameStop formerly Loop ring formerly GameStop yeah um lens just uh beefed up a raise today we are excited to announce our 15 million dollar funding round to accelerate the adoption of the next generation of Internet powered by human connection the people powered

show notes Jesse Walden how to actually get through a bear Market Jesse Jesse Walden says maintaining your psychology is one of the hardest parts of building slash investing in crypto Frontier Tech is hard enough but pundits love to kick us while we are down this is cyclical along with the market maintain thesis focus a dose of stoicism and they'll call it luck great take that is a great take uh here's another take from David Hoffman the current meta of crypto just feels so weird right now yeah it's a little bit Downstream of the conversation that we just had it's like I can't really put a pin on it just feels weird to be in crypto at this present moment I I think uh crypto feels a little lost is one thing I'd say um crypto Twitter at least is more grumpy than usual a bit more reactionary um everything gets put under the microscope um it seems hard for us still to separate like our friends from our enemies maybe we're just reeling from the trauma of 2022 where some people in crypto turned out to be kind of enemies of of the values of this space um I feel like we're more divided than we should be or we could be again in the face of kind of a common set of challenges we have challenges not just from regulatory which are immense but also in terms of um a shared voice like a shared message um showing the world what crypto can actually the the value it can actually deliver prices are down too so I think people get like grumpy when that happens uh I'm not sure it's it's kind of a weird vibe right now um yeah what what do you think how would you describe it I think it's also because we're seeing a crescendo wing and building but also an even faster crescendoing of fud and like real fud like Gary genser SEC fud and I don't know like how people I don't think people are figuring out how to come to terms with it I think we see parts of the crypto Community come together like I'm doing my best to try and come together with the Solana Community I'm really trying here um and then other parts just seem to be falling off it's like crypto feels like I'm trying to hold water in my hands right now and it's been that way for like a year I don't know what to do about it I don't know it's like I I I it's crypto hasn't been faced with these challenges before uh I think you said this earlier 2021 the class of 2021 and the class of 2017 just aren't like vibing very well I think it's a generational Gap there I think that is yeah I don't know definitely some of that um I have a solution for you it's but it's in the what I'm bullish on Section but I'll start with asking you the question what do you bullish on this week okay I'm I'm bullish on crypto lawyers I think our lawyers in this industry are absolute just chats yeah and chat ads yeah I think they are just I think they're just Savage I think they're some of the coolest lawyer I don't I don't know the full spectrum of uh industry lawyers but I think like Freedom crypto lawyers Freedom Fighter lawyers Paul from coinbase Jake and Amanda I don't know if you listen to that episode Ryan but it was awesome uh so we have is yes yes yeah uh I think we have some of the most like Savage lawyers that are out there who are like lawyers but also just like Freedom Fighters like technological Freedom Fighter like I never thought that we would have Cypher Punk lawyers yet here we are like lawyers that embody cipherfunk values shout out to all the crypto lawyers out there that's a good one yeah I appreciate hilarious bullish on them too thank you for sticking around because if you guys didn't stick around we'd really be in trouble Ryan what are you both Sean uh this is kind of an answer to like if krypto's feeling weird here's what you should do and it's what I'm bullish on grab a bear Market buddy um can you copy that my bear Market buddy you um I just I've been feeling like honestly guys if you're listening to this I guess you are crypto is hard enough it's it's really hard that you got the volatility um it's mentally exhausting you have kind of constant attacks your relatives think you're crazy you're down bad right now like all sorts of gaslighting you yeah and then for me personally you also threw a media on top of that and what that means is also social media for me and like social media is notorious it's toxic it's hard It's hard out there and so I feel like sometimes every single week I feel like under attack it like by somebody it's just something happens and you're just like I didn't mean for that I didn't mean to say it in that way and like this is this is not the event that I wanted to be handed right and as a so many crypto and also a content creator and I'll speak to the content creation part of this uh for for a minute it's very difficult to separate two things who are the good faith critics and who are the bad faith critics all right because the bad faith critics you want to separate them and like just cast them aside like you don't need to listen to them this is just the hater crowd I mean they're doing it to grow their influence they'll be happy to spread information it's just bad faith attacks on you but if you throw out all of the critics then you also throw out the good faith critics too and in there you have like people who disagree right they're good faith critics they disagree well that's a great chance for you to engage and to learn something from them and then you have people who misunderstand your perspective well that's a good opportunity for you to learn how to communicate better so you like clarify things right and so that's good faith too you want that uh and then there's some people who genuinely like understand you they just think you're wrong and you did something wrong and these are helpers they sort of help you improve and you absolutely want to listen to that last group of people they're the ones that hold you accountable probably like the questioner from from earlier asking us about disclosures that sort of thing so you always want to listen to your helpers but what's really difficult to do David I think in Bear markets when everyone's feeling grumpy uh and you have these types of reactions is like listen to any critics that's like hard for me because there's so the bad faith in the good faith are all mixed together so it all sounds like noise and my solution there the only one I found is bear Market buddy all right you need a council pass it back and forth you need a group you need people who are going to like call you on your BS right um and also listen to your decision a group of people you can also be a little bit like crazy with right right and so um that for me is secret through getting through 2018 2019. that for me is actually the secret right now I can tell you honestly David I wouldn't be doing this podcast without you like I uh feelings there's no chance I could not run this thing like it's just impossible uh and so I just want to extrapolate that to anyone else who's listening is don't travel alone okay never do that go find some friends go find some people who are on the crypto Journey that believe similar things that are here for the right reasons now is the time to find them because it is a settlers Market the tours are out I don't know where they are but they're gone it's a settlers market so find your bear Market buddies and uh just hang on um could be months uh maybe hopefully it's just months years I don't know we don't know but uh settlers don't care they're gonna be here and uh that's what I'm bullish on um you want to get to the meal of the week meme of the week let's do it all right here we go what are we looking at Donna we got Gary Gensler as a shark and man those eyes are really far apart in the uh the innocent little ladies swimming on top of him there we go we also like I said have a Moment of Zen from uh Coco the cornhub members singer it's so good it's so good uh I cherish every single one of these um I doubt that they're still going to be available but these are uh a mint on manifold I believe there's 150 I definitely minted one uh so yeah we're gonna go here from that moment as soon as Ryan tells you about risks and disclaimers about going away I get ready for it this is El coco.eth it's the bear it's called this will get you in the mood uh for a good bear Market where we are right now in the settlers Market risks and disclaimers of course gotta let you know eth Bitcoin these assets are all risky so is crypto you could definitely lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] now the crypto bear is one to Fair he'll eat your soul if you don't take care when the tide goes out he smells like air and if you're not wearing clothes you'll be a souvenir of the bear oh it's the bear it's finally hair I swear I'm so full of cheer cause it's the bear but no one's scared because we're all out of fear and you can say LSD and a platypus appears and friends are made that'll last for years and it's easier to find your dream career and it's also when normies think we're weak and they mount their attacks the scathing this is funny if they still don't see it clear we get stronger when times are more severe cause it's the beer who is the beer it's finally here when I swear I'm so full of Cheers [Music] well the bars when you find out who you are if you're here for the battle usually won't go far and it flushes out anything so far and it always dies down so you can pre-par for the next full run whenever it comes cause you got your scars and you're no longer dumb and you're down so far that you've become numb but it's not about the money when you've lived among the bar where's the bar it's finally hard when I swear I'm so full of char cause it's the mark
