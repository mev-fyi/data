sign in with ethereum is one of the first steps to letting users control their data across the web using public-private key cryptography we're able to just enable new modes of interaction that are user-centric at core issuing credentials being able to write permission slip Stacks as data moving to a model where instead of logging into the platform the platform logs into your data fault I think that all this is possible when you switch to sign in with ethereum because of the direct authentication and Builder ecosystem after that welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless David I just realized we talk about internet money and internet Finance in the intro we should also add Internet identity to the list of things we are covering in Bank list today's episode is about ethereum its ability potentially to take back our identity on the internet we're exploring that topic with Wayne Chang who's a researcher and a core Dev behind the sign in with ethereum project if you haven't heard about this project this is the episode to pay attention to a few things to look out for number one why Google Facebook and Twitter are actually banks for your identity and of course we are bankless so is there an alternative number two we talk about why Wayne thinks ethereum can disrupt the Silicon Valley Tech companies and become the standard way you sign into every application and social media platform on the internet number three we talk about how this leads to a more Sovereign decentralized and free internet for the world crypto has been called you've heard us talk about this before a separation of money and state this is the separation of identity and state and is perhaps even more profound David why is this topic so important to you why do we set up this conversation I know you were very excited to uh to bring Wayne on and talk about signing with ethereum yeah sign in with ethereum it's it's like one of those small holes as a rabbit hole that once you go through the hole it only gets bigger and bigger and bigger as it goes the implications of a simple swap of sign in with Google or sign in with Facebook when it turns into a sign in with ethereum it seems so simple but the downstream changes of how that completely changes the landscape of the internet and how users on the internet are able as a result of that to go from a commodity to the big Silicon Valley apps to an actual user once again a free and Sovereign user of the Internet it's it's quite profound and it really does go down to the depths of what does it mean to have an identity to be a person and Wayne is a deep thinker both as a developer as to how do we come up with standards to implement this sign in with ethereum vision but really what does it mean to authenticate what does it mean to be a person as it goes to the internet and these are conversations Ryan that we had in the debrief about human identity is a infinite boundless thing yet we know that it is captured by the current status quo of the internet because so much of what makes up users on the Internet is defined by Facebook is defined by Google it's defined by Twitter so what happens to the internet when we can unlock it from the constraints of these web 2 apps and finally make a version of ourselves that's as Limitless as the kinds of assets that we can mint on ethereum I I think is such a fantastic conversation so if you want more of that conversation you can sign up for the debrief podcast which is the only podcast that exclusively comes out on the bankless premium feed if you don't have the

is a topic we have been waiting a long time to talk about and are super excited about it's in our bull case for 2023 isn't it David uh sign in with ethereum and we've got the perfect guest to help us out with this topic Wayne Chang is the co-author of the sign in with ethereum EIP it's called eip4361 that is the ethereum Improvement proposal that is uh proposing the properties of sign in with ethereum and he's also the co-founder and CEO of spruce which is a company that's working to grow this very important standard and what signing with ethereum is doing is trying to make the internet more user first uh Wayne welcome backless thanks so much for having me this is great well I want to start with a big question in people's minds um identity on the Internet is identity on the internet broken today we have to first Define what identity means because that's a very overloaded word and means a lot of things to different people right so um there's definitions from like standards organizations like NIS niso that say identity is a set of attributes around an entity how useful is that you know maybe to certain implementers there are other groups that have other opinions about identity um I'm just talking about because we're talking about technical specification what some technical organizations think they're non-technical interpretations of course but um some more useful and holistic definitions for example our identity is the way that we recognize remember and respond to people and things so broader than just a really technical definition right so and typically identity is only useful in the context functional identity versus so-called foundational identity that you're a human on this Earth maybe it's part of a nation is uh something closer to foundational identity in semantics but functional identity hey I want to you know show that I can drive this car or I want to go to the bank and access my account or I want to log in and see my cat pictures in storage somewhere right those are more functional identity oriented a conversation that we've had on Bank lists frequently we've had this conversation with Chris Dixon it's come up a number of times in Bank list is that the internet was not built with a native payments system there was not money on the internet when we created it and as a result of that that's had some Downstream effects it's created the advertising model it's turned internet going adventurers into commodities for these big applications like Facebook and Instagram I'm wondering Wayne if it's a fair to frame this conversation that we're about to have as similar to the internet was also not built with identity Primitives in it from day one either and the downstream effects of that are kind of the Paradigm that we find ourselves in today with web2 log in with Facebook log in with Twitter log in with Instagram is that like a fair kind of foundation for setting setting the table of this conversation I think that's very fair and another example of sort of the vestigial artifacts from arpanet when you had a bunch of Highly trusted universities setting up networks to talk to each other and there was is just inherent trust speeds you basically knew everyone as part of that Network you did not have to do that much adversarial thinking to make those systems secure because you know you had local trust but as we scaled up you know those things weren't baked into the core protocol and we're starting to run into those problems and there's some Market solutions to those things sometimes with adverse incentives so yeah I think that's a pretty good description of why we are where we are now can we talk a little bit about um identity because I I do want to get to that that question of uh is identity on the internet broken but I still feel like we're in the definitional phase of what identity on the Internet is practically what is identity on the internet I think I guess my identity in the real world is let me see it's it's probably uh there's a nation state component to it so I have a driver's license and a passport and social security number and I'm an American citizen I'm also a Canadian citizen so I have a Canadian passport as well that's a piece of it it's also somewhat socially defined I suppose like when we say like I identify as right and I might identify as a particular gender or a particular like religious affiliation or I certainly identify as uh probably a a crypto native an etherean um somebody from the kind of the bankless nation these are all identities that I have but I also personally identify as a you know a dad for instance uh and uh you know someone on the internet would say I also identify as an AI that is under a much dispute um but like what what do we mean when we say so that's a real world but what do we mean when we say identity on the internet I guess for for me it would be like okay well I have an email address and that is some sort of identity and if it's a Gmail account that I can sign in with my Google account in places I have an Apple ID maybe um I have a probably a Facebook idea I have a Twitter ID I have a password manager with all of these identifications I suppose to all of these various uh web applications um and then I also have like you know social media profiles that sort of tell you who I am so maybe LinkedIn is my professional presence and Twitter is kind of like you know I don't know what Twitter is it's some kind of Bio combination of whatever I am on Twitter but what what is the what is the digital identity and how does that energy intersect with the like what are we actually talking about today in the current state when I even asked the question of is identity on the internet broken what is identity on the internet yeah and I think part of the answer to what is identity on the internet has to do with what are you trying to do right and depending on that a lot of things are relevant or not identity is just such a contextual thing that you really need to describe scenarios whether it's even you know you have to present your password somewhere to get into another country that is a scenario that makes that part of you relevant and as you alluded to having a professional presence you have different identities for different contexts in your life when you're with your family it's probably a different personality even than when you're at work think about your work slack versus maybe you're hanging out with people on Discord or in a WhatsApp group it's a different Dynamic and you bring different aspects of yourself to those places right so it's not necessarily the case that you can just have you know everything in every context and would make sense to people in fact when you're you know your work self you actually don't want to bring up a lot of things that might not be relevant if you're just trying to do your job and a good one at that likewise you don't want to bring your work stuff necessarily to social media sites where you're just really trying to enjoy the personal side of your life right so these different areas where you already have different digital presences I think are important to consider when we talk about identity so that's what identity is on on the internet then too it's sort of similar it's I guess the um aggregation of all of these various logins I have something like something to that effect is is that really what we're talking about it's my Gmail account my my Twitter account my Facebook account and all of the and Instagram and all of these things is that what identity is and if so who owns these are they mine are they somebody else's yeah and I would say it's some combination of those and preferably the point of view is that you should own those and decide where and when those things show up kind of like having a hand in poker and deciding which cards to reveal and what situation right so that's how we'd really like the internet to work instead of a lot of things being controlled uh outside of your purview if it's especially about you I think as we're trying to get down to the basement of things which we love doing on Bank lists getting down to all the way down down to the the core Primitives of what makes the world tick it's important to note that your identity is something infinite and unconstrained and Limitless like who you are as a person is very different in almost any different scenario be it on the Internet or in the real world sometimes uh to use my co-founder as an example he plays the role of dad sometimes he plays a role of podcaster uh sometimes he plays the role of investor sometimes he combines these things I'm sure he has musical tastes these are all different things that make up humans and that also transcends across time and it can also be constrained by the systems the social structures that we uh inhabit in this world so we talked about a form of identity as like the nation state like the nation-state bestows upon you a nation state approved identity at Birth here is your identity it is the this passport number a37421 or your social security number or your phone number and so you are given your identity by nation state inside of the nation state context and that is actually a constraint on identity because of course you are not just the person that the nation state believes you to be you are not just a social security number and so it's important to note that your identity is infinite it's expressive it's adaptive it changes over time you select it you control it and then also we have our social structures that we exist inside of our nation states our web 2 apps that limit our ability to express who we are and so Wayne I want to ask you the question how has over the trajectory over the Internet these what can we do an audit of this state of identity in the internet perhaps we can keep this to web too because the structures that we have Google Facebook Twitter these previous other like login with you know insert your Silicon Valley Tech Giant here what is the state of Iden on the internet today like can you do an audit for us on this yeah is it broken yeah is it broken so um average person has maybe a hundred passwords to manage according to one survey in 2021 from wordpass and um because of so many ux issues onboarding Services forgotten passwords a lot of people have opted to give that job of you know a testing for their login to an entity typically a large tech company popular ones include Facebook Google Apple Twitter is emerging but I don't have exact statistics right now um but a lot of these use a protocol to called oauth 2 under the hood which allows you to delegate access to resources that was the purpose of it so oauth 2 was invented because of the problem where you have a photo sharing website and you have a different website that does Printing and if you want to print those photos you can either download all those photos and retitle them printing site or maybe there's a way for the printing site to talk to the photo sharing site directly right in the land before oauth 2 we would basically give the password to the printing site and they would basically log in on our behalf right and there's a lot of horrible security things with this so we want to move away from just giving passwords to those systems although it's still in place in some places on the internet today but that became oauth 2 and then some clever people thought about what if we could also include a set of photos identity information as part of the payload that you could give as a resource right and that's how we got to open ID connect which is the dominant identity protocol on the internet today governed by the openid foundation now the really interesting thing about openid connect is if you talk to a lot of the developers and Architects of it they always wanted a decentralized internet where you'd have a bunch of identity providers that you could have an account with and you could sign in with this service that was I think the intended effect of a lot of those Architects but what happened was uh a few intermediaries that played these roles started to grow and grow and they had these Network effects that caused them to be pretty dominant and that's where we're left with today with a lot of people using those services and what's interesting about it is I think that people are giving up a lot more control than they realize so if you have you know a Gmail account they use for everything and you sign in with Google in places if at any point you lose that Gmail account it's not just Google services that you lose access to it's basically potentially anything you use that Gmail account to sign up with Right Use the forgot password button will be broken for you because you can't access your email anymore and it's uh maybe could be preempted to reset across all your accounts right so that's a big level of trust I don't know if everyone is comfortable with that they're taking maybe some people are and that's fine but we think it should be a choice so we think that moving towards more direct authentication systems like signing with ethereum without an intermediary is a very exciting proposal and we've gotten a lot of alignment with the ecosystem on this when you say lose access to something like Gmail in that category of lose access what what are we talking about I mean you could also be like censored by something like Google it doesn't have to be you for getting your Gmail password it could be someone just a system administrator or someone who has access in a for all the great controls that we hear about we constantly hear about stories and these large tech companies where some employee had unauthorized access to a certain spot or some kind of system failure cause this thing to happen right or even there was a request by this other entity and they had to do this and all of a sudden your access is gone there's a lot of there's a long trail of this happening on the news articles and that's the point you don't own that identity that authentication Google does that's right and if we would look at Silicon Valley as like a topology of size of tech companies you kind of have the big ones right Facebook Google uh Apple's probably in there uh Twitter's Twitter's up there and then there's like a bunch of smaller like Silicon Valley apps that probably use these bigger companies to log in with right so um canva Pinterest uh might be having a like a login with Facebook or a login with Google button and then so all of these like smaller web 2 apps use the bigger web 2 apps for identity right they've outsourced the need for identity to these bigger web 2 apps uh putting on like a finance brain it kind of feels like the banking system where we have these commercial Banks look Wells Fargo uh JP Morgan Chase and they are signed up with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve kind of dictates everything like they give you give or take away accounts right and so does your Commercial Bank gives over takeaway accounts from you and so what you're saying with like because of this convenience a lot of like our identity systems if you choose to like log in with Gmail or Facebook whichever provider you choose whichever Central Bank of identity that you choose uh everything Downstream breaks if you get D platform there and so you've given like these Central authorities custodianship over your internet identity and that's just like a bank is it fair to consider these like web 2 apps banks for our our identity I think it's fair with two caveats that I can think of now one there's no oversight body for it like there is for banks and even if you have one it's you know how effective can it be and it's not FDI insured either so if you lose it you know what what recourse do you have okay so that are some some of the risks and drawbacks we definitely see that bankless listeners understand the Perils of centralization what about just like user data and other just risks and drawbacks of web 2 based login that we haven't touched on is there anything that we should really touch on before we move on yeah one thing that I really think about and we'll get to this uh probably later in the conversation too is just how much Innovation are we stifling it's always really easy to see the stuff that's there and then you lose it but what about the stuff that could be there and now it can't be there because we have the current rails that are in place right and how I'm thinking about this is once you sign in sometimes you get the dialogue that says do you want to share this part of your account right and it is convenient um for a lot of people to do that but if you are a large tech company and you provide let's say a storage service or a photo service do you really want to let the user share from a different photo storage that they like and not the one that's part of your you know closed ecosystem I think there are a lot of interesting incentives that have to happen when one company controls the end-to-end login experience for you know billions of people pretty literally and uh there are some commercial interests at play too so this kind of differing of incentives and principal agent problems I think is at the very core of it and when you move to these decentralized direct authentication methods and you have the right protocols to let the user build up their entire login experience and what data gets imported or not then I think a lot more is possible and Wayne are you also saying if I kind of talk about uh you know second order effects there is like are these big tech companies also incented to keep you in their wild garden incented to like um promote their identity platforms as the single identity I would imagine imagine that would help them establish a moat around their Core Business this and kind of block out competitors blackout Innovation are you saying that there's a negative uh incentive at play here too I think there is a negative well yeah there's a positive incentive for a company to build up with their internal Network effects right more stickiness through that uh more um ability to have people use the systems every day and um also it works so nicely with all the other pieces the ecosystem right away and it's more difficult for other services so yes I think there's a natural world Garden effect here just uh one last bit of housekeeping while we're on kind of definitions and the existing problem before we talk about signing with ethereum is um can you tell us the difference between this term identity which we've talked about so much and this other term authentication so what's the difference between identity and authentication yep and I will add two more just so we have a complete set of stuff to talk about right so let's talk about identity versus identifier right so Wayne Spruce id.com that's an identifier for me right that's something that I can type into a computer an ethereum address You could argue is an identifier right but an identity is so much more complex than that as David said it's just pretty boundless and very contextual for us to even talk about it right so um that's one difference in other examples of identifier would be ens name a domain name something like that that's correct yeah any kind of uh thing that you can use as a digital handle and you can use that to um you know maybe one identity is associated with many identity of fires right I wouldn't raise my phone number an identifier yeah it can be considered an identifier um it's kind of used in relation to the context in the system so if you know sometimes you might log into a reservation service for a restaurant and that's your main identifier and then we have the pair of authentication and authorization and I'll tell you how that's related to Identity and identifiers so what's authentication authentication is basically being able to determine if someone is who they're claiming to be right and there are three ways to do that that we know of if you discover a new category as a listener please get in touch because you know you will win mini prizes and things uh because what we've determined and the identity ecosystem so far has been something you know like a password or uh you know secret phrase something you have maybe a UB key that you carry or something that you are and that starts to get into Biometrics um you know things that you can't change about yourself so easily like how you walk um your retina Etc many of the things all the modes of authentication seem to fall into these three broad categories uh sometimes you know you squint which one it's in but using a bunch of these factors in real life or on the Internet were able to identify that someone is uh who they say they are who they're claiming to be or who we think they are and that's authentication right so the Practical authentication for a lot of people is a username would be the identifier maybe or it could be authentication and then password that would be the something you know category which is you know the vast majority of ways we uh we log in and then if you add a two-factor authentication on top of that so if you guys are familiar with um something like Google Authenticator or using your phone number as a second factor of authentication is that tied to device and when would that be authentication for something you have sort of like my device I have this I have my mobile phone so I can I can type in this this code that generates every 60 seconds and then that's the second Factor when we talk about two-factor authentication right that's completely correct yeah cool uh identifier authentication authorization what's next yeah so we may use identifiers in the process of authentication to see that oh yeah that's the identity right confirmed identity and after we have an idea about who we're dealing with we're able to understand what they might be able to do in the system um maybe they log into a website as the administrator or a basic user right those two different roles have different privileges within the system so basically that's what authorization is now that we've identified who signed into the system we can figure out what they have discretion over so it's basically what you can do it's kind of your role right do you have the ability to on Reddit post a comment or do you have the ability as a Reddit mod to delete comments that would be an example of authorization after you've authenticated then you're authorized to do a particular set of things within this ecosystem is that correct yeah that's right and drawing back to the example we're talking about before when you're signing in with a service they are basically the proof point so let's say you sign in with your login service you go to a resource and the resource it says Hey prove to me that you're actually logged in and you are who you say you are and then the login service will attest or not that you signed in correctly that's how these sign in with whatever Services work got it okay now you said there were four is the fourth just identity oh yeah just identity yeah and yes so okay which is everything else we were talking about earlier yeah it's it's a notoriously difficult um term to Define even for people working in identity so now moving the conversation to sign in with ethereum I guess based on those definitions what is the scope of sign in with ethereum we'll talk about what it does and what it is but since we just talked about the definitions does that give us the identifier is that authentication is that authorization is it identities the full packages all four of these pieces or just a part of it how I would put it is that all these pieces are part of the identity puzzle right and nothing will just head on tackle identity in its entirety I think it's piecewise is the best approach as well um so sign in with ethereum uses ethereum addresses as identifiers as part of authentication that is all it tries to do it has extensibility so you can work on other things like authorization but sign in with ethereum itself just wants you to be able to prove that you're the controller of this ethereum account or the subtracted account such as for a Dao okay so the I your ethereum address which we can I'm sure at some point uh ens names are going to become relevant in this conversation uh but your ethereum address is 0x1234 is your identifier right as in you are letting that ethereum address represent your who you are represent your person to whatever you are logging in is that a way to think about this that for that session yep and maybe not even a person a machine can use sign in with ethereum with that ethereum account and then what is the authentication part of this yeah so let's talk about wallet connect and not uh connect wallet rather it's a button while connect is a protocol that allows you do it over mobile but I meant to say connect wallet when you go to adapt you'll usually see a connect wallet button and when you press that your wallet pops up usually and you pick which um account you want to use right and then at that point all your wallets doing is telling the DAP front end hey this is my ethereum address for this session right there's no checks being done actually so you could actually spoof and say any ethereum address even if you don't have the private keys to control that ethereum address right so what sign and what ethereum does is it adds an authentication layer on top of that so that you can prove you're actually The Entity that can control that ethereum address and then you can proceed after that and all that is right is signing a message with your private keys right so you're going to a website that is sign in with ethereum enabled that website is like hey what ethereum address are you you give that an ethereum address and it could be any ethereum address but then the next step is to be like okay prove it and that comes with signing a message using the private keys that correspond to that public address and then once you sign that message you can now prove to the website that the address the ethereum address that you gave it is actually the one that you have and then all of a sudden this website knows that you have the private keys to this public ethereum address and that's how we log in with ethereum that's correct yeah um so and I think that some things I will expand on in that is the sign in with ethereum is a technical specification it's kind of like a cookie cutter for how that message looks like for the user to sign and what's really important about standardizing this message format is we can get a bunch of great security and ux benefits from it people have been having ethereum users signed messages to prove they have the key for a long time right as early as 2015-16 probably we've seen open source projects but this Incorporated what signing with ethereum does is got the ecosystem rallied around a common specification for it that cookie cutter template and when we can get everyone to agree on that including dapps including wallets then really magical stuff happens for ux and security for example is that like a standard like oauthn is that what we're talking about so signing with the theorem is a standard and we actually use a lot of the same terminology in standards authorship that they use at ITF in fact we lean upon several ietf that's another standards body that where um oauth was published we use a lot of those same terms inside of theorem and so we're going through the same process in web 2 I was at the time too young to really care or know about how the the standards of oauth came together uh but I'm at the perfect age to watch how the standards of sign in with ethereum are coming together is that really the frontier that's the frontier that we're on right now right we are trying to get people in alignment in consensus with the sign in with ethereum standard and that's what you're doing at Spruce is that a fair illustration I would say that we have progressed pretty far in that and we have um hundreds of applications in production that you sign in with ethereum and major wallets you know actively working on support for signing with ethereum um standards are based on network effects though if no one uses a standard it doesn't really matter right but if everyone's using it all of a sudden it's really useful so it's a coordination game for sure you're you're about to say uh Wayne that once you have the you know some sort of standardization like something like sign on sign in with ethereum then you get some benefit and you're going to give an example of of that benefit what is it what are you going to say so there are three main benefits um two really really direct ones one is more of an extensibility benefit so the first benefit is ux if wallets can identify the exact format they're expecting for a sign in message then they can make a really nice ux for a user to sign in if you've ever signed a weird plain text message in your wallet it doesn't feel comfortable and you're not quite sure necessarily what's going on unless you really understand the DAP but if this is just the standard across all apps and wallets can just recognize this format and it literally looks like a login button that's a much nicer user experience for people than trying to dissipher a message with a bunch of technical bits in it and the second thing is security sorry just to really drill this point home is that there is a number of different ways to input your ethereum address and sign a message across many different apps uniswap.app you know compound like you open C and but what you're saying is those are all individually like one-off Solutions and so as a result of those one-off Solutions how it's presented to the user inside of your Ledger inside of metamask is also a one-off solution and then you're saying that that makes the user uncomfortable because like okay I'm used to assigning messages but each message is incongruent with each other it's a new experience every single time and I think what you're saying is like the repeatability of keeping with a single sign in with ethereum standard can start to make users feel good about what they are doing and experiencing which is they are just logging into a website and it's totally fine you're not giving permission to have your wallet drained exactly and that's where a lot of the wallet draining problems come from in our industry when people just blindly sign things you know because they're used to signing things they don't understand and I'd love for us as an ecosystem to get out of that habit 100 and I cut you off before you were going to go and listen to another one so what keeps going down this line well uh we get better ux and we get better security too because if the wallet can basically uh inspect the data inside that message to be signed we can add guarantees right so if example.org wants you to sign in with ethereum right the wallet can identify that message structure pull out example.org or whatever other domain is there and make sure that we're being served this by example.org proper over a secured connection not a man in the middle that's going to you know example2.org trying to get us to sign a message so they can impersonate us with example.org so this property is really important it's called domain binding because it's bound to that domain and the wallet will just reject or give you a big red flag like if you go to a website with a bad certificate saying hey this is you know totally wrong are you sure you want to do this and so is uh is this the end of this story it's like all right we got web 2 login to log in with Facebook log in with Google we can just replace it with sign in with ethereum and like boom end of podcasts are are we done here because I feel like we're actually just like scratching the tip of the iceberg can you kind of give us a preview of what's what's below the water about the implications of this yeah so signing with ethereum is just the beginning just the first step the top of a very very wide funnel and I of additional parts of the tech tree that'll bring us towards a more user controlled identity system and internet I think and it has a lot to do with what I mentioned about unbundling the login right instead of just one or two you know systems controlling how the end-to-end login experience works this is the kind of file sharing that you can use these are the kinds of photo services that you're allowed to bring in um these are the contact lists that you can you know share after you sign in with X right we want to let the user Define the entirety of that across whatever Services they want because the only two folks that should have to agree on what to share is the user and the service they're talking to right why is there an awkward intermediary in the middle who has a ton of discretion over what can be part of the session what can't be part of the session and can we do that all in a secure Manner and also improve privacy properties uh better than what we have today in web 2. so thinking about how we move away from you know users logging into platforms to how do we get platforms to start logging to users data volts any Data Vault that they want to bring to the equation right that's the direction that we want to see a shift in wait can you can you run that bias again so what is the Paradigm Shift there I just want to make sure listeners understand the implications of that so today when you're logging into a service maybe a big social media platform or something they will have this uh database it might be many databases collaborating but it's all under the domain of that organization that company right all under their control and typically you get access to that at their discretion right and instead of you getting access to a big Silo like that and you know them being in control of if you get access or not we'd rather see people bring their own data vaults with them to services okay so I'm logging into Instagram and that enables me to get access to all of my Instagram files uh photos whatever or maybe perhaps um I'm logging into Dropbox and all of my files in Dropbox are there that's where we are now how is this relationship inverted to the point where like I'm actually bringing my own data to these platforms what does it mean to walk us through that again what does it mean to bring your Data Vault somewhere yeah so if you Dropbox is a great example so if you go to so typically Dropbox can be very useful for people when let's say you're adding an attachment to your email right some email Services have a DropBox integration and you can fetch it from there well why can't you just fetch it from any service that speaks this data file sharing protocol you know and you can just plug it in and it can be hosted wherever you want doesn't have to be on a domain that's approved you can just add it as part of your session because you're approving it right so that's the idea that you can bring it with you and things aren't solid by default this is uh I'm just running through this in my my head coming from kind of a D5 world right and so like you know bankless listeners will will know one thing we've been so excited about with with D5 is of course you bring your your assets and your money with you and we can we can plug those assets and that money via private key into you all sorts of different user interfaces so you can plug that into xerion or or zapper or defy LOM or whatever it spins up this is very different than the Wells Fargo banking experience where I have to log into Wells Fargo they have my money and they create this user interface wrapper but they have the money they have all of my money I don't have I'm not bringing it with me I'm accessing it through their app whereas in the if you're wanting to send your money to Robinhood you have to take your money out of the Wells Fargo Vault and put it into the room get their permission please sir can I have my money whereas with with D5 what's so exciting is you have your assets on with your private keys and you just plug that into whatever interface that you want and one other side benefit is of course so we see the the D5 user interface uh you know going through like rapid improvements I don't think I remember the last time that my bank interface improves like it's just same old crappy thing that it was 10 years ago and 10 years before that it just hasn't improved whereas with defy interfaces they're all competing with one another to have the best interface that I'm willing to bring my private keys to and plug into this is a similar I think and what you're saying is the user has sovereignty the user has sovereignty of their money now these are sovereignty of their data and their identity profile and they bring that with them into the App instead of the app housing this are we starting to understand the picture here yep I think that's exactly it and then you can further beg the question well where do these data volts live if it's so decentralized right and I think it's a natural question to ask and we are really excited by certain architectures that are enabled by public blockchains for this so if you have a smart contract and you can edit a little section of it and in that section you can put in a list of computers allowed to replicate your data right running the same protocol that becomes the governance for your storage so you can hire vendors you can do things like encrypt your data before storing it and that is how you maintain control over your Data Vault because if you don't trust any of the vendors at some point you can just even run your own if it's open source software it speaks the same protocol even if it's in your basement you can replicate to that new node and eject anyone from that smart contract so you ultimately retain governance over your data and even better if it's encrypted form for a lot of use cases so this would be a world where I could encrypt my data store it in ipfs or I could go higher AWS or Google cloud or Microsoft or whomever I want but it's all encrypted and they just serve it to me as a commodity and if all of that fails then I could just host the this on my own servers and and still access it because it's my Data Vault and better yet um the the resource resolution is based on a smart contract address right so there's no domain name to fight over no Central entity is to fight over for DNS control and you can even solve the zuku's triangle part of human readability if you get an unes name and you tag it to that smart contract right so there are a lot of things possible we think about systems that look at public blockchains as a root of governance we'll we'll get into uh Zuko's triangle that's named after uh Zuko Wilcox we've had him on the on the podcast not too long ago uh but but Wayne this is probably I think one of those things those these dynamics that probably breaks people's brains if they're not ready for it like uh telling people who are outside of the world of crypto about the relationship between like oh no you hold your assets and then all of these Financial Services have to come to you uh that's not something intuitive and they're not going to understand unless they actually start to experience and play around with crypto and I'm guessing a lot of people are like okay I kind of understand the pattern I get it I can just custody my own data I really I resonate with the whole like web 2 uh service providers like Facebook and Twitter Are banks for our identity and now we can store our own identity but I think it's still going to be confusing to listeners to say like all right like you have your data but how does that date what what's an example of that data that represents your identity like what is that thing that is in in our little Data Vault that like what's the story that users can listen to relate to to help them understand what that means well I think the big one of the big topics in decentral sorry in digital identity not just thinking about decentralized systems but just broadly digital identity over the next year is going to be the mobile driver's license in Associated Technologies we started to see the rollout of a lot of these Pilots um and there are technical standards happening at ISO that have to do iso's International standards organization determining how do you get your physical driver's license onto your phone so you can use it for a lot of use cases including you know if you're at a traffic stop if you're online Etc right so how this is going to work is that uses cryptography just like blockchains do and their DMVs are going to cryptographically sign a data packet that says you know these are the facts about your driver's license height weight you know even address and that is an example of the data being stored and there's uh really I think user forward ways of doing this and making sure that this is all under your control in your devices never accessed without your permission and there are other ways of doing it where maybe you start making a honey pot of central database containing all of it for Access by a variety of actors right so we always want to see us leaning towards these sign pieces of information that represent who you are to being under the control of the user and those are the protocols that we're trying to architect and combine with ethereum accounts and other things that people like to use you use the term datavault to describe what this is like okay so if the DMV can sign a message saying all right this guy's got a driver's license you can put that signed message into your Data Vault and all of a sudden your datavault has an object in it and that object can prove to whoever you authorize the access to that you've got this driver's license and I'm assuming this can really unfold in many many many different ways I think really the point here is that users now have and I I'll call it an identity Vault an identity Vault of uh there's a place for you to put things that you choose represent you and through the gate of your ethereum address and private key you can gate that to whoever asks is that am I on track with this metaphor yeah definitely just wanted to add some a bit of clarification too um so depending on what kind of information it is and what are the security requirements around storing it right because personally I would never want my driver's license to leave my device I don't want it to be on a cloud or anything like that right I wanted to kind of even be bound to the device so that if I lose it I just go get another one don't want people to be able to pretend I'm me but if I have a grocery loyalty card or I have um or if I've completed uh if I've Associated my Twitter account to my ethereum account and that statement has been signed off on I'm more comfortable having that sync across my different devices through a Data Vault that can contain a cloud component but whether that Data Vault is restricted to your device and everything has to live there or you're allowing a cloud component to it that should be under your governance and you should decide that along with but there are security requirements of the credentials are sure are there are there any other examples that we could talk to really just drive this point home as to like useful data that one would put in their Data Vault because we're not talking about I'm like I'm not using my identity Vault to like store the the photos that I took on my iPhone because there's a bunch of photos that are just screenshots that I should really just delete uh are like are there other like use cases that that you guys pass around on the spruce team that are good examples of identity data that you would put in your Vault yeah and it's a combination of identity data but any other data too where it's basically um I think this is one of the pieces that we need to get web3 ux to the level uh and even exceed web 2. how many times do you go to adapt again you have to import another token list or Point things or have to set an entire mess of settings for D5 apps that's like liquidity settings for music apps that's you know other preferences if you could just bring that with you no matter where you are go to a different music app your top artists are still there you know that really helps the ux because today dapps don't have anywhere to store the data because they just write to the public blockchain but a combination of that where you can write to the blockchain but also kind of like a hybrid mode you can authorize parts of your Data Vault to come part of your session we have data storage all of a sudden without compromising on any of our values of decentralization vitalikin his recent article that was applications that excite me on his blog post he talked about identity but he was bearish about identity platforms yet bullish on identity and really the point that he was trying to drive home is that web 3 identity he's extremely bullish on the for the you know the future development but no one can really Define what identity is and when you tell me there is a Data Vault that you can put data into I think one of the reasons why people might get confused by that is because data is such a broad category and that's kind of the beauty of it of there is no way to confine identity into any one specific rule set or like or like it can be it's generalizable and so one of the the reasons why ethereum excites me Beyond Bitcoin is because it's generalizable it's Turing complete you can do anything with it and going back to what I was saying with identity at the very beginning identity is you said boundless there are no limitations as to what your identity could be and so maybe that's a fair way to really drive this point home of what a Data Vault is is it can be anything and it's anything that you choose for it to go into and it's I think really just a matter of these various service providers learning how to put data into these identity vaults and have other service providers find that data useful is that really the the hard problem of adoption here yeah and that's exactly why we're in the web 3 and app ecosystem for the for the reasons that Ryan mentioned earlier there are just so many different verticals experimenting with new ways of doing things day to day that we are seeing experiments across verticals like health records and legal identification Enterprise data we're seeing a lot of dapps focus on artists and music Etc these are all different types of resources that need to be shared in this more open and decentralized way across different Platforms in order to make it work and build resilient systems we need to hone in on specific use cases you know prove out that it works across you know sharing one thing to other for example if you can share the entirety of you know the MP3 files that you have on your music mixer dap to another one and import it we have figured it out for that very Niche vertical and that can expand out to other categories and mix and match so to the extent that we can experiment and have more fast iterations you know that really helps the evolution here uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop Wayne can we talk about um you know putting some because we're talking about uh some futuristic stuff right the world we live in is still a world very much of web 2 and we're talking about signing with ethereum we're talking about this idea of self-sovereign decentralized identity that an individual controls and they bring data vaults with them I I want to ask you about kind of the you know maybe the the medium to long-term future the Farah future if sign in with ethereum is maximally successful and we achieve the vision that you and the team and all of the developers around the world are working towards what does that look like what does the future of starting with ethereum actually look like and I want to ask some specific questions I'm going to do this in kind of a lightning round because I want people internet users today uh to get a picture of what this world looks like so my first thing is um how would I log in with social media apps does this mean there's a I can log in with a username password I can log in with my Google Facebook ID and then I can also log in with ethereum just sign in with ethereum and I go like I hit the metamask transaction I hit the thing on my ledger I hit my uh you know something on my mobile phone and boom I'm signed in well since you asked for the very strong version of it Ryan uh what what happened was would be that you generate a completely new identifier just for that interaction that's not correlated with anything and you don't you don't actually need to have any transactions to spawn a new ethereum address you just make a new one and you can sign in with that we can then associate other data that you want to to that session um and you can bring in parts of your portable social media graph if you're signing in with ethereum to a service and it supports the extensions that are under development then you'd be able to bring in a bunch of signed statements that represent things like follows likes tweets and you can bring that as part of your session that is a new eth addresses spawn that means there's no Trail essentially I'm not linking any other privacy leaking data to that and that's the strong version of this but the ability to sign into any of these social media apps is is the picture you're painting yeah it's not yeah it's not just one and then you have to depend on the data inside the database but you just have your whole graph with you right okay what does this mean for password managers that's a the bane of my existence you said earlier that the you know the average password people have are 100 I think I must be a little above average at least in the password category um people use password managers for this thing I don't know if you've been tracking the success of password managers LastPass just got freaking hacked again a month ago leaked all of this data like uh people you know freaking out as a result of that and you know as they should be does this mean passwords go away you were talking about this idea of authentication which is something you haven't uh something you you you um know and something you have password is something you know and now we've moved it we've done kind of a hot Swap and now it's something you have right because private key is not something you know I don't know what private key is but it's something I have um so does that mean we obviate and we kill passwords and password managers we've been trying to kill passwords for like a decade now and it hasn't worked yet so I think that there's still going to be a long tail of passwords floating around but I think that there will be fewer and fewer passwords as we see more passwordless login Solutions make their way into the market right and I think for password managers in particular they do have an opportunity to move up market and start helping with other forms of data autofilling things managing credentials being part of this whole idea of a Data Vault right that is I think a really good progression I think one of the art police heels though is that they haven't necessarily needed to innovate on the custody side so much some of them have decent recovery flows but I've just seen so much more investment in this category in web 3 and the walls we have here different multi-party compute Solutions social recovery mechanisms these abstraction abstracted accounts that allow a smart contract to participate in key recovery custody and ux are probably the two biggest problems in identity in web 3. well let's look at that right now because we're again we're talking about the strong version of this where we're signing with ethereum is maximally successful does this mean I'm using metamask uh to log in with everything am I using a hardware wallet um what happens if I lose my private Keys uh or if I I pass away like this age of problem is like metamask is great for what it is but it's not yet ready for Mass adoption for everybody using it in for like for sign in is there a different feature that a fully realized version of this would uh would paint yeah and um it's not necessary that you use a particular wallet you can use the wallet of your choice whether the market evolves for it and supports it um you know that's what you're looking at so I think that in the strong version of it you don't actually have to pick from the wallet selection screen anymore it just kind of knows and it's a lot more transparent right because you've already set up what you like to log into that website with in the strong version of this too do we have um smart contract wallets where we have like you know recovery social recovery type features because that's a fear people have as well as my God what if this sign with the theorem was my password to everything and I lose my private keys I'm totally like what happens to me then we frequently talk about like the dystopian nature of like China and like disappearing people right but if you get the ex like exact similar relationship with being disappeared if you just lose your private Keys like that's bad we don't want that yeah so today we already support uh something called Dao login where someone can log in on behalf of a Dao and uh what yeah so a lot of dows have these delicate lists that they um typically you can log in on behalf of a dow if you're on that list but then a smart contract and that allows you to you know administer bounties or manage your relationship with the service as the doubt not you not you so we support that workflow based on the smart contract in in principle you could just have a list for yourself and rotate keys out so we have the ink links and beginnings of this already I think okay so again maximally successful here's a pain point that I have uh in my current state I was telling David uh the other day that I've just been opening up some Exchange accounts right and in order to authenticate me they need my nation state uh identification which is basically my uh a JPEG of my driver's license and then I have to look in the camera and smile and get a selfie right and that doesn't feel very secure to me because if anyone has those JPEG files they could do the same thing in open account somewhere else yeah do we get rid of that in this maximally successful version of signing off the role of zero and all is proofs will only increase in identity in my opinion we have some clumsy ways to do selective disclosure today for example one of the Privacy benefits of a mobile driver's license and other forms of credentials you don't when you're at the bar you don't need to show the whole thing right and that's a big problem for people who don't want the bartender or whoever to see their address because why do you need to look at that just to see if you can drink in the US which is over 21 right so and these solutions that are start that the tech industry is working on a lot of the Privacy maximalists are making sure that we're putting just Fields over 21 just proving that you can easily imagine if you're familiar with zero knowledge proofs a little bit how you might be able to prove that in a zero knowledge uh way where you have maybe a date of birth or something and there's some kind of circuit that transforms so you can see if you're over 21 or not right I just basically my driver's license is proving that I'm a citizen of the United States I'm not on an of fact sanctions list basically so you're saying I could do that privately using sign in with ethereum zero knowledge proofs rather than you know my selfie so um two parts to that but I think I think yes you could do that and the zero knowledge proofs can happen completely uh independent as part of this digital credential right and it could be enabled for zero knowledge proofs but then you might use sign in with ethereum if you wanted to if you wanted to associate it with your ethereum address or you decide not to do it and just to really drive drive this point home because I remember I remember I think I was listening to a podcast when I had the same aha moment and it was that bartender metaphor that really did it for me where you're going into a bar and you're The Bard the bouncer or the bartender says hey can I see your ID so you give them uh your ID and what do you do when you give them your ID you give them your date of birth you give them your home address you give them your weight your height your eye color there's a bunch of extra information that you give this bartender and you actually don't even need to give the bartender your date of birth you just need to prove to them that you are older than 21 years you don't need to tell them how old you just need to prove on a binary yes or no basis yes I'm older than 21 years old and so Wayne what you're saying you you can do is you can take that data of a driver's license put it in your identity Vault and then if this exchange website that Ryan's trying to sign up for wants to understand that yes I am a citizen of the United States and I'm not on an ofac list you can put that through a zero knowledge proof and out of that zero knowledge proof comes a binary answer saying Ryan Sean Adams is a citizen of the United States and he's not on a no fact list and it doesn't give that exchange any more information beyond that and I think there was a term for that that you used I think it was like minimal minimal disclosure or something there's like an ethos about this that's in the this world can you talk about that yeah so Kim Cameron is uh commonly has his laws of identity which has minimal disclosure as part of that and it's a lot of the principles of uh people with a decentralized identity ecosystem so I think another important thing to talk about is what is privacy because that's something people say over and over again ad hominem but no one really sits down and talks about what they mean by it right so um I think speaking of other ideas that we like to draw upon in this ecosystem there's an author Helen isenbaum who writes about contextual integrity that's her book and in that she has a definition of privacy that she works off of and that definition is having appropriate control over information flows so it means that you're what expecting to happen happens you may be your medical records can be shared from your physician to a specialist but maybe not to an Advertiser right so having appropriate control of your information flows might even mean that you have an ens name that you like to be public and associated with your public Twitter presence in that definition that could achieve privacy because it's doing what you want to do in terms of disclosure but about some of these uh big problems the world is facing right now um I'm wondering if signing with ethereum has a role to play here and uh let's talk about too it seems to me there's a big problem Twitter is seeing this but everywhere is kind of seeing this different Bots propaganda bots of for example how can you tell what's a propaganda bot and what's a real person you know on Twitter something like this and Elon Musk is trying to battle the the Bots with I think much limited success right um does this signing with ethereum solve that problem I think it solves it in that we can allow people to bring the data they want to share as part of their interaction right so if you sign in with ethereum and you had an ethereum transaction at all that creates a really high cost of attack compared to zero right that you paid a gas fee to do something uh that could be used as part of a civil prevention strategy to know that this is not a bot if you did other things and you collected little credentials for it um then you can present those as well so it can combine your on-chain and off-chain data in a way that you choose to you know prove what you want to about yourself this is by the way where I could see nation states getting on board and getting excited about this because I don't think they currently have an internet native way to prevent propaganda Bots from attacking their citizens and swaying elections do they uh no but like this is a solution to that potentially that there's promise in that how about how about the idea of deep fakes um you know so what you know the all the Deep problems if a fake David and Ryan somebody spun this up with you know an AI and and put out a YouTube video that looked just like us and told us to buy whatever scam coin um like this is a huge problem can it solve deep fake problems and like that level of you know authentication yeah so there's one mode we're experimenting with for signing with ethereum where you can spawn a new random key and you can use sign in with ethereum to give it some powers to create credentials issue them or do other things like access a Data Vault we call those session keys and basically if you used a session key to issue a data license that says hey I Ryan say that this is definitely not a deep fake signed off by the same key that everyone knows you as your ethereum account right they can check that there was a root of trust in that ethereum account and it authorized that content to come out and that way anything else could just have screw more scrutiny versus the stuff that you basically attributed as genuine content can we go into session Keys a little bit more like what's a web to correlate for session keys and how how is session Keys kind of uh changing the game with with how it relates to that yeah so I think that session keys are a way to use ethereum addresses to sign other things in ethereum transactions and we don't always want to you know if you have a your private key that's very important and it's in a hardware wallet it's good that there's some friction there before you just sign things willy-nilly right but that creates a ux problem um imagine if you had to use your key to sign for a lot of things like renaming a file in decentralized Dropbox or moving stuff around and every time you've got a wallet prompt to do that that ux is really really difficult to work around and kind of a non-starter so what we can do instead is make a new key in the browser and that's not a very very secure place to keep a key um so we give it far less permissions so we can do far less damage and it expires automatically very similar to a cookie and we can interpret sign in with ethereum request to give limited sets of power to that key in a way that you authorize for that session so that's why we call it a session key and you can use that session key to do things like access your Data Vault you can use it to issue credentials for example if you're on a decentralized social media app and you click follow someone maybe you sign off in a statement that hey I follow this person they get a copy you get a copy it points to a place where you can retract that if you decide to unfollow them and basically you can go on your Merry way with all these credentials of people you've followed and uh your followers you can bring that with you wherever you want right so session keys can enable a lot of things and they shift us towards interactions that are just based on signing and we don't need cookies anymore because cookies are used to maintain sessions can you say that so we don't need cookies anymore so for people who don't know what cookies are right I guess maybe I don't know if we want to go to all the detail but just a quick uh crash course of cookies this is the thing that um apps and websites use to track you from a website to website basically and so they can be used for good ux which is kind of the the general uh you know the Genesis of them but they're also used to kind of like you know store data about you and maintain kind of your identity from place to place in ways that you might not want disclosed um so you just said that this could obviate the need or kill the need for cookies that seem seems like that could be a very good thing for users who want to maintain sovereignty of their own identity and their privacy online am I reading too much into that or is that really what you're saying I um it is more there's some Nuance to it but uh yes we wouldn't need cookies in this model so the types of cookies that really erode privacy happen third-party cookies and the whole advertising industry is figuring out what to do as those go away they are going away so people are panicking third party cooking means that a different website is able to you know plant cookies on you and kind of track you around won't go too much into it but and then there were cookies if you've ever been to an EU website and you know it says allow all cookies or just the ones we need right well just the ones we need are typically used to maintain sessions so when you revisit the website you're still logged in right that is important to the function of the website so they can remember who you are and continue where you left off but I'm saying it's possible to shift to a system where you just show up with your keys again and you can you know sprinkle a little power into a session key and that can improve who you are with any of your interactions without them having to maintain this so-called uh stateful relationship with you having to remember you every time you just sign and Bam it works kind of like sending a transaction to ethereum you don't have to log into ethereum to send a transaction you just make one and it sounds like it's just lowering the barrier to what it would take to have a private key enabled internet experience and so what you're what you're saying is like there's a bunch of use cases where having all of the benefits of what we've been talking about here with the sign in for ethereum podcast uh except there are many many use cases on the internet where even the act of just like a drop down menu in metamask where you click approve is too much time and labor and attention like there are parts of the ways that we navigate through the web where we need it even more seamless than that and so you're saying a session key is this like in the background uh disposable private key that has temporary limited authorizations that allow you to experience the internet in its fullest without having to be prompted to sign a message all the time yeah not only is the ux better but I think there's a huge empowerment element to it too because if you are on line in digital world right and now you're able to make digital statements by signing them cryptographically that is a huge degree of empowerment for example you can do you can do things that you just can't do now what if you wanted to give someone these photos but just for a week you can't hold on to them longer for that how do you represent that you can make a data license that says one week from this date signed by one of your keys and that can be linked back to you right so I think the ability to make digital statements and you can view ethereum transactions as a kind of digital statement is a really important core primitive to moving towards decentralization so this this whole thing is whole Paradigm is called sign in with ethereum but ethereum is a blockchain with like assets and stuff so far I don't think we've talked much about the actual role of the ethereum blockchain as it relates to sign in with ethereum what role does the blockchain play yeah well without ethereum there would not be signing with ethereum first of all but after that um you can think of it as a network effect why do people want to install sign in with ethereum at all right well a lot of the early use cases have to do with we want to see if someone has a certain nft or asset or something so that they can get different treatment in terms of they've got the right nft so they can do this thing so it is authorization for a lot of these services so you said we talked about our Data Vault our identity Vault where we keep data private but maybe our public addresses on ethereum are our data museums as in like hey we'll go look at my nfts and like the other things that I've collected all the PO apps is that a fair way to describe this I think museum is a great word that we should adopt as an industry because it gives exactly the right context because it's there on display right so we can think of that as a base layer that everyone can see and then you can start layering other stuff that you want depending on what digital interaction you're having but but probably prior to this like to sign into a website when again we're using the term sign in with ethereum but you're not making a transaction there's no other use of the ethereum blockchain other than the data Museum utility that we just talked about or is there something else there's like no gas fees right that this requires there's no gas fees so you can make a new ethereum address you can sign in with ethereum it costs you nothing right but um I think that what's exciting about it is you get to use what's established on the blockchain about you but it might also cause you to get more things right what if you can access another airdrop or something because you sign in with ethereum now you're writing back to the blockchain and we think that there's an opportunity to create a virtuous cycle where you're either writing back to the blockchain if you do want to showcase it in a museum or you're writing back to your Data Vault and this allows us to move towards a really decentralized applications okay so Wayne I'm I'm trying to understand a bit more like just uh getting my head wrapped around ethereum's role in this and identity and um you mentioned uh when we brought this up just now a network effect yes so it's almost like um ethereum is kind of like this this um the cedar for the private Keys it's a Bootloader for getting private keys in everybody's hands and how does it do that by ethereum becoming very useful and I have many different ethereum addresses because it's already very useful so I have I I um you know already natively have kind of sign in with ethereum so it's a bootloader I understand that as a piece of it um would it be inaccurate to call ethereum we call it a settlement layer for assets right which is I think definitely the right mental model for what ethereum actually is yeah is it accurate to say it also becomes with signing with ethereum a settlement layer for identity I'm not sure that that's is okay is that accurate or not like does does identity actually require the economic crypto Economic Security properties of ethereum or is that just sort of a byproduct of we just seated the world with a whole bunch of private keys does does my question make sense it does um I do think of ethereum as one of the most successful public key infrastructure adoption events ever right and that has huge implications for folks but in addition to that I don't think it's just that right I think that signing with ethereum is the most natural way for ethereum users to log into Services sure and is there um I think is there a settlement layer for identity which identity is already a loaded term but for part of it for example if we zoom into control of identifiers talking about losing keys and everything there are smart contract wallets they're in a multi-sig it can serve as the base layer for that so you use an abstracted account to sign in with and if you lose any of those keys you can have recovery mechanisms to build it back up right so in a sense that is the settlement layer there are also other settlement layers too if we need human readable addresses like ens names then you might want to have a common namespace that you can't civil attack or have two of something or double spend having the same name right that is an important primitive DNS solves that for the internet why why isn't this then uh log in with Bitcoin or log in with Solana like why aren't we calling it these things so it's important to understand that there are I think a lot of Technology components specific to the ethereum ecosystem that we really thought were constructive in building a decentralized identity ecosystems on top of so I think that the ethereum builders uh have a certain expectation about you know how you've signed messages to begin with we use an eip191 which is personal sign from ethereum and uh Bitcoin doesn't really have something like that maybe one of the bips is similar but then what wallet would I use to sign it with so by being able to really zoom in on which Tech stack we're able to do we're able to have a lot of problems just solve for us like we we wouldn't be able to solve custody the same way that an ecosystem wallets can solve custody right so to add that as part of our dependency tree before we get signed in with whatever to work it's a huge step so we we saw like a very good position in the ecosystem and also as I mentioned before there is adapt developer ecosystem who are excited to build for their users applications in a decentralized way right and these are across different Portables sports are engineering they're like developer Dows and even Transportation tracking um you know car usage and things like that that could really benefit from these ideas of having sessions having data vaults having credentials issued and verified by users layered in with a lot of the stuff that you find in the public blockchain I'm wondering if it takes advantage of some of ethereum's other kind of core features like so here's one great property about ethereum that's great for kind of money censorship resistance money censorship resistant money and that is uptime the thing just never goes down it always runs uh is that important when it comes to signing with ethereum let's say ethereum went down could you still sign in with ethereum um well if just um just with the base account you could but if you have a Dell login or abstracted account and we can no longer look up the smart contract containing if you're actually in the delegated list or not that part would break right so an entire system is built on that would break so it's really important that that stays on for the more advanced functionality to exist in which ethereum does serve as that settlement layer so you're just saying that ethereum is a part of a grander tech stack and some things will break in some things will be fine it will gracefully degrade to a point but I think a lot of the more interesting complex features require an online blockchain and some of them just won't work at all and then how about censorship resistance right it's that's a great property for money as well uh it kind of dovetails with this idea I think of credible neutrality which vitalik has talked about many times that ethereum has and I think here here's a link I'm making in my mind through this episode is um this idea that you want in order to provide a global settlement system for identity let's say or a global platform for identity you want the most credibly neutral platform um you're like known to humanity and so like you can't have a corporation control it because why a corporation is Corporate governance and they can be nefarious they can be evil they're also located in a nation-state what happens if the one nation state goes to war with another nation state for instance well then how can citizens of the warring Nation trust the the the corporation through the original Nation right and so you wanna you wanna put your your identity assets on the most credibly neutral database if I'm even using the right term available and I think that property also comes into play certainly comes into play with money does it also come into play with identity is that instinct correct yeah it's certainly correct um I think we're interested in building identity protocols that are decentralized in that typically in most identity models you have the issuer who writes statements maybe your school says you graduated you have the holder maybe that's you and you have your diploma and you have an employer who wants to check that you went to a certain institution they're the verifier so issuer holder and verifier right and by decentralized identity what I mean most is that you can play any of those roles you can write the fact that you know I know David in a credential and give it to David and David could do the same for you right so you could play the role of issuer you could be a verifier or you can be a holder and systems that are built with this in mind without favoring any kind of uh you know large entities or something across these roles they can just kind of exist neutrally into dependently and kind of a fractal too and those smaller instances can integrate and Federate into larger instances and I think that's a very important property of neutrality and interoperability Wayne are you familiar with um Andreas antonopoulos's Festival of the commons idea yeah yeah so for bankless listeners first you should totally listen to andreas's indianapolis's uh internet of money I listen to it it's an audiobook but it's also a book and he uses this metaphor the Festival of the commons which is supposed to be the opposite of the tragedy of the commons where the more people that are in and engaging with the commons the better it gets and it's partly a metaphor for the ethos of Open Source the more people that contribute the more people that are operating on this thing the better the code becomes and like my gut instinct is telling me that there's something about sign in with ethereum that is aligned with this whole festival of the commons idea and uh when it and I think that really is really about how do we fill up our data vaults our identity faults so that there's like a party in there rather than an empty Vault because like right now I don't have a Data Vault and if I did have a Data Vault I'm not really sure what I would put into it and so I think there's like kind of like this bootstrapping problem where definitely like I'm not going to get a Data Vault because I don't know what to put in there and no one's going to make anything for me to put into that Data Vault because no one has a Data Vault yet but I think I think as soon as this ball starts to roll it starts to go from an empty room into like a you know a party in there is it am I tracking onto something yeah totally and I think that um it's gonna just have to be used case driven so there was very specific use cases that you start with such as you know storing preferences for dapps or being able to bring parts to your social media graph with you and the Data Vault side will just be invisible you know and people working on it should make sure that it is user controlled but you won't really think about it so much you'll just think about oh I'm able to you know load up my SoundCloud account and now all my favorite artists are loaded up because I decided to share that and that's what you wanted to do right the fact that it went through a datavault you control is aligned with the principles but not necessarily to focus on at this point as more and more things get accumulated through these different use cases we're going to find overlaps that you might want to present your Soundcloud account over here or you might want to present the fact that you know you're a member of the stat over there and I think once we start to do that we'll think about how do you manage all the stuff in your Data Vault right so I think that's going to help the emergence over time there's a um a video that we it's been a while since we talked about this video on Bank list but it turned into a meme I think during the bull market and it's of this video of this one guy at some Festival somewhere and he's just dancing we are dancing totally solo he's dancing for like 20 30 seconds and then one more person just decides to be weird and goes and dances with this guy in the middle of this like music festival and then like five seconds later a third person joins and a few seconds later fourth person joins and then as you watch this video the whole entire lawn just like gets up and everyone's like dancing together and it's just like it just needs a little bit of a snowball to like roll and I kind of think that's how we end up filling our data vaults it's just like we have one use case we have two use cases and then this ball starts to roll uh is that how you see this road map going yeah definitely and I think um I think the initial conditions that we need to align it in a Festivus to the commons uh well I think one of the most important things is getting everyone in the same room so we had you know Community calls every month and we still do on Twitter spaces where we have people like engineers and product people and just people who use wallets show up um from wallet companies from dapps users and they're all in the room and listening about you know the problems we're experiencing and we start to reach rough consensus around what are the problems that are important to solve so some of the topics for example is how do you encrypt to an ethereum address right there everyone has a different way of doing that and if we just agreed on one way in the same way that we were able to agree on signing with ethereum and figure out how it interoperates with other parts then no one ever has to solve that problem again and we just kind of get that core piece of the tech tree for free right okay so it sounds like um I'm reminded of the phase in ethereum's roadmap where all the research and development was um done like we know that we can build it now we just have to build it and it kind of sounds like this is where sign in with ethereum is everything is totally the pieces are all laid out it's just now we need to put them together like there's no like hypothetical research that needs to be done it's just a matter of like we need people to come to consensus on things and start implementing standards yep exactly and I think that uh that's another benefit of the ethereum ecosystem we're watching other developments that the EF ethereum foundation and other researchers are working on especially in zero knowledge and we're just seeing Oh wow you could just take a snark and put it in this use case and instantly you have zero knowledge applied to Identity credentials instead of just the blockchain right so uh being able to just LeapFrog like that too is another big benefit so when I would say something like 99.99 of websites that we log into use a web to based login system the thing that we are trying to disrupt um they use identity banks for us to approve our identity to them how do we get uh from where we are now uh to where we want to be we're 99.9 of websites use login to ethereum how do we how do we go from A to B yeah I would say it's a different model of computing that is enabled right you're signing in password list but you also have all this potential bringing your Data Vault bringing your data with you Etc right so um we have to identify the market first for where that actually makes a lot of sense for the applications and right now that's adapts an adjacent application let's call them web3 enabled web 2 platforms as well and for them it's actually the best thing for their user like ethereum users don't want to add their email address or phone number or something they already have an ethereum account it's literally the best way to for them to sign into a service right and then dapps actually a lot of them don't have back-end databases or they'd much prefer the user bring their own right so for these demographics the it's actually the best solution and to the extent that this ecosystem is able to prove out use cases across a bunch of different verticals such as you know our Healthcare Etc and that will accumulate the value of this mode of interaction to the point where you can get enough value proposition to convince other people if I go to you know large companies today who are you know happy with their postgres database and I say the user can bring their own database I'm going to get some eye rolls but for people who don't have a database to begin with they're actually really excited about that mode but if the user Data Vault can do so much more and there's so many more privacy benefits when you sign in with ethereum then I think we can get to the point where we start to look at the next smart markets and expand from there right so that's that's how I'm conceptualizing it when um just summarize this for us as we start to draw to a close here okay so sign in with ethereum what does this do for Humanity what does this do for people on the internet the human beings that we all care so much about um we talked about shifting power back to the individual is is that the core feature here uh bottom line this for us why did you decide to take on this problem and why is it why is it personally important to you and what do you think it can achieve for the world sign in with ethereum is one of the first steps to letting users control their data across the web using public-private key cryptography we're able to just enable new modes of interaction that are user-centric at core issuing credentials being able to write permission slip Stacks as data moving to a model where instead of logging into the platform the platform logs into your data fault I think that all this is possible when you switch to sign in with ethereum because of the direct authentication and Builder ecosystem after that Wayne thank you so much for uh being with us today um Dave and I are super bullish on this technology I I tweeted this back a couple of years ago I think it's uh it remains true and I'm even more bullish about it there will be two phases of crypto and phase one we take back our money in phase two we take back our identity I think we are entering phase two signing with ethereum is a key part of that strategy uh and this makes me optimistic about the world and ultimately that is why David and I are in crypto why I hope you bankless listener and crypto and Wayne it sounds like that's why you are building in crypto as well so we appreciate your time and thanks for all the work towards this uh this Mission really grateful to be here thank you action items for you today bankless Nation uh go to the spruce website that is spruceid.com you can also read about the EIP we've been talking about the original signing with ethereum EIP that's eip4361 will include a link in the show notes it's a little light reading not too bad on that EIP have you ever got an EIP bankless listener because now today is your opportunity I thought you were about to ask me David I know you didn't ask me if I've read an AEP I've authored an EIP my friend um that's a different story barely Bristol disclaimers guys of course gotta let you know crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but uh your identity is something that you will never lose uh hopefully if we get signed in ethereum humming we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot hey we hope you enjoyed the video if
