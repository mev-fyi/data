olympus has fallen ohm market cap is down nearly 80 from its all-time high for reference the market cap of olympus dow peaked at 4.3 billion dollars it is currently at 1 billion i mean at the end of the day what happened is people sold people sold and number went down one of the reasons why it went down so much was because it went up so much because of this meme out of olympus dow the 3-3 me and the goal is to convince everyone to stake their own uh instead of selling it because if if everyone stakes their own then number goes up and so there was this culture instilled out of olympus dow to put the three the three comma three thing in your twitter profile talk about how like we're all gonna stake like no one's gonna sell we're all gonna stay together and i mean sure yeah when you convince you you and all your friends to stake and also instill a staking culture like well then there's no one selling and so so number goes up the problem with that you can only be rich on paper like that at some point people want to take paper gains into real gains and then the culture of staking turns into a culture of selling
