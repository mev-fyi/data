hey y'all a quick note before we dive into this episode this is not a typical friday recap episode i am actually in texas right now for consensus so this is a conversation that i had with g money the one and only we get into all sorts of fun topics admit one being the big one admit one is one of the hottest nft projects right now g-money launched it and he explains it and we talk about what's happening in the market these days his investing strategy and how he looks at things and uh and a little bit of his journey to where he is today i hope you enjoy [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs a very special episode in the studio with me today i have the one and only g-money i believe this is the first time i've had like a live cartoon that i've interviewed i've had anonymous people who just didn't go on camera but you're next level tech here at gmoney for anybody who's listening on the podcast you should tune into the youtube to to cgmoney um gmoney most of you probably know you almost certainly follow him on twitter he is a traitor investor a leading thinker in the nft space just general futurist and of course the founder of admit one which is one of if not the hottest project i think goblin town is probably rivaling rivaling you at the moment in nfts and we will talk all about admit one i'm really excited to to pick your brain more on it and and just talk about your journey in the space yeah awesome thank you for for having me on i'm i'm super excited this will be a fun combo absolutely and you've also you brought adidas into the space you're in puerto rico things those are other things i want to talk to you about i was in puerto rico recently going to be releasing some content about puerto rico and the nft scene there which you've had a really big amazing impact in so we'll talk about that as well before we get into any of this though we do have to hear a word from our wonderful sponsors wearable is the nft

feel like you really hit the nft scene and you can correct me if this is wrong but in january of last year when you wrote this long thread about why you spent 140 eth on your ape crypto punk for which you are now very well known and at that point i think it was like the most expensive nft purchase that had happened and you wrote this really awesome thread explaining it was that your like intro to the nft world as far as like them really knowing you no so it was uh at the time it was the most amount spent on a crypto punk i think there were higher prices okay going forward but no crypto punk sales uh it it that wasn't my entry into it that was kind of maybe my my uh public entry into it right okay because you've been buying chromey squiggles i know you'd bought a bunch of things yeah i was in i was in the discords i was talking to people i was tweeting a little bit but really like nobody really i think uh when i wrote that thread i probably had like 50 followers or something i i wasn't a more like known person uh in the space and so um because what ended up happening to me was in like november december of 2020 i could i especially remember i think it was the night of the people every day right the open edition it was a seven minute open edition i remember i was out to dinner with like seven or eight crypto people uh and i was like i brought my laptop i'm like i'm going out to my car to mint this thing during dinner but like i want to be at dinner hanging out with people and but i think let's say the mint was like at 7 p.m eastern i don't remember the exact time but we met like an hour before and in that hour before i was read killing everybody at the table on nfts because the and these were like crypto native people that were like big and d5 being in the erc20 tokens and like really deep in the space and when we sat down they were like nfts are stupid and within like 20 or 30 minutes i convinced them to the point where i think most of the people at that dinner bought at least one people oh my gosh but they were like they went from thinking nfts are stupid to you know being like oh hey i'll i'll take a flyer on this nft that this idiot is pushing me and i remember i ran out and i was like i was just minting for like seven minutes the entire time just mint refresh you know uh the entire time and i you know after that dinner i was like okay like i had my pitch down where i could convince these people going from nfts are stupid to okay nfts might hold some value i'm willing to you know and may and some people i remember that night people were like i don't think that there's any value there but i understand why you might think that and i'm like all right cool that's enough right uh progress you know as i was like thinking about it i was like all right well if i'm gonna go around from dinner party to dinner party uh red pilling like six to seven people at a time like we're never gonna get mass adoption of this tech and so i was like i need some sort of platform where i can share my ideas and i have that scale of technology being able to talk to people and that was really like the genesis behind when i ultimately finally did buy my crypto pump this ape i wrote that thread because i realized i was seeing the space a little bit differently than a lot of people were at the time even crypto native people and i was like there's an opportunity for me to kind of have a voice to express my point of view that i think was interesting and that i think a lot of people weren't thinking about at the time and it you know it ultimately my journey like culminated up until that point with writing that thread which was then like the beginning of like the next chapter of the journey yes okay that's what i meant you're really you're coming out to the rest of the world you had been in it for for months at that point or a couple months at least um you said that i maybe you said at the time or i've heard you an interview since talk about this like that nfts were just a good risk-adjusted bet for you can you unpack that because to me i'm like what like i feel like nfts are the hardest thing in the world to like determine an intrinsic value for and you know what do you mean by that yeah so especially you know at the time right uh in the in december november of 2020 my view was okay i think that this is really important technology and let me try to find the projects that you know and and i read a lot on the art market like in in that q4 of 2020 i think i read like three or four books on the contemporary art market because at the time i was like what is the closest uh you know contemporary to uh nfts and it was a contemporary art market and so i tried to understand you know how it works who like the institutional buyer is right and the institutional buyer of the contemporary art market is you know your tier one museums right like you know if an artist by the time an artist is in the moma is part of the moma collection like you know the their the value of their work has gone up significantly so it's like okay what do i i need to find things that i think will be at the moment or the met or you know the louvre 50 to 100 years from now and get in there before i think that they can find them and so my thesis was okay if there is uh an nft art movement right and at that time it wasn't guaranteed uh that i thought crypto punks would be historically significant there's like a bunch of stuff that i was collecting that i was like this is early on chain art that i think 50 to 100 years from now will be considered historically significant so that there if there is a wing at the moma that handles nft art i think these would be part of that collection so i to me i was like it was a good long-term play right and so that was one uh but the other aspect of it was you know coming from a finance background i was trading publicly traded equities for 15 plus years before um i i really started going down the nft rabbit hole um i take a look at you know what attracted me to crypto originally right it's like obviously the technology and the promise of it is great so when you take a look at crypto and you take a look at optionality right and you take one of the things that really attracted me to bitcoin and ethereum was that here you have this option that doesn't expire right so generally in traditional markets when you buy an option there's an expiration date right so you're like a call or a put like a literal option yeah when you buy a caller or when you buy a caller put you literally are in a race against time from the second you buy that there's time decay right so you know you could be right but if you're off by a week that's the difference between making a massive sum of money and like you know losing money on it so to me one of the things i really liked about ethereum and bitcoin was like all right i could literally be wrong for 10 years but if i'm right in that 11th year if i still have the position like i'm effectively right right because i held on to it so at the time uh i think ethereum was around 500 bucks it was either right below 500 bucks or right above 500 bucks and i was bullish on ethereum so i said okay um you know thinking about the last cycle and i remember in 2017 2018 people would always be like when lambo right um kind of be like oh you know i want to make so much money that i can buy a lamborghini i said i think this cycle is going to be a little bit different and people will be saying when crypto pump right i want to make so much money that can buy a crypto pump and so then when you take a look at assets priced in ethereum uh nfts you know and you take a look at real world assets right so when the stock market is at all-time highs luxury homes luxury cars wine luxury watches all these things that are high value items are trading also at elevated prices because people have more wealth and they're going to spend it on on ways to display that wealth and to enjoy that wealth and so my thesis was that much the same way that you experienced that in the real world and in last cycle the same thing would happen in the nft market so to me it's like i was technically buying an option on an option right i was buying that second derivative so that if the price of ethereum went up by 5x i would my theory was that the price of nft's high value nfts would go up by multiples of that and i i did i think i called it uh i think i called it the ppp price uh or no i don't know something with convexity i forgot the exact term that that i named it of how the price as the price of ethereum would go up the price of nfts would go up at a faster rate because they're just so much more scarce and so that's why when i took when i came into the space on a risk adjusted basis like that was like the best bet that i could make um for my bankroll right like if i was trying to put a hundred million dollars to work obviously um the market was too small at the time but trying to put 100 200k to work to me like it was like the best use of my cash that's fascinating and i totally understand the the how nfts are like levered eth in many ways i'm not i'm i'm slow and i need you to break down why eth is more like an option rather than like an equity where right and equity doesn't expire yeah so for me the reason why i saw it as an option is because you can you know you can make multiples of your money like crypto in general right like if i buy apples like i'm not gonna make 10x my money in apple unless i hold it for like five to ten years right but because and this is like i guess vc investing in general right like you're buying in right like any of these network token valves that come in at like you know sub 100 million or even some above right like as soon as they they catch that flywheel effect right you start getting that massive growth curve right where it'll go from a 50 million valve to like a billion valve because it finds product market fit right you were looking at it in terms of return like what could the return be in the frame of time and it was more on par with something like an option where you're sort of levered and therefore the bigger returns oh that's fascinating damn your mind i've listened to a bunch of interviews with you now and leading up to this and it's very fun to see how your mind works do you have anything right now you mentioned reading like four art books to understand the art market to before you started making your bets in in early nfts is there anything like that right now we're like this is the next meta this is this is what i'm reading books on on the side to make me a better trader um i'm not reading anything to make me a better trader you know i think right now i'm focused on uh building what i i like i'm focused the reason why i started admit one was because i want a community of people that is really interested in the same things that i am and focus on you know bringing the future to now um and you know i think right now i'm focused on building like that community and building it out and you know building what i think would be cool stuff uh to work on that i hope other people uh will find exciting and you know also understanding the fact that maybe some people don't get it right out the gate right and that's fine right because for the same reason that when i bought my crypto punk you know 15 uh 16 short months ago like people were you're an idiot right click save uh when it first happened and you know understanding that if everybody if the wisdom of the crowd thought that you know if if everyone thought that it was a good idea then it would it'd already be in existence right so uh to me i i don't know uh let's see what am i reading right now i'm actually reading uh snow crash right i'm about halfway through nice at the moment uh and i'm reading a couple books on fashion um and you know stuff on creative thinking those are probably like the things on my on my bookshelf at the moment i'm so eager down the line in this conversation to get into your fashion career and understand how that came to be because it's it's very cool that you're into it and i i don't know what the dots are for that um you mentioned i've heard you mentioned before that you had this mindset shift when you initially saw nfts as this awesome risk-adjusted trade as you just explained and then you had this moment where you really realized there were something a lot more and you seemed to just go all in and that was really the genesis of realizing you were going to build a community and what we now have is admit one what was that moment what was that flip where you realized that this is even more than i originally thought so yeah so it happened when uh and i i cover this like in in my manifesto so for for people that are super interested it's at g dot money uh there's a manifesto link but like for me you know i i put crypto punks on billboards with justin aversano in um march of 2021 march or april of 2020 and then the dates get so confusing to me uh march or april of 2021 and that we had like an opening party uh and we put a hundred bill 100 crypto punks on billboards in miami then uh the next month we did them in new york and then in london and we had our opening party in miami and i remember as i was walking around the party and just i don't remember the exact conversation but at that party i was like wow like nfts are gonna be so much bigger than i originally thought and i thought they were gonna i thought that they were gonna be big right out of the gate i just didn't realize how big that they would be right and i i was like this tech is so important and is going to be used by by pretty much anybody coming in for digital ownership in the future that every brand celebrity anybody with that does any sort of commerce right now will have to look at the space at some point in the future now i didn't know it would be in five months you know five years or 30 years right but i like i was very adamant that it would come and i was like okay i understand the space um and again like up until that point like i was you know at one point um i i think i had the first i had the largest chain on uh the largest uh loan on chain uh through nifty five right and i it was a 25 000 loan at the time it was like a monstrous loan and today that's like nothing right that's chump change for for an nft loan but like to me it's like at that point i was just trying to learn the technology so that i would understand it by the time like you know the real players started coming in i could be there to kind of help guide them and that was really how i started operating when i was like this is like an all-in moment where i could um either watch from the sidelines or build something that i would think is really cool that could change the world and am i wrong or was that the the crypto punk billboards that you and justin did had an interactive component where folks could scan and get an nft or take a picture of the billboard and get access to the parties am i do i have that right no so what it was is you can take a picture a selfie of you in front of the billboard and you get like a commemorative nft um you know and then uh you know we were we were distributing them uh or just and his team were distributing them out to people that that did it so there was some sort of interactivity but you also have to remember like a year ago like the tools for community were like almost non-existent right and even now they're still pretty rudimentary but like it's way better now than it was like a year ago to like track wallets and you know track p like it was literally people dming us on twitter uh and then like sending us their wallet and and sending it back right yeah well and that's what i want to flag is it was a it was cool i mean it was a very early example of doing anything like that is how i thought of it and um and it's amazing to see how much we've evolved as a space in just a year which is why when folks are like skeptical of nfts i'm like we have the brightest mod like some of the brightest minds in the world like full-time building on this like you don't think we're gonna be able to solve some of these problems that yeah you currently think are annoying right and to that point is right like a couple months after that at bitcoin miami in 2021 i reached out to poep because i'm like oh i want like literally two days before the event i was like okay i want to do some sort of like physical scavenger hunt right for fun like low low risk low entry uh and you know i was i was put in touch with the team at poap uh they gave me a bunch of qr codes and i hired uh i hired a few models to stand outside of these different establishments within like a half a block of the convention center and just like all you needed to do was just like walk a half a block collect the qr code and scan it and you got like an nft for just participating right and it was like to me it's just like how do we mess around with this tech and do something really cool and fun and i had a couple people uh that reached out to me uh and tweeted about it afterwards that the most fun thing that they did at that bitcoin conference was like go to the like panther coffee collect the po app and get like a five dollar gift certificate for a cup of coffee right like like that like to me it's like how do you build that interactivity and now we see that obviously going you know to the next level where a lot of these projects are throwing big parties you know and and all this stuff because it's all community building but like really it's like i remember like you know i think i think i had about 20 people show up each day right for that po-op right and it's like those po-ops were all white list allow listed on on on the admit one drop right and it was all you really had to do was walk one two blocks out of your way take ten minutes out of your time to do that right and that and now you'd have 14 13 8 sit in your pocket if you wanted it um did you know at that time when you were doing those po-ops at bitcoin miami that it would tie to something like admit one down the line like did you have that plan already yeah like i i knew that i wanted to build a community and i knew i wanted to build it slowly and organically and kind of show other people how you would be able to do that um i think in my in my original tweet i think i said something i saw a screenshot that said something like um you know if you collect all three there will be like you know value to it right and so the people that did collect all three got the first 11 uh admit one passes uh they got air drop those they were the only people that didn't have to actually do anything to claim it because they went out of their way three consecutive days in a row um to to kind of support me at the very beginning like right like you know compared to where i am now i think i i had a few thousand followers uh and it was just really me doing something cool and fun uh for people that like believed in g-money at that point you obviously were successful before you entered the nft space and you loved trading and your mind worked very much in that way you traded equities as you mentioned why do you want to build a community like why not do what you do and make money and why get into this at all um because i just i see like the opportunity out there to do something really cool that like affects the world on a really grand scale right like you know trading it's you know for lack of a better term it can be very unfulfilling right like you're just watching numbers go up and down all day sitting in front of a screen i think you know community building as i've gotten older i realize how much like the human human connection means to me personally and how much i enjoy interacting with humans and you know and that's community right that's literally the basis and essence of community and for me like what i'm doing now is way more fulfilling beyond you know the monetary value of it is like i think that you know i'm hoping that like i can affect the world and leave it in a better place than than when i came in and i just see an opportunity for me to kind of push that narrative forward and push the tech forward and adoption forward by by doing what i'm doing rather than just sitting on the sidelines or you know i i could could have definitely faded into into oblivion and you know nobody would have ever heard from g-money like a year ago again and i would have been perfectly fine right but like to me it's like i'm like okay i i i see like what i could be what i think could be really cool version of the future and i can help make that a reality so like why not do you still trade obviously you trade nft and nfts and things but do you trade in the web 2 world uh no i like don't i mean i i will say like i look at prices right of like the stock market every once in a while but i i don't trade i don't have time to trade i don't even trade nfts right like i like i generally just buy and and hold like i like the only sales i really i really have you look at my wallets probably because someone like really wants something or somebody really wants to you know i've been asked to sell stuff and you know uh at prices and you know it's just to me it's like i'm more of a buy and hold person and i just don't think it's the good use of my time trying to sit there and you know uh buy like the next nft drop and like try to flip it it's just like i i don't find it um fulfilling right it's like i find the work that i'm doing much more fulfilling and i think that it has just a better effect on on the overall like ecosystem so let's get into what admit one is i feel like i saw a lot of comparisons to proof when when you launched do you think of it as an alpha group um no i i don't i i think of it as getting a community together um that is very like-minded right like i i have two things that i'm really focused on is how do we disrupt uh current industries and how do we increase adoption right and so like one of you know and how have i been doing that personally over the last year and a half is i've invested in close to 100 startups in the crypto space in the last year and a half and you know i've worked with companies like adidas to help them come into the space and i think that that increases adoption right so to me i've been working on that you know solo for the last year and a half and you know as i like have been evolving in the space and and my uh notoriety has been growing you know i as i talk to potential partners and i talk to uh you know founders that i invest in is like yeah like you know they want to access my community because they know people that generally follow me and are interested in what i have to do that you know those are the type of people that they want within their communities right and so to me it was just like this great synergy of like all right i can now take my vision uh that i've been working on uh extensively for the last year and a half and kind of bring other people that think similarly right i think one of uh one of the benefits has been like you know i didn't see it as an alpha group but there has been alpha shared in the discord right we have a token data discord where you know uh yesterday you know i always post on sundays um the things i'm thankful for right the gratitude post and we had a discussion within our discord yesterday and we started like a daily gratitude thread that like was sparked by other people in the community right like people have been bringing alpha to the group without me necessarily being like all right like you know i got a hot tip that like we should be minting this like because that's not really what i want it to be about i'm sure there will be alpha there's plenty of smart people within the group uh that um are in every part of the ecosystem that i think will bring alpha to the table and create an awesome community but to me when i started it wasn't like okay like this is the next hot mint like that's not what it's about i'm sure that there will be a lot of access and a lot of good things to come out of it but that was never the intent when you made a number of i think very interesting strategic decisions that maybe you can speak on sort of as a whole and i mentioned before we hopped on here that you did do an interview on your own podcast that's now been renamed admit one where you talked through some of the tactical decisions and i don't want to duplicate that too much if folks want to hear all the tactical side they can go listen to that episode we'll link to it um but i will flag like you did a free mint you dropped during a huge bear market and maybe speak to how you thought about the mechanics of this holistically yeah so you know i wanted to you know we spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to distribute it and you know what you know what we would price it at you know what you know how we would distribute it right we went through like dutch auctions english auctions free mints allow this like whatever it was you know uh free and obviously on an english auction or dutch auction like everybody pays like a different price and like you know what what happens because of that and and ultimately we we decided to settle on freeman because like you know and and i i bring this up in in the manifesto as well is like you know one is you know i want the community to be completely aligned with me right it's like you know i'm not doing this as a cash grab i want people that are aligned with me that you know i get a portion of royalty but like you know if i don't create value there there's no value to be had it's not like i can just rug and like walk away i wanted the market to decide what it was worth i didn't want to say i think this is worth this right and then people would be buying it on you know my belief of what i think it's worth i i mean it started trading like where where it's trading right now is like way higher than i anticipated it to be trading uh i thought it would you know probably be settling at like two to five e right um so i'm i'm obviously very humbled and honored that that people um have that much faith in me and and belief in in the things that i'm working on and you know like that doesn't change the fact that i'm i plan on executing no matter what the price of it is right and so i have uh a lot of cool things that i've been working on uh to that effect and then finally i would say that um you know just as an homage to crypto punks right crypto punks were free to claim and so you know it's like to me it's like i think that that's what makes the crypto punk community so beautiful is that it was like you know such this this like immaculate conception almost right of you know all you had to do was pay the price of uh the transaction fee and you know you were able to hold it right and so i that to me is like all those things um i think that like uh by doing so i've been able i was also able to include people that otherwise might not be able to afford it right it's a little more inclusive and you know not everybody has one eath or three eat to to spend on a brand new mint for community that they don't know so i think it allowed me to have a more diverse group of people which i think ultimately leads to more creativity which leads to uh better ideas and you were very intentional about how you curated the community i think 700 or approximately of the spots the allowance spots were given to folks who held one of your po-ops from one of these previous events and then 300 were like hand hand-picked community members that you really uh wanted to be in the community and i know i think you're like 59 women like you've you've made a real a real effort there yeah yeah and again i think that comes down to in in my view is right like everybody has a different perspective in life right whether you're man women non-binary right like you have your unique perspective and the more perspectives we get that's where you get that like that explosion of ideas that really leads to innovation and that's really what i would love to foster in the community because i'm only one person and and one of the reasons why i love talking to anybody about nft is like outside of the space and i try to get them to understand it is because you know i can only speak about nfts in like verticals that like i totally understand but you know if i go to if i if i can help somebody explain it in a vertical i have no idea then they will start turning their heads around like oh like what if we did it like this and i'm like i didn't even know that that was a possibility right but now like we have another potential use case for the tech and that really is like where the beauty of innovation comes from does it make you nervous that it's at 13th right now um i i mean i'm i'm i'm humbled right like it really i think the expectations are higher uh i have my vision uh i i do think long term i think there will be a lot of value accrual to the uh to the community uh but yeah i mean i i think with any i've spoken to enough founders at this point where i think you're gonna always be nervous because you always want to uh you know you want everybody wants to set a low bar and then you know uh under promise and over deliver is is how i've always operated so when the bar starts becoming high it you know you i feel like you start feeling the pressure whether it's itself self-inflicted or not right totally i i have so much empathy for for project founders especially if you go in with a free mint and then it gets bit up and you're like i had nothing to do with this you know like i didn't tell you it should be 13 eth um it's i think you have a lovely community though given that you've handcrafted it so that it seems like you'll have an understanding group um with this launch i believe you'll correct me if i'm wrong about this your marketplace went live the admit one marketplace i'm i'm fascinated by this my understanding and then i want you to explain better is that this is ultimately going to be like a g-money curated marketplace right now it holds your admit one tokens it holds uh i think your brick uh game which by the way i played for like three hours yesterday i was like oh this is good research for the interview and i literally spent like three hours listening to podcasts and playing brick breaker um and and maybe a couple other nft adidas into the metaverse nfts within your ecosystem but down the line it will be like a curated selection of of nfts for purchase on the marketplace correct yes yeah so it's called gmoney market you can go to gmoney.market uh to check it out and you know i you know when i take a look at the real world and i take a look at web2 and you know the future of commerce is curation right it's it's always been there right like you go to a department store uh not because that's the only place you can buy your favorite brands but it's because you go to a department store it saves you time right like if or even a boutique right you like the buyer you like the the clothing the selection of clothing that they provide for you so that it saves you time and hassle and decision making and so you know then when you when you fast forward that to like the web 2 world right and you take a look at you know i don't know the exact stats but i'm fairly certain that in 1998 99 ebay probably had some of the most transaction volume on the internet right because you can go on there and buy anything on ebay and today there's only certain products that you would buy on ebay and the same with amazon right like there's a whole breadth of products but you don't buy everything from either of those sites and they do do a lot of volume but at the end of the day if you're a brand and you want to sell your consumer on a certain experience you don't you want to control what that experience is like right and that's why every website has their own every company has their own e-commerce website because they are curating that experience for their clients and so to me i think the the future isn't on a super site or uh you know a super a mega store right people want very curated experiences that pertain to exactly what they want and we see that you know through through brands uh through department stores in the real world but then also uh you know websites that cater to specific things whether it be like sporting goods or electric scooters or you know cars whatever it is people will go to that specific vertical because they want that curated experience you don't want to you know google electric scooter and then you know it's like a toy or something right and and that happens a lot on the superstore sites and so i think for me i think the future of web3 goes that way as well and so it's like i just want to start preparing for it right and it's like i want to not only have that but then also you as a consumer if you want to buy a g-money branded product you know if you go to a major site you have to worry about like a scam collection popping up or worrying about maybe you bought the wrong one it's like if you just go directly to my marketplace you know because you there's no other option you can only buy uh the ones that are listed right so you don't have to necessarily worry about that authenticity which i think will probably become more and more of a thing in the future right well let me push back which is i think one of the reasons that amazon gained the traction it did was because it was providing curated experiences even back like when it was just a bookstore it could do what a physical bookstore couldn't do which is see your buying history and then present you additional options based on your buying history so scenarios where marketplaces can look into your wallet see what you own and recommend other things you might want could could play better on marketplaces that have everything right do you think about that i mean that's fine and i think it definitely will happen right uh the beautiful thing about blockchain is that it's all public info so i don't have to be a member of a certain marketplace in order to kind of benefit from it right uh so i definitely agree with you there but i i think i'm thinking of it more from a brand perspective right like nike like you can't buy a gucci purse on amazon right you can't buy i mean maybe now you can buy some nike stuff but like there's no like most brands and this was always the issue with amazon was no brands wanted to sell their product on amazon right it took a long time and it took a huge fight for them to do it right like even now if you buy you know you go on ebay for for nike sneakers like you could be buying fakes you really don't know right like if i go to nike.com i i i'm buying real sneakers right that these are from the manufacturer so i think you're gonna run into that um where the brands want to give you a very curated experience that you can't get on a super site because uh you know i don't want to be selling right next to my competitors when i already have you as a captive customer right so i think they all have their their time in their places but i do think as a brand and as brands start coming into this the space they're going to want their own they're going to want to give their clientele their own curated experience specific to that brand and then just like in the real world you can go into the store buy that pair of sneakers and then you can do whatever you want with it you can resell it on ebay you can go to the real real you can give it away you can throw it away right it's up to you because you technically own it and i i firmly believe that that's where we're headed in the future we're seeing and we've been seeing for years now this macro trend of pulling away from institutions and towards individuals right it's like joe rogan does way crazier numbers than cnn does at this point and we trust individuals more than we're trusting these big institutions and it feels like that's what you're you're tapping into with your marketplace is you as an individual creator that people trust being able to curate experiences that that help taste make for folks you do you see yourself as a taste maker um yeah to an extent right like i think that it happens like it happens to me all the time where people are like oh what what nft should i buy right and you know it's like again that turns into that curation right that's an aspect that i could turn on at some point where it's like okay here's like the g money curated corner where these are the nft projects i like right and i put them in a place for you where you know you're buying the exact project that i'm talking about and maybe there's a curation fee that goes on top of that right like that's something long-term that um again i think that that's where the world goes i don't need to to go in that direction right away because i already have other things that i'm working on but i know it's an option it's like a lever to to pull at some point but i agree with you i think that there is you know i think because of the way the world is set up today there's a lot of mistrust in brands that we used to trust and because of that uh the people that are super authentic uh that speak to their community that people trust like joe rogan's that great example right like you know some some people go to him for the news instead of like cnn right because they know that he's gonna give it to you straight whether you agree with him or not right like he's not going to be sitting there trying to uh tell you uh that you know this this color is not red right you know when it it obviously is so i think that it just comes from the way the world that we live in and people want to find those people that they trust that they believe are authentic that aren't trying to necessarily lie to them about what they're doing right can you give us a taste of what folks should expect at the g money market in the future um i mean really at the outset it's really just to be focused on all products that uh i'm associated with right that i have my name on which is why those those uh i guess now four projects because adidas uh also did an airdrop over on on friday uh that you know things that i'm involved in so that if you're a fan of g-money and interested in the projects that i'm working on you don't have to worry about going to like an open sea and worrying about you know you type in g money and maybe you buy something that's a fake right so to me it's kind of a way to combat that you know uh fake collections popping up and stuff like that and you know to ultimately give people uh and you don't have to pay a transaction fee right for things that are listed right so you get access to uh all the major exchanges the the the listings on there and if you buy them you obviously have to buy the each exchanges uh fee uh that that they charge but ones that get listed natively you don't have to pay that two and a half percent transaction fee which i think is pretty cool uh and again long term i think that we're gonna see you know i and i think we already saw it so i used reservoir uh to kind of build the white label solution for it and they've been uh they've built a couple marketplace i think they built one for nouns now and uh they've been working with with other projects and i think we probably see that long term right again i think it helps combat that authenticity and fake collections popping up and it really helps against i think the scamming of of people when maybe they end up buying a fake nft you four star four went for i don't know you front ran my next question which is going to be about the technology underpinning this it sounds like reservoir i know wearable is also doing bespoke marketplace or you know white label marketplaces for folks meta angels did that i'm fascinated by the future of marketplaces and and everybody smart that i'm talking to is is definitely betting on this fragmented marketplace you know unique marketplaces for different genres of things different curators i guess in your case so a technical question i i suppose why did you go with reservoir um i think that they were really smart guys you know they they gave me a working uh like a working marketplace uh and obviously we needed like to tweak it like super fast like really really fast and they were like yeah we will iterate on it and we'll help you get it to the design that you want but like they have like the infrastructure and they and we spoke to a couple different people about doing our own marketplace and one of the things was i like how one how quickly they worked uh how well they understood it uh the entire the entire thing that i wanted but then also i think providing users that access to other marketplaces right where it's like when you go on openc you can't see what's on looks rare right i'm not sure if you can see what's on openc from looks rare but it's like i want to aggregate like all marketplace data so that you know if you are just interested in buying an admit one token and you want to get the best price you go to g money market right because that will aggregate all the data from everywhere whereas like sometimes you see like oh it trades a little higher here and it trades a little lower there because people don't realize oh i could have just gone there because there's no like one aggregated center right and so i think that like that to me is like super interesting it's like how can you provide these these extra uh little perks right that you won't get on openc or looks rare uh or any of the other major marketplaces that you can there because you know i want to create the best experience for people that are buying all things gmoney and whereas those those marketplaces are optimizing for different things if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs

adidas is one of the the projects on your bespoke marketplace because you really were instrumental in bringing them into the space how did you end up in fashion have you always been a fashion fan talk to me about this journey yeah so you know when i as i as i look uh into my my background in life right like i remember when you know i used to doodle a lot in school like during class whatever and i would like mess around with logos and like you know kind of like always i guess i was always like consumer focused right uh even when i was trading even when um you know i was generally a generalist right so i covered i knew a lot a little bit about a lot of different sectors and a lot of different companies i always like to say i was uh ten feet deep on a thousand names right as opposed to being a thousand feet deep on ten names and so uh one of the things one of the sectors that i really focused on was consumer discretionary and that is you know like your consumer facing stocks right so even up until last year uh my best trade of my entire career was when uh i remember i was interning in new york city going into my senior year of college and i was sitting on the subway and i look around and i see that everybody had these white headphones in their ears and at the time they had you know white lines as well because we were still in a wired world and that was apple right that was everybody had the original ipod right and i remember uh apple stock i think it was trading around around ten dollars i bought the 20 calls uh for about 62 cents and i sold them for 49 that's like you know that was like an insane roi in like uh in 18 months it was about because i purchased the options the options i was going to race against time as far out as i could and i something that i thought it'd be able to hit you know and then i was like wow i'm like this is really cool like i you know i like that was just for me being observant and spotting consumer trends and i remember a few years later uh i don't know if if you're too young to remember this but there was a company called true religion brand jeans yeah yeah that became very popular in uh 2004 2005 and it was a publicly traded stock and i remember uh the most fashionable girlfriends of mine living in new york were always wearing them and i was like oh you know like you know these things are going to become popular because new york catches trends generally earlier than the rest of the country and probably most of the world and so i i ended up buying some true religion stock and around four or five dollars uh it eventually ended up getting acquired for i think around 25 to 28 a few years later but like to me it's like i was always super observant uh especially on consumer consumer journeys and consumer trends and it was just something that always interests me right i think living in new york city uh it is even though it's uh very finance focused and real estate focused it's also very fashion forward right and there is like a new york fashion scene so i think i was just like naturally around it uh it was something that had interested me from a young age but i probably shelved it because i was also interested in finance and numbers in the stock market uh and that always fascinated me as well and yeah you know and when adidas came to me it was just i was like yeah like of course one i want to work with adidas but you know on top of that it's like you know adidas and nike are you know two of like the most culturally significant brands on the planet right it doesn't matter what your age is how much money you make you know that these brands you know the what these two brands are and you know that they're cool right so to me that that was like super important when i when i started talking to them as well so you know it's like it's been like a fun and wild ride but like it's definitely it definitely wasn't something that's like oh you know like i'm gonna focus on fashion it's just something that i think i was always interested in am i right though that in addition to adidas like you you've made some big investments in a number of other fashion brands and that you you know folks who are launching within the fashion space within the virtual world you know sort of think of you as as a good investor in that am i right um yeah well i'm i'm a member of red dial so you know i invested in a bunch of fashion startups as well and you know like i i think one of the things that i find super interesting is you know as we move from like crypto and crypto culture to mainstream culture one of the things we have to focus on is like how do we make it cool right like how you know how like how do we make it so that you know when kanye west kim kardashian travis scott when these people that are arguably some of the coolest people on the planet learn about an nft project they're not like you know like that's you know i don't i don't like that or like you know whatever whether it's the artwork or the vibe or whatever it is right like we need in order for crypto to really go mainstream and you know i firmly believe that nft tech is what is the trojan horse that takes crypto mainstream so we need to make nfts cool we need to make sure that the coolest people on the on the planet want to be involved in the space and i think a lot of that you know is involving like the coolest brands and people on the planet and helping them execute on the vision that they want a lot of brands that have entered this space i i'm trying to figure out the right way to phrase it i don't want to overstate it but like haven't necessarily fared that well even the folks that are kind of doing it right so i'll say in the short term maybe they haven't fared well you know pepsi was met with with a decent amount of cringe i would say i think adidas entered really well with your help and then there was fud around it's not happening quickly enough and then people were disappointed in various ways like why do you think brands struggle so much when they enter the space or at some point in the their lifespan of being in the space yeah well i mean i think it's the nature that they're they're massive right these are are huge huge companies that they when you're running a multi-billion dollar business um you can't like pivot and be like oh well free mints are popular now like we're going to just drop everything we've been working on for the last 12 months and just do a free mint right like i think when you're a startup right and you know you have a team of three to five people of course you can pivot overnight you can pivot in an hour but when you're a massive company you know not only do you have to answer the people higher up but i'm sure there's some cost benefit analysis and stuff like that so as as much as like some of these companies are moving at the speed of light for their company uh it's still really really slow in in the world of crypto and nfts right so i think that that's part of it right and it's also like an entirely new business model right like a year ago at this time um if you were to walk into like a room full of cmos or c-suite level people they probably would have laughed at you if you were talking to them about the metaverse right like there's only like a handful of people that would not have laughed at you that would have taken you seriously but i think now at this point uh we're at a point where every company has to have some sort of metaverse strategy right what is it what is a digital what do what what is their part look like in a digital future right and a year ago they weren't having that conversation so i think part of it is just because these companies are so old uh or so so large not so old uh it's that they're so large that you know it can't just be oh well i decided we're going to do this we're going to move forward there's you know a chain of command of people that have to be those decision makers but then also like they're also learning it as well like we're all learning it right like we're trying to figure out what the best business model is and i think when you have that much brand equity at stake you have you have to move slower right like you it it it's much riskier if you move faster and mess up than if you move a little bit slower and kind of make sure you're doing it right is part of the problem that there's still this expectation that like we'll all become millionaires off nfts and does there need to be a reframing of like eventually we're all going to hold nfts not to make us rich but because we want access to the cool adidas room and it's it's going to be for utility and it's you're not necessarily going to make huge money i'm not trying to say you're not going to make money on your adidas nft i'm using that generically yeah no i mean i think that you know there's an expectations reset that's probably going to come at some point right because like uh you know that that model of hey like i you know spent x and i expect like a thousand x worth of value like i mean it's just not sustainable right like let's be honest like you don't you can't get anything in the real world of value for free like you only people say you get what you pay for right if you want like a ton of free product it's probably not high quality product right and that's something that people need to be cognizant of and understand that you know things take time and investment and you know as large as as these companies are when they're coming into the space like they don't there's not like an infinite pool of capital that they can dump into uh a new market right because at the end of the day they're looking at their bottom line as well and you know every startups as well startups probably even more so because they don't have the money to burn so i think that there will be that that um that reset of expectations uh but frankly like up until this point right like the whole reason we're talking about nfts is because they went up in value so much so quickly uh if not we probably wouldn't be talking about nfts right here right now so um i do think that there's a reset in expectations that are coming and you know that's something that the industry's gonna have to come to terms with that's not there at the moment and and likely will come with the mainstreaming of it like these early folks who are in it are obviously more heavily weighted toward the speculators who want the money and in theory the next wave of people come in because they actually want the value they're getting because it's a ticket to their taylor swift concert or whatever the case may be and they're not expecting it to to pump to the moon um you talked about obviously you're you're the two pillars your two big goals being to disrupt industries and to increase adoption of the technology i'm curious if you have a different way you would describe the g-money brand or here's your your high-level thesis of the kind of world you want to bring into into effect as you disrupt these industries and as you increase adoption of the technology um yeah so you know i i think it's different because like i'll i'll meet somebody that like comes to me with like a cool new idea that i haven't thought of i'm like oh that's really cool all right now i have to i want to figure out how i can help you and how we can work together and like bring around that disruption right uh so i mean i have my ideas of you know the specific verticals that i am going to be focused on and you know a lot of it is because i've had conversations with people and i'm just like all right nobody's doing it so i'm just going to do it right and i i think it's cool hopefully other people think it's cool and you know then it starts being adopted by more and more people and it and it leads to that ultimate disruption um yeah i i don't say like i have like one formula because it really comes down to sometimes i talk to somebody in a vertical i'm like yeah i don't really know how you can use nfts and then they hit me up like a day or two later like so i was thinking this what do you think i'm like i mean that sounds really cool like if you want to work on it like i support it you know like do it you know um but yeah i wouldn't say that there's like a direct formula that like for me it's it comes down to and i said this in the manifesto is like do dope with dope people right it's like you know good ideas and good people will will yield good results i had one nitpick with your you didn't publish manifest or you didn't publish a road map you published like a list of values which i loved it was like long and it was funny and it was great the joe's pizza thing though i gotta say joe's pizza has become a little bit i feel like too touristy and now sometimes it's a little floppy it's not as like crispy bottomed as i'd like so i think at the like i like going to the one in the west village and the one there those are my two favorites those are i'm inside eye and the fidei joes can be a little hit or miss i've been to five eyes like uh the one in finale a couple times i mean the good news is that like it's literally like the only thing open in fidei so i feel like hey don't you talk bad about my hood no i mean i lived in fine for two years it was honestly it was my least favorite neighborhood in in manhattan i it wasn't for me uh but but i think that that's why the quality in phi die is probably not as high as the other ones because there's less competition yeah i i'm not people hate small talk and podcast so i'm not going to bore people by fighting you on this continuously but when we hop off i'll give you my final thoughts um well i know just even from a morals and a principles perspective like it feels like you have a really good understanding of the importance of importance of decentralization and the open metaverse you know beyond just talking points like that's something you really feel to your core am i correct in that yeah for sure i mean i think when we look at when we always see these dystopian futures right it's always like a walled garden right it's always like oh there's some central source that uh you can't piss off or like your digital future is gone and you know it's like hey and i know i've had extensive conversations with 65 29 on this and other dominant figures in in the uh the nft space where it's like we need like those property rights in a digital future right and having a centralized ledger does not allow for that because at some point somebody you know it's up to one person to decide who wins and who loses right and you know that shouldn't be the case because then you're talking about you know human rights and human freedoms that we as americans feel are like you know inalienable right it literally says that in the constitution and and so that to me is like why i feel so strongly about decentralization is like you know i want i want all these brands and all these uh people of influence in the real world to come into the space on decentralized rails whatever they do from there is it's totally and completely up to them but i want them to do something where we're not at the mercy of some centralized authority that can censor whoever they choose just because your values don't necessarily align and that to me is like my fundamental thesis for for why um i'm doing a lot of the things that i'm doing i loved your conversation with six five two nine and i i also listened to your conversation with the nor team and i thought that there were some through lines there that i found interesting i've been personally like railing against land sales as a metaverse strategy and i had an episode recently with with like a land like asset gaming expert who talked about why it's it's a strange strategy um i think 6529 put it really well of like it's weird to have an open metaverse where it costs ten thousand to get into dollars to get into it because you have to buy this piece of land i'm curious your feelings on on land sales as a matter of fact strategy because it's the dominant one right now it feels like yeah i know i i you know i think like some of these metaverses will have historic value i don't know how many at this point like probably like the first ones will have historic value right just because it was like one of the first or you know there was a community that formed around it but as i spent more time like thinking about and interacting with um you know the meta land in the metaverse right and the analogy i always like to use is instagram right it's like if each successive profile on instagram cost more expensive than the last one like instagram would have never scaled like nobody would have ever gone on instagram right like what makes an instagram account valuable is the content that the owner puts on there right what makes uh a concert hall epic like what makes madison square garden such a special place what makes cbgb such a special place in new york city not because of their location their location is irrelevant it's like the the moments that happen there is what make the place special right so then when you think about it in the metaverse right like what's going to make one piece of land more valuable than the other it's going to be the experience right the uh historicness of whatever happens there that gives it the value so like as i spend more and more time thinking about it's like i mean metaverse land is is infinite right like all you need is computing power so why are we creating scarcity now in some games i understand why scarcity exists right like if you have a game and it's part of the the map and like how the rules of how you play the game that's fine but like should there be scarcity in something that like you know if anybody has access to right it should be like almost like public land where you can come and go as you please but if you want to create your experience you know you have a place to do that but then also if you want to customize it like then you either put in your own sweat equity or you hire an architect or whatever it is but like getting that actual parcel shouldn't really matter right because like ultimately like i can just send you a link and then you just go to my my metaverse land right so as i spend more and more time thinking about it like over the last year it's been like yeah like digital scarcity on land is kind of  right like it it's fine if it's within the combines of the game and those are the rules of that game but like overall like you know it should be free right like and i think in the instagram model makes the most sense to me just because like that's something where like you know if i had to pay five hundred dollars for an instagram account right now like i nobody would ever do it right it just doesn't it's free and always will be that was like you know the the golden age of me being on facebook i remember seeing that tagline every day and that's what allows the network effects to build up which is why you have a game like roblox that's so popular and it's it's it's very strange and once that switch went off for me too i was like god like how is this the the current paradigm is is to do these land sales you're you're you're beholden to rewarding the people who can afford it rather than the people who are creating the most value which may not be the same people [Laughter] as we close here i do want to talk to you a little bit about puerto rico i i visited puerto rico and and had just the best time and met just some of the most incredible people who are building in web 3 artists who are native to web3 um a number of whom are now making money off nfts who were first introduced to the concept because of mediverso which is a conference you co-hosted and really brought about in puerto rico um when did you move to the island and would love to hear you just tell folks a little bit about what the the scene is like there yeah i moved to puerto rico in uh april of 2017 uh and i've been living here full time since then and you know i i love it it's been amazing to watch uh the crypto community grow and blossom especially in the last like i'd say two two and a half years uh and it's been it's been really good i think that there's been a lot of amazing and and smart people moving down here that uh are doing amazing things for crypto and now like being part of the community right and that and that was like the genesis for for starting mata mediversa right it's like here i saw this technology that was changing so many people's lives in the creator uh economy like in it in the world at large and it's like how can i help educate you know locals right to take advantage of this tech because you know this is you know like minimum wage here is below the united states even though we are a us territory and you know it's like how can these people uh use this tech for their benefit right and so that was really the genesis of it and like you know a lot of times you know even in admit one uh the people that were included on the list were people that attended mediverso and there were a lot of puerto ricans that attended artists as well as locals and you know i've gotten some messages from a few people of how like that you know they changed like they sold it but like that money they're using to fund other initiatives and things that they're working on and how it affected their lives in a positive manner and like that to me is like a great like i feel great about that because i know i'm helping empower locals that are putting themselves out there and want to learn this new tech who will then go to their communities and empower others as well it struck me being there that there are a number of reasons that nfts and crypto make a ton of sense like it makes sense that puerto ricans would be adopting this technology and there's a huge art scene natively and there's other things that i get into in this documentary that that will be coming out here pretty shortly um and that it was funny because when you look at the coverage of crypto in puerto rico like it's almost exclusively crypto colonizers like it's got this kind of very negative framing and what what felt what it felt what felt frustrating me to me about that then going and meeting with people like juan salgado who i know you know and pedro cruz and um and christina who's an artist down there like is it ends up erasing all the amazing work that local puerto ricans are doing because they only focus on these outsiders who are coming in and is that do you share that feeling like do do you feel frustrated ever seeing the media coverage around the crypto scene in puerto rico yeah i mean i think it's not just limited to the crypto scene i think it's just all um all people that are moving down here for that incentive right and a lot of you know and i think this is just endemic of the media in general where there is a lot of focus on the negative because negative headlines get way more clicks and coverage than positive headlines right like the feel-good stories aren't generally as well clicked on right as well read as to feel bad story so it does get frustrating but i just know that i'm i'm doing things and i have the best intentions and you know the people that i interact with you know hopefully have nothing but good things to say about that interaction and how i've been able to help them and that's all i can do and just you know i think the community that's being fostered down here is is one where we help each other and help one another and all grow right like you know pedro and juan are two amazing examples where you know these guys are are great and they're beacons of light within their communities and they're you know by helping them they're i'm helping their communities that they can then go out and educate like pedro's an amazing example he ran the hackathon for mediverso and he's running um a boot camp two boot camps this summer with a hackathon at the end and that's all geared towards local puerto ricans some of them to understand crypto like if you don't know anything and then some of them for programmers and devs to help uh to help the the local dev scene uh become more up to date on on crypto tech so to me it the coverage sucks right like it's sad that that that's what's getting chose chosen to be displayed but i think ultimately it's just really keep keep our heads down and keep on doing the next right thing and and hopefully at some point that coverage changes to one of more positivity than negativity well i'm hoping that my project it'll hopefully bring light to some of the awesome things that are happening on the island because again i was just so impressed by everything that's being built and and the people and the artists and so um again i've got to plug it you know coming
