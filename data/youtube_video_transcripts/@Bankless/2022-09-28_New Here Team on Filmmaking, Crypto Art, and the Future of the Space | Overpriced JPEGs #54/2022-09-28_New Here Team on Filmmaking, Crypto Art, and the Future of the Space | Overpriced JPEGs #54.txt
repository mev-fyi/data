what's up [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs I am very excited about today's episode because it is reuniting me with a team that I worked very closely with for for quite a while last year and I am joined by the new Here documentary film team it is Dan sickles who is the director Creator behind new here he was the youngest director to ever win Sundance he's directed several Independent films that have done incredibly well at festivals and and with audiences and his two producers two of his producers I should say there's a couple others who didn't make it but Hannah Rudman who has been working on film like campaigns for ngos and international organizations for over a decade at this point and Bruce Chung who's an independent filmmaker also has been in the the crypto nft space for uh for a number of years now as well uh another producer on the film I'm so excited to have y'all thank you for having us Carly it's good to see you we have been through the trenches together and uh so I think we'll probably end up starting there just I know I learned a ton I think you guys learned a ton and because this project has evolved a lot and I'll talk a little bit about what the initial intention with this um documentary film which has a it's about nfts and about the crypto art community but also has an nft component to it that I worked on with y'all so we'll talk about what we really learned I think there'll be a lot of teachings that other folks who are interested in the overlap between like film and entertainment and nfts will be able to take from this but of course we're also going to talk about what you guys are doing now the film itself which is really documenting the crypto art like story over the last two years or so which I think is amazing you have incredible people involved in this film so we're gonna get into all that good stuff but first we do need to hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors metamask is the

so I wanted to start from the beginning of like our collaboration which is I think we met I mean it's been almost a year we I think first met back in probably October of 2021 and we were on the week 40 yacht together that's true shortly after we had had like our first call you and I met up in person at the first eight Fest at nft NYC very fun yeah and and at that point you knew you wanted to do this film Dan I know you as like a very determined person you're like once you get a topic in your head you're like nothing will stop me from making the film I want to make about this topic you know or these people or whatever it is so you were full steam ahead making a documentary about the crypto Arts base and what was going on having sort of fallen in love with it yourself you'll talk us to us about that and you were like but I really want the community involved from day one in this project and I want their voices heard in this I want their input on how this should be made I mean if I'm going to make a film about the ethos of this space like I need to subscribe to the ethos of the space in the making of the film and one of like the goals that you know we sort of had was how can we bring the audience in as essentially like Equity stake Partners in this like treat them like a Hollywood financier would get treated and really have like Financial stake in the film and we quickly realized the 1001 incredibly challenging like legal restrictions that were going we were going to bump into uh trying to do that especially trying to do that in the time frame we were trying to do it like if this was something where we had two years to just like plan the the drop mechanics itself alone like maybe but it it was incredibly challenging and I think I'll speed run through this because I do think there are some learnings that people could could take from this so we rapidly realized like okay clearly this needs to be a security which means using something called regulation CF and there's only like a handful of brokers really in the world that are like able to handle a regulation CF crowdfund raise where you're actually issuing a security then it becomes a matter of like okay if you're gonna go with one of these Brokers you need to issue basically ownership in a company and you we couldn't have ownership in your production company for a number of reasons because you have you know whatever a number of projects there we won't get into the details so we're like all right we need to set up a new LLC entity that that people can maybe have an ownership stake in then we're like well maybe we could do this like financiers style agreement like what we do with the producers but like with every single person individually and then we're like cool we're gonna have potentially 5 000 financiers agreements we can't do that then the separate LLC we wanted it to just kind of pass through the money to new here your project and then just pass back the profits to the owners but that actually isn't legal in a reg CF crowd fund so then the LLC was actually gonna have to be like a agency partner but then that's impossible to Market to anyways I could go on and on and on it just became a complete legal Quagmire and is so reflective of like why we need kind of the new web 3 movement to just like catch on to the rest of the world because there's so many opportunities that like retail investors are missing out on because the laws are um kind of not not modern anymore and not up to speed with the world we're now living in okay so with that incredibly long preamble can you catch me up to speed on like where you are now in terms of incorporating the the web3 community into this filmmaking process and and where you are with the current nfts that you want to um you're offering to folks to to be a part of this whole journey absolutely so yeah I mean you know the the way in which you spoke through it um was much calmer and cooler and Collective uh than like the the in live process the experience of it yeah I know I've already spoken too much but I should say the original concept was we're gonna have an nft that represents the film we're going to fractionalize that nft and sell fractions of the film to individuals I mean like the the number of iterations we went through on this is like shattering absolutely and like really really worked hard to do like the due diligence of asking all the legal questions off the bat and I mean you and and Hannah were really attacking it in I mean such an astute way that like honestly I I feel like I tuned out like one third of the way through of of that history uh yeah just purely by being by virtue of like I don't I don't know how many more lawyers we can speak to about what these potential problems are and I yeah the knots just became so complicated to untie um but where we are now I mean is in it's in a it's in a much better place uh you know we've been able to bootstrap production for essentially the past 14 months or so um and you know because of that we've been able to capture 95 or so people uh and their experiences in the space most of those being interviews in a studio but then quite a few artists and thinkers actually like on location with in process of making art or performing uh or whatever it is that they do um and right now we're actually looking to raise the rest of the budget to complete the film uh you know with non-fiction like usually the The Upfront costs of production are a bit lower than Fiction but when it comes to post-production and the editing process and particularly this film that there will be pretty VFX heavy and including a lot of the digital art that we know and love uh you know there are some some larger expenses that come with completing a film of of this ambition um so we are starting actually our our public uh actually mint of the the new here drop uh which is a 10K collection of avatars combining all of the iconic traits of everybody that we've worked with on the film so far um so it's it's actually pretty radical and like the the avatars like they look sick and they're they're cool because I mean if you know the space well enough then they're instantly recognizable um but Bruce actually Bruce has been working really really hard on it um I've been really focusing on it with our artists so I think he should maybe speak speak a bit more to the details and Bruce before you dive in let me just quickly you you teased there you know the 95 folks you've worked with on this film like can you give folks a a sense of just like the magnitude of the the people and the artists you've gotten to interview for this film yeah for sure I mean you know who can we tell who can you spell uh you know we've worked with Tyler Hobbs we've worked with Claire silver G money um you know we're setting up our interview with with lupify actually uh is somebody that people know um yesterday actually we just filmed with Raul pal um who's a brilliant macro Economist um you know it's it's like we're we're spreading you know very very wide to capture sort of like the the biggest spectrum of of this sort of crypto Community as possible um you know one one person that I love talking about that we did an interview with is actually jasty's mom um jasty I don't I don't know if you know him he's like I believe he's probably 14 or 15 now um he's a young artist in the space um and we actually brought his mother into the studio just to to really get that perspective of being the parent of a young artist who was making a killing in this new new genre of art so you know like it's it's really been a a dynamic sort of Arena that the we've built to build the oral history of this space how do you know when you're going into these conversations how do you strike the balance between preparing questions and knowing what you want to get out of it and also allowing the conversations you're having to ultimately shape the direction that the film goes in that's a good question I mean it's really a balance between I mean it's good to have producers in this conversation too because it really is a matter of production like I can really uh when I lock in with somebody I can really sort of get lost um in in conversation you know so I think you know we we attack a lot of these interviews with like knowing the information that we definitely need to get on film and then trying to like leave room to sort of play in conversation um and sort of attack like these more abstract questions about what this space is in different ways from from different angles um and and that sort of is like the more I I think kind of experimental theoretical philosophical kind of conversation that happens that I tend to get lost in a bit um so it's a matter of kind of juggling those different spaces within the conversation but really I mean Hannah and Bruce like we we work very closely together uh before every interview and really go go through everybody that we're talking to uh to share what we know about them and what we don't know yeah Hannah or Bruce do you have a sense going in like where the person is going to fit in the film like what scene they're going to be used in if it's like an independent film where it's not scripted you know in advance and we'll talk about why this film's really interesting because it is a hybrid in in like fiction non-fiction in some ways but like do you already have that in your head when you go into these conversations when you're prepping the research for it that is a really really good question so I think for example uh yes it depends I I love this quote that um Shane Boris the other producer in our in our Squad um who couldn't make an Academy Award okay nominated producer documentary producer so we have an amazing team anyway he said to me something recently that um that documentary filmmaking is truly an Act of Faith and I think that we uh instinctively know that because it's a really emergent process exactly what you're asking um but on the other side of that it's also highly controlled because this is a hybrid film and it is held in this script of this character rookie who we can talk more about um but yesterday we interviewed Raul Powell who is an amazing macro Economist and um we knew that we wanted him to help us set up the stakes of um why this entire technological Revolution needed to take place how did we get here historically um and sort of the um yeah all angles of um the question of the values that this space is upholding so the opposite end of the emergent spectrum is also that this is a scripted movie Bruce I I do want to have you explain the nft drop but because we're rolling on this and it's it's fun can just explain to folks the hybrid nature of this film whoever wants to dive in and talk about that like that it's a documentary and you have interviews with all these incredible very real people in this but there's also this like fictional character Arc or non-fictional character Arc I should say I guess but like you explain it Somebody explain it I can I can talk a bit to that and then maybe Bruce can also speak to how we're working with avatars and and sort of metaverse yes would love that yeah I think like you know the the structure of this film is unique in the like I'm building it sort of as a film within a film right um and really sort of aiming from to root it in the perspective of a new user entering the space um so that it's like a real kind of invitation slash subtle education and what it means to dive into web 3 and to this world of crypto art um so that not only is it is it you know full of oral history told by the people who were there actually building the space in that time but then also the film itself is experiential which to me um makes it a film and sort of like lifts this type of Storytelling Beyond um you know just just a slate of interviews or a series of interviews yeah it's ambitious yeah it's wild um but yeah I guess the easiest way to say it is you know like that the story is is really sort of being told from the perspective of Alice um falling into Wonderland or Charlie going like entering the the Chocolate Factory is is the Charlie Alice character a real person that you've effectively cast in in this and it's their real journey or is that a kind of a fictionalized Arc to help people enter it well I mean that's also like I guess a bit of like a nuanced question because like I guess in in everything that I do in like the non-fiction space it's deeply collaborative um you know so with with this particular character I mean I know who they are they know who they are um there's there's plans for us to be filming together for sure there's also like the subtle Act of uh red pilling them like I mean they're they're cast for a particular reason like I I believe that they're they're very set um to fall into the space in an effective and interesting way so so you have Cass somebody who is like on the precipice of falling into this World somebody who collects art on Instagram you know who's very into like finding independent art artists on Instagram and like through through that means and actually like receiving the physical art and is very into like Reddit and subreddits and you know like these internet communities but just hasn't really found the key that's going to unlock this particular space yet um so yeah I mean it's gonna it's gonna be a bit so this is very much a real person and you are very much really capturing their Journey starting to discover nfts and fall down the rabbit hole absolutely and like where you know what their character is is um it's related to to their real life experience in a lot of ways um so that so that I mean so that it's rooted in in the real right um and that's that's really how A lot of this process starts for me I mean that's how our crew came together um but you know to to to get to like also a deeper part of how we're working it is part of the process for how we're working with individual artists and particularly Anonymous artists and Bruce is doing like a lot of incredible and and very thorough deep work with people who are Anonymous in the space to make sure that they're represented in in you know in in our film um but Bruce yeah yeah but Bruce I would love to hear like how you're weaving in and interlairing the the anonymity and the effects you mentioned that earlier as being part of why this is an ambitious and sort of expense more expensive maybe independent film project because of the VFX so yeah Bruce yeah I mean one of the things that really excited me when I first met Dan was he told me he wanted the film to be said in the Mount Everest and be partially animated and and combine not just be a hybrid in terms of uh narrative and non-fiction but also hybrid in in the form of the film real life animation real life and 3D environment and Graphics um and I think that that way of working really lends well to collaborating with um Anonymous artists in the space who are taking on this other form on online you know like clear silver we know her as a crypto Punk so one of the challenges um that we embarked on was like how do we translate this you know iconic pink haired crypto Punk into a cinematic character that we can empathize with they can like tell her story and and be and be Vivid and real you know um so we've been we've been collaborating with her and our an incredible animation team um called nice monster on like shaping this 3D form of clear silver um um for example you know and then we're gonna take on a similar approach with other Anonymous characters in the film like um like Owen from pseudo swap or or G money um and and not just the the forums too but also the environments they're in would also take take on a different shape based on the people who were interviewing um I think you know like clear Silver's environment will of course look very different than like a Tyler Hobb space you know for example or or been known in space so again to like give them credit real quick like so like Hannah like on one hand is really handling like the the the logistics and also sort of like the the storytelling from like how we craft all of this casting and how we get these people in a room um and on schedule right and then Bruce is sort of matching that with like following up with like okay what should your environment look like uh that that you that we meet you in and all of that so I mean and none of that is is a small task you know um so it's it's really big and I and I give the two of them so much credit for really wrangling all of those conversations yeah I mean having having worked up close and or kind of seeing you guys work up close or closer than probably most of my audience has certainly like it's it's incredibly impressive you're you're an amazing team and and all together work just so well so to explain to people a little bit more like a lot of these interviews are being conducted in in like green screen rooms oftentimes and so that's where you're able to then craft this metaverse sort of animated environment around folks but you also are gonna I imagine interspers some real footage I know are we allowed to say what you've done with Tyler Hobbs yeah absolutely is that public or that public like you know you were able you were at bright moments when he did one of his generative art you know launches and sales and auctions you've been to his studio in Texas so we'll also see real world environments where some of these people work is that absolutely I mean like we have a you're the first one to know this but you we have this incredible backstage moment during a [ __ ] Riot concert um with her and one of the highest grossing living artists of all time um and a few other incredible crypto artists and like it's just it's this tiny moment where it is it is utterly web3 um because like you know that the cast is like wait this person and this person and this person they're all in the same room like talking you know um and you know just one of these magical moments where our camera just happened to be backstage with Nadia because we had been working with her for a few days uh to be there to get it and like that's that's the magic of just have hanging around these Crews uh for so long you know and and and really forming these relationships with people in this phase I want to ask you about some of your other best moments or just fun moments from filming and and honestly curious what we're all said you gave that teaser Hannah and now I like want to ask like what what has he said about why this needed to emerge in this moment um but I want to ask given the structure of this film and that you're coming at it from the perspective of like a new person falling down the rabbit hole and that's what you're the journey you're you're tracking is the goal here for you to Red Pill newcomers is it more a love letter to people already in the space like who's the ideal audience member for for a film like this that's a really good question um honestly I think the like the Curious it's it's a very vague answer I guess but um I think crypto is still finding its audience right I think like this whole Space is still figuring out like who it's for which I guess also necessitates answering who it isn't for and we definitely don't know that yet either so you know I think that the film is definitely an attempt to be like as as as wide of uh a half-sided hug as possible right and it's kind of like you know like the hope is really like the the people like leave the theater or you know finish watching it in their living room or and I will say this sort of a bit sacrilegiously while they're watching the film in their living room also looking up the work of some of these incredible artists like that I think is the work that the film is really trying to do um and to that end you know like where our team is really making efforts to preserve everything that we've shot and make that accessible to people who encounter the film um and and want to know more about anybody in this particular film because our cast is huge you know Hannah did you want to jump in definitely because I think people are listening to this and wondering like okay so interviews documentary cool so I'm gonna learn something about crypto you will learn a lot but the thing is is we are artists non-fiction filmmakers and definitely in the scheme of um the hybrid and experimental nature of this project we are artists and our skill is making people feel things and we want this movie to help people feel the Bizarro spectrum of emotion and curiosity and frustration and um excitement and um and fear and all of it that Inc is encompassed in this space I think people really forget that when they hear the word documentary and part of shooting these interviews and a green screen environment is because that's also the extraordinary nature of the metaverse it's literally an endless playground for our imaginations where these interviews can live how they stack on top of each other on a screen even um and so there is all of that and I also God I'm totally blanking on how I wanted to get to this one other thread so I'm just going to take it anyways just go I'm just gonna go I think oh I think in terms of also how it feels it feels like we're on a crazy wacko Adventure making this movie um and to kind of bring you into that it's like I'm at nft NYC 2021 at a helicopter uh launch pad with Jacob riglin and [ __ ] render and beige and I'm there with my DP and we're just like okay this is what it means to be a holder of an nft you get to go on a pla on a helicopter over New York City with Jacob riglin oh [ __ ] render why don't you come to our studio tomorrow Fred you down you're gonna show up um and then yeah and then a few months later Hannah like we're sitting in Austin Texas like hanging out with Tyler Hobbs in his Studio as he like diligently shows up like every single day and sits down and like does his his work as an artist and like we get to watch that unfold after all of like the the crazy like energy of that nft NYC scene you know it's it's like it is so cool of the internet I feel like this process I could see too how valuable it will be for the world to see the artistic process of a generative artist because I think there's still a lot of people who don't really grasp how it's art you know or they're like you know there was pushback when people first started using paint brushes or I should like photography or they started painting on um canvas as opposed to like church walls people like oh that's not real art and I feel like people have the same impression of generative art like a computer is doing it but when but so to kind of document or getting to see a glimpse into somebody who's showing up every day for their art which is partly writing code like it just feels like it would be so valuable for the spaces like PR that's a bit what's lost here for sure um you know and again like Bruce has spent more time in this space I think than than anyone really on the team and he's sort of seen it firsthand especially in a place like crypto boxes how people show up you know and and how they and how they build uh by choice but I do think that that is a particular narrative that really does get lost right now even even people I mean you know every day is obviously everyone knows that narrative but like people was also making clips for music videos for for free for lots of artists for for years before people became people you know and and there is there is a consistency of dedication throughout from from the great artists in this space um that the film is definitely looking to capture okay we're gonna keep we're gonna come back to talking all about the film and again best moments and learnings and like almost telling us a little bit of this history but let's talk about the nft before we get too deep into this Bruce I'm bringing it back to you now so folks have gotten a little taste of this like you've gotta you've already done some nft drops that were geared towards I feel like dowed or or maybe more whales in the space you can correct me and now you have this Avatar launch coming up on the 28th though actually or on the 26th you'll be hearing this on September 28th so the public mint will have just gone live Bruce can you tell us a little bit about the Avatar nft project and um what folks should expect there oh yeah oh yeah yeah and Dan and Hannah feel free to jump in too um we we started creating these like these portraits to our portraits about a year ago right after nft MSC 2021 as something we just we just want to do for fun like we had interviewed all these amazing artists and in the green screen room and we wanted to you know like um honor them um by by drawing these like cute pixel art avatars of them you know like care silver and Andrew Wang and [ __ ] random people like that and um so we were and you know part of the challenge and fun of creating this pixel art characters was like how do we unify these artists together you know how do we how would like a board eight translate into Pixar and how would a fidanza translate to Pixar and how would a punk how would they all stand together into one collection and we were just this this became kind of a ritual for us you know like after every shoot we would you know just like talk to the artists and like see get a sense of them sometimes collaborate with them on holidays these avatars would come together it well it wasn't conceived initially as an nft project actually it was just like something we were we were just doing as an experiment and um at the beginning of the show you talked about pivoting um early this year you know last week as we transitioned from like the right CF approach to fundraising to something a little bit more crypto native if we we were looking at these nft projects you're looking at Avatar avatars we drew and we realized that this could be something that could be taken a step further and used as the foundation of a generative art collection perhaps like what if we were able to Like Remix traits from XYZ artists together and and and combine it into a a shared um connection of all these people mixed together um yeah the job that opens today is exactly that it's a 10 000 Avatar collection um and every Avatar is generated using a combination of of the iconic traits of our cast um so really again like if if you know the space enough and you know people's pfps enough um you can sort of piece together who you have so you know you you might get a generated character that again is like Tyler hobbs's face with Claire Silver's hair and you know like four one five six to five or something like that whoa I got very excited um some of them like look really sick I mean like bit Pixies Avatar in particular like I'm really excited to see like how how those avatars are generated because she has like some awesome pixelated wings um and yeah there's there's basically a whole ecosystem that we're going to be building out using these tokens um and and sort of what it means to hold a token and how we engage with the token holders and sort of open up this this world um of media and sort of documentation and archive that we've created over the past 16 months or so I'm assuming you have permission from all of these artists to use the the pieces of their various avatars and traits in this generative work we do and you know one one thing that we're also doing um through this drop is including all of the artists in the gross revenue as well so 15 of the revenue will be going to the artists included in the drop in perpetuity um and for me I don't know that that's a very exciting it might sound like a small thing but uh in the world of non-fiction it's a very exciting uh opportunity actually to to sort of find ways of the people that you're collaborating with uh to to mutually benefit from raising the budget of the project that is telling the story that you've already lent your time to you know uh like it's important to remember that like everyone shows up to the studio like everyone that we filmed with actually showed up and gave us their time and that was in exchange for for nothing um and then for that you know I think it's it's really cool to be able to recognize them using this Tech coin shift is a leading treasury management and

I expect from a benefits perspective and and being a part of this this team cool it would be much easier to say to the list of what I'm not allowed to talk about right now is unfortunate but I think what I should what I can say is this project is born of collaboration with the artist that we're working with and that's what's most exciting to me is the artist collaborations that we um will be creating and sharing with the people who are part of our community and I want to also give credit to our amazing associate producer the Crypt Keeper who has built a Discord Community for new here 11 000 people strong um and we have and our Twitter as well and we've been hosting events IRL and in the metaverse and those are also extraordinary opportunities to connect really intimately with artists um and to um and to meet the cast and I think that that offering that couple that kind of access in a way that feels good um that's what we're really good at and that's what really excited to continue to do and yeah obviously what I can't talk about is the profit participation sort of question that limbs large and and we're figuring that out too but like that's why we didn't take the easy route of financing this the traditional way I can very much attest to you guys consistently choosing to make this way [ __ ] hard for the sake of I think creative Purity and and really like the community at large and I just say I have no Financial stake in this film so any like you know praise I'm lathering on the team I have literally no no staking this other than uh appreciating what you guys have done um some brass tax questions people can go to the website and and see this but like mint price and then like kind of immediately Next Step should they go to the Discord typical nft project in that sense to kind of keep up with with any new announcements that might be coming out absolutely yeah you can mint a new here Avatar now uh the public mint is open today um and the Min practice is .088 each was that a significant like is the 2 8 of significance in some in some way foreign not that I remember I feel like there was definitely there was definitely a conversation about it but I feel like we have like so many conversations on like that granular level that I kind of have lost the details there feels like that's like a Kai Turner contribution of some sort it's like you know and and there are there are numbers there are hard Fiat numbers that this film is trying to meet right I mean like it's like you know that there there's the hard cost of real labor that goes into filmmaking like these movies don't fall out of the sky and I and I say that being somebody who really believed that they did until I ended up on my first set and I was like oh wow like it it's it's eight phone calls to get a picture car on set like just the car that you you film you know like just even these small details that no one really knows and I mean with this there is the magnitude of having uh a Global Production um and wrangling you know obviously close to a hundred different voices and then the hard editing work of really putting that together in a narrative that speaks to both people in the space who deeply love it and deeply know it but also especially people outside the space right um where are you in the timeline of this right you know again we we referenced that you were you approached I sort of had an initial conversation with you about this a year ago effectively and you were just starting how long does it take to to how long will it take to finish producing this film and then and then we maybe we'll talk about the steps that come after that yeah I I feel like a fun place to answer that question is with Bruce on sort of where we're at with with visualizing this and especially on the VFX side of things that sort of like zooms Us in um the short answer is like we're trying to uh have this ready to go in next October so it's a it's a journey um and yet we sort of know where we're going because there is this Arc of a script that is sort of holding the pieces together so you've largely finished conducting your interviews and then you'll pick up additional ones it's like a special opportunities arise exactly yeah we're mostly done filming interviews um there there is one more location that we're we're thinking to hit uh to sort of centralize ourselves on a different continent and and you know make the set accessible again in in a way that it it hasn't always been right we've done a lot of work in the states and obviously capturing people who have come in internationally here but it's important that the film uh you know is also is also decentralized so to speak um can you say the other continent yeah we'll be probably going back to well our team will definitely be going back to Europe um as a unit um but then we will have production happening in Western Africa and Eastern Asia that's awesome I was I I was I sort of a leading question because I was pretty sure you guys were going to Africa and I think I knew that and I was just having a conversation with folks like I think Nigeria has like the third highest crypto adoption of any country and I I do think capturing totally capturing what's happening in Africa is you know I'm gonna have more conversation on this podcast about it because I do think people don't really realize like how in this space a lot of a lot of folks on the continent of Africa are and uh important highlight I think absolutely there's some great work going on in Senegal and yeah like you're saying in Nigeria as well um incredible incredible artists doing a lot of like Community work there too actually like doing a lot of like really Grassroots onboarding work um which is which is always awesome to hear yeah I treasured out apparently the treasured out Community like some of the specific games that have been built on treasured out like battlefly like the majority of holder holders are African and um anyway it's gonna gonna dive in I haven't done my full research on that is in the film actually um so John was somebody that I spoke with about I mean it was an incredible conversation basically about creating value uh creating currency creating value right um and and his mind is is brilliant so it was it was an incredible conversation I love that community are you primarily focused on crypto art or how much is it crypto art and how much it of it is like nfts including kind of the pfp craze and maybe cryptocurrency generally as you think about the Arc of this story yeah you know errors kind of bleed into one another here um I think that like you know really rooting this film in the initial intentions of the tech uh is is an approachable way to start right um and we had the incredible opportunity to to film with Haber and stornetta and they they are the people who invented blockchain technology uh in 1989. and you know they they they came up with this idea basically on the understanding that the world was becoming more digitized um and all of these documents were going to like live on this this web you know so many things are still being figured out but but they saw it coming and they were they were asking themselves like how are we going to know which document is authentic how are we going to be able to authenticate things in this digitized world and from there they they basically built the system that we know as blockchain wow so you guys start in 1989 like if you were to say the earliest kind of moment in the film is like chronological yes and I mean if if we talk about the conversation yesterday we also start at what does the fall of the British Empire have to do with my monkey jpeg wow okay so I'm not gonna be the best person to to spin This Thread I don't think but essentially there there is there is a narrative historical Arc of um decentralized governments and communities and nation states um becoming more centralized and sort of coming up with um globalized orders and and that's sort of what we saw happening especially after the end of World War II um with the creation of things like the IMF and the EU um and and plenty of other organizations that again like historians are probably more equipped to speak about but you know now again this is sort of where the film is rooting itself to is like the the current Paradigm is really sort of it's untenable um for so many different reasons right um for for debt for inflation um for for currency being being consistently devalued over time um and yeah I think that like from from there we really have like then the birth of a new system that I think was really born out of out of necessity um at least to Satoshi and his team of cypherpunks in the beginning but now to a wider and wider and wider growing group of people who sort of see this this corrupt system like something is super rotten in the state of Denmark right and more education is happening as to what this is all about and how this sort of financialized system works and and I think that like really showing this space is enough an alternative to that traditional Paradigm is really where we kick this film off and then going a step deeper is is to say that crypto art and nfts are are the culture that that is is speaking and attempting to speak to that space in all these different ways and and then this is like we're talking about geopolitics right now which we probably didn't expect to do on this yeah I didn't prep you for the geopolitical quiz that was uh forthcoming but fair but the the way that this is felt in the movie is our protagonist this this character rookie is a millennial and we're starting with that sort of widespread anger that this generation has about their disenfranchisement from the financial system and it's it's that sort of emotional tenor the meme of like oh welcome to your third once in a lifetime or like once in a generation crisis yeah bingo so we're really asking like well how did we get there and what's the alternative I mean there's and there's so many different artists really working to answer that question too and like make make this entire system um more tangible and more digestible for people through ART and how art communicates and that's why it makes so much sense like that's why that's why pfps make a lot of sense despite crypto art makes sense it's like these these ways of attempting to communicate what this is all about you know we spoke to Sarah mayohas also very early on and and she she was working with with Bitcoin before nft was that did not exist this term right and she saw Bitcoin and what Satoshi created as as like some sort of new avant-garde material right Mitchell Chan has a very similar take on this Raya Myers as well maybe it's like bit pixie who maybe is someone who wouldn't make a bar in physical space But as a convenient a convener of community makes one in the metaverse and star starts to create real rituals for people to come together virtually and like in sad moments after a lot of money died or enjoy to you know celebrate what is being built in voxels like there's so many different ways that we can enter that question of why why this alternative what is the most interesting Insight or like a a a comment or a thought that somebody shared that you were like oh my God that's so interesting and it was an aha moment for you or it changed the way you think about things I'd love to hear that from from each of you maybe Bruce we'll start with you just bring it in here for me what really sticks with what we just fixed on my heart still is what Kara silver talked about um um how your your digital stuff can live on after your physical self passes you know like there's like this concept that like um like maybe 100 years from now maybe like the the clear survey eyes to out there living you know in our virtual our virtual Subs are can can live on you know someone who who wonders a lot about the impermanence of of the real life physical you know like the what what what what can what can linger for for a while it's it's really tough yeah to two responses to that one I I snow fro I know once talked about like you know you could program some things that your generative your generative art pieces that were set to not release until after you died and like that was a really interesting concept to me so I well he made he like gifted a punk to someone to to basically be delivered to their wallet on their 18th birthday I think it was it wasn't it a fun there was also the punk because he did it for his friend he put five dollars of I think it was ethereum in a wallet that won a lock until their daughter exactly exactly you know turned 18. yeah he he's he thinks really uh progressively about time and how you can use Smart contracts in really interesting ways with time the other thing that's a bit lighter about this is I have a friend who's very interested in um immortality and like how can science get us to the point where humans can live forever and you know he's sort of made money now and this is like what he spends his time thinking about and he was like you won't be surprised probably to learn that there's like a lot of our funding comes from like crypto people and just like crypto people have this wiring or this fascination with just like you know maximum life yes and and um so uh yeah very interesting okay Dan Hannah who wants to go next I don't I honestly it's a really hard question to answer um and like I don't I don't know even how to like reduce like the encounter but like Sarah Zucker is like an incred I stole it from you Hannah it's a really good moment all right let me let me perhaps it and say so so these three people have been talking to like the most interesting well-known people who have been in the crypto nft space and these are the things and the two of you feel like the same moment stood out so now I'm extra eager to hear what that moment is there's something about Sarah um and you know I think it will come through in film for sure um but it definitely comes through in the physical she's uh she transports you uh in in talking and like there's just something super to steal her word like erratic um just about her presence and like she's she's one of the more um she's one of the most spiritual people I'd say sort of in the space but has like a very clear and articulated understanding of what what that spirituality means in like the digital realm um and yeah whatever anytime I see Sarah I'm just like it's like I just wanna I just wanna absorb everything that she says is there a nugget you can give us of like a point she's made that you're like oh wow this like unlocks something for me or I thought about the world differently or this cryptocination Hannah you you can take that then God the witch and the wand the mycelial network the fact that the bear Market is a wildfire I mean like it's the witch not the wand that was that's an incredible phrase okay what's the what's the witch not the wand then it's it's the it's the artists not the tools um it's it's the yeah it's it's the spirit not the physical in a way yeah it's it's the Sorceress do any of you feel like you have a better sense of where all this is heading or where we might land in this space in a year two years five years ten years having embarked on all these conversations oh yes and no I mean I guess that when you're talking about the future you're expanding you're expanding parallel universes of possibility and so there is a really extraordinary utopian vision of how this all goes down of wealth redistribution of Ubi because we've got the robots to do our jobs and there's like a scary version too um you know that I think maybe even just magnifies the problems that we have right now um of Financial disenfranchisement and also populism and just this like widening extreme in people not being able to listen to each other that's all there in the space that we're talking about and I want to weave in the ceremony that stuck with me which is I I we talked about why people are so resistant to this technology to nfts in particular I mean we all know that it is just a wildly um potent subject everyone has strong opinions and for Sarah her analysis is it's rep it represents the nft space the crypto Art Space it represents self-sovereignty it represents our own empowerment to create value from scratch because of the relationships that we create and nurture and because of the sheer creativity that comes out of our brains and she talks about how people are terrified of that freedom and that's why maybe this is such a loaded potent subject for people it's the nft space so my hope for where this all goes is that we maybe all get a little bit more literacy with our own power because these tools become becomes much more accessible to us like yeah sure I'm gonna go fund my own startup or my own art project or whatever like that that risk becomes less risky for more people that that would be a hope you're reminding me of the quote that I feel like I attribute it to Oprah though I don't I think Marion Williamson isn't it it's like it's not our inadequacies that are our greatest fear it's like the idea that we are powerful beyond measure and that that's actually people's greatest fear which to be fair I've always been like I don't really [ __ ] understand that quote like I'm not actually afraid that I'm powerful I'm afraid that I'm inadequate but I'm probably just not deep enough to like really know what my deepest fear is uh but that's sort of what you're talking about yeah I know I think that there is there is absolutely something to that for sure and I think that that's also why like you know I mean to Hannah's Point like we're still in we're still very much I think in this like spark phase and like if they're like it is it's inevitable kind of like what's coming but like it's it's also going to be spreading everywhere in all directions I think like we can definitely answer that by by saying that artists will still be here artists will still be doing their thing um and they'll still be trying to figure out how to talk about like what all these systems are doing to each other um but I definitely think that like yeah we're gonna see more and more powerful systems use this Tech uh to leverage the value that they can that they can create um for their communities in whatever way it's like again like like for poor Dave that might mean actually dropping a coin into all of their holders wallets um for other people that might be access to education um so I think we're going to see all these Incredible use cases uh but yeah I think also as a team we're so concerned right now with figuring out how to articulate this in in a way that is digestible to the most amount of people so that they can also get hip to it because there are so many communities that the when Tech like this does come about are just immediately just kind of left on the fringes and the margins without any sort of access point um and that's that's really what we're trying to provide here yeah and also we're we're talking at a crossroads right now like you know we're a few days after the marriage which was one of the biggest crypto events you know and past year or two but also we're at the edge of a recession we're we're still deep in a lingering War you know in in Europe and so I feel a lot of like mixed feelings right now about the future and and what could what could happen um but ultimately like this is uh I'm also optimistic because um we have this profound tool at our hands right now you know this open source Community this open source like nft movement that we can all collaborate on and build on together so like how how does our generation uh meet this moment with this tool is something that I'm I'm optimistic and I have to piggyback on the profundity from Bruce for a moment with it just reminded me of something that we heard from Nadia um [ __ ] right when we when we filmed with her um back in March really the height of the Devastation in Ukraine and um as a Russian dissident she's you know on the front lines of that in a in a massive way and we had the honor of filming with Nadia on the 10th anniversary of her imprisonment um so really really uh charge day and you know Nadia is um as many of us may should know or hopefully we'll know and I know you've had her on your podcast Carly um is an activist right and she talks about it like the age of 14 coming to the realization that she would rather just live in a dumpster than be courageous every single day of her life and it's seeing someone with that level of courage and not giving a fuckness that makes me Optima who is so committed to this space and what it can do for Humanity and for uh anti-censorship sort of um future and for the you know um and and just a general sort of like vision of uh Humanity that gives me hope that we have people like her in the space as well um who realize the potential that that Bruce kind of laid out too well it's so funny like people who say what's the use case for crypto and then you think of somebody like Nadia or you know people coming out of Ukraine and it's like you know how lucky you are if you can't see the use case for crypto you are in a small portion of the population that is in a very very fortunate situation in your yeah there's an artist that we're working with in Iran you know um who makes art uh that is that is anti-regime right um it's very dangerous who's Anonymous obviously I was reading about him or do we know gender that hey okay we do know yeah we yeah um yeah and I mean he's an incredible artist um and his story is phenomenal and you know I mean using again blockchain Tech is is basically the only way that his art can can get out of Iran um and part of making his art is also again um putting it on chain like making sure that the people are aware that the these events happened and that they're being communicated through his art um so so not only is it is it the piece but it's also sort of time stamped um which is which is super important um to point out about what this Tech can do it does create sort of that that objective layer of Truth so to speak so I want a bunch of people to see this movie because I think it would be great for the space great for the world what does distribution for something like this look like you get the movie made you know we sell our 10 000 nft avatars the movies like what comes next yeah that's a that's a good question you know like there's a few different ways in which this goes um you know the more information that comes out about uh other cast members and the film I think that it's just gonna it's gonna draw more attention to the project um which means buyers then start asking questions too um and you know like that that's something that we evaluate when and if that happens like for me I I have a lot of experience like waiting until my film is done um and and finished it in a state that's like really ready to be shown and then taking it to a festival like Tribeca or like Sundance and having like a real moment where we Premiere it and we show it um and then from there you you sell it um to be distributed to a Distribution Company to a streamer um or any combination of the of the two of them but that's really what like the landscape looks like today I think for for our team um you know also by virtue of knowing really the the incredible amount of footage and and information and data that we have about the space I think that it's important for us to maintain Independence as much as possible and and again that creative freedom as much as possible so that's really why we are turning to this nft drop in the community to to sort of also help support this project getting produced in that way so that we don't really have to like let anybody into it who who might not have the same sort of mutual benefit uh interest as as we do so putting some of that into like lay person speak I feel like is something I learned working with y'all is like one route is you just get a buyer who comes in a Netflix or a big streamer who says hey we just want this film and great it gets released on there the other route would be to release at festivals to have a theatrical opening people in in theaters like around the world in theory you can see it you'd sell it to different distributors who sell by region Etc and then you know getting bought by a streamer what I hear you saying is like you want to maintain flexibility to like honor essentially the Integrity of the project and I know you guys have experience selling to to the big streamers but it's like we want to hold off and and until we really are able to finish this thing to its like creative completion before we start evaluating where it goes in the world so that it's what we want to be so I mean my first film uh Mala Mala I spent three and a half years in Puerto Rico documenting the trans Liberation movement and that was a film that was really difficult to sell right um it was it was really it came out just before uh this this wave of trans awareness and trans-lib kind of happening Stateside too um and you know we found a way to get it into theaters and it opened at IFC in New York you know the programmers gave me a week and people turned up for it and then the film spread it went to LA and then it went to Canada and then a proper distributor picked it up and it was only after that the Netflix ended up purchasing the rights to that film globally for three years you know um and and I've had that experience before you know I mean my second film was very similar too like we had a proper theatrical release and then uh that's still available on Hulu um Dina is still up there to be watched and and I think that there's something about that sort of like you know we we have this incredible community that is collaborating on the film and there's something about keeping keeping this ours until it's ready really to be celebrated by a wider group of people and seen and and owned in a way I wanna jump just say okay filmmakers are artists and we are business people as well and so yes we're talking about the value of having flexibility till the end from a creative perspective it's nice have that flexibility but we also want to have the flexibility so that we can have a really successful sale because we also want to thrive as yeah artists and we want all the investors behind our project to thrive and work we know how to do that and we're committed to doing that so when when you are able to kind of hold the sale of a movie um until or yeah until you have finished it then you open up a lot of doors for maybe we'll we'll just license it for this period of time we don't have to give it in perpetuity and there's all of these very very cool things that then we can continue to do as a community and as a team to to build out the media that we've created apart from the film um and that's like really as much as we can say about kind of like what the future of this project looks like Beyond just the token drop that's happening today um is that like I'm very very much in the mindset of building films that have legs um they're they're screened all the time uh you know at different festivals or community events and like that to me like is something that I'm definitely looking to build out with this like this this isn't a film that's gonna happen and then disappear um there's an entire ecosystem behind this project so to close public mint has launched today by the way at the date this is going to be released it's Wednesday September 28th it'll be released and folks can go to visit newhere.xyz give it we'll we'll of course include the link but why not just shout it out here um and you yeah you can follow us on Twitter at new here XYZ you can check out the site at newhere.xyz um both of those places have links to our Discord um DMs I think are open on all accounts as well so if there are any questions like apart from the drop itself if you're looking to get involved as an artist as an animator or whatever I mean like we we are open this is how we built our team this is how we built the project this is a project very much of the space and will continue to be built that way um so we're looking forward to continuing to work with people uh to realize this insanely ambitious vision for New Year awesome well thank you all so much I'm proud I'm proud of what you guys are doing and excited to see the film and appreciate you coming on you're the best Carly and you do such incredible work it's been awesome really to like also watch uh when you've been able to make happen in the past year it's really remarkable thank you back at you we're all grown up you know where to go Kumbaya thank you Carly thank you Carly
