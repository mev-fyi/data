vitalik's back on bankless we've officially defined the metaverse and what do you do when your friend asks you about crypto all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the important narratives and big headlines from around bankless this week as always there are going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to quickly shout out our sponsor tracer dow their perpetual pools product is now live on arbitrum launching natively to layer 2 is something we've talked a lot about skipping ethereum mainnet and going straight to a roll-up makes a lot of sense for a derivatives protocol like tracer and now we have scaled decentralized leverage with no liquidity and no margins pretty cool uh check it out at tracer.finance so vitalik came on the podcast this week which is always a good time and he recently posted an article to his blog called moving beyond coin voting governance uh and for d5 protocols coin voting seems to be the standard mechanism for governance but there are inherent flaws here in an optimal governance structure the incentives of the individual are aligned with those of the whole the interests of the individual are typically profit driven or self-interest while the interests of the whole include public goods general well-being maintenance upgrades the health of the whole ecosystem and it's really hard to take those two things and smoosh them together in an elegant way governance is how you decide things how you decide where capital and resources should go do you give every individual involved the exact same weight do you prioritize those who may have more at stake what about participation how can you ensure that each person only gets one identity these are tough questions that require research development and elegant implementation coin voting as it currently stands doesn't really do the trick whales can coordinate and overpower smaller stakeholders and in general coin voting promotes the interest of the coin holders and a defy ecosystem is and should be much more than just its token the thing that coin voting really relies on um for kind of the philosophical arguments for why like it makes sense is this idea that it couples economic interests and governance power right like coin voting governance is supposed to work because the people with the coins have the votes um and so the people who have economic interest in the protocol success are the ones that have the governance power to make the success happen the problem is that financialization is extremely good at separating out um like different parts of an asset if the people uh in that um in that asset want them to be separated and like most people like because each individual each individual person only has such a tiny and insignificant share of their governance power most people do not value their governance power that highly right like even if there aren't any attackers it's very hard to get people to be willing to vote at all like voter participation rates in most coin voting systems are tiny and then if there is the ability to just kind of like split up your token that has to build the economic interest and the governance power and say like there's going to be token a that has just the economic interest and so it can be that has just the governance to power and then you can go like rent out your token b um and keep your token a like that's a deal that a lot of people are going to find attractive right and financial systems are just inherently about doing this kind of unbundling long story short it makes sense why coin voting is the default standard but we can and should do better the podcast covers a bunch of other things like running your own node other layer ones like solana and the trade-offs there and the metaverse i love when vitalik comes on bankless and i strongly recommend going through all his episodes in market monday david talked about how the pace of innovation in this industry is astounding and it's really not all that surprising when you think about it the crypto community lives on the cutting edge of coordination technologies and one piece of innovation drives another and another and it's expanding in complex ways in all sorts of directions and this is discussed in way further detail in the upcoming layer zero episode with kevin owaki of getcoin and it's a good one in this week's layer zero though david spoke with probably our favorite bitcoiner nick carter and what i really respect about nick is his priorities are always in line and he absolutely crushes what the bitcoin community is the best at and that is macro big picture history economics and just like bitcoin nick's values are hard clean cut and reliable and there was also a really interesting conversation here about religion what role does faith play in the different arenas of cryptoculture how do belief systems and identities come into play as you find your place in this industry now i don't mean this in like a democrat republican kind of way but it definitely seems like the bitcoin ethos would attract more conservative-minded faith-based folks while ethereum and d5 is a little more liberal-minded and as i've gotten to know the space more the reasons behind this distinction are increasingly clear even on the deep technical protocol level and as the human layer layer 0 smashes together and mingles with the technology layer i think that's when you have the metaverse it seems like everybody in the space is trying to wrap their heads around exactly what the metaverse is and instead of our usual live stream uh this week ryan and david did a classic no guest episode to define the metaverse humanity's going digital people like to own things people are going to want to own digital things that's crypto in a nutshell and if you believe that's true then like crypto's got to have a bright future and i think that the metaverse sort of fits into that because what we're doing in crypto is so like i guess the metaverse is hard to define maybe we'll get into some definition of it but what we're doing in crypto is we're layering kind of this object permanence on top of it this digital property right system once we have digital objects and objects that exist only on the internet then it's up to the internet and the things that we do on it to build a world around those objects because we're not going to build a physical world around those objects we already have a physical world with physical objects now that now we have digital objects but what we are missing is a digital world but i think this whole digital world of which people have started to call the metaverse begins with a base of digital objects and so the the fundamental thesis about this whole idea is that the metaverse emerges out of a shared registry a shared state of truth a single source of truth of all known objects in the digital universe which or the metaverse so that's that's like kind of the skeleton for the whole entire thesis the conversation circles around much of david's article from a few weeks back called the metaverse emerges and it's really hard to put all of the ideas in a nutshell but the tldr is that something like a crypto economic nation state is emerging slowly spreading out its feelers and rooting itself into the fabric of our society uh and in this space the metaverse will exist and it already exists in many ways and it definitely exists to a degree on the current internet but the fully fledged metaverse is what we're trying to get at here and it's tough to pin down i think what we'll see is something like raul paul said digital fluidity when the internet reaches a space where value and information are manifested into composable objects and sovereign individuals have ownership over those objects and when the metaverse has tens of thousands hundreds of thousands hundreds of millions hundreds of billions of objects floating around in the metaverse a that each one has its own serial number because each one had to be like manifested in ethereum by a transaction but now every time an object collides with another object that is also another transaction on ethereum it's likely going to be on a roll-up that's what roll-ups are for um but like all of this economic activity this vibrancy of objects interacting with objects interacting with objects creates an economic engine it is the egg it is the heat of the economy and then eip1559 captures a portion of that heat to recycle it into the ethereum economy to make sure it's secure make sure it's going make sure the engine is fluid uh and that is uh that is the model of the metaverse and that is in my mind really really bullish identities cultures social things economic things all blended together in an immersive cohesive way and the glue of that metaverse is the subjective human people side of things and also the objective hard-coded protocol on the other is that thing ethereum is eth ultrasound metaverse money anyways uh part of marrying those two things together the digitally social with the digitally economic is onboarding people into this space and perhaps the most challenging part of this whole thing is bridging the crypto curious into the crypto native that's what ben talks about in his article this week and he tells us how he onboards his friends into crypto this world is a deep multifaceted one which is not easy to understand especially at first on top of that the media stigma and cultural understanding of crypto is generally misleading and distracting so how do you onboard people into this space well you find their motivations what are their interests or concerns about crypto then where do they get their information crypto twitter is a squishy chaotic place where you can either find tons of insight or tons of bs showing people where to look is huge to get them to familiarize themselves with the language and the culture and finally at some point they need skin in the game they need to get themselves some assets first to know what it feels like but also is an incentive to figure out exactly what's going on from there they can onboard into defy use a decentralized application and eventually participate in the ecosystem find their niche find what they like and care about our other articles this week focused on the using a decentralized application part first we covered lending with maple finance maple is a really interesting d5 primitive concerned with under collateralized corporate loans maple is paving the way for defy credit where the vast majority of crypto is either fully or over collateralized credit scores are tricky but maple has stepped into the arena of offering loans to verified creditworthy institutions on the borrowing side and on the lending side you can stake funds to earn yield we also covered earning on dydx one of dfi's biggest perpetuals markets dydx rewards traders with its native token offers yield on staking liquidity and also offers discounts on trading fees to token holders these are two of many many daps out there to learn more about and start getting your hands dirty so with that get your hands dirty with some of our sponsors arbitra matcha ledger and uniswap we get to sponsor some of the essential tools to
