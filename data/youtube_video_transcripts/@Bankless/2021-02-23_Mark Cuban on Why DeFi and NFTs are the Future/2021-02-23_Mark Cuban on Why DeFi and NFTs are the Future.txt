all right bankless nation we are super excited about this extra special episode with mark cuban i'm going to introduce mark in just a minute just some quick logistics we are live streaming this special episode for you so catch it live on youtube hopefully you're watching now the podcast will come out next monday of this and then after the show david and i are gonna do something different we're gonna jump into clubhouse and have an after party where we do a debrief on the episode so catch that as well there's some instructions in the show notes for that last thing shout out to the sponsors that made this possible you'll see some of the rotating logos gemini ave monolith dharma guys these are the tools to help you go bankless and they have helped make this episode possible use their stuff mark cuban you need no introduction to the bankless community or really any community um you are mark cuban the d5 bull i think now at least that's how crypto twitter is seeing these days how are you doing sir i'm doing great how y'all doing good man it is awesome to have you on bank list like dave and i are so psyched about this your time is super valuable we want to get right to the goods can we start with this question you weren't bullish on d5 before at least that's our general sense why are you now bullish on on or you weren't bullish on bitcoin before rather but why are you so bullish on define now what's what kind of change for you so let's let's go through it so when bitcoin first started really becoming popular in the early days let's put aside 2009 10 11 12 right um you know i was very familiar with the very familiar with blockchain but the original um presentation or narrative if you will was that it was a currency right that it was going to be used as a currency by normal people in normal circumstances and i i just never saw that happening to this day i don't see it as being a replacement currency for the us dollar or for any sovereign nation for that matter is it a better way to transfer money yeah of course right is that are there significant benefits to um to bitcoin yeah of course but it's really evolved to being a store of value for the longest time store value was not the you know was not the key to bitcoin right there was going to be lightning and that was going to allow all these transactions to take place and yada yada and so that to me never got me excited because i i still don't think that'll happen but i've always thought it could be a store of value i've always compared it to gold and you know it's what people will pay for but what really changed is over the last year um as i started getting more into smart contracts in particular and really understanding more about their capability and seeing the enhancements that had been made that was the first thing that got me excited what made me really blow up on it and really get fired up about it is when i went to mintable.app and minted my first nft and it wasn't so much just minting the process but when i saw the royalties right that was the game changer because the challenge for all intellectual property whether it's art whether it's music whether it's photography whether it's a textbook whether it's anything is the rule of first sale right once you sell it everybody else has got the right to sell it and you don't get a nickel from it and this changes all of that and the implications there and the applications are enormous so that was the first thing that got me started with nfts then i started digging in more on the d5 stuff because you can't miss you know from this summer right i mean deep i was everywhere and all anybody talked about it seemed like and so i started digging in and there's a lot of hype you know a lot of bs going around and a lot of you know the yield farming thing and apy and token binging and all this kind of stuff but what got me excited is really understanding that d5 turned bitcoin or ethereum or even several other tokens into personal banking right and friction free personal banking you know with with the money i have in some of my bank accounts right i still got to go to a banker and i still have to fill out paperwork and it's still a multi-day process and that's ridiculous right even you know even though i'm over collateralized and and i have a big nvl in my personal accounts right and so you know then i started looking at it and realized that okay put aside the over collateralization that's not really a limiting factor um but i can borrow or anybody can borrow regardless of size in seconds and it's this decentralization really working to turn crypto into a personal banking platform and that to me is the most exciting aspect of d5 and then you start applying that to corporations and then you start extending um nfts and smart contracts in particular and so you can mint anything anything that's digital becomes a digital tokenizable um asset that can be resold all those things together and it really is something to get excited about because not only can it change how people deal with their own personal assets and their own you know borrowing and lending money but also for companies it can really allow them to monetize things they've never been able to monetize before so mark this sounds like you have uh fallen down the bankless rabbit hole really this decentralized right like this this is this is what you are speaking our language sir and you're talking about these the the potential of these programmable assets whether it's an nft or whether it's it's some sort of uh programmable interest account but uh a lot of the the the people listening here don't remember the birth of the original internet right like we've got like more generations in front of us for the kids listening i want to know if you're feeling like internet vibes here early internet vibes here is this like a an internet of of money and internet of value is this like an internet 2.0 to you or is it something different well it's different but it there's a lot of similarities right so back in the day um people you know so everything was analog right it was physical in a lot of respects and so people looked at the internet as a way to to simplify things and centralize things and make them available to everybody right that was the whole value of the net and then you started to see unique applications it's like my my company audionet you know we took sporting events we took radio stations um back in late 94 early 1995 when people didn't even know what the internet was and we said you know what just like we're doing now literally you know when we started streaming starting with audio and doing live audio stream um like this in 1995 people are like what's the point you know i'll just turn on my radio i'll just turn on my tv right i'll just listen to you know my i'll put in a cd in the cd player it was like why are you even doing this i'm like no you don't get it bits or bits right they don't care where you put them or they just want to be used effectively efficiently and now we can send audio where people want how people want when they want them right and so but there are limiting factors like bandwidth was a huge limiting factor fast forward to today right you know back then everybody tried to digitize and internet eyes everything now with smart contracts people and and crypto and on blockchain particular people are looking for new applications everywhere and it's hard to know what's right and what's wrong what's going to work and what's not going to work so we were able to make things work um there were a lot of applications that ended up working ebay amazon etc there were a lot that failed and so we're in the same place right now and back then companies went public and everybody wanted to own stock in an internet company even though they didn't understand it now you know there's tokens and applications and layer one two three four and people don't fully understand it but they're they go hype and they go for the narratives and and that's what makes it similar but underneath it all there are solid applications that impact the world and that's the important part i can't tell you while the winners are going to be yet or who all the losers are going to be whether it's the nft space whether it's defy whether it's smart um whether it's blockchain and smart contract applications so there's a lot of spray and um prey when it comes to buying tokens and dealing with this stuff and that's what makes it really similar people don't didn't fully understand then we didn't know who all the winners were going to be then there's a lot of okay i'll try a little bit of everything to see what works and see what sticks and that's very similar to today so mark we the there's a frequent uh conversation in like the bankless world in the ethereum world that like all these d5 financial tools as soon as you get over this like learning curve the the the experience of using these tools is this an absolute tree like like you said we don't have to go into a bank we can use these personal financial tools in the comfort of our own homes and they're straight up more powerful tools um and so like on a personal note these are all advantageous for us as individuals yet you and and notably you are on this uh the shark tank green screen right now i like to invest in things so how are you on abc let me just add yeah absolutely and so like notably there's like one half where like these are personal tools that can better our lives but also how are you thinking on this from like the investor side like you you said that it was really the the ability for the resale ability of these nfts to that offer commissions baked in via smart contracts like where does your investor hat turn into like turn when you when you think about this space yeah so you know there's a lot of battles going on right now you know and there's a lot of people striving for the crown if you will you know wondering what's going to happen with ethereum and e 2.0 and transactions per second and there's a lot of hype around that and so you know i'm trying to get my arms around what companies are going to be the survivors um and what's going to happen with the industry for that matter you know is 2.0 really going to happen is it going to be you know is it going to work what type of tps is it going to hit you know you see what's happening with binance how much of that is narrative and hype and what's real um you see a lot of liquidity chasing to try to create a story that you know this company's got all this nvl and they must be strong and then you know people talk about the market cap of the tokens and so they're and that's really not relevant to anything that's just all narrative just like there's narrative you know like price earnings ratio price to earnings growth ratio you know those you know those are narratives that that um analysts use to sell stocks and so there's a lot of narratives right now so from an investing perspective i tried to say take my same shark tank principles and normal investing principles what are the good companies who are the smart people you know what are the applications that are going to change the game and like i said personal banking is you know really a big change you know decentralizing what was centralized um governance is a big game changer but those are macro themes right and so you've still got to determine which companies are going to be the ones that actually create the technology that really makes it work and when i say technology you know it could be a competitive blockchain it could be a layer two add-on it could be you know layer four it could be whatever you know and now you see all the arguments is it is you know is this dex really centralized or is it decentralized right is this yield farming sustainable or is it not sustainable a lot of the [ __ ] is not sustainable you know when when everybody is just liquidity chasing to try to you know build up their nvl and paying these astronomical rates and paying to be listed or at least hedging to be listed on on an exchange and there's so many games being played because everybody is chasing the same money trying to find narratives to bring in new money and that happens with new industries that's not unusual but from my investing perspective to answer your question i've got to separate the [ __ ] from what's real totally and very similar to the late 1990s and kind of the to the internet.com kind of bubble and bust um we want to get back to talking about some of the the areas in crypto that you're most interested in putting on your investment at but before we do staying with kind of the macro picture here so we've got uh crypto as an internet 2.0 but you also said something super interesting in a podcast i was listening to recently mark which is uh defy is america 2.0 right so i mean famously america made some fantastic strides in the early internet laid out some massive infrastructure uh created a home for silicon valley and has really led the way on the internet revolution up to this point um do you think that defined crypto could be like an america 2.0 how important is it for politicians and main street to get their arms wrapped around how important this could be for for the us as a country you know ryan that that's a really interesting question because the reality is you know the strongest plays and players are not american right we talk a lot about it but the biggest money doesn't come from here you know and the biggest you know day-to-day usage from everyday people not happening here right it's happening elsewhere around the world but a lot of the development not most not even the biggest is happening here right a lot of the biggest in the original stuff that's been going on for a while is happening in asia and and so you know we have the opportunity to really have an impact but we're not we can't think americans like to think that we're always the biggest and best at everything but we're not really in this particular case and that can be concerning because if we don't it's just like look most of the internet's in english right in terms of the governance um dns etc um and so we've got to really hopefully be a leader in this now you know there's a lot of ways to to discuss that does that mean selling half the gold in fort knox and buying a basket of you know bitcoin ethereum and maybe some others i would be all for that because i think gold is useless right you know gold bugs will tell you that well it has intrinsic value it has this much intrinsic value for manufacturing applications and all that jewelry usage there's no law there's there's no law of physics that says gold jewelry is more valuable than any other metal being you know created into jewelry or for plastics and jewelry for that matter right that's just a narrative that we've all accepted hey gold is better gold band gold jewelry whatever you know and so every store of value has a story whether it's bitcoin ethereum or gold and so if we're going to have a store of value that at least is more more useful i'd rather have bitcoin and ethereum in fort knox than i would gold um but a lot of that is just you know we need as a country to start recognizing that is real and two it makes better business sense as a country than it does for a lot of a lot of other applications i'll give you an example you know you if we created our own usdc right issued by the treasury we lose money on every penny minted we lose money on every nickel diamond maybe even quarter minted we lose money on dollars and having to recycle them right um it's bad business and now with the pandemic where um if you if you have to go into a store if you still go into a store and you have to use cash and you get change back or you get dollars back your first thought is should i even touch that thing right you know and and so with trying to get to a touchless society for for economics usdc issued by the treasury makes perfect sense and so being a leader there and i think hopefully we'll have conversations with politicians and leaders in government to to convey to them that 99 of transactions are already digital right we already have a usdc it just doesn't get down to the consumer retail level we just don't call it that right when i when i do a wire transfer it's in dollars but it's all digital no one's you know printing anything out you know hopefully to confirm it until after the transaction and then that therein lies the rub because all the centralized interests government but even more so the big banks um they have a vested interest in not seeing this happen at least the way things are set up right now and so that's going to be the battle yeah so it's exactly what you said right so and we didn't have these types of battles in the early 90s with the internet so here's part of my worry mark is that we did okay well tell us about that because my worry right now is is the politicians don't get this right there's a few people in congress who sort of are starting to wrap their heads around um crypto there's maybe andrew yang who's talking about it a little bit like in little pockets but it felt like in the 90s are you kidding me i went to see senators and try to explain it to them yeah what do they say no clue whatsoever um you know are we doing anything to stop it kinda you know whether it was copyright laws you know whether it was um dealing with bandwidth and dealing with i mean because remember back in the 90s you had a 56k modem and the biggest inhibitor to the internet was bandwidth and so there were a lot of laws put in place in terms of being able for cable and telcos and satellites in order to how and where and when they could build the restrictions communities set their own restrictions so you had multiple layers of problems in terms of just creating bandwidth and then you had people investing in fiber because you needed to connect all these things and so there there were inhibitors there but it was easier literally to install fiber underneath the ocean than it was fiber to the home right or fiber to a business trying to get a ds3 45 megabits was expensive and it was a hassle and there were all these taxes associated with it and so i mean it was it was a [ __ ] back then too and people didn't understand it you know we used to have this thing on broadcast.com called the cd jukebox and i remember and basically prior to 1996 we could put up any cd there was no copyright laws preventing it then the music industry got these copyright laws passed the digital copyright act and so we'd have to go get permission and i remember explaining this to oren hatch senator orrin hash from utah who was on the judiciary committee trying to tell him that you had to be careful with copyright laws because it could really slow down the internet and all he can think about was he had a cd of hymns or something he wanted to know if he could sell my cd you know and you know his cd i'm like no it's not cds um it just had no clue and so it was very similar then but you know people find where there's opportunity smart people find workarounds and companies find workarounds and capital finds workarounds and the same thing will happen here you know as gen z start voting more younger millennials start you know becoming more aware because they're not even as aware you know um and so as they become more aware then they'll make sure their politicians are more aware and smart capital will find ways to invest and that's what's happening now so you're optimistic that we'll be able to get over this regulatory education hurdle yeah because it's like the 90s right you know there's no choice because you can work around them because it's decentralized look if there's no usdc that's not going to stop defy the only thing that's going to screw up defy is the liquidity chase and the yield farming because you know somebody in the government is going to step up and say it's too good to be true and let me just tell you why and show all the problems um you know and like i say to people who yield chase you know the wrist doesn't leave the system you just don't know it's like a game of musical chairs you just don't know when the music is going to stop and so you've got to be really careful there in terms of yield farming but you know that now if you're sitting home you're getting a stimulus check i don't blame people from yield farming because it's actually smart as long as you can be agile but it's not a long term it's not going to be valid long term so mark one thing we've been uh super impressed with is um your ability to go deep in defy like so our biggest criticism on bank list is that many of the investors you know vcs institutional investors they don't actually use defy right so they're not informed investors imagine going and buying or like investing in apple stock in you know 2008 without ever having use let me give you a better example so we'll go back to the 90s so broadcast.com was going public in july of 1998 and we go on this thing called a road show and a road show is where you make an um a presentation to investors and we go i mean we even got to take the concord to go to london and come back today it was unbelievable but we would go into these presentations and we could see their eyes just glossing over and there were never rarely any questions and the questions just showed that they had no clue what they were investing in and then we go public it's the biggest one-day jump in the history of the stock market at that time everybody placed their maximum order and the price just skyrocketed but none of those people had a clue or understood the technology of what we were doing none and so it's it's no different here i mean that's just the way it is people are momentum investors in a lot of respects that's what we say it's like your edge can just be actually using d5 protocols have you gone in and and deposited something in ave and are earning some interest you have an edge because 95 of the other investors haven't even gone that far no no clue whatsoever right because okay so you know investing and working with some of these companies i'm like you guys you got to do me a favor if i'm going to invest here's what you got to do you have before you hit confirm right for that swap or whatever deposit whatever it may be you need to put up the transaction fee versus the apy and how long it'll take you to earn back your transaction fee right because people will see an api of 60 or 70 and invest a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars and have a gas fee because they do it the wrong time of a hundred bucks right and that's ten percent immediately right off the top and don't realize even if it's a fifty percent apy that's an annual yield right and you gotta hold it long enough to cover just to break even before you even think about it right and they don't do the math and so i'm like you got to save the little guy because otherwise it you know if you don't take care of the little guy like that it's going to backfire in the whole industry and you know whether it's ave um or others you don't see that right and that's going to create problems because you know there's a lot of people you're farming on a small level trying to figure it out and losing money including me i'll you know because when i when i first learned it and i first did my first deposit and then um did did some yield farming where i deposited and i saw the high apy and i wanted to see what happened and then i was like yeah and then i swapped it back out losing money thinking i'm getting this high yield right well but that this is exactly right like you have to have skin in the game and you have to be willing to experiment you have to have a few transactions where you're like oh that didn't go well and like here's why in order to level up and understand this stuff so what is is that generally how you approach investing and is that how you improv approach defy like tell us how you learned defy and how you approach investing yeah i just do it right i mean i'm teaching myself solidity right now i'm taking solidity tutorials so i understand smart contracts better because it's important for me to be able to say okay this is what you can do with a smart contract it's almost like artificial intelligence right so everything ai is included in almost every investment crypto doesn't really talk about it but you know every traditional regular business company does and so i'm taking you tutorials and ai i'm learning the difference between gans you know cnns reinforcement all this stuff i'm you know doing machine learning tutorials you know reading books whatever watching the videos so i can learn because i got to know what's real what's [ __ ] and 99 of the deals that say they have ai or computer vision are [ __ ] you know they have one guy or one person who is there you know that went to mit or harvard that took a class in data science and has done you know a three-layered neural network like i have and that's it right and they're going to try to figure it out ai is hard crypto is easy relatively speaking but you've got to learn you've got to learn what it is in order to be able to make legitimate decisions you know if vr i've got a patent pendant with a medical application for vr i got you know a patent that was issued for computer vision for counting things from uh from the air on the ground i mean you know i had help but these are things you know over the years just diving in and what you learn very quickly about technology generally is once you get these fundamentals in place it's not hard to add new things right d you know d5 is really straightforward um if you just try it and you understand the principles behind it but you know you've got to understand finance to a certain extent you've got to understand why people are chasing liquidity or why the dexas are chasing liquidity and trying to offer these yields and why it's a game of musical chairs but that just takes time and experience to do it mark so you've been playing in these defy apps yourself which is absolutely fantastic like ryan said you're already like leagues beyond the typical vc who doesn't actually play and the fact that you're learning solidity is insanely cool um we talked about gas fees and gas fees are they're pretty prohibitively expensive for a large part of the population it's an unfortunate place that we find ourselves in where ethereum has so much demand that everyone wants to use it yet we haven't actually learned how to how to scale it right there are l2 solutions on the way they're just very nascent not very mature we do believe they're coming there's been a ton of content that we've produced on l2s but one of my opinion one of my questions that i have for you is like do you think uh the average person like assuming that ethereum scales assuming that l2 does work do you think that the average person just you me just like the listeners here are actually making these individual transactions managing their own money uh playing when their own defy apps and putting their own money into ave putting their own money into maker dao or do you think there's going to be some sort of like uh service provider some sort of like centralized entities like how do you think how do you think about the long term for every business ever whether it's a little company coming on shark tank or the biggest companies customers take the path to least resistance period end of story we don't you know we don't want to have to think about it we put our money in a bank because we don't want to have to think about it and we know fdic insures it and we feel it's safe right better than under a mattress hopefully um and so whichever company creates look at top shots right look look what flow has done with top shots their biggest thing wasn't you know creating the videos the video moments aren't anything special the biggest thing wasn't a deal with the nba that helps makes me some money i'm glad right um the biggest thing was there's no wallet you just put in your credit card everybody's been trained for decades you just put in your credit card you buy what you want that is the key you can talk about flow blockchain all you want right and you know you can talk about whether it's better or worse and you know who's going to develop on it or why that's not the secret sauce the secret sauce is the fincen side where there's no know your customer there's no any of this other stuff you just put in your credit card you buy and if the prices go up you're happy there's a two and a half percent no it's more than that now um it's well depending on the size of the transaction but you know it's gonna be a seven to ten dollar transaction fee that's cool too because people are used to that because of shipping and credit card fees and you know and that's a thought right there's no shipping fees you know on on nfts and all that stuff but you get my point right it's the path or least resistance to dealing with things look you can't take your money off of top shots right now you know you can have something that just skyrockets in value and okay you know it looks good you know on your collection but it's you know you can't really take it anywhere you know so there's a lot of limitations and it just goes shows even despite those limitations the site being down it's hard to buy a pack you know they're still working on getting out bots all that kind of stuff people still do it because it's exciting to collect and it's easy and so deep i right now is not super easy it's not easy at all right understand standing pooling and swaps or exchanges different people use different naming conventions right yield farming and pro what what's really profitable people see apy and they're they're used to you know the concept of apy or apr because of their credit cards right and so the advanced users or people who just learn their way through it um can get to it right but you don't see nvls into the billions because of everyday people right there are big old players and i know some of them now that are just moving money around and you can do it now because you know the the exchanges of the world are able to hedge still and you know they're still the liquidity chases because it's a zero-sum game you know you talk about similarities to the internet i used to do deals with companies because they wanted traffic and with broadcast.com we got a ton of traffic and we invented these things called guaranteed click-throughs right so just like nvl is the the metric for how successful you are because that leads to market cap right so traffic was the currency back in the day and so we would charge ex you know obscene amounts for sending people traffic because they in turn use that as a metric to either go public stay public their stock price whatever it was legitimate traffic it wasn't bot traffic or anything like that it was legit but we would charge the [ __ ] out of it you know and it's the same thing now people are paying overpaying for the metrics the nvls and everything they're paying influencers who don't know [ __ ] about crypto to say you know come you know you know just to jack up their tps or jack whatever the metric is that they're using their nbl whatever it may be their user numbers and so you're seeing a lot of people gaming the system right now and you've got to really be careful of that and that hurts the ordinary user who doesn't see that bigger picture because it truly is a game of musical chairs you know if your yield that you're earning that you've committed to be locked in whether it's you know 11 days on ave or whatever you know or whatever it may be for whatever your lock is um i don't think that's a risk people fully understand and you don't have the leverage to yank yourself out like other people do mark i think david's going to get back to nfts in a second but i want to jump on something you said where it hurts the user because i think it hurts the user in two ways right so um it it hurts the user obviously when they're buying into something like a speculative type bubble it hurts the users that way but it also hurts i think the mainstream users who look at this whole crypto space and dismiss it as a bunch of speculation and nonsense and shenanigans and games and they dismiss because they're partially right aren't they yeah so it hurts them too because it shuts them out and they don't see the potential like like i you know i i do remember i would get it old enough to sort of remember this uh the dot-com bubble and everyone said that like the internet is dead at that time after the bubble popped like it would never come back and they dismissed the technology because of the speculative bubble so it hurts in two ways this this kind of speculative nature of things but you know what that kind of takes care of itself over time right because the people who are just buying traffic um and don't have something sustainable underneath it they're going to be gone it's just a question of when you know you just hope enough um individual players you know buyers i don't want to necessarily call them investors if you're looking for a 50 apy you're not investing you've got to know that they're good right you know and there should be a disclaimer that you know every dex has to list right every front end has to list saying that you know your yield is being paid in the tokens of the people that you're locking with and most likely it's going to take x number of days for you just to break even you know because if there was a break even metric you know for you know your yield versus your transaction versus the risk associated with the token you're getting people are going to think twice and might not dive in mark i want to i want to go back to the conversation of uh people using these things themselves rather than using somebody else to to be their proxy right because there are some services in d5 some services on ethereum that are very easy to obfuscate using a centralized service provider but then there are other services other things you can do in defy where it's really wouldn't make sense and specifically where i think this is true would be nfts right like you people like nfts because they like them right you can't you you can't outsource your own taste right so there are some things in this world where you actually do need to be the person you know with making the transaction buying like choosing the specific asset and like one of the reasons why why we call bankless bank lists is because there are all of these platforms that can remove these intermediaries from from choices in a bankless world right the bankless thesis uh and so i kind of want to get get your take on that because i know you love nfts and i'm assuming you wouldn't trust anyone else other than yourself to make your nft selections for you uh so when you go and you look at nfts and you are making those choices for yourself like how do you look at nfts like how do you evaluate these things especially when they're so subjective yeah so that's a great question so there's a couple things here if you if you analogize it to the art world right there are um advisories like i'm not an art guy there's no art in this house you know that i've bought um and there are advisors that come to me every now and then oh you know i'm a consultant i help you know wealthy people buy art and i'm like okay good luck you know and so there are intermediaries that try to fill that role that understand the marketplace you know i know some people that know that this artist is really hot right this artist has got a following and really what it comes down to is and the exact same thing applies to nfts it's not so much the subjective aspect of the art itself it's more what kind of following does that artist have because that following is what creates the demand because you're right there's it's almost impossible to think that that if you put up a picture that everybody's going to feel the same way about it like you look at the mona lisa and you go okay somebody thinks that's special not me right but it's the mona lisa okay so everybody you know so you're you're not going to get that commonality you're right it's very very subjective but what's not subjective and it's quantitative is the size of the following and so so when you look at crypto punks um when you look at some of the things that hash marks is doing and you look at people right they have huge followings and that's what creates the value more because it becomes a community it becomes something that creates a commonality it's like being a fan of the dallas mavericks you know there's some people who are just okay you know i hope the mavs win and then there are others like we lose a game and like me right and it's the end of the world it feels like you know the world just came to an end with every loss and i can't sleep that night and you know that's community and community creates value and people in the nft world you always have to remember that community creates value for nfts and when you're evaluating them you have to evaluate the size and the strength and the intensity of the community um and so i don't the only time i've bought nfts as an investment per se where i'm just going to let them sit there um was bitcoin origins because i thought was cool and i know those guys and i'm gonna do some stuff with them um i didn't want oh my god um eiler um oh euler beats the music ones yeah euler beats right about two of those because to me it was the most genius idea ever and that's since i've talked i've talked to those guys since at triumph um but what was genius about it was it was generative and they did the bond curve and they did a 90 reserve which means they created a floor for every item right so if you took a chance on it then you know as long as the prices are going up you're not you're going to make money no matter what and if the prices are going to go down well because the reserve was so high at least it's not going to zero right there's some value there and for them as a company being you know a shark i'm like it cost them nothing to cost to mint their marginal cost is zero and so you know their only mistake was setting a 90 reserve you know even though that made me buy more you know um and so you know the the business side is interesting to me but again the community side is most important but sometimes like the euler beats when you just come up with an idea that i thought was just really differentiated and unique that's cool right that is really cool to me and that's why i invested in them yeah man there's so many directions i want to go in i think the topic of audio nfts is is a huge one that we are just now scratching the surface but i want to go back to something you said where the community creates the value and this is this is a drum that we've been beating on the bankless program for a while now where one of the cool things about all these defy apps and all these defy tools on ethereum their money tools their value tools what they do is they allow for cultural expression right and one of the reasons why i'm particularly so bullish on nfts is that there can be one or many sets of nfts for every single community out there right like the nba top shop is the the mb the nfts for the nba community right like there's one of my favorite artists musicians rac he's got his own token and it's like the community token for every sort of can you think about are you talking about on on audience or on zora or i think i think his specific token is is its own native erc20 token on the base train of ethereum but the important thing about that is that he made a token and his community loves it and it's a way for him the artist to engage directly with his community right there's no intermediaries he didn't have to ask permission to anyone he made the token and then the community's like i like ric i like his music and it's a way for them to engage so what's your how does that land with you like the the one community one nft like connection yeah i mean look there's two things there right just doing an nft doesn't necessarily mean you want to create a token right because the token carries with it a different set of responsibilities particularly if you try to do original sale to make money um or to raise money that that creates a set of obligations like i say in shark tank raising money is not an accomplishment it's an obligation the people that gave you that money want something back for it now you may give them back an nft and that's fine that's that's a sale that's not necessarily a money raise um but building community is everything to every company everywhere i don't care what company you are or what you sell you know if your customers aren't don't feel like a community you're gonna suffer at some level and if you're an artist um creating community and using telegram and discord and twitter and wherever your customers want to be is great the challenge in all that is only the token that's it you know because again that creates a different level of responsibility um because if people come if you're already seeing people come to you for your music just love your music love everything that you do as an artist everything but because they love you they put their life savings in your ric token that's a different responsibility you know and it's you know i get i've gotten asked so many times over the years why don't i start a hedge fund why don't i start a fund you know why didn't i do a spa which is a really hot money raising thing right now right because people are going to put their life savings in based on my name and that's a huge [ __ ] responsibility that i don't want right because like i said you know broadcast.com had the biggest ipo jump um in in stock market history at the time and we ended up closing that day at like 63 dollars but there was somebody who top ticket at 72.50 and i was like oh [ __ ] how am i going to have that person make sure they make money and that kept me up at night and that kept me working hard um but you got to have that attitude otherwise people are going to lose and it's like all these dexes and all um these liquidity chases in yield farming somebody's saying you know what some of my customers might lose out on this but [ __ ] it i can't do business like that and that's the challenge yeah totally agreed like so um this is what tends to happen during during bull runs is you start to get a bunch of short-termers who enter the space right so like but the long-term projects that are playing long-term games they're not going to screw over their community i want to get back to the nfts because i think you have a unique uh i guess i take on this mark is like it feels like we are in the very first stages of nfts right like disney hasn't discovered nfts my god like the biggest marketing uh company in the world with massive communities hasn't discovered nfts athletes have barely discovered it right celebrities haven't discovered it there are all of these communities outside of crypto and what crypto provides uh and ethereum provides is this blank canvas essentially so it's like the internet you know anybody could spin up a website well now anybody can create an nfc how big could this get and what what do you think we're going to be seeing next it's a 100 billion dollar industry but probably not for 15 20 years right no no doubt about it because and put aside um the art side of it the music side of it look at it from the business side of it look talk college textbooks right literally i'm checking the market caps of the biggest companies that create college textbooks and asking you know if they were under severely undervalued and like all companies now they're overvalued to a certain extent um because interest rates are so you know relative interest rates are not overvalued but relative to history they are just looking to see should we be looking at buying these college textbook companies because there's no good reason at all to have a physical college textbook the only way reason they do it is because that's the way they've always done it but the new style college textbook company is going to use you know the equivalent of an nft whatever they decide to call it because now with college textbooks they lose the resale value that's why they're overpriced so much right you know kids buy so many kids buy you know used textbooks like i did when i was in college um because that's just smarter way to do it maybe you get some good notes in there too and and so but now because you can get your royalties ongoing right why wouldn't you do every college textbook as the equivalent of an nft whether you call it that or not and then just issue it you can charge less knowing you're going to get 25 or 30 of the resale value and make a shitload more money you know those are the things that are going to drive this nfp to 100 billion dollar industry it's not going to be artists because you're you know you're going to start getting into long tail that's too long right it's like publishing a book it's anybody can publish a book you can get it on amazon you can get it in bookstores if you work hard enough that's not going to mean that there's a market for it and people are going to buy it anybody could publish music it used to be really hard and expensive to publish a song that was you know well mixed and produced not anymore you know it takes nothing to produce a song that doesn't mean anybody's gonna buy it or listen to it and so you're starting you know we're already starting to see that with nfts right if you go on miniable or wearable or open c you see a lot of stuff even a lot of it that looks good right that is really interesting but has no bids and so the the real jump is i mean we really haven't hit with music yet so that'll jump we really haven't hit with professional photographers so that'll jump and grow the market but like you mentioned about sports yeah how about sports yeah we'll do everything from tickets to pictures to um moments to everything and anything we'll you know i've got a company mba meme um that i'm part owner in and all these memes we're going you know once we get the rights we're going to make nfps with them and so that will bring in more users but the holy grail of all this are the business applications you know if you think about the removing the friction of bankers because every bank has got to touch it you know and you've got multiple layers of people who have got to approve businesses work that way in general think of payroll think of college transcripts high school transcripts think of you know borrowing against receivables um there's just so many applications and so and they apply not just the dpi but the nft technology as well you know so if i write if i do a presentation or if i give a speech um and you guys are talking about going on clubhouse well clubhouse to me is the anti-nft because it's ephemeral right there's nothing there to remove to me that's a mistake right i'm working with a company called fireside chats and you know so if rather than having that after party on um on clubhouse where it's just gone right you do it on on fireside and you're gonna turn it into an nft and you're gonna price it at the equivalent of five bucks or ten bucks right and when someone's done using it you're gonna have a 50 royalty and they can trade it maybe no one will buy it maybe no one will trade it but it'll be there right that's the long tail that in aggregate for business applications that makes this a 100 billion dollar marketplace i listened to this uh fantastic frank zappa clip last night where he talked about the uniqueness of specifically live performances and the reason why bootlegged uh video recordings of performances still go for like extremely large sums of money is because the live performances only happened once right there is only one of them right and look at the great dead right yeah yeah i've been listening to the grateful dead for like weeks now it's been been it's been it's been a fun time and so i want to go back to the the question of like musical nfts music nfts where you know we start we talked about euler beats which is like kind of like the first big music nft and it's it's programmatic computer generated less less art more computer right like more algorithms um but the the thesis is that's kind of just the start of it music is just secondary it's really the first math ft right that's what it is it's the first math nf2 and there'll be other things that are math generated that are unique maybe it's not visual maybe it's something else right maybe it's a calming pattern i don't know right it could be like there's one nft that i'm thinking of putting up so i have long story short i ended up creating um this application in vr that just has these squares that flow by which allows your if you're dizzy it recalibrates your brain your um vestibular system in your eyes and so it helps some people deal with dizziness and it's patent-pending and all this but it's all generative right and so i'm thinking about putting it up as an mlt because it's just math effectively and it's calming based off the math there's going to be a whole industry of math based you know nfts that just have an impact in their own way um and so it you know euler beast was just the first this this can go in any direction right so like there's there seems to be a fork in the road right there's the math-based nfts and then there's like the the music auditory nfts that maybe a musician could be um more more resonant with where where do you see what do you see happening first because i'm particularly bullish on like audio and music and tracks like specific songs based like tokens where you know you buy you buy the nft you get the rights to the to the audio where where does your head go when you extrapolate audio based nfts into the future um really depends on what is the standard 1155 um for ethereum for royalties 1155 and uh 721s are the two nft standards yeah so the 1155 is the royalty side of it right i believe so i think they can both be programmed but i think look at mark cuban's yeah now eips dude this is crazy he's asking questions i can't answer he knows more than us the 721 is already twice that's a given right so that's basic royalties and if i read it right the 1155 because i'm also reading the stuff i think is whatever about burning ethereum and the miners are arguing and all that [ __ ] right um and so um but on the royalties that'll drive the music implications right because being able to allocate royalties to the the whole publishing litany right the songwriter the performer the um people who do the music the musician all that kind of stuff that's the hard part it's the same with the movie right the executive producer the producer the actors the writers the this the that like you know all the little cameos and um acting [ __ ] that i've done i'll get a royalty check from this episode of um entourage from you know a free screening in korea um and the the royalty will be for a dollar fifteen and they'll send me a check i literally have a stack of checks that big from entourage that are two dollars or less and i'm just saving them to auction them off on ebay for charity right where i can autograph them um so you've got to solve the business side of the problem first and smart contracts are a better way and when the this standard really becomes usable for the distribution of royalties then you'll see the explosion because it's a better business um solution that's always the key you always have to ask yourself on one side you think about the demand and that's always important right more music more people more demand right but you got to think of the business side and is this a better way and [ __ ] yes it's a better way it's not even close but there's got to be standards because ethereum right now has you know got its scaling issues that hopefully go away with 2.0 and then there's all these other competitive blockchains and you you know do they go there where you kind of control it will it be acceptable all the normal questions right um but those have to be solved first so what's exciting about all of this and i don't think yet mainstream sees it but we see it because we're here is this is mark this is like the birth of a new economy here right like we're talking about all of these products all of these cool things in the digital world that you can't get in the in the physical in the analog world right so this is the birth of a whole new decentralized finance ethereum crypto economy here what i want to find out and i think what people listening want to find out too is how you think about this space more specifically back to putting on your investor hat right so like your skin in the game it's really really really simple go for individuals is it the path of least resistance does it make your life better yes or no that's it on the business side does it make you more productive more competitive and more profitable that's it and the answer is yes across the board yeah okay so what look can we talk about basically where you have skin in the game what you're kind of betting on right we don't have to get into specific projects but i want to know like what layers like bitcoin for instance is that is that we talked about that earlier is that something you like yeah i've owned a bunch of bitcoin for a long time right despite what people think right people would send it to me when it wasn't worth much trying to convince me and i kept it you know i bought some along the way and i've kept it i've never sold one bitcoin or a fraction of a bitcoin it's extremely rare that people keep their bitcoins that people send them to them so so congratulations for doing that yeah i did i mean i didn't need the money so you know um you know same with ethereum and i got a bunch of [ __ ] coins that some of which i thought were [ __ ] coins that now are turning into real value because everything's trading up um and i bought some more along the way um and so on the token side you know that's not as big a play for me right now even though in absolute terms it's a fair amount of money even for me right because i've accumulated over the years um so you know i lose when the price goes up i make a lot of money when the price goes down i lose a lot of money relatively speaking um but i'm not i'm not selling it not changing it sometimes it's fun to trade in and out of some of the smaller tokens just to try to be right but that's not really investing that's just that um speculating now in terms of investing um you know there's a difference as an investor i don't look at tokens as an investment other than you know you can look at maker because you get a percentage back right you can look at you know others where i've i've done things on wearable and they've given me rari right you know and maybe that's earning it so that's an investment um but i look to make more equity investments like traditional type investments as opposed to looking as a token as a traditional investment it's not unless it pays you a dividend of some sort um and so there i'm investing in the minting side right because i think you know simplifying minting and integrating the different um eips that come along you've got to be able to do that all these things that we're talking about with music start with minting right if the minting is not easy and it's not usable and it doesn't um carry over into as many marketplaces to get in front as many users as possible if that part doesn't work with minting it doesn't work at all i'm investing some in marketplaces there's so many marketplaces popping up but there's one you know bitcoin origin right i like those guys simply because they talk about the narrative they create stories right so their marketplace isn't about just accumulating as many um nfts as they can but about working with artists that generate stories and generate narratives and that because that builds community right it and having that community as we said is important i'm working with injective right so you know for because i like that they're order book decentralized meaning that they're using traditional market makers and bringing them over and you'll be able to trade in stocks and um crypto and whatever else right um i haven't invested but i work a lot with ave right because even though i they need a lot of help with their user interface that's where i got started and they're fair they work right um what else have i done um but i'm looking at those types of things where there's literally a business there and i'm investing in the business and the technology and the entrepreneurs and hoping that they're the survivors and the thrivers right um and so that's what i look for right now crypto has always had this question of where is value going to accrue in crypto right we're building this whole new economy and you know bitcoiners will tell you bitcoin you know bitcoin is the value accrual for this stuff we're not building a whole new economy okay what we're doing is trying to make the existing economy more efficient and more productive and you know if you're a business more um profitable and if you're an individual more usable right it's not a new economy it's any more than the internet created the internet economy right we're still transaction we just moved where we transacted we saw that with the pandemic you know there's still people who preferred going to stores and you know my wife used to love grocery shopping right not anymore right so now you know it's all amazon all the time for me um and so the economy is the same we're just trying to make it better yeah so this is this is moving across from from analog to digital maybe same economy in some respects we're making it better but like tell us where value is going to accrue here because there's kind of two layers we're talking about one is like the money layer the store value layer we might put bitcoin there we might put ether there although ether also has some utility value right you have to use it to pay for transactions talk about that layer and then let's talk about the layer up which is the application layer where we've got all of these d5 tokens where's value going to accrue here so it really depends on what happens with 2.0 right because there's a lot of bets for and against the companies i work with i try to make them blockchain agnostic you know because everybody's trying to do their best to come up with an alternative ether or to complement it um at some level but it you know if you're creating your own blockchain you've got to have an application that's already driving it so it's just like flow with top shots they've got an application that's driving it and that's what's making it work um and so i look for combinations there right now you know right now you can't bet against ether 2.0 you know but i can see why a lot of people are trying to preempt it and trying to you know hype it in every way they can you know you see binance doing what they're doing you see flo doing what they're doing it you know it's different but in their own way they're trying to be that the gravity that brings in users um because that's the traffic and that's what's going to make their business work on layer 2 um it's really just depends on the application and what i look for are business world applications not just critic crypto world application but what changes how businesses do business you know smart contracts that's why i'm learning solidity so i can visualize okay here's how you would program it this is why it works this is why it's better than what a company is doing right now for payroll for human resources for accounting i mean imagine accounting system you would never have an enron or a fraudulent accounting if you had um if you had and i'm gonna get all these wrong with proof of work right distributed proof of work where you've got hundreds of hundreds of accountants who decided to make their money staking or you know confirming blocks for general ledger entries and i know i'm getting the terminology wrong i'm still learning it but you know you get my point right if i if i have a whole group of accountants that are you know are are validators um and they're confirming look at look what happens in health care right this is the best example so right now if you go to your doctor and they say you need this or that and then you go to your insurance company and you hope they don't deny it right or you know and it's a battle or in the hospital itself once you get it done you hope they don't up code it so it cost you more um well if all that was done by independent validators who have been trained and are rewarded by doing a good job and confirm each other right for accuracy now all of a sudden it's not just in a hospital and you you eliminate fraud right and you humanize the whole process and those are the types of things that i look for so to me like i mentioned earlier the grand slams aren't the crypto community those are proof of concepts and it's interesting and exciting and fun you know there's a lot of great things but if you could change healthcare because you have validators that have all been trained and they're all independent of each other across the country across the world whatever right and they're confirming whether or not a um a claim is payable or not you know or whether it's accurate or not or whatever it may be and same for you know accounting applications that's enormous enormous all the healthcare fraud and [ __ ] and pain and agony that people go through you know when you get sick and you just hope to god that you can pay for it and not go broke and so when you talk for medicare for all that you know you can argue whether that's right or wrong but when you talk you know validating independent decentralized validation of claims that's healthcare for all right that's sanity and reduced anxiety for all and that's what i look for when i look at these things and that's why when you look at this you know the bitcoin everything has a store value that's great that's fun that's exciting it's an investment you know if you really understand it the nfts starting with music that's great right um it can change industries there as well um textbook we talk music etc just blockchain itself and layer two you know all the way up to layer four applications applied to traditional business and making them fair decentralized and more efficient which in turn leads to lower cost and more profitability hopefully and imagine you know a company built around blockchain that does have their own tokens or your partner you know uses someone else's tokens even and you're able to give to all your employees not only shares of equity if you're a public company or even private right but also those tokens so that every one of your employees have an appreciable asset hopefully appreciates right because that's part of you know income inequality and that's part of the decentralized nature of crypto right if you can get you know any any coin token with algorithmic scarcity built into it and you get you know one satoshi into 330 million americans hands into a you know a wallet that's automatically set up at birth and every time they you know they graduate from from first grade second grade third grade you know they they get you know they're fed right they get a satoshi right and they're building up things for basic you know and it's you know even if it's one-tenth of a penny you know in valuation and i'm not trying to do the math in my head but whatever it is right you know and they're just accruing this and accruing this and aren't allowed to sell it till they're 30 years old or whatever it may be or have to hold it for 10 years now you're you're seeing how this decentralized nature and the fractionalized nature of this and the value of a usdc so put aside satoshis just to say it's one you know of a fiat equivalent you know stable coin one dollar and you're giving somebody a penny every time they do something right but over from the day they're born you know and they're able to accumulate this this asset that can appreciate um that's huge so so mark there this is a conversation that we also have on on the bank list program quite a lot which is where crypto where blockchain where ethereum and some of the biggest issues that we see in society intersect right and i know that you had a tweet that went pretty viral with the whole like gamestop debacle and comparing and contrasting it to defy and one of one of the big things that i think that you know ethereum can bring to the world are solutions that are helping uh that are that can help mitigate some of the the social unrest the the wealth inequality in this world right like we saw like the deep platforming of people that were wanting to trade on on gamestop right uh or wanting to trade on robin hood excuse me uh and and there's a al exactly what you were talking about these broader conversations of wealth and equality where in the legacy financial system the non-crypto financial system there's very well capitalized in trench players and like the the younger millennials the the zoomers there's this sense of like kind of despair that like climbing the ladder and like making a name for yourself is just like too hard in this calcified system and like one of the value propositions of defined ethereum is like there is no ladder like everything is so new it's so flat it's easy to climb that ladder and one of the narratives that we're trying to to harp on is that like this new world is unsaturated and young entrepreneurs can do something cool in this world and it can help solve some of the biggest social issues of the day how do you think about this i agree i mean it's like the early days of the internet again the early days of the pc industry right it it you know there were the tech dinosaurs you know that never believed oh i'll never use a pc who the hell needs that i got betty and susie and sam over there they do my pc work they're gonna die eventually right but it was opportunity when i was your age right and when everybody else was [ __ ] on it i was like [ __ ] y'all this this is gonna change everything right and i'm gonna connect these things together um and then it was the internet it was the same thing for super young millennials back then right it was like okay let's go right you know this is changing everything and crypto's the same thing but the underpinning and i'll keep on repeating this the underpinning of it is there's got to be value created from the applications and there are and that's why i'm excited because i can see you know and i mentioned some of them just like i saw with pcs and software and that's why i taught myself how to program and locally and wide area networks and then mobile and then high def um and now with crypto and teaching myself and ai for that matter don't want to leave that out right um ai is also a world changer and now crypto right so each of them has has had their own dramatic impact on applications and business right and people's lives and in hindsight it's really easy and it makes perfect sense of course you're going to stream of course you're going to use a pc or a phone who the [ __ ] would think otherwise well back when it's happening everybody doubts it every single idea that i've ever had that's made me big [ __ ] money everybody thought i was crazy everybody and if you don't think i'm crazy when i come up with it then it's not the right idea because there's you know and that's the same thing with this you know people don't know what the blockchains are they don't know what smart contracts are they don't know about layer one two three four right they you know it's all foreign to them so they're not gonna understand it but if you or i or any kid out there can see that application and figure out and then do it and then implement it bam right it's like there were plenty of search engines before google at this stage like how do you i want to know how you explain it to people so you got you got somebody who sees your tweets you know a friend of yours maybe knows you're decrypto knows like you you're into tech you got in on the internet how do you explain it to the to the average person on this street what's going on no right i don't try um you know so trying to get into d5 right now it's too early it's just like you know when we were starting streaming i didn't try to explain streaming and i just said do you want to listen to the cubs game while you're in the office and then we did research to said you know the pc was the dominant media device on 97 of corporate desktops and only three percent of them had radios or tvs so we were the only way for someone sitting at their desk in the office to be able to listen and then watch something i'm like do you get that you know and so what you do is you think of a basic application how would you like to borrow money so you cover your overdrafts in 10 seconds or 30 seconds or less and not need permission from anybody how am i going to do that well you got to have more than you're borrowing that's the first problem you know for right now you're going to be over collateralized but if you're able to save that money right and you just don't want you want to leave it in your bank account and you want to borrow it to pay a bill knowing you're going to get paid next week great you got to save up that first you know tranche to be over collateralized but after that you never have to talk to a bank again does that work well i can't really save the money but if i could it would but then slowly but surely hopefully in your life you're able to save some of that money right um and then you start seeing and so it's the application i don't try to explain the crypto i try to explain the value and when people start seeing the value then it works that is such a good point that like i think people who are deep in crypto maybe sometimes the listeners on our maybe ourselves david that we sometimes miss is we oh you want to learn about blockchain let me tell you about how blockchain works but really it's like they don't want they want problem solved how do i'm making like close to zero percent in my wells fargo bank account how can i make five percent right in a relatively risk-free rate way that's a that's a problem you solve i i just got disconnected from uh robin hood because they stopped me from trading gainstop well there's a synthetics version of the s p 500 and stocks on ethereum that they can't shut down that's what you're talking about right right so like injector why do i invest in objective right so one the whole stop out right because of the capital requirements robin hood didn't do it in purpose that on purpose to hurt them they just didn't have enough equity right they didn't have enough capital um and so they had no choice they would have gone bankrupt because they had too many customers but doing it in a decentralized manner but because it's transparent that's the thing because it's on the blockchain every investor gets to see exactly how much injective has of all this right there's no you know it's not it's all decentralized so there's no hiding it at all and so that creates one opportunity but the the second part of that is the governance aspect of it you know if you created a wall street bets governance token and everybody got to vote every hour right or sign somebody which stocks they're going to buy or sell or for each stock that they own have a governance of whether they hold it or sell it and it's voted on every minute hour or whatever they set that's wall street bets and it's going to work it's so crazy because what we're talking about is all we're talking about is adding a capital coordination layer to the community that's that's already happening wall street bets community it's just giving them an outlet yeah that's the application that's the way i think what are the app that's the program or business programmer side of me that when i was first getting started here's what you're doing manually here's how i'm going to automate it how do what's what's the logic to get me from point a to point b this is no different here are the applica that's why i'm trying to learn solidity that's why i'm learning as much as i can about blockchain and smart contracts because that allows me to visualize how i get from how they're doing business today to where they should be using these new tools and whether or not it can be done same with ai it's one thing to talk about it look my investment thesis you didn't ask me on on traditional stocks is who does ai the best if you look at the if you look at the biggest market cap companies without fail they are the ones that have been doing ai the longest and do it the best and they continue to take market share from people and make more money at times when their competitors are not because they're that good at ai and the same thing will apply to crypto and companies as well the companies that are best able to to apply on blockchain and smart contract technology and whatever else comes along the layer on top of that will be the ones that have the biggest market caps and the most profits because they'll be more efficient and will have happier customers that's the way i look at it mark i want to ask your perception about about narratives because the crypto world it runs on narratives everything is a narrative like we can talk about the fundamentals of certain defy tokens but i will promise you that that won't be the reason why that token goes up or down in price it's because of narrative it sounds like you want you already know where to go um a comment that i heard you uh talk on on a different podcast was something along the lines of like you you slapped like a baseball card down on the table and then there was some stock and you were saying which one's going to go up more i don't know and so so talk about that because like the the legacy a big criticism from the crypto space to the legacy stock market is that we think it's based on fundamentals but it's actually based on narratives like talk about that and talk about how crypto is different i wrote about that [ __ ] 15 years ago right so if you go to blogmaverick.com and put in the word stock you know for a search term you'll see the stuff i wrote you know what is buy and hold buy home is just a narrative from you know stock brokers so that you hold on to your stocks right and you know think about wolf of wall street and all the [ __ ] that you know when they were pitching these shitty ass stocks it was all narrative right creating the story and and you know they would they would talk about kind of create the story you got to let them see that wealth in their mind and all this and you know price earnings ratio what does that really mean look at apple right for the longest time apple was considered a cyclical stock which meant it traded in the 10 to 15 price earnings ratio um range then all of a sudden everybody decided it was a growth stock and so now it could trade as a multiple of everything else right it's all narrative my broker taught me the so when i first saw my first company when i was 29 30 years old and i made a few million dollars i told him i wanted him to invest like i'm 60 years old right because this i wanted this to last me a long time because i just wanted to party like a rock star but a lifetime pass in american airlines just went out to get party with as many people as i could um and he told me something he goes look he goes you have a platform you know back then it was much smaller but you have a little platform and the thing that makes stocks move is when you get long a stock you get loud to stock and i learned it and it's the same thing when you buy a token get long get loud and that's what people do you see um cz at binance he's a superstar at that right he knows how to play that game you saw tron um you know talking you know paying people to pump up their their um their tokens and you're seeing in other places as well people don't know anything and because perception is reality when it comes to valuation why why is the stock market where it's at the stock market has been down the last five or six days what really changed nothing nothing you know maybe interest rates went up a tiny bit maybe there's some fear and you watch cnbc and they get people coming on all the time and i remember going on cnbc you know a while back and it was fun because i would tell people yeah i'm going to talk about this stock i don't own it but i'm going to talk about it because you own it and you'd see the stock of bbb it's no different it is absolutely no different whatsoever so now it's just streaming shows like this where if i say you know i'm buying this token chances are the price is going to go up so what are you buying mark i told you actually what yeah i'm not what am i buying what did i last buy no i'm not going to do it i was like no way is he actually about to say that no way so one of my wallets one of my wallets is public i got a bunch of them um one of my walks was public because of the minting i did on um on the nfts and did you know that you were going to make that wallet public when you did that no i did not i did not that's really funny so so i want to take to put this into a takeaway lesson for any of the listeners here so for for the for anyone who's new to d5 anyone who's listening in the stream like do know that like defy and ethereum and crypto and basically that run runs on narratives so so mark you you've been on both sides you've been on the legacy world legacy finance and now you're playing in the in the crypto world understanding that everything runs on narratives what should new players understand like how what are the lessons that that we can teach them right here on this live stream i tell everybody about a stock do your homework right no one sells you a token thinking the price is going to go up everybody selling unless they just need the money right for some other external reason like because particularly in crypto because you can borrow against it now maybe they're selling it because they got called in a margin or whatever because the stock the price is going down but you got to do your homework you got to do your homework you got to know why you're buying it because if you don't know why you're buying it you don't know why you'll sell it right so if i buy a stock i'll hold it and i learned this expensively right because i used to try to time the market i used to think oh i've got a great feel for the market you know um no but what i learned and what's paid me a lot of money since is why am i learn why i'm buying the stock and until that changes just hold on to the stock and if it falls back and it still stayed the same buy more so if it's injective and you know they're not live they're still on test net so you know it's all just fun games right now but if i like what they're doing right and they keep on progressing the way i like it if it falls i'll buy more you know and if something changes where they set a goal they're going to do a b or c and they weren't able to do it or they were only able to do a and b and they failed miserably at sea then i'll sell so if you're new into this whether it's nfts whether it's tokens whatever it is know why you're buying and if you're just buying because somebody on twitter told you like dojo coin doggy coin like i tell my literally like my 11 year old son i i have a account i set up for him um my account for him on um robin hood and my daughter as well my 14 year old daughter my four-year-old daughter doesn't get us fired up as he does and um i'm like why are you buying this doggy coin he goes because um it's dojo coin i like i know but it's still a doggy you know and let me just say buy dojo coin all you want if you know it's fun and it's like a lottery ticket right and you're just playing a game otherwise think twice and i said to him you know why why are you even intro how did you even hear about this tick tock right so there's all kinds of people blasting [ __ ] out on tick tock that kids are getting into and you know it's just a whole get long get loud principle and you've got to ask yourself why are you buying this what do you understand about this company and what they're doing you know um so when you see bmb or matic or you know who else is layer one near or solana is that right solana um so you know the the layer one guys the blockchain guys that you read their white papers they're all great stories or flow for that matter right they're all great stories no one puts out shitty white papers for the most part right but at least you know be very critical of them and understand and know why you're doing it so in the event they don't deliver that's when you sell and so that's what you really have got to do if you're getting involved in this if you're just winging it then that's fine like in stock stocks you know they have technical people who buy based off of technicals right they just buy or sell based off of what the charts tell them that's okay too you know and you're seeing more and more of that and i think if anything that's probably one of the biggest problems crypto has is that it's not a truly efficient marketplace and you're getting more and more quantitative sellers i mean traders involved trying to arb all the variances um across the board in real time and their own version of high frequency trading and that in one respect it helps balance the market but in another respect there's a lot of front running going on there's a lot of people that you know are getting you know getting ahead of retail investors so you've got you've got to be careful um this is not like buying or selling stock just because it's not regulated good advice mark that's great okay so i i said this in the intro it feels like you have uh fallen down the crypto d5 rabbit hole in a big way i feel that even more so at the end of this conversation so my question to you is what are you going to do next man is is crypto going to be like one of the areas you play in for the next like five to ten years what do you do really what i talked about how can you disrupt so the way i look at it how can i use blockchain in particular and smart change in particular and come up with applications that just disruption you know i we talked you know i mentioned medical you know insurance um textbooks um we talked about music but everybody's looking at music right um you know there's business applications exactly you know back in the day when i was first getting started with pcs how can i [ __ ] things up right how can i change the way a company does business then i got to local area networks how can it change wide area networks how can it change and along the way i taught myself how to program because that was the only way these applications are going to get done i wrote the first purchase order system that integrated with walmart you know back in the day you know i wrote an application that took pictures of jewelry at zales so that they didn't have to store physical watches and everything in the vaults for buyers to go look to make sure it's the same way how do you change those games right and then same with streaming you know even though we did you know you can watch the cubs game or listen to the cubs games in the office we did that as proof of concept back then in order to have an all hands meeting for a company that was in multiple cities they would literally rent satellite time and go to theaters during the day when they were empty and send their employees there and beam it down and that's how they would have all hands meetings and we made most of our money doing corporate applications like that we called it our business services that's the exact same thing i'm looking to do here how do you take things that are done in a non-um blockchain smart chain world a smart contract world um and apply it to the way things have always been done and say how do you disrupt it how do you change the game so that the world is just a different place hey david you're muted buddy oh there we go mark i want to present a scenario to you which i think is going to happen in the future right so you're on shark tank like doing doing your thing lights on abc that everybody that that's the one that's the one that's the one i mean um and so then someone comes in and pitches you and it's something bitcoin ethereum defy related and it's and i'm assuming this hasn't happened yet what gets you out of your seat what gets the checkbook and out and like it gets that check signed right then and there but they know their [ __ ] right they got to know what they're talking about because i don't want buzzword you know you know promotions or buzzword pitches that that is of no value to me whatsoever it's just like ai people will mention ai or they'll know that i like sensor based applications right so they'll mention sensors and then i'm going to quiz them is it off the shelf or is it something you created you know um who you know for ai are you using open source libraries or is this something unique is this a unique data set how are you creating your data how are you scaling it yada yada cost people don't realize how expensive ai is same with blockchain it's not so much that it's expensive but you know who are you competing with why are you better what's unique what's differentiated um what's you know what's going to make people want to do business with you or what impact are you going to have on the business world that allows businesses to become more profitable productive and competitive and you know change the game mark you got any predictions for us as we close out for uh 2021 what's in store here man for i guess you know let's talk crypto d5 nfts anything you want to throw out and then you know maybe more broadly first of all shark tank is going to be a great show this season second math play tonight so that's all i'm thinking about um you know it's going to be business driven as much as you know it's like again like the early days of the internet where people who are passionate about the net you know i would go on to compuserve long gone right prodigy long gone aol the old walled garden aol long gone and have these conversations about the internet and how they're gonna screw up you know those businesses right the chat rooms um and but the people there were really passionate and then you get on you you net and the people there were really passionate about the internet and those chat forums um and so now it's the early adopters that are really excited about it there's ways to make money there's better places for individuals to earn some yield as long as they're careful and know what they're getting into right so that's all good but that's kind of just basic stuff the big money you know and so we're talking about trillion dollar bitcoin amazon's worth one point whatever apple's worth one point ever that's just a singular company you know um and i think gold i mean i think bitcoin is going to take away from gold but macro basis you know there's still a game being trade played for nvl and market cap valuation for tokens so what you know that you know that's just ego more than anything else the market cap of a token really doesn't mean anything the nbl of a site it's a great metric i mean i guess it's the best metric we can come up with so far but it really doesn't mean anything what does it really mean there's definitely a lot of you know vanity type stuff going on as you talked about earlier there's there's ways to sort of uh you know hack those metrics and bend it in in any area this is definitely going to be a proving time for crypto i think in a big way um it also applications the way you'll know you put aside what tesla did and talking about the valuation of bitcoin the proving ground for crypto is in the applications where you see companies all of a sudden using blockchain and using crypto in a unique way to disrupt incumbents that's when the game changes so when you see some zoomer come in that's you know 20 years old and came up with a new payroll system that disrupts all the sas and all the you know the new payroll programs that are out there right when you see one coming up that this place is twilio right you know that this place is plaid right plants should be you know first in line for to be disrupted right they're great company but it you know they're what they do basically is arbitrage the hassle factor for traditional finance and so when you see people coming up with applications that just totally mess them up that you know it's here to stay and it's going to grow that's really the key to the future of crypto and if i'm wrong and those applications don't exist then it'll just be a sideline and it'll be a store of value and that's it and there'll be some specialty applications well said sir yeah and we on the bank list program think that the banking and finance layer will one be one of those first layers to be disrupted uh would you make it easy right now it's too hard to deal with the wallet and understand it you know it's too hard to yield farm for most people it's hard to understand the the macro basis maybe you can make some money off of it i bet half the people that do yield farming are losing money [Laughter] you're you know if the whole thing in this is decentralization so that anybody can make some money from it between transaction fees even if you're on some other blockchain right you know it's hard to to really because you don't only have the risk you have the slippage you have you know beyond that's just on the time of the transaction you have the movement of the token the volatility of it all and so unless you time it right you know it's hard and so i would bet half the people and are losing money on yield farming the small people right and the big ones you know they get to call their own game because they create the liquidity that that's needed and so it's not the the fairness that people want it to be today right but as these applications get easier to use and the the tutorials are better and the friction is reduced significantly then you're right like i said you know owning any you know ethereum or bitcoin in particular is like owning your own private bank you just have but the hard part is figuring out where to deposit it and how and once that is simplified so that you know you know the thought that you have to get it from your bank account is dismissive in the first place right to get it from fiat to bitcoin that's got to be easier um but once it is and i'm getting paid in usdc and it goes right into my wallet slash bank account and i convert it to whatever i want to whether it's algorithmically or i get to choose and now i'm you know i'm incented to save right because of the the collateral basis right so i'm incented to save because now i can pay my bills from there i can borrow from there and it all happens simply and at the lowest cost ever and so when those things start to happen that's when the game really changes that's a message to the builders there is lots to build out in this space and i think mark cuban he wants to hear from you if you've got some good ideas i'm sure he'd love to hear from you uh guys as we say so often this is the frontier it's not for everyone it's risky out there in d5 world but we're glad you're with us uh we want to do a last shout out to gemini ave monolith and dharma these are the sponsors that made this show possible we want to also thank mark cuban dude it is awesome to have you on the bankless journey with us like we need advocates and supporters who understand this stuff who have used metamask and deposited into d5 protocols to help spread the word and it's awesome that you're you're doing this here so we appreciate it you guys have me on it it was enjoyable and i always learned something from this and so that's what's important to me awesome fantastic well lastly guys we went over risks and disclaimers but david you and i are jumping into clubhouse for a bit of the after party what's going on there man yeah so this is gonna where where me and ryan are gonna do our after episode debriefs right so this is something new that we're doing on the bank list program i'm gonna open up that room here in just a second there's a link in the youtube description if you want to join the clubhouse after party where we talk about the episode that's where it's going to happen all right mark you're of course welcome to join us but i'm sure you've got other things mav games a maps game on tonight all right well take care see you later thanks take care bye see
