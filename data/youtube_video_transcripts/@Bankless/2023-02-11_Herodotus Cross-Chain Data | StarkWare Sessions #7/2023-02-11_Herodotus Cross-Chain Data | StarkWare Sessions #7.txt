welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this interview we were talking about Herodotus and that is an interesting name which will become self-evident as to how they named what they are working on Herodotus in this interview Herodotus is a system for taking all of the very deep rich data that we have across many many chains and and allowing each of these chains to access the state across trains both the currency and the historical state so say for example optimism unit swap on optimism wants to understand the average price of ether on arbitrum over a 30-day period arbitrary length period Herodotus and by running all of these very deep archive nodes across all these chains can provide all of this data to all across all of these chains using ZK proofs in order to compress all this data and prove it to the chain it's extremely useful thing to do and the use cases for this are quite large so I will let your imagination run wild as you listen to this episode but first before we get into this episode a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets Krakens customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankless's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps that can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 fees by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite T5 apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every or two and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wallet experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview and we're back in Tel Aviv for the startware sessions and I'm talking about the Herodotus team uh you guys want to introduce yourselves and then we'll get into what you guys are building sure uh I'm Casper kozil I'm the one of the co-founders of Herodotus um Marcelo also one of the co-founders and yeah I'm the technical guy and so uh we're absolutely going to dive into Herodotus but first I want to ask you guys about why you decided to come all the way out to Tel Aviv for shark recessions what brought you here well storknet the whole community over here is very vibrant they're building a really uh interesting ecosystem with a lot of unique projects uh we wanted to network with these projects and essentially explain to other projects how they can leverage storage proofs and the advancements that we're building at uh Herodotus um and explore all the unique applications that these Technologies unlock yeah another reason uh we use cryptography we love cryptography many people over here also seem to like cryptography so yeah it just makes sense to come here and chat with the guys and yeah so you use the word storage proofs which uh tells me that this is going to be a very technical conversation so fair warning to the bankless nation uh when how did you guys come up with the with the need for Harris how do you pronounce it how did you guys come up with a need for hair Donuts yes so actually Herodotus is the father of History uh that's what he's known for but he's also the supposed creator of something called the Herodotus machine which uh fun fact the Herodotus machine was supposedly used to um build pyramids so in Cairo so Cairo Stark net kind of the vibe that's where the the names came from um and yeah and Herodotus since he was a historian uh our Solutions unlock access to historical data for ethereum and applications on it and uh and we thought that I was an interesting fit um and yeah it's a very technical product so the the target audience of that name is also uh quite quite Niche so it fits so when do they Adonis project get started so uh hair notice itself we started building it in August of uh last year August 2022 and uh and since then we have gone through a lot of research a lot of uh experimentation that's a that brought us to this point here we have presented some of the concepts and some of the technologies that we have been building at several conferences last year uh but uh only here at starknet starkware sessions in in Tel Aviv we have actually been able to demo a working API implementation of what using this these products these solutions that we've been building will look like and uh and we're very excited to share them with uh with the community um the developers that build on top of this uh essentially um can can build really cool things and I'd love to give you some examples of uh how others are using and exploring our our Technologies and uh yeah first I'd like to ask what's broken about the state of all these blockchains that we're using the state of web 3 because Herodotus doesn't exist what's broken about the world right now yeah so first of all I would say that nowadays we live in a 2d World why because if you build a smart contract this smart contract can access its own storage and to some limited scope of the storage of other contracts and we want to enable some other dimensions one of them being hey let's see what's happening on other roll ups and other layers of ethereum another dimension which is probably the most important one is time and yeah that's our mission to essentially enable the two dimensions so where should we get started diving into Herodotus uh where where should we leave I think the best way to kind of get started is to go over some use cases give some intuition as to where this technology fits in and then maybe later on we can kind of cover some uh some more of the like the technical stuff of how we actually make this happen and uh where do we see Herodotus fitting in in the future um so as of right now I'd say that our most Flagship integration is with uh it's for governance it's snapshot X and essentially what snapshot X allows you to do is it allows you well how they use Herodotus is they leverage Herodotus storage proofs to allow you to improve ownership of L1 assets on on starknet so essentially you're able to prove that you are the rightful owner of an asset on an L2 and reap the utility of this asset and this is very powerful because you're able to keep the security of keeping your assets on this main chain and essentially eliminate the need for bridging and I think that's one of the main takeaways from uh from Storage groups in general they unlock a lot of use cases and while I agree that there's a big shift over the recent months to uh well years to abridging assets between various chains storage proofs actually eliminate the need for bridging in many circumstances that said it is possible to build a bridge on top of storage proofs however the the general like possibilities of what you can build on top of them are quite Limitless and uh and yeah so snapshot is one of a very interesting example because users normally are kind of restricted to to voting on the L1 which of course is pretty expensive and if you want to have Dao adoption adoption governance becoming much more used we want to make sure it's accessible to all the people who might not want to pay 16 for transaction fee Etc is there anything you want to add no I think that was that was a great explanation I think that's a use case that a lot of people in the bank close Nation probably pretty easily wrap their heads around um I mean how many times has there been a snapshot vote that has been relevant to a defy app or Dow that you are a part of but your assets are somewhere else and you haven't really you just can't vote and so what do you do do you go retrieve your assets to go snapshot Vote or do you just skip the vote you probably skip the vote yeah especially when gas fees go through the roof and uh yeah not much you can do about that at that time so uh so yeah so governance is one example but uh there's a lot more you can build with this so I personally am always excited with most of the financial applications of what's possible to build on this and one of the examples is lending cross chain lending is quite interesting because you're able to essentially do something like locking your assets on an L1 and taking out a loan on an L2 based on storage proof this allows you to keep your assets on a chain that you find secure which is L1 you trusted and uh and get exposure for let's say cross chain Arbitrage Etc um I want to unpack that one really quick because I think that's really really cool okay so like say I have an Ave position on optimism uh and I would like to borrow usdc on optimism but I don't have any ethon optimism all my ether's on the layer one and so using using uh what are they what are they called uh Bridge um using storage proofs I can lock up my assets on the layer one and then prove that to Ave on Layer Two yeah yes yes but that's that's something that can be built on top of hair hairdos so like I want to clarify that uh our infrastructure unlocks these use cases but it's up to the actual end developers to build these Solutions on top of it strictly theoretical use cases correct all the examples I'm going to list right now are simply things that projects we have been discussing with entering into partnership agreements with uh are exploring and we've heard of um another really cool example that I'm sure if someone's uh has listened to our starknet Workshop presented by Machi suletsky is essentially proving that your nonce in an account obstruction wallet has not changed in over a year and at that point you could simply write a account instruction wallets that allow you to do fund recovery that is based on like a dead man switch for example so you can prove that there was no activity for over a year which makes it a reasonable assumption you maybe lost your keys and at that point you could delegate ownership of that wallets or transfer funds based on that proof that can also work for Eos that are part of let's say a multi-seek okay so how does how does the magic come about what's the magic under the hood that really enables this to happen Okay so uh that's my part so essentially the way how we think about blockchain is essentially it's a it's a lease right a list of blocks and there is a very nice cryptographic relation between them essentially one block header refers to its parent right in a cryptographic manner because the hashes just match and we essentially Embrace that relation we just process the whole chain we we prove it so we know that whatever we come up with is valid and then on top of that we can access the state routes and the status are just a root of a tree that contains everything was ever committed on on the blockchain at this specific block and essentially by just leveraging cryptographic proofs we are able to access whatever was present at any time on any chain okay uh and so where does the role of just like nodes come into play like this is all based off of archive nodes right yes so to to kind of expand on like storage proofs in general they're very complex to work with and they have pretty high Hardware like requirements and all know-how requirements uh you need to have archive nodes and you need to maintain them you need to Benchmark the different proving systems that can be used to essentially generate these proofs and on every single chain this will vary uh this is pretty complex and we believe that developers doesn't give the developer very easy integration experience if you want to see storage proofs mainstream and essentially see them being adopted in the increased amount of projects uh we want to simplify that as much as possible we want to take this very complex topic and make it easy to integrate into your app so for example uh let's say I want to have an options protocol that settles based on let's say historical historical yield of let's say an oven we could take that feed from essentially Herodotus by essentially sampling historical points in time uh through from the blockchain and Computing something we call a verifiable data feed uh that's an interesting use case as well um what else uh and yeah so essentially we're abstracting the complexity of working with storage proofs and giving them to uh developers in an easy to use API so let me uh try and repeat a bunch of stuff to make sure I check my understanding here so like there are some ways for data to go into our defy apps for that defy app might actually be able to look on chain at historical data and then come up with its own data feed about using native smart contracts on ethereum but that's probably going to be really computationally intensive and probably extremely expensive and on the L1 probably so expensive that's not even possible and it's just a theoretical conversation because of how expensive it is what you guys are doing is operating archive nodes taking that same data that exists on ethereum or other layer twos or whatever and then generating a proof of that data which then you can prove to a Smart contract about the data that's going into it and you can also prove that it's valid and that smart contract can receive that same data but rather than that smart Contract Processing ethereum history uh you guys are just feeding it externally but you don't have any trust assumptions because it's a proof exactly correct yes nice all right okay uh that sounds so generalizable that you can unlock almost anything with that yes there's a lot more use cases that I can probably think of I'd kind of like to explain as to how we actually got here and um how we ended up in a situation where this data acts as the sharded essentially amongst all these other chains um layer twos have done a lot for ethereum they increase transaction through throughput Etc however in itself in like the very early days of ethereum if you were a smart contract you had access to pretty much all the data you it was all in this one chain and as we wanted to increase this transaction throughput on ethereum layer two's managed to increase this transaction throughput but in itself they sharded this data access so if you were that smart contract you would you no longer had access to all the data because it became isolated within your layer 2. um and uh and with peridotis and our apis and and the solutions that we're building where we want to enable you to do is we want to enable developers to once again be able to access data between these layer twos in a trustless manner relying on on these cryptographic properties that secure the blockchain itself uh without introducing unnecessary trust assumptions so what's the roadmap like like what are you guys building first I think you guys you talked about snapshot uh it sounds like that's coming first what's coming second what's coming third what are the ways that people are going to be impacted by this the most yes so our first uh first Integrations are essentially with starknet we have a starknet ethereum connection built we Define these as connections meaning that when there's two chains between there there's a need for data access we Define that as a connection and this connection can be one directional or bi-directional and in this case the first connection that we have built and we have successfully benchmarked Etc and we will be releasing access for the public for with API Keys Etc in the future is this connection allows you to read ethereum data from starknet so it's a one-directional connection in this case this was more of a decision that is very expensive to do it the other way around uh in the future this is something we're going to explore as well and uh now that we have done this starknet ethereum connection the next ones that we're going to be exploring are going to be ECM to EDM we haven't yet finally finalized the decision as to which uh which roll up that we're gonna go go for uh but uh this is gonna come out sometime in the next two two to three maybe so that on top of that uh we also allowed to access state from polygon optimism and arbitrum on Stark net so my intuition tells me that um this just works across any blockchain and the fact that a layer one or Layer Two or a side chain or an alternative layer one is actually a detail that does not matter for what you guys are building uh yes in a way right now we are simply focusing on making it evm compatible and the chains that we deployed on later is uh as a later decision um we have not picked one yet uh maybe to add on top of that we firstly are focused on doing like l2202 communication l122 we are not looking at l121 yet because it's a completely different type of problem many things are in common but it's uh it's still not on the road not not for any time soon so how big is the team uh currently and there's nine of us um and uh there's a few part-time people uh but uh but yeah the teams the team's growing and uh and we're building there's results and uh I and things are moving very nicely beautiful if people want to learn more where should they go um Herodotus Dev the Twitter or herodotus.dev the website is probably the best resource and uh and yeah that's where we post updates Etc awesome and it uh at the end of this uh interview in this conversation the uh naming father of modern history definitely checks out I understand how that came to be happy to hear that cheers guys thank you so much thanks thank you [Music]
