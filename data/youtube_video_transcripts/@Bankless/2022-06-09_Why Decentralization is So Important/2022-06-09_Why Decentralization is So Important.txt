what drives you to be so involved in ethereum's decentralization i've been a part of field networks i've been a part of other l1s that allowed themselves to be captured or followed the wrong goals and sold out on their core principles and as someone who's been involved with ethereum for a long time i've gone to this place where i don't want that to happen to ethereum like i want ethereum to survive and it's something that i'm willing to put energy into like it's that valuable to me whatever it takes like whatever i need to do to organize the community to empower people to educate people then i'm going to do what i can to help ethereum be successful
