welcome everyone to another episode of state of the nation david how are you doing today absolutely fantastic i think we have a pretty interesting state of the nation ahead of us 0x mackie from sushi swap this will be the first uh non-uh pseudo-anonymous camera off state of the nation that we've ever had at least with a guest our cameras are obviously on but our guest xerox mackie he's on standby with his camera off because he's pseudo-anonymous and that's kind of how the sushi swap protocol rolls so we're going to get a little bit more into that later this is going to be a super fascinating episode i think you're going to learn a lot if this is your first day of the nation these come out every tuesday we try to live stream them on youtube then we put the video up then we get the podcast out to our podcast listeners so this is an opportunity for us to relate some of the interesting things that are going on in the bankless nation to big picture stuff uh we're going to be getting to that zero x maki conversation in just a minute but david we've got some new stuff going on in the bankless nation as well we had a fantastic episode with justin drake that just came out this past monday i think it was our most bullish ethereum episode yet i was maybe bold to say but because because the topic was cryptography what what were some of your takeaways from this episode yeah justin drake this was a unique piece of uh a unique podcast to come out of the bankless podcast that i think might be my favorite episode that we've ever done so far it's also our longest it's a marathon at two hours and 20 minutes uh and well i think what makes this uh episode so unique was that justin drake who is an ethereum researcher by the way he works with the ef he's a he's a cryptographer uh came to us with this proposal for like what he thought would be a really really cool episode and he was totally right uh he the idea came to him when he heard us do this like bull case for ethereum bowl case for each series that we did you know with eric connor anthony zazano dc investor and then we had the guys at youth capital on uh and then justin drake wanted to introduce like what we what he calls moon math the bold case for cryptography uh and i think my biggest takeaway just as a little teaser for what's in that episode everyone should totally listen to it is what i'm now calling drake's razor uh where drake has uh justin drake has two rules of thumb that he lives by that i think this whole entire industry is pinned on whereas if you can use cryptography use cryptography but if you can't use cryptography use cryptoeconomics and this is of course in relation to building something building an app on top of ethereum or actually creating a consensus protocol like ethereum itself if you're in the protocol or anything else in this cryptocurrency industry use cryptography if you can but if you can't you can use cryptoeconomics and i think that's going to be a very valuable tool very relevant to the protocol steam thesis and something that's really a really strong mental model that i got out of that episode yeah and i was just so struck by how far we've yet to come on the cryptography front like this is basically um this moon math that you're talking about is basically moore's law for crypto and we're just at the very start of this trajectory of uh crypto innovation crypto uh cryptography innovation really and that's going to make all of our blockchain systems that much better we also have yanov from the graph who's coming on an ama community ask me anything this thursday 12 o'clock eastern so check that out and jeremy alaire our conversation with the ceo of circle he is one of the uh main leaders of usdc the staplecoin he came on the podcast that conversation is coming out monday any takeaways from jeremy alaira david jeremy elaire is uh has been at the forefront of what has been an extremely active quarter of crypto regulation right uh you know originally people always thought that like bitcoin is going to be the target of crypto regulation but bitcoin seems to be kind of getting a pass and what actually seems to be the target of crypto regulation has been stable coins crypto dollars and primarily usdc we saw this with this stable act but then we also saw this with uh fincen's guidance on self-hosted wallets that is very relevant to stable coins and so jeremy alaire as the the founder behind the the usdc crypto dollar has uh had to take the brunt of this like regulatory at this highly active regulatory environment as it relates to the our industry um so we we mainly get that perspective out of jeremy but then of course we also talk about uscc inside of d5 which was a very fun conversation so stay tuned for that one coming out next to monday jeremy is bullish defy he's bullish ethereum guys you can hear all about our after the podcast conversation as well david we started doing these these deep brief episodes available for bankless premium subscribers and that's really an opportunity for you and i we used to have these discussions all the time after a podcast actually uh talk about the podcast that was and do a full debrief of of our thoughts um that i think is one of the times i level up the most is those after podcast conversations where we sort of dump our our thoughts and our primary takeaways and and talk about them and that's going to be now made available for bankless premium members yeah i do get a lot of learning out of those conversations and i'm pretty happy that we are making these conversations available to bank spankles premium uh subscribers uh they're one of the my favorite things about bank list is that there's two of us and so we actually get to like throw ideas back between each other because like obviously one person can only have one person's ideas and so these are the times where we we sit and reflect upon the podcast that we just had literally as soon as we're done recording a podcast ryan and i hop into a zoom and be like so to make sure it's not stale then we hop into a zoom and hit record and so that's what those debriefs are 20 30 minutes long for the bankless premium subscribers so if you are interested in those uh there is a link in the show notes available to you so you can go watch those all right david let's start with the question i ask you for every state of the nation what is the state of the nation today the state of the nation is growing we are growing the pie like i'm sure you are getting text messages ryan i'm getting text messages uh about people who are interested in bitcoin interested in ethereum interested in deep trying to figure out what this is all about and of course people are just throwing money at this industry right now right like we are not in in in a scarce environment right now there is less competition going on and i think that's kind of why bitcoiners and ethereum these ecosystems have generally separated is because like in bear markets people fight right but in bull markets there's abundance there's not much need for fighting like all protocols are receiving basically all the funding that they need to continue and i see this dynamic uh and what this is really relevant to is the uni swap vs sushi swap conversation uh i think a lot of there's a decent number of people that perhaps have a bad taste in in their mouth about sushi swap from the way that it was uh spawned from the way that was birthed into the world uh there's this conversation of a vampire attack we get i think we're going to get into the subject uh when we talk to mackie um but there's this competitive error about like you know if sushi swap wins unit swap loses no or or vice versa unit swap wins or sushi swap uses like no i don't think that's what's going on i think this pie that we have this defy pie is growing at such an incredibly large rate that like that the fact that there is both uniswap and sushi swap which are maximizing in their own core competencies illustrates like how much abundance there is in this world right now especially in the world of dfi and so the state of the nation orion is growing we are growing absolutely well said i think very often the crypto tribes sort of get into this trap of thinking that this is a fixed pie fix some game it's not even within within different uh within different chains bitcoin plus ethereum bitcoin is better because ethereum exists ethereum is better because bitcoin exists this is all on-ramps from the traditional banking system to this new banking system and it is all additive and i think that's what the the sushi swap versus uniswap uh example really really showcases it is because of sushi swaps existence unit swap is that much better and has that much more volume dave we're going to get to that in just a minute but first we should take a minute to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma mobile app dharma is a non-custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a

are you doing today hey ryan hey david david thank you for having me um just very quick and from a core contributor to sushi swap i don't actually code we have like a cto and a bunch of core developer helping on this side of things so really i'm just instrumental in growing the protocol making sure that the community is tended to and so on i'm the one ensuring pretty much everything that is awesome well thank you so much for it for clarifying and you know i think where we should start is could could you give us some history so for folks that uh weren't here don't remember uh for me d5 summers was sort of a blur in many ways can you give us a history of the project like how did things start take us take us through the story so far yeah sure no problem so we started the end of august with only a medium article uh discord and then we just we grow we grew to 1.0 8 billion i think in tvl in almost a week or so uh which all came from uni swap lp tokens at first before we add our first uh migration to our own uh set of smart contracts that were basically a fork of the uni swap ones and all of this was uh made by um sheriff nomi which was one of the three co-founders back then uh including me and sushi sushi swap chef so this is kind of how we got started the goal were very clear from the beginning it was going to be a community-led fork of uni swap and they kind of grew into this uh massive i guess protocol and umbrella under like an open org model that was pioneered by urine wi-fi and so on so this is kind of where we started and um since then we're kind of keep iterating we have been funding some teams to work on multiple projects that are in the same um ecosystem as sushi so we have a bento box we have musoku we have miso and so on all of these are added by uh different teams of developers some of them are more supported by the court core team than others and so on so this is it it's pretty simple i've been like a fervent ethereum uh community member since i would say uh early 2017 or so before the big ico mania i got interested back to crypto after um i guess being dormant for three four years and then i discovered ethereum and all of the possibilities of smart contract and from there i kind of i've always wanted to join the the ecosystem in the community but never really had any um what can i say experience in the field so it was very hard for me to get the confidence to basically take ownership and go on and just send some resume and etc so i just never participated until i kind of saw sushi swap and i've always wanted to contribute to uni swap and kind of the dex field so i took ownership and i just rolled with it you know so maki what what yeah yeah what would you say um i think my part of my some folks over d5 summer have kind of a bad taste left in their mouth still with sushi swap um you know i think part of it was initially the the birth the genesis of sushi swap um some called it kind of a vampire attack of this this other d5 darling which is which is uniswap um i would love for you to talk about that and then also kind of the second event that happened is uh chef nomi and um like maybe describe that because that i have still a lingering taste and bad taste in my mouth from from i guess probably the the chef nomi event can you talk about what happened there and uh its impact in in kind of the history and trajectory of sushi swap yeah no problem i mean we can keep it very simply um the fact that we call it an attack when you know back then uni swap at maybe 250 million dollar in tvl is pretty i think ridiculous a lot of people got introduced to being an lp because of this whole kind of liquidity mining phase and craze etc so calling it an attack is kind of really i think meaningless in a way i think it was just like we unlocked for the first time uh an amount of liquidity and you know assets that were dormant in the ecosystem and this is what is bringing you know so much i would say attention to the to the space and ecosystem we basically were able to grow um more in one month than the entire year of 2020 with all these incentives and kind of teaching people newcomers how to lp for the first time before that you know you were only like putting some assets and they were quote-unquote giving you tokens now we were actually helping and you know this had this tremendous impact of changing the the game right we went from 500 million to one billion dollar um locked in d fight to today we're at 26 billion dollar and i think we're on track to 100 million by the end of the year and how you how do you do this you bring new people to the ecosystem you make sure that they are able to easily earn yield on their assets and productivize them so mackie david stated state of the nation that this week was um growing the pie and you feel you really feel like sushi swap did that not only for d5 but also for unislop it brought more volume and value to the d5 ecosystem and also to uniswa yeah what happened is we were able to not only i guess make them launch a token to actually be open and governed by the community but we were also able to make sure that these people were incentivized to provide liquidity so what we did is the biggest gift lp could have wished for in a very long time and we and this is kind of what i am kind of experiencing here it's not about just like oh it's it's a forward it's not a fork it's not about making sure that lps are taken care of it's not just a 0.3 fee going to them anymore it's you know i think we're going to be seeing a lot of innovation coming on this side of things where capital is going to be not just more efficient but capital is going to be more smart capital strategies to deploy capital is going to be uh less with less risk less impermanent loss or division divergence loss whatever you want to call it and um yeah this is kind of it uh for know me i think uh very quickly uh brief on the subject because it's been quite some time and you know he's not involved anymore in the project i think there was some inflammatory i guess uh toxic comments being made and thrown around on twitter uh everyone was all a bit uh we sit at florida pool in french so i would say uh everyone everything was tense back then and uh you know it's uh it we're past this i don't think his actions were to praise at all but we everyone kind of he was under pressure he cracked a little bit and here we are now it's past us and we can make sure that this is community owned and he's gone but the community is marching on right exactly i do think that the fact that this project succeed even though that we had like i guess this first incident it just makes sushi swap stronger every time along the steps right yeah we are you know improving we have like difficulties all the time but we are making sure to fix the the problem that we were we have on our way and so on i wanted to go back to your your comment maki about uniswap was um you know use swap of course famously airdropped a token to its users in september how much of the decision their decision to airdrop do you think was because of sushi swap i don't know about the decision to airdrop i think it was like a very good marketing stunt i think it kind of uh made sure to align incentives uh for people that use the project before and to guarantee that you know some of the i guess most fervent uni swap uh lp and you know like believer we would have like a say in the protocol uh you don't give like a thousand token to sex holder for fun right you want to have uh the most uh die-hard fan of your protocol being able to have like a meaningful voice and i think that this was great um i don't really i don't really agree with uh how the governance was been kind of uh blocked or you know like the requirements were very uh strict at first they are in a different legal landscape than us they are based in the u.s so i do understand all the ramifications there so so bottom line is though you think that the birth of sushi swap brought some competitive pressures to to unit swap even exactly and and provided more benefits for both unit swap users and their lp's i i do think so yeah so there's a very interesting story here because uniswap got off to this very rocky star and i i am i am personally convinced that the vampire attack was less of an attack and more of a value add yet that was the branding and then on top of the branding of the attack on unit swap there was um the the chef nomi that took the dev fund and ran that's behind us uh sushi swap has turned turned into this uh pillar of a community and has kind of led the charge into seeing what can really be done when you have a bottom-up community take control over a project and turn it into something awesome and so now the the branding behind sushi swap has nothing to do with uh you know chef nomi or uh the vampire attack and it's now something that's i would say is largely differentiated what would you could you describe the process that sushi swap went through to go uh to get to this point like uh people thought including me uh that sushi swap was was dead in the three month like d5 bear market between d5 summer and where we are now yet that was the opposite of the case can maybe you can tell us a story of like how sushi swab came to be into what it is now i think it's very easy david um there's always someone to enter at sushi like whether you want to be building uh we will help you we will give you a grant if you know like the work has been done and so on we will never like we will always support efforts of you know people that are willing to do partnership we have like you have some issues with you know like uni swapping itself then you can fix it that's sushi it's going to be implemented and push granted that it passed like all the security uh you know the workflow but what is it very important is pretty much we were able to get like a die-hard community of builder and people that resonated with this ethos of you know actually um community-led where you know actions and votes are accessible to anyone like this is kind of what made us you know very different we have like a very clear uh token accurate value to actual value to the token uh i mean the rules are very simple and it's just how we were able to grow i think is by collaborating with other protocols making sure that our dev designer or else is our tendent to and so on like this is just the key it's collaboration it's being open um we're not like a team we're not based in you know in a single country or city there's a lot of hurdles to this you know and the way we work as an open r can be very messy but once you get like inside this discord once you get inside the the talking the forums you get you kind of realize that there is actually like a soul into this project there's a community that loves what we're doing and i think this is why we were able to come back from this bear market so what would you say is sushi swaps core competencies what are the things that it's good at that really differentiates itself from uniswap i think we're very good at many things i would say like uh first of all we are always improving i guess everything related to the ui we are you know we even if we started with like three different ones it was super messy at first we're starting to you know unify all of this together into something that is more easy we were able to get like integration with partners that were not uh able to get on uni swap for months because they had like no uh support so we are like we're providing a white glove service to like all the project with recorder dev uh this is just like what we are good at right now we're also very uh open-minded on other alternatives on the blockchain so we're thinking about um you know crosstalking swaps on ethereum powered by torch chain we're thinking about going on polka dots with moonbeam and so on like we even have like a grant right now for a good move to the ceramic system not moving any liquidity but literally opening uh new branches where you know assets can be swapped on other chains and i think this is the fact this is very important because if you're not i guess open to to other communities and bridge them together then what is the point of being community-led so so close-minded i think that fits into the conversation of where we wanted to to take this because i think one of the differentiators between sushi swap and unity swap is that sushi swap has developers that talk to other projects um famously iron and urine i think is that actually the correct pronunciation um mackie maybe you could talk about uh the relationship between sushi swap and urine yeah the the urine ecosystem is very fascinating it's really just a a group of individuals with the same values i think we're talking about this specialization we're talking about open org we're talking about um fervent uh developers like people that are intense and everything that they do and we are able to kind of leverage each other competencies and um basically help each other it's just like an alliance in a way where um we all get together to work and make sure to execute on the same pace it can be right now i can tell you for a fact that we are swamped with things to do so it can be very difficult but every month i think or so every two weeks we have like these inter team calls where we can make sure that you know we're on pace on partnership collaboration and so on so and you know it does that's been wonderful to see like you know cream pickle acro yearn all of these wonderful projects in my opinion kind of slowly united thing into something so i we've kind of seen this pattern maki i i think before in crypto right so you have sort of your your um almost your your first mover and then you have your fast mover right so in the crypto bank world you have coinbase first mover and then you have binance which is fast mover uh and then in the decentralized lending world you have compound which is kind of first mover and they're a bit more slow and cautious and then you have ave which is like all the assets we're going to try uh flash loans we're gonna we're gonna build um all of these new things we're going to embrace assets that compound doesn't first uh we're going to you know push the bleeding edge a bit more is that the the right dichotomy would you say with the difference between a uniswap and a sushi swap now that um uniswap is kind of first mover uh whereas sushi swap is is trying to be a fast mover that's um a bit more embracing of of things that might be you know cutting edge it's a good it's a good uh the economy or analogy uh i don't think it's fair to say that you know we're kind of the fast mover of uni swap because i do believe that they are right now are that working working on some groundbreaking innovation and so on we are really just like trying to do our own path from now on and you know we're going to capitalize on compass ability and you know flexibility of things i don't know if you've um maybe we're going to talk about this later on for what is coming up for sushi but we're trying to bridge you know like a different world at the moment we want to make sure that the d5 can access um retail and you know like this the centralized exchange of this world to make sure that d5 can grow even bigger uh we do have also like other plans for scalability and so on but maybe we can talk more about this later the fast mover is uh it would say that you know uni swap is is not moving and i think that's not fair how would you differentiate um the sushi asset between the uni assay like how how would you characterize how unit swap the protocol uh leverages and uses its uni the asset and then how would you compare that to how sushi leverages sushi the asset i think cuny is just a type of sushi personally i think they will try to at some point get some value across the token otherwise i don't really see the value in just a pure governance so can that you know votes and the way it has been distributed and so on uh it's very hard to get to this tipping tipping point for voting and proposing and so on uh i did i do know they have like um they're using compound contract right so they can in theory ask for more vote but it's still very uh very complicated i think the egg sushi or like the sushi in in itself is not just attracting fees from the amm too you know like this is kind of part of the strategy it's um it's going to be coming from multiple products under the same umbrella i think that's one of the key differentiation unless uni swaps start to expand as like you know over the amm reveal it's always going to be a very two different product the the goal is the same it's governance but we're also like paying or um or token orders we are giving yeah yeah oh go ahead yeah sorry but maki i i don't want to box you in again with another like kind of pattern or dichotomy but like i'm about to try another one on you so um i i it seems like there's also another dichotomy with d5 protocols in that you get for a similar market you get one protocol that is kind of u.s based has silicon valley type investment or traditional venture investment and then you get another protocol that is outside of the us outside of like traditional u.s legal apparatus not necessarily a venture funded more bottom-up community so again an ave versus compound kind of like comes to mind right um or like a maker versus synthetics um do you think the fact that your founders are um pseudo anonymous outside of the us does that give you more flexibility in terms of the things you can build we're just talking about value accrual to sushi the token does that even give you more flexibility to design a like higher value accrual token what are the benefits there in your approach yeah i do think that is beneficial and you know instrumental in the success of sushi um this is kind of tricky i don't know why the us government is so um constraining all this innovation blockchain what we're seeing is anyway like most of these teams are now outside of the us for like uh going to uh blockchain up like singapore taiwan and uh in europe like portugal and so on it's just going to keep going this way because we want a future that is bankless you want a future that is decentralized and what happened is you are risking prison to build like i guess the future of finance uh in the us so might as well you know just leave but this is part of why we were anonymous this is kind of the reason uh it's not yeah mackie i want to ask questions about v2 um and of course if there's going to be something similar to uniswap's plans to v2 or if sushi has their own plans of v2 we're going to get into that topic of conversation but first we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the dharma mobile app dharma is a non-custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a

investment dharma is the place to go signing up and going through kyc is an absolute breeze it took me just under three minutes and after signing into my bank account via plaid i am now just one transaction away from any token that uniswap has to offer go to www.dharma.io that's d h a r m a dot io download the dharma app and get yourself unbanked today if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract wallet as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your

fingertips but with monolith so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop go to monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today all right guys we are back with xerox mackie from the sushi swap protocol we want to ask about l2s and we everyone in uh the d5 world is kind of having their one eye on uniswa because we know uniswop is working very hard to pioneer uh their own l2 it's hopefully it's fantastic um and we want to ask about sushi's plans for l2s um is is sushi just looking towards uniswap kind of like how the rest of us are about what their plans are for getting onto an l2 or are you guys kind of carving your own path and wha if you are what is that path to uh exchanging on an l2 so users can save on gas fees sure so very quickly um i do think that lyric 2 like for 2021 is are going to be massive i think we're going to see for the first time uh real adoption of this tech and because we're getting to a moment where you know they will be they're going to be mature enough to power like emm and so on but beside that i don't think uh we're going to be rushing to release on this uh on this deck we're like right now exploring all of our options with you know zk roll ups garbage from uh they starkware as you can sink and so on the thing is we want to make sure that if we do move onto a layer two we don't just move by ourselves we don't want to just be able to do swaps if we move somewhere we want to bring with us you know like a money market uh is it going to be cream ave is it going to be and like other options like this is all in the thoughts i think that if we were to move with five participants from the urine ecosystem at the same time this would be way more interesting than just uh by ourselves because then the users are not constrained to just like doing swaps um but then we also we don't want to forget about like compressibility i think this is one of the most crucial aspect of deep five is that we want to make sure that people are not locked i would say or they cannot you know do what is fun with all these protocols and card reading so once this is cleared out then you know we're we're going to be announcing what we do for um for the layer two part ability and i do think this is like something that is six months away in my opinion so maki do you have any guesses on how this will play out because there is an element to what you're talking about with the move to layer two or even you were talking about kind of a multi-chain world there is some loss of composability there is some like liquidity silos that start to form so how how is this all going to play out in your mind do you have any scenarios you can paint for us i mean from what i saw like this the sealing of you know assets and so on like between optimist optimism optimistic sorry and other layer two are going to be kind of not too impacted by that i've seen like connects where connex network has been working on bridging layer twos together i do think that we're gonna see more and more of this sort of initiative uh because if like you know the assets are trapped there or frozen there uh there's gonna be massive gains for people that are able to bridge them so i don't think it's gonna happen or maybe just at the beginning and then we're gonna find solutions um but aside from that you know i i think like i'm not a specialist a player 2 personally so i won't like pronounce myself too too heavily on this topic but just very happy to see the innovation that it's going to bring to the table on the side of you know the user experience are going to be totally different i think we're not going to have to care about gas anymore and this was i think the missing piece for um for ethereum to another competitor i everyone was kind of screaming scalability and you know oh how cheap their transactions were on other chains this is kind of gonna this is gonna kill this this notion in my opinion and this is when other blockchains if they really have like like a community or like a soul that's where they're gonna create their own interesting feature because otherwise the secret is going to ethereum yeah so what do you think about that so you mentioned earlier that um the part of what sushi is doing is actually it's like branching out or playing with other chains too like you mentioned the polka dot uh ecosystem for example how do you think that plays out with ethereum are there like are the eath killers going to kill eth will they carve out a different niche in the ecosystem will they all compete will they all be one you know big happy family what's your take on this i think they're just going to be doing their own things like similar to what sushi swap is doing with uh this whole like uni vsu i think they're just going to be building their own kind of solutions on like d fire blocks and so on and so on if they don't then it they're just gonna it's just gonna die simply put and you cannot just take whatever is happening on ethereum and just mirror it somewhere else and then i assume that people are just gonna move that's not how it works they need to to invent their own um like groundbreaking things i think and on poker i'm kind of fairly certain that some innovation is gonna be good and duck and crypto and blockchain etc it's always the people we don't have like a million dev yet and if you don't have like a strong community of developers of community advocates and so on then it's worthless okay so you mentioned you mentioned polka dot are there any other ecosystems that you are uh impressed with as as kind of layer one ecosystems i haven't looked at all of them personally uh so i would say all i'm missing right now is uh buying smart chain uh atom i haven't looked it up uh there is i mean all the ghost chain i don't care so i'm not interested in the rest i would say this these two are kind of the the main ones like and what is very important with us it's something with a bridge if we cannot have a bridge back to ethereum then we don't care basically got it all right so ethereum possibly has a sort of a a settlement layer uh certainly a central hub to all of this innovation but other chains possibly playing a role as well um can you talk a bit more about the the sushi swap rid map you've got a v2 coming up you mentioned something called bento box uh earlier tell us what's in store for for the next releases of sushi swap so what is very interesting is right now we're like finishing up the formal verification for bento box this is going to be huge i think it's going to be our kind of margin solution on top of sushi so we are going to be enabling a long and short leverage basically on every single pair that is on sushi and this is going to be you know we're going to be partnering with a lot of participants to make sure that this is a very um popular product i would say in a way where the iron bank can be instrumental there we can have like strategies with yarn uh and so on this is going to be in my opinion like the next step in in sushi swap and then the amm v2 is going to be very interesting because this is when we're going to be able to unlock more flexibility and uh we're talking about the pair composition the fee structure for pools uh we want to like one of the key the key thing of the mirror update i think is going to be the franchise pool aspect where we are trying to make sure that like i would say c5 can happen but in a way where they are connected with us so they will be able in theory to um for binance user to let's say provide liquidity on sushi swap like in with a franchise pool if they were if you know if binance is interested and so on right this is the goal like exchange are going to be able to uh set their own fee and then provide i guess the abstraction for the user to not even you know play with metamask and so on uh i personally i prefer the fact that people have ownership of their assets and everything and are self-sovereign yeah but this is not for everyone like uh i cannot get my dad and mom to buy sushi on sushi swap at the moment they won't they won't be able to understand all of this dimension and they just want like a very um similar experience to like i guess their bank account yeah they want the they they want the training wheels on right and like look all of us started on an exchange our first step was to get fiat into crypto so we all started on an exchange what you're talking about sounds similar to something david and i talk about often which is uh the protocol sync thesis which is the idea as well that many of these exchanges will start using d5 protocols as uh build on top of them essentially use d5 protocols as as their base layer but how hard or easy is it for a centralized exchange like a binance for example to um tap into the liquidity in sushi swap right now is it um can they can they do it without your permission yeah they could do it without their permission but i do think that they want you know some assistance they want a wide glove experience they want like developers that can support them in their efforts they want to make sure everything is secure uh there's always the compliance aspect also to keep in mind all the time and so on that we are trying to kind of to to mitigate in a way right we want to make sure there is no issues with this on this front uh i mean d5 as you may know is very prone to attacks and so on exploits so there's always risk there's also like this uh this part where you know il impermanent plus is real and we don't want we wouldn't want you know user to use their assets or you know like incur losses if you are uh narrating a very interesting apy and so on that's why we saw you know sushi happening on on centralized exchange more and more because it is pretty much quote unquote um without any risk of downsize right downside right so this is kind of the approach i would say and uh yeah it's uh that's one part of the of the the whole road map i mean i could go on like i've written like a very extensive um medium article about it but uh yeah well we will we will link that uh medium article in the show notes maki one other thing you mentioned when you're going over the high level there is something called the iron bank sounds super cool what is the iron bank so the iron bank is going to be a part of the new update from cream like the upgrade from cream it's going to be a way for protocol to leverage uh liquidity without any curator so that means if you are in need of um of massive amount of tokens or else you can just borrow it without any any guarantee like guarantees on on the other side right you don't need to to show that you will use the fund in a good way so this is the idea of credit it's it's without collateral without a collateralized loan this is a credit based type of loan how is how are they able to do that i mean i would love for you to have leo perhaps like on the show and explaining all of this from uh from top to bottom it is like very interesting and since you know andre shared the post about it and the queen team it was kind of mind-blowing because this is going to be enabling a totally different you know i would say not primitive but different way of thinking about um liquidity and so on you are not just bonded by what i guess the people are providing to your smart contract so this enables things like uh like 100x leverage for example or things like that wow you we're definitely going to have to dig into that a bit more on on bankless can we talk about a bit more about um yeah your your future road map compared to uniswap so uniswap is launching their v3 sometime soon it's uh there's a lot of hype don't know exactly what's going to be in that that v3 um it seems like sushi swap is kind of it started as a fork of unit swap but now it's going its own direction are you going to fork you to swap v3 at all or take any of their ideas or are are is sushi swap basically it's on its own trajectory now i mean we're very open to pretty much uh everything that is going on in this space and if you know unisof was to invol uh to sorry evolve into or you know innovating in a way that is like groundbreaking i don't see why um everyone in the ecosystem wouldn't you know kind of uh get inspired but for us i don't i think we're past this forking phase that was essential in i guess bootstrapping the treasury bootstrapping the community the product but now we're kind of we are well funded uh we were able to you know in the treasury at the moment as we speak we have more than 100 million dollars right without in with all of this being controlled by the community we're able to pretty much do to build anything that we wish we have like built an amazing team i think on the technical front we still need to hire many people on the more ops design and so on and we're kind of setting up ourselves for uh blazing our own path basically not forking their code like just making sure we've shared our own roadmap we're working with very different approach jeff a friend that i've spoken with very recently told us that you know sushi is similar to a bazaar and uni swap is a category where they're not sharing anything that they're working on i don't know if it's by fear or if it's because they're worried that it is too uh too massive to i don't know maybe it's not ready yet we have absolutely no pointers and this is what is infuriating i guess with uni swap is that even if you wanted to help you are kind of uh let that force let down right you cannot help in any single way on sushi swap mindsets were more like all right we are not pretending to be the the most knowledgeable people in the world everyone is welcome to join everyone will be paid uh extremely generously to help out and there is absolutely no barrier to entry anyone that wants to get involved will be involved there's no resume at sushi swap it's all based on on your output uh meritocracy and so on so that's pretty much it yeah that that's fascinating that that that also may be a reaction to the uh advance of sushi swap it seems like they might be doing keeping things under wrap for competitive reasons um one other thing before we uh conclude kind of talking about the road map is we mentioned this this this i don't know if the feature or a a product that you're calling bento box what is that it's just leverage basically on every single pair of sushi as well you will be able to deposit um your assets and basically earn apy on top while people are borrowing it and going for a leveraged position 2 to 3x it's going to be enabled with you know flashlights inside and so on uh boring crypto has been the architect behind it there is like a lot of um of development on this side and i think if one wanted to learn more you could always read the bento box plus uh medium article i can probably uh link it to you in the show notes it's gonna be a way for people to if you have like a quote-unquote gem you will be able to long it you will be able to short it there will be no assets that are not uh possible to basically um to leverage and what is very interesting with this aspect or this approach is that we're not going to be optimizing for tvl on pairs so we're not going after the compound as a cream of this world we're really optimizing for usage we are making sure that the apy are going to be i for people that are in need of i guess a very specific asset and that's why like the elastic rate kicks in you know it's going to be very fast it's going to be way different than ave and compound uh and this sort of thing so we're talking about like an ideal api of 80 on pairs 90 goes to the people putting the assets to work ten percent goes to each sushi holders and then whenever there's like a liquidation happening two pers the the first two percent um of the asset can be flash loan and already and the profit is going to be paid directly to exclusion holder before it is our our bots that can access it so this where we're making sure that the system is benefiting the whole ecosystem of sushi swap and we're also giving the liberty or freedom the freedom for people to create new pairs whenever they want so they can pick the article they can pick the risk parameters it's all isolated risk so if a pair fail uh not it's not going to affect the broader system of the mental product so this is kind of i guess it's very difficult to wrap your mind around but once you read i guess the medium article and the documentation you just simply get it and what is very cool about it is it's not just a product it's also um oh it's called it's a infrastructure layer too so you can build on top of the bento box with assets being available without you know approve contra approved transaction and so on you have like a very capital efficient base layer to build on top so we're probably going to see quote unquote the amm built on this on top of this who knows maybe we're going to see other products um this is kind of a bento for you yeah so is this the assets that people are borrowing are they the same assets that have been deposited to sushi in the amms or is this a different product that's unrelated different product yeah but there's going to be more interwining i guess in 2021 once it is launched we're probably gonna have way more builder and we're gonna have incentives probably for uh for and grants for people to experiment with it because i do think uh it's gonna be instrumental and in our future and in a way to different differentiate ourselves than uni swap so this actually starts to feel like a little bit something more like a doubt right like this is something that i think or behavior that we're seeing coming out of yam where yam built the umbrella protocol which really has it's it's arbitrary has nothing to really do with the yam token except for that people behind the yam token built the product is this kind of the same thing where like the the bento box it doesn't actually have anything to do with sushi swab the amm but it's under the sushi umbrella what is that um what's the takeaway message there should we should we expect more products that are differentiated from other sushi products that are still under the sushi umbrella exactly i mean that's you you you are nailing it down it's like a doubt it's an open or everything can happen in the sushi ecosystem you're you're a chef if the idea is well received by the community and you know we're just going to be giving you funding and get get to it and we want to enable passionate people to join us and build what they're passionate about it's about what you love and to be honest like if there's one contribution to to sushi that you know the impact we had with sushi swap was to make sure that incentives are are more um broadly distributed from now on the fact that you know we can onboard like full-time people that were not necessarily working in crypto uh full-time this is wonderful in my opinion it's all about making sure that the ecosystem grow and by doing so not only are you helping um the sushi custom but the broader community and then we're just getting closer to a bank class future and the future where um you know we are building the the france you know the future of france basically uh how much volume do you guys have these days uh to be fair which i don't look at the volume every single day how do you write in a week plus or minus uh i think it's a bit more than this uh let's call it half a billion to a billion a week i i i just like as as you're talking machia i'm just like just want to pause and reflect how how strange this is and how revolutionary this is right so here is a d5 protocol built by a team of pseudo-anonymous individuals that was originally built as a fork of another protocol and you have right now 100 million in your treasury to continue through a dow to deploy to build out the product you've got volume between 500 million to a billion a week you are continuing to iterate and and build a um like a revolutionary defy primitive like for someone thinking about traditional startups right even somebody who's on the cutting edge traditional startups in silicon valley right this sounds crazy this sounds bizarre like this is not the way the traditional world works if you wanted to build a financial uh like a bank banking system or a financial primitive in the traditional world it would take uh regulation it would take licenses it would take vc checks it would take startup funding it would take an established headquarters location it would take press releases and partnerships this is what we're doing here in d5 is so strange compared to how the traditional world does that i was just struck by that as as you guys were talking i don't know if you have any follow-up comments that maki but this is truly a different type of thing that that's happening in d5 yeah just to give you maybe more more numbers metrics behind the what you just said we for the week the past week we were we did in volume around two billion dollars uh just on sushi swap uh day not a week that was my mistake there yeah no problem this is uh i mean who could have thought that we would be here um six months ago no one i think but this is just a testament to how you can build anything and pretty much gain traction by just perseverance and making sure that you have like a community that is not only um enabled and working and you know growing the pie for you it's and it's not you know this is kind of crazy but it's not benefiting me myself you know individually but everyone that is part of it and i think that is what is very important uh we are enabling people to swap assets from anywhere in the world there's no like uh front-end uh bypass or whatever it is ethereum is really like in my opinion the next the next step in enabling i guess the future of finance and i guess the world is not even ready for when we can have or eat wallet on our iphone or android or whatever and pay on square terminal and so on like this is just the the rails of the future and that was an open or we don't have like i guess the blueprint yet to build them uh you can see recently i'm pretty sure some people um the urine ecosystem are listening uh we're gonna see a minting possibly a voting on the main thing to make sure that you know our contributors are a sense of incentivized um in a decent way and to bring you know treasury to to their community so every everything is kind of still moving and we're assembling the the rocket as we fly kind of type of situation so i do think that the future that is coming is not even this is just the start like what we're seeing here is just the start we don't even have all of the innovation we have like some exotic perps exotic option derivative and so on that are coming the fight if the finance layer on ethereum is something but i don't know if you've seen the all the nft's action happening to the way that they're becoming more liquid um this is very interesting on all the fronts i guess and this is why i cannot just think that any other layer can i guess remove ethereum of it there's just too much happening there's too much life maki you've used the word capital efficiency or the phrase capital efficiency a number of times so far in in this show um and i know that andre uh from from uh urine is really big on the concept of capital efficiency uh and so since you guys are close to that project it seems it seems to make sense that sushi is focused on capital efficiency as well maybe maybe you could talk about um your philosophy about capital efficiency and design in uh sushi swap products that have that make capital more efficient maybe you could talk about that so for example like very very quickly because um i know we're running out of time a little bit but capital efficiency is that you can deposit your assets for example in in a urine vault or in a bento box uh kind of pool or something like this and you don't need to um you don't need to move it yourself you don't need to pay a huge amount to move all of this similar to um you've probably have you ever switched capital from compound to ave uh yeah manually yeah manually like it's kind of uh it can be an sometimes i know there's like some tools with flashlights now but before that it was very tedious i would say a tedious process with bento like you can just like you don't even need to approve like other contracts to um kind of move all of these assets and so on and it's just to make sure things are less cost um they cost less to you and transaction and so on it's really about this make and also that you get the most out of your assets so for example if you are lp you want to deposit them uh in maybe a solution that is going to provide you impermanent loss without you uh needing to move everything all right we're also like we're thinking about strategies on top of bento to make sure that you know assets of people are working for them while they are sitting there um being landed so it's all of this notion that we're when we're talking about capital efficiency maki um we want to close this maybe by um talking about the the the future of of defy in general so we've talked about so many things i'm sure um you were in a place now you didn't think you would be a a year ago at this time right so it's it's at some level it's hard to predict the future um that said you are in kind of the the frontier as we would call it on bankless of this whole defy experiment and you're talking to many different projects what do you see ahead for us in d5 right now what projects are you excited about either things inside sushi or in in d5 in general that we should also be looking into to be honest i think what is going to be very interesting to evolve to see evolving swan besides capability and so on it's all the fact that this project can be started now without any sort of um funding i would say or they can they don't like there is no gatekeeper anymore right so which means if there's no gatekeeper all the innovation can happen and be funded by the community and i guess the early adopters meaning that we're going to be seeing people that are able to support themselves and launch whatever they please whatever they're passionate about is this going to be whether it is a derivative whether it is uh related to identity whether it is related to nft um we're gonna be seeing more innovation than we can even concede at this point that we can absorb in our mind i think we're gonna like you know we would have predict all of this liquidity mining phase and this is just one thing right this is just to bootstrap like liquidity and so on it's not perfect for everything but i do think that we're gonna be seeing uh other not just primitives but incentives in a way uh are they gonna be i think like one of the the one i want to be seeing myself and we're gonna be working on at sushi is um enabling developers to be quote-unquote paid or like having more revenue streams from helping protocols so they don't need to ask permission for a grant they don't need to go by a tedious process or else they just can build with legos that are provided and be incentivized for doing so i think once we can make sure that builders are incentivized in a remote remarkable way i think we're going to see so much innovation from them that you know the humans are very creative since individuals and anonymous is probably the anonymous kind of persona and so on are going to keep going and being more mainstream i do think and at some point you know it's just not going to be our own little bubble that we are in that you know crypto is for power user and crypto native and so on we're probably going to be seeing uh people in in all part of the world being able to accept crypto for the first time you know the people uh news that happened people forgot already about it but it's happening and they're going to be opening in many countries very soon meaning that we are we are going to be able to be first-class citizen with crypto and once this shift happens anything is possible at that point maggie i want to thank you for coming on the bankless state of the nation uh i think there's a lot of really powerful takeaways that we can get from this conversation and from what sushi swap has taught the ecosystem i think one of the biggest uh things that it's taught me and showed the rest of the listeners is that well first off sushi has a massive treasury that could be somebody's paycheck uh and that that is not just for sushi swap that's also true for yam that's also true for urine a lot of these uh d5 protocols have treasuries that are they're ready to pay out to people that provide value to the ecosystem that was uh something that i was personally when i was getting into the space of crypto in 2017 there wasn't very many opportunities um to to contribute if you didn't know how to code if you didn't know how to write solidity you kind of had to sit and watch while the coders did the coding stuff um but with uh with yam with you with sushi with wire there's a there's a lot of community management there's branding writing marketing uh and i i think it's an open invitation to anyone listening or watching this on youtube uh that there are protocols that are looking for your human capital your labor and sushi swap is is kind of pioneering that along with their own path through defy just kind of being exemplar models of what open source software development can really look like in a world powered by ethereum i think this is a fantastic story that i personally uh will be watching with great interest so mackie thank you for coming on and helping to tell that story to the bankless nation pleasure thank you for having me david and ryan it was like i never expected to uh to be on this show to be honest with you i remember vividly when all of the not maxie but all the fervent uh influencer of ethereum i would say we're very against sushi sua but we proved ourselves to be actual um pillar of the ecosystem i think and we will keep going so we'll keep doing so and be there for helping any project to to launch to exchange on our platform and so on and provide collaboration because this is key in this ecosystem well said there are no gatekeepers in the bankless economy mackie thank you very much for joining us guys david and i work for a protocol it sounds like there are tons of opportunities for you to work for a protocol too perhaps your kids will work for protocols not companies a really fascinating discussion here with mackie of course risks and disclaimers ethan's risky d phi is risky so is all of crypto this is really the frontier we're headed west it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on bank list today
