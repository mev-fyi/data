[Music] hello and welcome to the green pill i'm kevin walke and this is the podcast about public goods and regenerative crypto economics this episode is with glenn weil who is at the microsoft office of the cto he is a political economist and social technologist and the founder of radical exchange this is a special episode for me because when i got into the ethereum space one of the first books that i read was radical markets by glenn weil and later went on to as we evolved get coin make quadratic funding which is an inve a mechanism that glenn and vitalik and zoe hitsig invented quadratic funding is a foundation of get coin grants which is a foundation of bitcoin so over the years and over bitcoin grants having run 12 rounds of quadratic funding have developed a relationship with glenn in which he's one of the most lucid thinkers thinking about public goods funding and using markets for good and get coin is a place where his ideas quadratic funding most notably have gone into practice and so there's sort of a symbiosis between glenn's ideas and get coin putting them out into the world in order to fund open source software and public goods using ethereum so this is a really interesting episode for me to hear about glenn's vision for where quadratic funding is going and where radical markets in general are going and some interesting commentary and kind of sober thoughts about the ethereum and web3 ecosystem to keep us grounded so without further ado i give you glenn weil living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use d5 and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitrary and arbitrary defy and nfd ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of decentralization and security if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on arbitrum if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps or nft projects building on arbitrome many of your favorite apps are already live with many more coming over soon you can find these apps at portal.arbitrom.one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrom using bridge.arbitrom.io in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free already welcome to the show everyone i am here with glenn weil who is an inspiration to me and the reason why git coin grants what it is what it is today uh welcome glenn weil the founder of the radical exchange foundation uh and uh from the office of the cto at microsoft glenn welcome to the show kevin great to be here you're a real inspiration to me too so thanks um so can you tell me about how you came to author radical markets and uh what your view is on regenerative crypto economics how can we use crypto and markets in order to create a better world well a pretty funny thing is that um radical markets was written with eric posner and i don't know if you've ever tried to read anything the eric posner ever wrote about blockchain i didn't really write about blockchain much myself but uh none of it was very positive you know and eric posner and i actually our original work was on financial regulation in a direction that's pretty uh defy would find pretty challenging to work with i think um so eric and i were not crypto enthusiasts we were really interested in the potential of new types of social mechanisms to be transformative and when things started going really weird in the world of politics around 2016 with brexit and donald trump and so forth we felt an impetus to take some of these ideas we'd been developing pretty academically and put them out there in a form that different communities could interact with and we didn't expect one of those communities to be the blockchain world but it turned out to be um and it was kind of in a weird way vitalik had seen one of the papers that went into the book and tweeted about it and off of that tweet i got more traffic than off of uh everything that i'd ever done on twitter before and and so at that point i kind of looked into him and he looked kind of me like uh some kind of a bond villain you know like a 23 year old billionaire you know russian canadian like it was pretty weird and so i i dm'd him and i said uh you want to take a look at the book and he sent me back 25 pages of the most thoughtful comments i've ever gotten on anything and so i thought well maybe there's something here so i started corresponding with him and working together and eventually wrote this paper that i think played a role in in starting your business and uh yeah that's kind of the that's kind of the right we should clarify for the listeners out there that vitalik is not a bond villain actually one of the most pure-hearted and lucid thinkers uh that i think i've ever met i couldn't agree more and in the end i was i was surprised about it yeah uh well it so specifically i remember reading radical markets and and and learning about quadratic fund or sorry quadratic voting and i think that the outcome of your collaboration with vitalik and also zoe hitzig was taking quadratic voting and using it in a monetary concept in quadratic funding could you talk about that leap at all yeah so quadratic voting was originally um actually originally quadratic voting was supposed to be done with money uh but then that was really unpalatable to people and so then and then we had a version of quadratic voting where you got our official currency um but then we just took it in the direction of okay what if you're funding a project rather than making a decision and in that context because people are much more used to like capitalism for funding things uh money seemed much more natural so we used in that context it turns out there's kind of a deep sense in which quadratic voting and all these contexts is actually kind of the same thing and there's actually no difference really between quadratic funding and quadratic voting not sure it's worth going into like the mathematical uh logic behind that all here but you can kind of just play with the formulas and you'll and you'll see that they're actually there's actually a sense in which they're the same thing in particular like if you had a quadratic vote on should this project get this amount of money um if that was like the proposal and you had a quadratic vote on it it turns out you can just see from the formula that it will pass exactly when like it will pass exactly if that amount of money is less than or equal to the amount that it would get funded under qf in in the equilibrium so it's like uh they're actually the same thing in some sense it's just like quadratic findings like discovering the level of funding that would pass a vote in a quadratic vote um anyway but um so the uh quadratic funding i think in some ways has ended up being at least as impactful if not more impactful than quadratic voting because the sort of formulation in the world of crypto is very much around finance and money and whatever rather that you know even though there is decision making and governance issues and whatever somehow like the sexy thing is is funding there uh rather than you know collective decision making and governance even though as i pointed out these are kind of the same thing um but uh but that's the reason why i think it's caught a lot of people's attention in that world whereas in the world of politics quadratic voting has gotten a lot more attention interesting yeah i'll just say i'm looking at getcoin.comresults right now and so far getcoin has funded 55 million dollars worth of funding for open source software and i think about two-thirds of that has gone through the quadratic funding mechanism so we owe a lot of our traction at get coin to quadratic funding and one of the things that i think the users like a lot is that they can fund a project with a dollar and it can be matched with tens sometimes hundreds of dollars so it really gets people over that free rider problem of why would i fund this when i already get it for free uh well the answer is because the matching pool is going to contribute a lot especially to the projects that get a lot of traction from many many other people giving their dollars it's kind of takes crowdfunding and makes it into a multiplayer compounding game absolutely yeah so um where do you see uh i want to talk about some other mechanisms that are regenerative with you but uh i think it'd be really interesting to pinch and zoom on quadratic funding itself where do you see quadratic funding going in the future um i think the most exciting applications and you know we really emphasize these in the original paper are to things like media i think media is one of the most interesting areas this is one where everybody knows that like capitalism is completely broken like the number of like the dwell time you can get on a cat video versus on like an investigative report that totally changes the world just bears no relationship to what anyone thinks the value of that is you know and at the same time nobody wants like the government giving out grants to be like the direct uh you know source of funding for most of the media so like both of those models just don't work and on the other hand like yeah philanthropists could give out money but like who does someone really want bill gates like determining like what media gets funded so so clearly like the answer has to be something in the spirit of decentralized but public goods logic based funding and i just don't think there's another systematic game in town at the moment and so i i think it's it's that's a really natural application um campaign funding is like conceptually very similar to media uh but it you know it's a slightly different space and and these types of mechanisms are already used there so i think this is a supernatural fit in that context um uh but i i think there's all kinds of things like one area that i think is really exciting is within corporations and in some sense like that's kind of where bitcoin is because like yeah ethe isn't a corporation but it's kind of spiritually it's like some kind of a private loose decentralized entity and you guys are sort of supporting things that make that ecosystem work but you know i think within microsoft uh you know a big role that the office of the cto that i work in plays is to overcome sort of conflicts between different organizations within microsoft that you know don't want to contribute to underlying infrastructure that benefits the whole company they just want to do whatever benefits the bottom line of their order that they're getting credit for and this provides a potential mechanism for something like the office of the cto not to have the big bureaucracy that we're coming to have but instead to just have some kind of a you know big pool of money but a pool of money that's not directed by executive fiat but by um some decentralized process of sort of virtual teams coming together saying that we need to do this for the company and then that just getting funding based on willingness of their different orgs to contribute to that common infrastructure and have that matched by a common pool interesting you know your story about quadratic funding for media reminds me of git coin grants has done 12 rounds thus far and around round three or four vitalik suggested that you know this is before i should say that right now bitcoin's quadratic funding is governed by the dow and those governance rights and all that kind of stuff but around rounds three or four it was really just bitcoin applying for a grant from the ethereum foundation to run the rounds and so um in the negotiation process for running round four i think it was vitalik suggested that we do around for media um which has always been foreign for get coin because we're about funding open source software and one of the things that we saw was that the public goods the open source software that were being funded on git coin got a huge lift from media projects also being on the platform because the media projects were the ones that were bringing large twitter audiences and large mailing list audiences and their visitors would come to the site they would add their favorite media organization to the site but they would also add the digital infrastructure the open source software projects to their cart and check out with all of them and so there was this kind of like positive some game being played between the media organizations and the open source projects that's interesting uh when when we added those to the platform so i i wonder if there's there's there's an option to fund digital infrastructure technology projects along with media and have the sun be greater than the whole of its parts uh do you have any sort of any comment on that sounds very interesting to me i mean one thing that i pretty strongly believe in is that the way that we actually get a better internet is to get a much larger set of people engaged with the need for digital public infrastructure i don't think that like random crypto people like doing their little thing is gonna get us there i don't think that like regulation is gonna get us there i think what's gonna get us there is like real public engagement with constructively building better solutions and i think that the link between that those things that generate the public engagement and the things that um that are actually like that's exactly what we want so so if that that that's a example of a pathway to do it i'm super uh super positive and you know that's the way that radical exchange is designed right radical exchange has this big art base and it also has a big community of of builders and we very much believe in connecting those to each other so right um that actually sort of reminds me of uh two experiments we've done outside of the cryptosphere with quadratic funding is a campaign in may of 2020 to do quadratic funding for downtown boulder and to prove that everyday retail stores that were being threatened by the lack of retail foot traffic during the pandemic i think we had a comic book store a bookstore a yoga studio and two other retail businesses we ran a 50k quadratic funding round in downtown boulder and got over 250 donations to those businesses so i think it was really interesting to see quadratic funding work outside of crypto there and then in i think it was november no i'm sorry it was it was may of 2021 we actually did a quadratic funding campaign uh in partnership with open collective and funded regular traditional open source not crypto open source with quadratic funding and was able to raise 100k based off of that so one of the most interesting things to me is that the mechanism scales whether you're in the crypto niche or you're not and so maybe that could be one way that we get to a better internet which involves more people involved in funding and managing digital infrastructure um does that sort of comport with your vision or how would you augment and and i would say that i think one really important element of that is finding those targeted communities like boulder and showing that you're able to get real signal through people's experiences with that i mean you really at some level want to do like almost a natural like a controlled experiment where you have some grant making authority go and try to like give money in some context you give like ubi to people in some context and then you give matching funds you know all uh bitcoin grants in in three contexts that are kind of parallel like imagine that like you know for to do relief for uh covent you either sent checks to everyone in the community you did your some form of your downtown stimulus in every in in a community and you did uh like someone giving grants all with the same amount of money uh in three different communities in some place you know like that are nearby but you know and pretty equivalent but not the same towns right and see what the impact is you know i think that would be super interesting so i think like this controlled experiment between a central pool ubi and a quadratic funding style matching pool is sort of interesting in understanding how different mechanisms work and in funding things but do you think that uh that the the actual that those things have to be zero-sum with each other i mean could we not have all three of those things stacked on top of each other uh in funding our digital infrastructure all together sure absolutely i mean all of them are gonna have to play roles and even within any context there's probably gonna have to be some amounts of of each of these different things but um right but i i i tend towards and even beyond the way that quadratic funding does i tend towards things that are decentralized but community oriented rather than either individualistic in the way that ubi is or centralized i want to ask you about other decentralized and community-oriented mechanisms that you're excited about but before we do that i want to untangle a few more concepts with quadratic funding um i'm wondering if you wouldn't mind telling us a little bit about the idea that you shared with me six or nine months ago about uh this sort of like gradient between public and private goods and how quadratic funding could be uh augmented by measuring the social distance between participants and maybe changing the incentives based off of that i'm you're i'd be curious in your words what whether you're still excited about that mechanism and what problem it solves yeah so a couple of things so first let me talk about the gradient between public and private goods without bringing in this thing of social distance so sure um right now quadratic funding is being used pretty much for things that have no business model where they're just like putting out completely free stuff i would really love to see quadratic funding go into context where that's not necessarily the case so like for example imagine that i'm funding a road a road is basically public infrastructure in fact it's like gave the name to public infrastructure right but roads do get crowded and so you want congestion pricing on roads and once you have congestion pricing roads have somewhat of a business model right like they're going to make some money off that congestion pricing right um so you should have the congestion pricing but you also don't want like people charging some ridiculous toll and the road going getting underutilized right that was the whole reason to make it public in the first place you want some balance between those things and and in fact there's there are going to be a number of things that do naturally have some elements of scarcity and you want to ration things in them and those that will raise some money but not enough to support the the project so i actually really support the notion of having quadratic funding for things that have somewhat of a business model um or even things that maybe are like profitable businesses but they could be much more exploitative and choose to act in the public interest or to be certified b corporations or do you know like open collective like exit to community or whatever things that have business models that can be self-sustaining but that like aren't really going to thrive unless or aren't really going to be able to sustain being exit to community or whatever unless they have some of that matching funds so like there's kind of a spectrum between things that are like totally just like the only way you could possibly do it is completely as sort of a charity plus you know quadratic funding two things that are like businesses but that could be really exploitative businesses or they could be really pro-social businesses and if you have that matching funds there it gives them an incentive to be that pro-social orientation you know what i mean so so that's the first spectrum to think about the the second one is to think about the fact that most goods and in fact this is what quadratic funding discovers are in some sense community goods they're neither like pure public goods that just like freely open to everyone or pure private goods that just one person consumes like one example is right now out my window behind you um i'm looking at lake washington where i like to go paddle boarding right and you know you could divide up the water in lake washington and give everyone like some chunk of water that they could drink or do whatever but like no one could go paddle boarding and no one could uh no one could do all the things that you do you know whether it's jet skiing or or sailing or swimming in that bigger body of water right and those type of goods uh are i think the generic thing like actually most of the value we get out of our lives come out of those types of things they're they're community goods rather than either global public goods or private goods and once you take that into account it actually really changes your perspective on a lot of things because what you come to realize is that most people you're interacting with are not some like anonymous rando person that you only have a market interaction with there are actually people that you have stronger or weaker social ties to depending on how many of those community goods you share and this is definitely true in the crypto world right like people are people are involved in like 17 different projects with like different subsets of people in the crypto world all the time right and the prosperity of people who are in one of those projects with you is like super important to your success as well right and um this means that it's like just running a mechanism like qf runs into a lot of trouble because yeah there's collusion or whatever that you're not supposed to do but then there's just like the relationships that you have with people right quadratic funding is this problem that if like a bunch of people care about each other and care about what's important to each other this like actually undermines the functioning quadratic funding which is weird because the whole point of quadratic funding is to get people to have that kind of solidarity so like it should be like thrilled if there's already solidarity that pre-exists it shouldn't be like freaked out about that right but um but somehow it like it it's set up in a way where it it like assumes that everyone's an atomized individual and then tries to itself build all the solidarity rather than understanding that that solidarity will exist and you know like harnessing that or giving incentives for solidarity where it doesn't already exist or something like that you know what i mean and so i think we need mechanisms that do a better job of achieving that got it so it it sounds like in the context of quadratic funding in crypto instead of viewing the collusion problem which is basically you know if i go around to all my friends who i have a relationship with and tell them to contribute to my project instead of viewing that as a binary is it collusion or is it not you just kind of take into account the existing social structure of the system and the fact that if we have a relationship uh or if you're really close to my project that's kind of a different situation than if it's a totally public good uh if for which i have no relationship with you or no proximity to the project am i saying that back to you yeah exactly let me give you the example of the org structure of a company right like you know companies have these org structures right where like there are these different organizations and there's some organizations and whatever and um the the problem that the company faces is not really like oh no one will do anything for the company at all the problem the company faces is that though like further from someone in org space you are the harder it is for you to get credit for collaboration with them and therefore like the more likely you are to like build redundant things that are wasteful of the overall company's resources and they don't play well together right and so what the company really wants to do is provide an incentive mechanism so that if people like from different orgs randomly meet in the cafeteria and have a great idea together that they would have like just as much night an incentive to pursue that if it's in the company's interests as if they had both been in exactly the same org right um like that's that's what that's what the company wants not just like everyone to build public goods as if there was no existing social structure there at all you know and um that that's like a better representation of the problem that we face in the world as well um we we live like in quadratic funding there's like all these there's like a list of people and then these list of people each put in like some tokens and then these tokens have some like operation applied to them each separately and that's like that's like treating people as if they're equally spaced atoms in some like you know infinite you know high dimensional space but in reality people like live closer to each other and many senses of that they live on a network of relationships and and like a system should somehow rock that sure got it and so what i'm hearing is that you're looking for those areas of unlikely consensus in which people are voting for the projects that uh they agree upon even though they're different in different places in the org chart or uh to use your your lake example like people who are far away from the lake are voting are are spending money on that lake and like it's those areas of unlikely consensus is where the purest public goods are the most important public goods another word that sociologists use is is the distinction between bridging ties and bonding ties um bonding ties are like those that sort of are already existing etc bridging ties are when you take different communities and find something for them to collaborate on you know and and in fact it's a dynamic process like in fact the way i think about this is that we what we want is an evolving social graph so there's there's solidarity that already exists um but then there's opportunities for new forms of solidarity that get created like you know there might be a bunch of people who all live in a city and they're like you know a union or whatever and now there's people in other cities who are forming unions but then they realize oh no if we collaborate we can do the following thing together and like what you want to do and then they have solidarity with each other so actually with the role of the mechanism is to evolve the social graph to take advantage of the new opportunities for cooperation that don't historically exist and allow those new forms of solidarity to come into existence at a more rapid pace you know what i mean yeah wow that's amazing bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap your swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswopgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so you've got some money but how are you gonna use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] i'm curious what other mechanisms are exciting to you right now and specifically just knowing that most of my audience and the audience for this podcast is going to be cryptoeconomic and web3 curious about what mechanisms uh are exciting to you and what projects are exciting to you i know you just read a you just wrote a tweet thread about web 3 projects that are doing charitable and public goods funding that are exciting to you and i'm wondering if we can kind of explore that design space for the rest of the show sure that sounds great well i mean one thing that i'm a huge fan of is polis uh and the whole space around it of deliberative mechanisms so uh you know quadratic funding is not really about having a conversation it's about once you've already formed your opinions expressing your views but how do people even come to those views in the first place how do people figure out what's a good you know project um like how and how do people at scale take two projects both of which are good and try to synthesize them into something that's even better together right um i don't think we figured that out you know uh and and twitter people kind of do that in some kind of a way on twitter right but um but it's it's like not really very it's it's oriented towards engagement it's not oriented towards building good  you know what i mean like twitter would be like thrilled if you spent like all day rat holing on getting angry and angrier about something um that's probably better from like the perspective of the twitter business model than it is if you like very quickly converge on some super awesome thing that solved an unsolved problem by bringing two different communities together right and polis uh is this like i think a proof of concept really of a direction of thinking which is consensus oriented deliberative mechanisms that very large numbers of people can participate in um what what it basically does is people like put sort of a tweet length thing in about some topic um and then other people put other tweet link things in and then you can like go plus or minus on them um maybe eventually you could do that quadratically or something but and then they form clusters of opinion and then they pull out sort of the most supported thing within a cluster as sort of a representative opinion and then everyone can read those and then you could come back and offer new things and try to find that unlikely consensus across people um and this allows you to have sort of a deliberative conversation at scale um where where you're going back and forth and hearing different people's perspectives and so forth yeah so um i'm on the polis website and it looks like it says you input like input crowd and output meaning so it's a real-time system for gathering analyzing and understanding what large group of people think in their own words enabled by advanced statistics and machine learning um i'm curious this seems like a really amazing elegant mechanism and i'm wondering how we get out of the trap of the race to the bottom of the brainstem to all these consumers of information systems just in this feedback loop where they optimize for attention uh and there's an advertising supporting model where we're spending all these times on places like twitter and on facebook that are just designed to capture us and you know what's the network effect that can move conversations from twitter over to some place that's more of a pull a public scare a public square like like polis a place where we can have better conversations and and get better meaning well um i think that the conceptual framework is very similar to what i view as um bitcoin's business model the way i would characterize get going to business model is a three-sided market you basically have um people giving contributions you can think of those as like the twitter users you have people getting donations um which you can think of in this context as being like the issues that are being discussed and the third side of the market is some entity which has a stake in the system working well um but very little else like very little knowledge very little like you know very little on the ground anything but they do have a stake in the system working well and you go to those people and you get them to put in matching funds you know in the case of media that might be like the city of los angeles might want local media to work well or whatever you know and and similarly like there's a lot of people who have a stake in like twitter not degenerating into like you know a complete cesspool it's not twitter shareholders but but it is like various governments and philanthropists and um and even just like ordinary citizens might say like okay i'll give some money towards that or some you know what i mean and similarly i think that there's you know protest movements and there's civic energy that people um you know people do want their societies to work better and in fact a lot of the time they spend rat holding on twitter is because they want their you know societies work better so if they're if there was if there's credible signal that this actually leads to that type of an outcome i think there's a lot of people who would say like look i'm just going to put time in to doing things this way you know and and if they're not directly willing to do it they're going to be philanthropists who pay people to do that or there could be churches that say we're just gonna do an hour of this every sunday or there's just like all sorts of organizations out there that actually like do care about the system working better if they could identify a way to make that happen you know um so so i think the business model for these regenerative things always has that triangular feel you know there's there's the individuals there's the like sort of benevolent but uninformed act you know uh overlord figure um and then there's the topics or communities or whatever that that get created it's interesting i feel like you turned your question around on me by saying it's uh it's already get coins business model and one of the things that that made me think of glenn is that um we're starting to branch out on get coin into doing these side rounds where we've got this main ethereum round in the center uh and we're starting to do rounds for polygon and for uniswap and we've done a round on climate change and uh longevity research and advocacy and what's really interesting is that in the main round uh you've got these side rounds that are kind of uh orthogonal to the main round but there is an overlap in a venn diagram where there can be grants that are in multiple rounds and what's really interesting to me is seeing a grant that is deriving quadratic matching from the main round but also from the side round and i kind of visualize this as wow every individual quadratic funding round is like a like a fan like it's generating some amount of crypto economic force but together the the the the rounds are like a jet engine like they create so much force for for public good um and an example of this is that coin center alaska coin grants round coin center is an advocacy group for for uh crypto to educate lawmakers about yeah yeah um and and one of what was interesting is that a dollar donation led to a 500 match in in quadratic funding because they were in the advocacy round and they were in a couple different rounds and people on twitter were saying wow this is too good to be true because the matching was so high um and and you know so when we go back to the question of how do we move people out of twitter and into polis or out of centralized funding systems and indicating grants i think there's a compounding nature to multiple ecosystems being together on the same platform and using that mechanism hopefully that can help us climb out of the hole that we're in well and also another element to that is i think eventually you guys might have an interesting kind of federal structure where what you might want to do is give matching you know give grants to things that are all quadratic funding organizations or dows or whatever and then what you're actually giving money to the to in those cases is a matching pool that then is going to match grants on that topic you know you can imagine having like a hierarchical structure like that you know where where there's like a high level like topic based thing like yeah i think this thing should be this great area should be supported but then that would have a quadratic funding and like and different types of people would participate in each of these types of of around anyways just just a thought we should turn to a couple of other mechanisms that are exciting uh uh out there yeah um but let's do it you want to list off the ones that are most exciting to you well i think one thing that i i think is is super important is um some kind of i don't know if people know the spritely project um but there's a number of these uh mechanisms out there for interesting new forms of identity decentralized identity i don't know is the only best word to use for it but things that allow us to represent and manage who we are in ways that capture sort of the richness of all the different contexts that go into our lives um uh so sprightly is a great example like that um but there's a number of other khalia young is like the ultimate repository of all the great projects uh in this area so i think that's a super exciting direction um i think another set of uh you know mechanisms in this direction are um things coming out of like ipfs um which is uh like sort of horizontal ways for people to share computation and uh and you know files and things like this um but you know of course that just fits in the normal crypto thing but in in the more regenerative version like i really want to see that embedded into a network of trust and relationships where what you really have is not just like you send it out to the marketplace or whatever but where you have communities of people that are pooling together those resources and building on the trust that they have not in the trustlessness but rather the trust within that community i think that's a super exciting uh set of directions it reminds me a little bit i don't know if i'm in the same direction as you mentally right now but i remember reading radical markets and learning about data as labor and possible internet economy in which we've all kind of formed maybe data labor data unions and we can sell access to data and share data um in a peer-to-peer type of ways is that is that kind of the same direction that you're thinking yeah well so that's for data and i think that's super exciting and that's definitely an area that i think there's been a huge amount of activity around um there's things like uh pool and um uh microsoft has done some there's a whole range of different projects in that area but there's also doing that for compute or doing that for storage that i think are really interesting uh as potential alternatives to the cloud you know um another uh set of things that i think is really exciting is um federated learning and other ways of sharing data in privacy-preserving ways and those are very related to these data labor union type things but open mind being a really great example uh of that so those are those are some of my favorite examples right now and in fact there's this whole umbrella now like digital public goods digital public infrastructure has become really in the last year like a word that like the white house is saying and all sorts of people are saying so it's a it's a thought space that's really exciting to be in right for sure well i think it's really exciting but i'm obviously drinking the kool-aid talking about digital public goods over here at get coin um what would you say to someone who's kind of on the periphery of this whole space whether the space is radical markets or regenerative crypto economics or digital public goods um you know what tools or or resources would you recommend for people that are that are just about to jump down the rabbit hole i think the best place to start is an article uh in wired about about audrey tong um called how the digital taiwan's unlikely digital minister hacked the pandemic or one by ann applebaum uh in the atlantic called how to put out democracies dumpster fire which are really about um how if sort of participative democratic systems are going to survive the technological revolutions we're going through we need these types of uh approaches these types of imagination to make that possible the way i think about it is that you know markets have accelerated or like capitalist systems have accelerated with technology and bureaucratic systems which i think you know ai is kind of a bureaucratic system it's like a system you program and it does things on people um have accelerated but what hasn't accelerated is participative democratic systems and uh these are giving visions of how we can do that right i was talking to uh matt pruitt who's the executive director of the radical exchange foundation uh during route exchange denver in december and one of the things that he kind of summed up a lot of the work that they're doing is upgrading democracy to be high bandwidth for the 21st century and i thought wow what a beautiful what a beautiful vision to have i hope that we can do it well it's been great talking to you kevin thanks for all the amazing work that you do and and the community that you're creating and uh really looking forward to more exchanges with you and and your forthcoming uh literature and books and so forth yeah yeah i hope that we can uh continue to be a shining light of quadratic funding um glenn where can people find you online if they're interested in learning more at glenwile uh on twitter um i've got a website glenwild.com and and definitely check out radical exchange uh radical exchange right glenn weil thank you so much for being on the podcast great to have you take care [Music] you
