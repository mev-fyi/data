SPF got arrested it's such a great day turns out his 4D chess was just him playing checkers ladies and gentlemen we got him Friday of December David what time is it Ryan it's the bank this Friday weekly roll up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere into the frontier into the end of the year nonetheless how are you doing yeah I'm doing great man it's gonna be good to close this one out this year that is uh but we got a lot to talk about this roll up and David I think you're are you wearing your SpongeBob uh sweater I haven't seen you in that for a while high fashion Friday High fashion all right that feels like a good kind of like holiday sweater it looks comfy looks like pretty relaxing how you feeling man you feeling okay you feeling relaxed dude I think I'm pretty I'm I'm feeling good I'm feeling really good uh I mean we all know how bad this year was but uh I think that we are on the precipice of good stuff because of what happened this week SBF got arrested this week Ryan I started I started December saying December is the best month SBF got arrested uh the the Redemption Arc of three hours capital is coming to a close people are having none of that and so we're going to cover all of this news and more in addition to that binance is seeing all-time high outflows is a run on the bank happening with binance are we about to do this all over again or is this just happening in an abundance of caution people going bankless we'll talk about that what else we got Ryan we also have one of the best investigative journalists or so we thought called the block it turns out that was secretly owed by SPF yeah like what a Mastercraft villain uh we're dealing with so we talk about that that hit me pretty hard on Friday we'll talk about that a little bit and also David I'm hearing some Rumblings I'm hearing some things about the world's greatest nft drop in history who is who is dropping in nft oh we can't tease that we can't tease that now but let me just tell you Ryan it's a big big deal the world has never seen an nfg drop this fantastic we're going to make nfts great again folks let me tell you nfcs are the future of digital ownership based on the most advanced technology out there blockchain and we're going to drop the biggest any nfts anyone has ever seen more later in the show David did you get any comments about your uh Trump impression from last last roll up you know like uh positive or negative the scammy YouTube comments absolutely like the bot Farms that are also on YouTube kind of drowned out all the YouTube comments last week and I didn't get any comments but yeah okay I'm coming from maybe they're coming for round two he's fishing for it all right because uh I bet if you could guess who that was who David was in person you probably have a clue on who's dropping an nft as fresh as of today David before we get in we gotta talk about our friends and sponsors at Kraken what are we doing with Kraken and what is cracking up to yeah so we're actually rethinking Bank list is rethinking our sponsor strategy going into 2023 we want to form uh more intentful more surgical long-term relationships and so we're working with Kraken who is the only exchange that pioneered and implemented proof of reserves before anyone ever asked them to uh when we had our conversation with uh with Jesse Powell from Kraken the CEO who's been head sound building since like 2014. uh I just felt like he is the Eric Voorhees type he's the libertarian who's doing what he needs to do to help move this industry forward uh and so he when he came on he was like yo use Kraken but then get off Kraken and so he's also like and also you should use other exchanges don't put all of your eggs in one basket that was super refreshing to hear it was in stark contrast to the scammers that have pioneered 2022 uh Jesse came into the industry way back when he's been headstone building ever since uh very unego-less individual and so we've chosen Kraken for a long-term sponsor we're gonna have more details about this uh into 2023 but right now uh if you are unsure about your exchange uh perhaps go to the link in the show notes go to kraken.com and sign up for the exchange that implemented proof of reserves before anyone ever asked them to in exchange that didn't rug you last year as well doesn't that feel good to say yeah exactly I'm going to be moving some more of my stuff there as well guys all right well let's uh get in let's talk about markets today Bitcoin what are we looking at on the week give us the price data we got a flat week Ryan Bitcoin ended up up 0.7 sort of the week at 17 to 60 ending the week at 17 380 so 0.7 up all right right um neither higher nor lower very much just kind of flat-ish eth as well same same down a little bit down 1.1 percent start of the week at 1285 ending the week at 1270 got up to 13 30 on the positive CPI print um but then fell back down uh you know one point eight percent part of the 180 I'm feeling um uh I guess rejuvenated coming to this episode versus some of the others in like November is uh we had that eatables episode that we did this is an episode that's coming at you on December 26th all about ether it's an eth bull panel that we do about every six months and six months and this one was especially good it's so good uh but I remember seeing the DC investor made the point look we are still below 2018 all-time highs for eth right and what's interesting is like he he put out this tweet a few uh weeks ago we just said like I didn't buy at 80 but I bought it 120. this is during you know uh 2020 I guess been you know bear market and he's like there is no difference there's literally no difference right it's crazy it's like that's kind of what the numbers look like now only it's 10x different like our low for ether was about 800 or so it's eight High eight hundreds really and then now we're at like 12 uh 1200s 1300s right the Delta is the same so and we're below 2018. we're below the last all-time high so I'm not saying eth is looking juicy at these prices but uh the Bulls certainly are and they will be on the two on the 26th when that episode releases and uh yeah it just seems like a good time to keep dollar cost averaging in yeah and the point of that tweet was that like when ether hit 80 like it didn't stay there it bounced right back up and so he was just reminding people it's like hey you don't have to time the Pico bottom yeah buying a 120 East just kind of blurred together with buying the 80 East I made so many mistakes when I was a noob just like watching the charts and trying to time the the Pico bottom when I should have just been like dollar cost averaging in during the bear Market yeah all right let's talk about the ratio what's that looking like David uh ratio down 1.8 percent down from a point zero seven four five to point zero seven three uh down to 1.8 holding up though holding up and Bitcoin and East down from all-time highs they're about neck and neck aren't they yeah yeah they're about the same like 76 77 something like that um crypto market cap total are we above or below a trillion dollars Dave it's still below a trillion dollars uh 885 billion dollars about flat on the week good question that we asked vitalik by the way in our episode we recorded that's coming at you Monday was basically like will crypto ever be a you know multi-trillion dollar asset class again or it will forever be a niche you had a really fascinating answer to that question premium Subs already have that podcast oh yeah you do or at least I'll check you out in a few hours yeah go check your premium RSS feed for that it's a fantastic podcast all right should we talk about uh do our fed watch Macro for a bit gotta watch the FED two things happen this week David um the first is we got some CPI numbers and that is inflation of course Consumer Price Index they came in lower than was expected so that's right we are excited about that and you can kind of see this over time this is the chart from uh of CPI changes from 2015 all the way to 2021 you see the peak that Peak was around like June ish or so and uh we're down off the peak so I think the official numbers are something like this David um June was 9.1 percent that was the high for the year now November 7.1 percent the numbers fall up and previous month October was 7.7 percent uh core inflation obviously also down core inflation is like a subset of the main CPI number that's another number to track independently so that happened and the question is is inflation over maybe we'll talk about that in a minute the other thing that happened David is the Fed raised rates so the federal fund rates that's the interest rate is now in a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent so the FED Powell raised it by another half a percent that was basically as expected the market anticipated that and so um this is lower than the previous increases the last couple of raises have been by point seven five percent and this was half a percent instead and if you look at kind of the the predict like the markets the prediction markets the the target rate right now is people are thinking the Market's thinking the rate's going to be about five percent in 2023. uh so we might get one or two more hikes that are expected in that range and by 2024 the market is saying the rates will drop down to 4.1 percent so that is what the average person thinks and so I think there's like two questions here um the first question is has inflation peaked all right has inflation peaked what's your take on that do you think we've inflation's Peak do you think CPI is kind of over and um you know the intervention by the FED a combination of relaxation of the supply chain issues that that we are facing uh over the past two years are kind of over and so we've hit the peak and it we're going to be fine from here what do you think so if you want to go back to that chart that you were just showing that shows the inflation chart uh the inflation peaked in June 9.1 percent September 8.2 October 7.7 November this month 7.1 so clearly we are in a downtrend and while it's totally possible that it just reverses and keeps on going up in a way that we don't like that is on the menu but uh it is worth noting that the more that we progress forward in time the more the interest rates that the FED has increased in recent uh in the 2022 starts to take effect when you raise interest rates as the FED that takes time to Ripple out it takes time for the effects of having to pay back money at a faster rate reaches the margins as it reaches the all of the economy so the CPI is a lagging indicators exactly exactly and so the FED has been raising rates all throughout the year and so there are the last one two three times instances that the FED has raised interest rates that has not shown up in the CPI print yet and so there are many instances of the fattestra rates that has not shown up that how it will continue to have an increased effect on inflation so I think it's one of those questions are we are we peaked have we peaked the longer that it goes on where we are not going up obviously I mean this is a really really simple way bankless analysis here exactly the more that it's not going up the more likely it is that it is peaked and we are in almost like I mean June we're in December now so we have a November print like we almost have six months in a row of decreasing inflation so I mean it's looking better it's looking pretty good yeah well and then also just like there's been a longer time if but when there's been any news about uh the Russian invasion there's been I haven't seen much about Supply chains like the global macro news cycle at least seems to be like quelling uh for like six ish months in a row now so like we're trending in an acceptable Direction well this professor at University of Michigan over econ Justin wolford's agrees with you he says this in his tweet core CPI Rose by only zero point two percent in November which is yet another positive disinflationary surprise headline CPI Rose only 0.1 percent in the month also below expectations this is remarkably good news he says for the second month in a row inflation has clearly peaked inflation has clearly peaked so much so that brings us to kind of the next question of analysis is when when can the FED stop raising it's a question right and we have politicians saying that they should stop now that they've already gone too far uh this is a tweet from Elizabeth Warren saying the Federal Reserves chair Powell has just announced another extreme interest rate hike while forecasting higher unemployment I've been warning that chair Powell's fed would throw millions of Americans out of work and I fear he's already on the path to doing so I'm not sure what Elizabeth Warren's response to inflation would be do we just let it run but that aside there's clearly some posturing some pressure to not let these interest rate hikes trigger a recession that would also be a bad thing and politicians are increasing the pressure so maybe that is um a reason this political pressure for the FED to uh to reverse course and change course earlier I'm just kind of triggered that Elizabeth Warren is trying to tweet at the Federal Reserve to influence monetary policy like Elizabeth Warren is a politician not an economist uh our friend Kyla if you scroll down Ryan I'm pretty sure has the most liked tweet in response to this prayer she responds to Elizabeth Warren and says this is an incredibly irresponsible thing to tweet which I agree with like let's not politic can we stop politicizing our monetary policy uh that is bad uh but I don't think we can David is to answer your question I think no and it's interesting you said uh trying to influence the the FED one observation I have we might get into this a little bit later with some other politicians tweets is uh you said the word influence I think all politicians are influencers now I mean this is like a look uh we know the game we see it in crypto Twitter all the time this is a clout chasing type tweet you're not necessarily wanting the FED to actually stop it's not that you actually think it's a good idea you're kind of trying to collect the clout you're just being a populist there's an element of that certainly and that is the game that they're playing now Powell the game that he's playing is he is still saying that there is a ways to go he's not responding this political pressure so uh continues to plan to increase interest rates this is a quote from him we still have some ways to go he told a press conference that was on Wednesday uh I wouldn't see us considering rate Cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to two percent in a sustain way restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time restrictive policy stands for for some time not going to stop till we hit two percent where are we David seven percent there's a Delta there um other people are saying hey two percent pow what's so bad about three percent we can live with that in a post covet era and that is the slippery slope he kind of um I guess finds himself in in this type of uh in this type of climate uh yeah I think I think that I think that's right and I think there was a big conversation around uh the s p in the stock market we're also seeing this in the crypto markets as well where we got the the lower than expected inflation and markets markets rallied that's when ether got all the way up to the high high price of 1330. uh and Bitcoin jumped as well uh the stock market jumped and then everything came right back down to where it was uh and so and then that bummed people out it's like yo I thought this was good news like why didn't we sustain this rally uh and the conversations I've heard around this are all about well it's hard to sustain rallies when interest rates are high and so like okay maybe we're not going to dump but like having uh going up in price sustainably requires flows of buy pressure into these assets into these risk-on assets and like okay we got this good news we got this dopamine hit but sustaining a rally when interest rates are as high as they are at four and a half percent and like that's a bigger ask and so some people have I mean it's they're not turning bearish but it's hard to be optimistic when we can't sustain a rally because of you know there's still yeah there's still some work to and especially when it's still uncertain like we don't really know you know okay so here's an interesting stat a year ago at this time if you're trying to predict what the fed's going to do next the The Fed themselves predicted in December 2021 when asked what the FED fed funds rate would be at the end of 2022. so a year ago they were projecting the end of 2022. uh do you know what their projection said David tell me they thought we would be at 0.9 that's fomc projections do you know what their their forecast for inflation was the beginning of last year the end of last year two percent yeah exactly what their target was 2.6 percent actually it's been it's 7.1 percent um today so look um I don't know it's just also clear to me that uh you you can't always believe what the FED is projecting they're just like yeah yeah they're just extrapolating the existing data of what they want to happen uh always um anyway that's that's what's happening in macro right now what's happening in the uh the housing market though David yeah well it's still a macro conversation there's an article out of Zero Hedge uh here that caught my eye which the headline was nine million Millennials moved back at home in with their parents this year uh and I think uh during covid a lot of innovation a lot of Millennials you know got out of their parents home and to go like do stuff uh and then the FED jacks up the interest rates and we're seeing nine million Millennials moving back home I think that about there was a poll inside of the article that was like all right why did you move it and it was all because of the economy it was like job insecurity wanting to save money can't afford rent uh I mean Millennials they they finally got out of their parents home from like the 2008 crash and now like hey Mom Dad I'm coming back on the backs of that there's also this uh chart I saw uh on Twitter this week about uh Rising share of companies with debt servicing costs that are higher than profits and of course when you increase interest rates if you have debt you have to pay that debt back higher because the interest rates are going up therefore there's a lot of companies out there that have debts that and as the interest rates go up and up and up a higher and higher share of them are making less profit than they have available to send to pay back their debts to service their own debts right now Ryan we are at almost 20 percent of companies inside of the United States with debt servicing costs that are higher than profits wow that seems like a large number you can't sustain that forever yeah right I mean High interest rates are the zombie killer that is like the stake through the head right so I guess that has to work its way for the system no that's not the right metaphor create the zombies they create them but then they also like kill the I guess the zombies can't be killed is the thing oh yeah the zombie yes one you you go from being a human to a zombie because of interest rates I think I'm just seeing a world where all of these firms like they become they're not even reanimated corpses they're just dead they're just gone well yeah so that's when unemployment they like people lay people off unemployment goes up uh that's when this this goes from uh Rising interest rates and a bear Market to Rising interest rates and uh depression yep uh and deflation careful careful I'm not ready for that sorry recession recession okay we'll stick with that um give us some crypto takes though okay on to crypto take so so this is now about the uh asset prices of ether and BTC versus some of the uh Darlings that were of the second half of the bull market the second half of 2020 uh 2021. this is a take from Van Spencer uh looking back through the fog of war the data points that are revealed today uncover the pieces of the puzzle from last year if FTX was selling client eth and BTC to buy Solana ftt serum this has large implications about what organic Ethan bitcoin price action would have looked like and so this is the conversation that's been going on it's like oh billions of inflows billions of Bitcoin and ether inflows into FTX into Sam bakeman free slush fund where did they go they put a significant amount of those inflows probably went into the Sam coins Solana FTD serum remember when Sam tutored it out sell me all your soul at three dollars and then F off well probably why he was so confident in that is because he was taking customer deposits and buying all of his bags with them and so there's a broader conversation at the current the industry is currently having as to how legitimate some of the price action was in these highly illiquid alt layer 1 Sam coins Solana ftt serum and that has second order effects like why are things like Aptoide and sui have insane billion dollar valuations well they rode on the backs of the evaluations that Solana got and so because Solana's price action was absolutely insane it created the alt layer 1 investment like VC coin investment Mania to try and ride on the backs of that so van Spencer is saying this whole the whole second half of the 2021 bull market was fraudulent because it was propped up by this like illicit illegal fraudulent buying pressure of a customer in inflows of Bitcoin and ether into FTX and then Sam Bateman free just popping them up and so his second tweet is saying that the absence of a fraudulent seller of Bitcoin and eth on the order of tens of billions of dollars the additional absent fraudulent buyer of Solana again on the order books of tens of billions of dollars implies very different things about these ecosystems going forward and he ties this thing off and says the alt layer one thesis of yesteryear was essentially an intellectual framework built around the first mover Solana whose initial price of P appreciation appears to be driven by Sam bigman Freed's fraud in my opinion this is extremely damaging to the narrative that any alt layer 1 price action was organic oof what what a damn autopsy of the second half of 2021 uh I look I think there's Merit to this I um the the run-up of alt later ones all of them uh against eth and Bitcoin did not make sense to me at the time it was very confusing and retrospectively if people like Sam well Sam in particular was actually using depositors funds Ethan Bitcoin and using those funds to actually sell those assets and exchange them for Solana and some other sand coins which he was using as collateral by the way so he had to do that like where did he get such a massive line of collateral well he had collateralized ftt and collateralized soul to to borrow a ton yeah I mean the price charts now they make more sense to me because like you could see definitely some demand for these ecosystems but it felt inorganic the entire time and so France in our most recent podcast with Vance a few months ago he called the the 2021 bull market the first half the high conviction rally and the second half the low conviction rally and so Vance already his intuition was already like there's a difference here there's a difference in these moments I just also want to call attention to people who have um been right for a long time and um Advanced Spencer is one of those people to me like he kind of is starting to fit in a Chris berninsky camp for me of like oh these are voices I I actually will listen to you why because they're they've they're proven over time and they've been right enough times and so this is a signal that um that I often called I think you could be right here coming up next in the show SPF got arrested it's such a great day turns out his 4D chess was just him playing checkers ladies and gentlemen we got him uh and after we'll cover all of that we're going to talk about the run on binance or nah we'll get to some of the details how much Bitcoin and how much stable coins are actually outflowing out of binance we got the numbers and of course Sam Bateman treats the last insult to the industry secretly buying a cherished media Organization no not bankless um and and just really kicking us on his way out uh so all of that and more right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless arbitrim1 is pioneering the world

is in jail how's that make you feel well I was surprised actually because what doesn't make sense to me David is the whole like Aw Shucks IG I didn't know anything about the speaking tour that he's been on Good Morning America and I was like what does this guy know that we don't so you have some kind of a get out of jail free card does he have some sort of bulletproof armor we don't know and so I was surprised I'm not sure that much more makes sense um surprise but also like relieved like cool you know uh you actually can't escape from accountability after stealing 10 billion of you know dollars of money no matter who you pay off um so it made me feel kind of good to actually see uh some accountability here how about you is that why you're wearing your SpongeBob uh sweater celebratory yeah I mean I mean like it's like I've been saying you got to be happy and optimistic even though we're at the bottom because we're at the bottom uh and so when somebody like SBF gets arrested it's like man we are turning a new page uh the seller that sold all of our tokens is in jail the seller is in jail uh so that makes me happy that's something worth being happy about like look at that guy just getting escorted into a car by a bunch of Bahamian uh policemen that's where he was arrested in the Bahamas yeah this is uh footage yeah crazy that like he did look how many people they sent yeah they sent they sent a lot of policemen what did they expect I mean this this is like uh almost a dozen yeah at least in this one shot yeah from from what we can tell uh and so okay so so here's what happened uh the Bahamian Regulators the Bahamian authorities release a statement on December 12th the Office of the Attorney General of the Bahamas is announcing the arrest by the Royal Bahamas police force of SBF of FTX spf's arrests followed the receipt a formal notification from the United States that has filed criminal charges against SPF and is likely to request his extradition so the United States has filed charges against Sam and as a result of that they have not yet requested his extradition but you could only assume and so because that he is being charged by the United States uh the bahaman police arrested him okay so he's arrested he's in jail in the Bahamas yet to be extradited um is there like bail does he have the ability to make bail has he tried that I mean I know he has only a hundred thousand in his account uh allegedly but um what's that looking like uh yeah no bail for Mr SBF if he wanted to flee to a country that didn't have an extradition treaty with the United States that window has officially closed uh and so he will uh officially be judged inside the United States uh by a court um unlike by the way Pharaoh's Capital who is in a country with no uh with no extradition treaty so SBF has been charged with wire fraud wire fraud conspiracy see Securities fraud Securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering that's a lot that's a lot of things that's a lot of things so if you are interested uh if you are tallying up the years for if he is guilty for all of those things if you try it becomes guilty for all of those things that is life that's life in prison if he Max charge all right Max right it's like something like 120 years or something like this yeah yeah so not not life in prison but 120 years uh so the rest of his life yeah that of course is Max charges which is hardly ever happens yet guilty for those look there's some discussion around this and I don't I don't know uh in one of the conspiracy theories when he was arrested uh like the night he was arrested was that well he was supposed to appear in Congress the very next day so maybe this was some kind of block from him appearing in Congress he was going to testify in in a in a hearing but he that was voluntary is there any substance to that do you think that there's still some Shenanigans going on with like oh this is the way to get him out out of testifying in front of us that does that take doesn't make any sense it's like the worst thing now he has to like swear under oath in a court of law about what happened rather than a willing like and yeah volunteer testimony like whatever that take didn't make sense to me there's another take which is like oh clearly Caroline ratted him out yeah and has some sort of plea bargain now that that makes more sense to me but I have no evidence that that's true she was seen in New York blocks away from the Attorney General's office um Starbucks yeah and so then and then then crypto Twitter deduced that that particular Starbucks or some bakery or whatever um eight blocks away from like the Attorney General's office they're like yeah picking up a croissant and routing out her business partner I mean remember like one at least one of these people is a complete psychopath uh and so at least probably at least and so uh and so when it comes time to not go to jail somebody is going to like person there's dilemma come on like we we know we know what this is already that makes perfect sense to me and remind people Caroline was the CEO of Alameda right exactly CEO of Alameda yeah uh allegedly uh sbf's short-term girlfriend and also fellow Adderall consumer not only is he being put in jail and under charge for the financial crimes he listed but the cftc has a bone to pick with him too it's all kind of co-releasing on the same day another set of charges from the Commodities Futures and trading commission what is this yeah they are suing Sand Bay print freed ftxtrading ftx.com and Alameda research against the cftc uh for all for Commodities fraud yeah so uh sdny is also suing uh Sam bakeman free they had their indictment that was just unsealed the morning after they arrested him charging Sam with four counts of wire fraud two accounts of Commodities fraud One account of money laundering and one count of campaign Finance violation wow probably more than that so eight total counts uh yeah that guy is going to jail did you know Ryan that uh in apparently in the FTX inner circles on Signal there was a group chat uh called that they had titled wire fraud and they were using it to send secret information about operations in the lead up to the company's spectacular wait a group chat between uh Sam Sam and a bunch of others it's called wire fraud as a haha funny joke exactly yes they just titled it which is probably where they did the wire fraud I mean that's going to be obviously presented in court it's like okay so here's the take it's just it really was a whole bunch of children David it was like here's there's a lot of some speculation that turned out not to be true one one piece of speculation so far anyways was that this guy's gonna get away with it completely because he paid off the politicians and he bought the media institutions and he bribed everyone and so he'll never go to jail right that was one take well my thought was just like we should wait a little bit we've waited a little bit and now here he is in jail so that doesn't seem to be playing out the other take was that SBF with his media tour he's playing some kind of 4D chess where he's trying to Garner public support he's trying to like uh gain sympathy and this is why he went on Good Morning America and did that like Bloomberg he showed up in a you know uh Wall Street Journal CNBC interview like the week after all of these things it just wasn't making sense so people were like he's playing 4D chess David I think we can say at this point this man was not playing 4D chest he is a child he is a kid he got in way over his head he had no idea what he was doing and and now he's in jail and that is the like the conclusion of that in my opinion I can't believe it though that um we let a child manage billions of of uh like of crypto's capital like we gave him all of these PR like I don't mean you and I but like the industry writ large we gave this child access to our private Keys what a massive mistake that turned out to be yeah oops uh well lesson learned uh and at least my faith in society and Justice is restored at least we are not as Society totally completely corrupt although all of the like it's very sketchy uh terrible investigative journalism that was done by mainstream media I think we could go back and cast another eye on why the hell that happened but at least our justice system was not duped by this fraud uh which is the important thing that is important as well and so there are some hearings going on uh on Capitol Hill as well should we tune into this one from representative Tom emmer who's been on the bankless podcast before yeah let's let's hear what Tom emmer has to say uh in Mr Ray I appreciate you mentioning uh your concerns in the beginning of my question about the concentration of power in a small group of individuals with no oversight that is the exact problem that open and permissionless Technology like crypto and blockchain solve it solves for the problems of centralization you stated in your testimony that you've never seen such a quote utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever close quote FTX had disastrous or even non-existent systems for accounting audit cash management cyber security Human Resources risk management and other unacceptable management practices that currently make your job to uncover the facts quite difficult fortunately the immutable characteristics of public blockchains that some people would care not to understand in this committee allowed the crypto Community to reveal Sam bankman Freed's fraud and the on-chain public record will assist law enforcement moving forward I encourage my colleagues to understand Sam bankman Freed's con for what it is a failure of centralization a failure of business ethics and a crime it is not a failure of technology I worked across the aisle since I came to Congress so the future of crypto reflects American values the same way the internet does today for the most engaged members of Congress on crypto policy the FTX collapse remind us of why we care so deeply about this technology decentralization is the point Thank You There we go my God that's how I am decentralization is the point I'm pretty sure I remember a few of us tweeting that out during the middle of the bull market well he's paying attention I mean guys remember Tom emmer has been on the podcast we've had this conversation with him and this is this is him on Capitol Hill talking about it that was um the the former former CEO of FTX was that John John Ray yeah who is kind of the witness on the stand there all right Dave this is Tom emmer again this time on the SEC you ready for this club oh my God it's so good we know that uh chair Gensler had more meetings with FTX than anyone else in the crypto industry we understand that what was being negotiated was a framework for digital asset exchange registration and token registration with the SEC that would benefit both parties it would expand the sec's jurisdiction in exchange for the sec's preferential treatment of FTX over other industry participants we understand there was a lot of activity to move this idea forward including the circulation of draft short form disclosures that would enable filers to get tokens listed on this newly formed bespoke exchange Mr Ray I know you're handicapped with the information you currently have obtained but chair Gensler refuses to answer our questions or testify before this committee will you commit to sharing with this committee any any internal documents you come across regarding communication between FTX and Mr Gensler or others at the SEC we'll fully cooperate you know with the committee and the regulatory authorities with respect to our investigation again specifically I just want copies that this committee will want copies of those Communications to the extent they exist we can certainly work with your staff to get you a job oh God what a what a hero God damn but man is that so damning of Gary Gensler a quid pro quo agreement with FTX to hand over the keys of crypto to the SEC in exchange for preferential treatment and the ability for Sam to make his Sam coins all of his like all of his like portfolio basically the thumbs up from Gary ginsler wow that does that's not a good look that is uh What uh I think if I was a lawyer around I would call that a bad fact that sounds like a bad fact we'll see as the evidence comes out but um if the evidence comes out and that proves to be the case that is very damning I think for the SEC and Gensler in this case um this is a clip from Kevin O'Leary testifying the Senate hearing and uh I think you've called this David this clip might be actually the worst take of the year one of the worst things I've heard this year should we play this Hall Mountain sorry that is a if this is Ryan the worst sake of the year there's been a lot of bad takes this year so let's let the listeners decide why do you believe FDX failed I have an opinion I don't have the records here it is these two behemoths that own the unregulated market together and grow these incredible businesses in terms of growth and one puts the other out of business intentionally now maybe there's nothing wrong with that maybe there's nothing wrong with Love and War but Finance is a massive unregulated Global Monopoly now they put FTX out of business no they did not bro no they did not what uh look binance who knows what binance was doing but if SBF and FDX actually had the funds that they claimed to have if they weren't playing around with depositors money a run on the bank wouldn't have been successful how are you blaming that on binance and CZ I don't understand that take David CZ was like he wasn't The Whistleblower but you don't blame the guy who expresses public criticism that accidentally tipped over a massive House of Cards the crazy thing is is Kevin O'Leary was paid 15 million dollars to be a public spokesperson AKA Paige schill for FTX Mr O'Leary I am going to inform you that FTX is not an institution anymore and SPF is in jail and you do not have to continue to fulfill your contract as the paid spokesperson you can stop that can be clawed back as well like you have no incentive to give it back you know why you're trying to ruin your reputation in front of all of America in front of the U.S Senate by saying these ludicrous things absolutely insane David but let's all just take some like let's all take some personal accountability no one for Sam bankman freed to steal depositors funds right no one forced him to do that that wasn't like some competitor playing dirty games this is all Sam let's all Sam and and probably a few others who definitely enabled him to really wrap this up uh I want to bring up this tweet from Anthony cesano who tweeted out SBF down suzu Kyle Davies and dokwon are hopefully next uh I think this is the year of hopefully the the Reckoning right like scammers infiltrated our industry in the last bull market uh suzu and Kyle Davies definitely committed fraud uh dokwon I mean algorithmic stablecoin he didn't know he definitely kind of knew but like man like let's get these people charged and in jail please we live in a society yeah uh crypto definitely has to take out the trash a little bit and we have to have a purge um we have to be introspective about how this happened uh David on his way out his parting gift and I hope this is the last thing he leaves us it turned out we found out last Friday that SPF secretly funded the crypto news site the block media institution the way he did that was uh pretty shady do you want to explain yeah so the the news here is that the CEO of the block Michael McCaffrey resigned after failing to disclose 43 million dollars of loans from FTX to the block these loans were apparently kept secret from the employees as McAfee was the only member on the board of the block uh one 16 million dollar Bachelor funding from Alameda was used in part to finance the purchasing of an apartment in the Bahamas one of those Bahamian real estates for the block CEO Mike McAfee uh he has again since stepped down uh Morin the chief I think uh Revenue officer finance officer of the block has taken over McAfee's role as CEO and will look to restructure the block to buy out McAfee's stake in the company this is was crazy to me Ryan the the company the block isn't profitable and I previously raised over four million dollars to support the company it's Revenue mostly from ads and subscriptions is expected to be about 20 million dollars this year a source code told axio who we are reporting with right now um and uh so a couple quotes from people that worked at the Block Mike never asked me or anyone in research to cover FTX or SPF in any particular way or anyone else for that matter we had a complete discretion in our job so this is Larry Cermak out of the block who's who's gen very well respected in in the cryptospheres uh additionally another editor-in-chief Sarah coppet said I'm proud of the work our journalists have done especially covering the follow-up of the xpx implosion and then um continues in saying in my time Mike has never had any undue influence on The Newsroom we've always been completely independent uh Frank chaparro who as head of news at the Block I believe also has some public statements basically SBF secretly bought the block uh and did a deal with the CEO bought him a uh and then the employees of the block uh said that they all no one knew any of this um yeah that's the news yeah that's the news I do feel bad I know there are people of integrity at the Block I feel bad for them I'm sure they were caught by surprise by this and that has to be absolutely devastating so um I mean that's terrible it's bad for the industry I mean what was Sam planning to do with this crypto media institution that he kind of Shadow owned through shell companies and through bribes through the block CEO you know it was for a purpose you know there had to be some return on that investment in the form of good press because that's what he was up to in traditional media and to see that corruption take take hold in crypto media you know it's it was when I heard about this David I was like it it almost brought me down to those November lows when I was like just really upset about this whole thing because for so long we've been talking about hey uh traditional media is not covering crypto the way it needs to become let's go crypto media crypto media that's an answer to this and um you know that's that's the flag that bankless is carrying and like Defiance and uh blockworks and some others uh and then here we are have one of the crypto media Publications just have you know corruption uh from from the inside out and um yeah it's uh it's very unfortunate I hope they get over this I hope the good people at the block are are able to kind of Forge past this and and rebuild um but uh yeah it's it's pretty unfortunate yeah yeah quite I I do know that like Larry Stephen Frank they all uh I've always thought that they were upstanding individuals on net the some of the conversations in the space were are like yes uh they're they're great investigative journalists they're great at being impartial but on net like the block the people at the block all did seem to this these are not my words SIM for Sam and the SPF coins and like Mike dudas former owner of the block big Solana Bowl so there's like alignment with that now like kind of axis the Sam coins FTX axis that like even though they appeared to be very like uh forthcoming and um uh impartial ethical they also were like in that axis of of crypto that was aligned with Sam and so there's like we don't know anything it's hard to know it's very hard to know yeah and who knew what like it's kind of crazy like people like people know about like the financials of a company like how where did they think the money came from like why were any I don't know I'm just has I I just don't know that's the thing no like I will say one thing that um David my my kind of Circle of trust has definitely contracted uh in crypto from what it used to be like I I mean crypto has always had this thing is like um verify don't trust right and I've always kind of lived by that but like as you get to know people as you kind of meet these institutions you start to trust more and more people that that Circle of trust has like definitely decreased I'm not here lately for me personally and uh yeah so I don't know we'll just have to let long-term reputation speak for themselves and and that'll be the true test it's the Lindy effect um so the block CEO has resigned all right what else we got um we've got binance binance the binance bank run okay so the justice department Ryan has turned their eyes over to binance and apparently are weighing uh the charges against binance and its Executives whether or not they should charge them with stuff and has this precipitated a bank run because these charges are going in the press and so people are like uh oh uh binance is the next to to fall and so they're starting like massive withdrawals from binance uh perhaps yeah so U.S department continuing to weigh up charges against crypto exchange a giant binance for possible money laundering and criminal sanctions violations according to Reuters uh and so as a result of this and I mean see I don't know if you've been following CZ lately doing a lot of the whole like main character thing uh and so as a result of that there have been uh all-time high outflows of uh out of binance here's a Nick Carter who also tweeted out I'm not the Arbiter of proof of reserves or anything but I also find binance's proof of reserves a bit questionable writing an article soon uh and so there was an article out about uh binance's proof of reserves uh and the headline of this article is binance's alleged crypto audit failed not even its auditor would vouch for it and the subtitles binance as an audit shows proof of reserves of customer funds but its auditor will not vouch for the reserves nor the methodology demanded by binance so this has you know people they're very recent memory about the insolvency of exchange and so as a result of this there is the largest outflows out of binance 40 000 Bitcoin has flowed out of binance in the last 24 hours uh this week or so and then but also Ryan important to note that the remaining balance on binance is 580 000 Bitcoins so 40 000 outflows not that crazy uh 200 to 2.2 billion dollars of stable coins flew uh outflowed out of binance the remaining balance is 20 billion so while there are all-time highs of stablecoin outflows there are 20 billion dollars of stable coins reportedly left in binance and so like it's uh people are doing the whole Bank list thing which is great uh but I mean the if this is a run on the bank it's a pretty weak one well like if it first of all if it's a run on the bank and uh binance has all of the deposits nothing to worry about there's no such thing as a run on the bank because it's fully reserved you only have to worry about running the banks when it's a fractional system and finance says they're not fractional but can you trust them can you trust any Bank what we say is if crypto been now your keys not your coin use an exchange then get out that's how you should be using these crypto exchanges but then when you zoom out and this is um this is Nick Carter's tweet again this this is a background at binance that you're all hyperventilating about like look at the numbers here it's kind of like barely a blip it's a blip yeah there's not really a binance bank run that's kind of the thing it's like kind of overplayed like just Bitcoin reserves are down but they're down to like May levels David it's it's Finance preserves are almost at all time you can't even July numbers maybe I don't know I mean this is not really a thing I think it's uh much to do about nothing but like so far anyway but look I that's the thing do we know that those are the reserves we don't actually know are those that on chain data I don't know if that's on-chain data or not um yeah I like don't know for sure but so can you trust binance I mean go bankless uh can you trust any crypto exchange just just go bankless use these exchanges for for what don't ask the question just withdraw yeah just just go bankless uh but also I do feel like there's some scrutiny here that is maybe just like you know the the nation state eye of Sauron saying oh we missed FDX better not miss these guys and what oh they're they're a foreign company they don't have public financials they're non-us U.S uh they must be Shady don't like them uh and so maybe there's some of that reaction going on too so it's hard to know at this stage but we'll see hard to know all right well that was all of the SPF exchange drama all that stuff that's over coming up next metamask lands a huge partnership we'll talk about that uh and there is a lawsuit Ryan I don't know if you caught this this week a lawsuit against basically every celebrity who owns a board ape it's not looking good and then we cut the three arrows Capital Redemption Arc but it's coming to an end I'm having none of it and of course Donald Trump launches an nft collection so I'm sure the listener is going to stay tuned for all of that right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help us go bankless sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for your users sequence is a smart wallet and it's the easiest most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the web 3 world multi-change support nft display and users can buy sfts nfts and crypto directly with a credit or debit card for developers sequence is the Plug and Play platform for web 3 games and apps their apis let you bring nfts sfts and tokens into your game or application in a sequence relayer enables gasless transactions for your users sequence already Powers some of the best web3 games like skyweaver nft projects like cool cats and marketplaces like Nifty Swap and sequence is compatible with all the evm chains including ethereum polygon binance smart chain arbitrum optimism and Avalanche so go to sequence.xyz banklist to start building or speak with a sequence team today if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel element environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network biggest news of the week here David in my opinion it's optimistic news this is metamask tweeting out our us users will now be able to fund their wallet with eth via who PayPal PayPal rolling out in the US in the next few weeks PayPal plus metamask a combination I didn't think would happen to like 2025 or Beyond it's now available so you can get eth in your metamask wallet is that what this means that's exactly what this means and so I'm just loving how direct this flow of funds is so PayPal which hooks into your bank account and then hooks into your metamask address and doesn't have to be your metamask address it can be your Ledger inside of metamask so you can go from bank account to your Ledger via the partnership between metamask and PayPal the previous metamask onboarding like on-ramps have been like a crypto natives like Moon pay like wire uh I mean it's hard to beat PayPal uh I've always been frustrated by like how small that pipeline is from funds into through metamask credit card fees inside of metamask for like 2.5 it's expensive and that pipe was super constricted now with a PayPal partnership inside of metamask that flow of is just way bigger yeah and look you can skip you can skip the FTX in the middle you don't even have to like you just go from your bank directly to madamasco that's a great thing for Fiat on rampant to defy um David this is cool too it was officially decided kind of the eth governance world that eip4844 which is proto-dink sharding which just to remind you scales layer twos on ethereum absolutely massively what is this like a 10x gain or is this like 10x game is like the floor it's really it can be as high as 100x depending on how 10 to 100 x gain and so it was decided that eip4844 will be included in ethereum that's official now that's not the next ethereum hard Fork right I think the next hard Fork is probably still just going to be withdrawals yes which is good we need that but this could be a hard for coming this year that we get eip4844 I think more work needs to be done so there's no official timeline yet but that's the possibility there's well there's never any official timeline because that's true that's that's how we live our lives in ethereum but it is uh Liam who's privy to these conversations Liam horn at optimism he says it will be in a fast follow hard Fork after Shanghai so no specific dates but the roadmap is a fast follow uh yes as Gandalf says a wizard is never late exactly he drives precisely on time so does ethereum uh updates what's this David oh yeah just more more Layer Two stuff optimism has all-time high-end transactions yet again oh God that is just great they're the layer twos have been a bull market a transactional bull market ever since their existence did you know is anyone talking about it Magnus is talking about it yes uh arbitrum and optimism when you add their transactions together you almost get an equivalent amount of transaction volume as the ethereum main chain itself uh and that is just those two layer twos when you add in the rest of them all the the network of layer twos on top of ethereum you Auto you automatically you you definitely get Beyond ethereum layer one in transactional volume layer twos are just absolutely crushing it there's always a bullet Market somewhere like I like to say yes uh vitalik said something similar to in our conversation with him about bullishness on Layer Two is it's coming out Monday David you were really excited about uh this this Phi application Nation what is Phi yeah so Phi underscore XYZ on Twitter or Phi land uh is announcing that they mainnet is here uh so what is Phi it is like an evolution on d-gen score so what is Degen score you would load up your wallet it would give you a number which would like give you a resume it's like how Dion are you like what what did you go like what food Farms did you wipe into like is like a resume like how how much did you do on ethereum I remember I think talking to Van Spencer actually he was like yeah somebody some applicant came into uh framework offices and applied for a job and he showed us like a decent score of like four lower is better by the way that means you're the fourth most DJ in person on ethereum and we hired him instantly anyways so if you're on chain resume people it's yeah it's an on-chain resume okay so Phi is a digital landscape it's like an eight by eight grid but but I'm sure you can make it bigger and because of what your ethereum address has done uh that you load up into Phi you can uh claim little units of land uh and so because I've traded on uniform up I have a little uniswap trophy because I've traded a lot on uniswap I have a big Chad uniswap trophy do you really can I see yours yeah uh okay so you can see the one that I have at David hoffman.eath I'm not showing the one that is on my secret wallet is it awesome it's awesome it's awesome yeah I know you really want to show that though yeah I know and so like the the gas truck on the bottom right the two by one guy this is yours this is my web free traffic yeah so I've used optimism I've used uniswap some of these are free just to populate the land um that gas truck on the bottom right I got by spending more than one ethon gas uh the uh open that's not something to be proud of David that's a waste you're wasting your eth you're spending it you should be saving it sorry brother uh I forgot to buy the nfcs the uh the Open Sea uh the ship in the top left I got that one for buying like I think five nfts on open this is awesome it's right so it's a place of the way to visually showcase your on-chain activity it's like you're on train footprint this is cool and these are look like chess pieces here these are just apps those are actual call actually called chess pieces yeah they're called chess pieces this is awesome uh so how did you get this like bank vault uh that one's a freebie that one's just a free to populate your land yeah that's that's the highest one is that like a dog on top of this building this is really fun yeah it's super cute uh the the designer yeah if you're if people are familiar with the nouns ecosystem uh one of the same artists behind noun style uh and so it was like one of the first times like I've had fun on ethereum in a really long time and this also plays into one of the things that we're talking about with vitalik on the show is like identity this is an identity application yeah this is what identity looks like there's a separated from the social security number yeah exactly yeah this is my identity so it's cool no customer deposits no yield just like a playing on a fun little cute little landscape I thought it was pretty fun that's pretty cool we have a disclosure here too don't we David yes we do have a disclosure both Ryan and I are investors in Phi uh and so yeah proud investor you know that is a great app nice job it's really cool uh what about this D5 Central Bank that's what they call maker Dow these days not quite a central bank uh whatever they relaunched their one percent fixed yield for die holders people are like just one percent I'm like one percent but like you know what more do you want all the eight percent yield we had was gone it's gone in the smoke that's pretty darn expensive from a risk return perspective uh this is back to Old Times I guess um that I used to have an interest rate now it does again yeah and it's also important that that one percent is not being paid for by somebody else that is being paid for by the Protocol no Ponzi no Ponzi yes back to fundamentals you gotta love it is that why it's only one percent so yes because it's sustainable yeah so long-term uh defy ethereum veterans will remember the die savings rate which got turned off uh as soon as interest rates in inside of crypto uh went to zero do you remember how juicy that baby was back in 2018 yeah it was it was like seven or eight percent yeah because yeah the dye was trading below a peg for so long is it traded down to like 94 cents or something anyways the die savings rate is back you can get a uh a risk-free one percent and when I say risk-free I mean no counterparty risk there's other risks out there like smart contractors protocol risk but uh in the same way that each staking is risk-free uh maker Dallas die savings rate is also risk-free and that die savings rate is up to one percent anyways moving on uh tweet out of sazzle that I thought was really really cool it was talking about the you know how interest rates are turning over Ryan like starting to Peak uh daily ofac compliant blocks are also turning over uh and so I was told that would go to 100 percent and never yeah right yeah well we're so the non-ofac compliant blocks are on the up and Sasol puts out uh his little uh analysis as to why that's the case and it's because of so many so many of the things that just made me not really worry about censorship in the first place botch open sourcing their relay and Builder infrastructure more non-censoring relayers coming online relayers accepting submissions from external Builders uh and then also people using flashbot's new innovation Min bid uh to like ofak compliance has never been a real thing in ethereum do you know who's not worried about ofac compliance at all in ethereum uh Justin Drake oh yeah how do I know that bankless Bulls episode with Justin drank Drake Anthony sassano and DC investor that comes out the 26th let me tell you guys it's bullish it's very so if you thought we were gonna quit recording and putting a podcast during the holidays you thought wrong I'm totally getting more bullish thankless don't stop uh David big news here all right news of course on Truth social uh.com this is a Donald Trump official announcement that he is getting into the nft market uh good time to get in I think when the Market's down David but he is rolling up uh Trump digital trading card collection yeah Trump cards collect your Trump cards here for the low low price of 99 per card uh God this could buy it buy it by a credit card this is this is so perfectly built for Trump's base this uh looks very very um sweepstakes bonuses uh it yeah it's you got it all here I actually if I if I saw this if somebody sent me this like NFS website it's like hey should I buy this nft I'd be like yeah this is a scam bro um to each their own uh is there he's pulling some some of the Leafs out of garyvee's book so if you there are certain nfts that you could buy uh Miami dinner with Donald Trump spend a memorable evening in Miami for an exclusive dinner hosted by Trump uh or you could get the Mar-A-Lago cocktail hour which is an nft of trump in a spacesuit experience and meet and greet with Trump in his luxurious private Palm Beach Resort play golf with Trump and your friends join Donald on the green for an exclusive one hour of golf with your two closest friends wow wow I want the nft that that makes it so he doesn't run for president again I don't think that NFC exists I just love how all of these nfts like most of them says have Donald Trump in an extremely heroic outfit and pose this is influencer nft world do you know okay so um this is deployed because I've read the FAQs on what is it which chain is it which polygon polygon I got the Trump nfts uh you know I'm just surprised it took Trump so long uh honestly like yeah he feels he would kind of feel like late to the game but you know teach their own benefits are here uh you can buy them of course he did not get the digital collectible memo he is still branding these things as nfts he did not really the Rebrand yeah he forgot to Rebrand he Trump still bullish nfts Yeah question mark I don't know uh all right we got this this is a story you want to dig into celebrity promoters sued overboard ape nft endorsements what is going on here so we I we were always suspicious that these celebrities weren't intrinsically bullish on board Apes uh it was much more likely that they were given a board ape and then they were able to talk about it in pop culture turns out it gets even more shady than that very much more shady so this particular suit named Jimmy Fallon Gwyneth Paltrow Justin Bieber Madonna Kevin Hart Stephen Curry Snoop Dogg Serena Williams post Malone the weekend and Fallon's production company electric hot dog and Universal TV those are the defendants this is what who is being named in the suit and claims that most of them were recruited by talent manager guy osiri who spearheaded a scheme with yoga labs to discreetly pay them for their endorsements through crypto firm moonpay so guy osiri he's a talent manager in Hollywood talent manager for like all many of the people I just listed also Madonna and you too I know Siri is allegedly linked to several of the credit celebrity promoters through their early investments in moonpay so by increasing the demand for board Apes yaw clubs nfts and yoga Labs ape coin crypto token the suit alleges that they also increase demand for Moon pay so there was just this incestuous network of yoga Labs Moon pay and all of these celebrities like hey Moon pay we're gonna give celebrities board apes and then we're also going to do that through your payment services and so we're going to pay celebrities for that through moonpay to induce demand for Moon pay we'll talk about Moon pay and so quote from this article oh Siri the moon paid defendants and the promoted defendants each shared strong motive to use their influence to artificially create demand for the Yuga Securities which in turn would increase use of moon Pace crypto waves security they're calling them Securities yeah like the nfts are securities yes yes exactly yeah well you collabs is being being I'm I'm on board with that one like it's kind of hard to argue that they're not nfts you're on board with wait you're on board with board Apes being Securities David because well it's kind of hard to defend that they're not when they have the whole entire board ecosystem and the board ape is like an ownership stake over the board a metaverse yeah it doesn't look good I wouldn't want to be the lawyer having to I understand the like the ownership property but like how how can an end like why is why is a board Abe different than an axi for because because you're a collectible like a sword like you know genzler wants to make everything a security right David yes it's because like the uh Yuga Labs is making this board ape ecosystem this board ape universe and so it's very claimable that as Yuka Labs a centralized party uh the efforts of this centralized party is going to increase the value of a board ape bet whether or not they can execute on making the board a metaverse or not that is kind of a security but Gary would make that claim about eth too and he would call that a security before then we get into the nature of client teams like client teams are different than yoga Labs I don't know I I think this one is I again all I'm saying is I would not want to be the lawyer who has a defend it that's not true anyways I want to go back to the story uh and so uh at the same time oh Siri could use moonpay to obscure how he paid his off his celebrity cohorts for their direct or off-label promotions of the Yuga Financial products uh in an episode of the Time Tonight Show on November 11th 2021 Fallon promoted moonpay and the board ape nft collection by announcing that he got his first nft through the crypto firm which builds itself as a white glove service designed to help celebrities Buy digital assets he did not disclose that he had a financial stake in moonpay to me that's the big piece honestly is the disclosure is you have to disclose right promotions are one thing but like you have to separate what's a promotion and what's not and when you're paid and what's not I think that's the first thing whether this thing's a security or not that's a bridge too far that's not that's not what that's not personally that's not what the story is uh look at the net effect of this what were the brands of board Apes like the board ape Community holders like why do I have this like anti-board ape resistance it's because the board apes are known to like lose their private keys and get fished all the time because they're normies uh and so if we the sorry to all the proud board apolders that's kind of the brand of a board a polder and so all of these celebrities are promoting board Apes to like their like you know mainstream normally isn't that what we want like mainstream adoption that's what we want though David I mean yeah but not through not through secret paid chills not through that 100 guarantee and so like it onboarded a cohort of people who weren't ready to go bankless and then they paid a ton of money for their board apes and then they got fished because they like the the connections between the novice nature of board ape holders and the fact that there was a ton of celebrity endorsements that connection is really strong for me um yeah it's interesting I I I'll have to let this one sit but um I do I the thing that is very clear to me is there needs to be a complete transparency around what is provided as Promotional and and what's not it very much seemed like when I watched the Fallon show that like Fallon was like I'm bullish nfts and I've been bored a pilled and I bought this thing and like if there was some knowledge or disclosure that there was a payment for that that it was actually a sponsorship right then I'm Bola sportier sponsored by board Apes yeah exactly um that's the thing that sticks out to me speaking of promotion bankless nfts are here so we've been going through the Genesis collection uh we originally minted uh the SBF versus Eric Voorhees episode and then we did the crypto Renaissance and then last week we did the ownership economy with Legion uh and so there's five Genesis collections three of them have been released they have all sold out inside of four block and the fourth of fifth is going live today this is bankless at promoting our own nfts so disclaimer disclaimer

more bad boys to tie off before Boys Bad Boys SPF thing is over so where are Kyle Davies and suzu hanging out these days I think I need a membership to look at this but vaporized 1 trillion was the title in the uh in the New Yorker I believe New York Magazine rather um where are Kyle Davies and suzu hanging out David uh they're probably I think in Dubai they're in Dubai okay so some of some of the parts of this article I think are entertaining I will say and so uh and so I'll read off parts of this uh parts of this uh this article uh her as in her the boat uh would-be captains showed off pictures of the 50 million vessels at parties bragging that it would be quote bigger than all the richest billionaires in Singapore and described plans to Adorn the staterooms with projector screens creating a waterborne gallery for their growing collection of digital art in the form of nfts wow is that not the most toppy top signal of all time this super yacht was the largest by well-established boat builder San Lorenzo ever sold in Asia a Triumph of crypto nouveau's reach I don't know nouveau that's like the new Rich cool uh sick it represents the beginning of a fascinating Journey uh the name of the buyers had in mind was cleverly chosen an inside joke nodding to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin that would both thrill their social media acolytes and would be intelligible to all the pathetic poor no corners out there the name of the boat of course much WoW uh that's actually not a crypto meme that's just the normal doge meme but yeah I don't think I've opted it yep uh okay last paragraph her buyers again heard about suzu and Kyle Davies two and over graduates who ran a singapore-based hedge fund called fiero's Capital never got the chance to spray champagne across much Wow's bow instead in July the same month the boat was set to launch the duo filed for bankruptcy and disappeared before making their final payment marooning the unclaimed trophy in her breath in LA cespia on the Italian coast and I want to just pull out two quotes from an article that suzu and Kyle AV said because they Ryan were if you have been watching them on Twitter we're trying to go through some sort of redemption Arc with SPF as soon as SPF was was uh you know being dragged through the coals on crypto Twitter suzu and Kyle Davies came out of hiding on Twitter and started also trying to drag SPF through the coals uh and then crypto Twitter was absolutely having none of it it's like wait no you guys are criminals too we haven't forgotten yeah we know who you are for months guys and so two quotes that they have tweeted both tweeted out uh or put into an article um it's a long story but we were scammed just like you guys that is a quote from suzu and then also Kyle Davies we understand that FTX hunted our positions taking absolutely no responsibility whatsoever saying it was Sam we just got screwed just like you guys we're just a bunch of normies just like you guys who got axed by SPF absolutely insane absolutely insane uh this is Nick Carter's take uh calling uh suzu and Kyle Davies carbon copies of FTX yeah uh because that's exactly excuse me of SBF uh because what what were they doing they are refusing to talk to Liquidators but also doing a press Tour on crypto Twitter trying to like report like carbon copies of SPF mini SPF well SPF is in jail so I don't know what the what the next destination is um does seem like dokwan is in Serbia right now so not in uh in South Korea I he every time I've seen him tweet I haven't looked in a while but the past few months he said it's like I'm fine I'm right here like you know if the authorities want to come talk to me I'm right here I'm just in my house uh reports that are he he is in Serbia um that's like the country that's harder to extradite from I'm sure if you're in South Korea yes yes in in Serbia which you know kind of formerly a gulag so it's not like a nice place to be uh also wanted by Interpol wow well there we go this is bad boys on the run something else that floated by my desk this week was a bill by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Marshall this is a republican Democrat combos probably the most significant attack on digital Freedom I've ever seen uh one of the things this bill does it's anti-crypto Bill it turns validators into Money Services business I'll have to be AML kyc'd register and all the states registry with all of the different places you need to register financially it completely outright David bans Financial privacy so you know that whole tornado cash thing it's like if you on-chain privacy mixers all of it it's explicitly named uh no can do by the way they get the level of detail right here like look at this in this um money service they're talking about Mev Searchers they use that term in the draft bill validators other independent Network participants that's a 400 level term totally I mean they probably Listen to bankless In order to like craft a bill like this um and what this does is it turns American to a full-on surveillance state so my comment here in the Tweet was this is how Western democracies die I really feel strongly that if we Institute this type of Bill like we're goners we're going the way of like other surveillance uh countries authoritarian countries like the way of China that sort of thing now what's interesting about this kind of Bill is because like I'm not in Capitol Hill does this bill actually have a chance and I think that's where the second order analysis really really comes into this uh and so you know we tweeted about it back and forth including inviting Elizabeth Warren on the backless podcast and by the way uh anyone from Elizabeth's office you guys are listening right now we'd love to talk to Senator Warren about this bill and about crypto we're not shadowy super coders like this is David in a subway photo um this guy does not look like a criminal to me um well like we're friendly we're happy to have a debate our conversation anything else you'd like the question to Jake travinsky is is this bill like really a thing or uh like what is this um and he says no it has no chance whatsoever on Capitol Hill um he he says and I quote this is sort of her thing talking to Elizabeth Warren exploding exploiting unrelated news to make headlines with crypto Crackdown bills each one more extreme than the last one to keep the outrage machine humming for example earlier this year Russia invades Ukraine let's ban ban crypto so that's the thing I mean like crypto the thing that put body armor on Ukrainian citizens yeah at first at some level I felt like I needed to respond to this right we need to take a stand and just like but at another level it's kind of playing into her game which is interesting it's like turning our politicians have turned into influencer Chasers haven't they fortunately this bill accordion Jake does not have a chance whatsoever so it's not a real threat but this kind of posturing uh is I think a threat uh anyway don't have to be worried about this bill specifically but we have to be ever Vigilant I think against these sorts of things I have no idea why AI Senator would think this is a good idea or is uh at all why it would have anything to do with American values um but yeah that's the take yeah I wonder how many just wasted man hours went into producing this bill so Elizabeth Warren could just wave it around but I don't really want to explore that question anymore well let's explore some races this week if they raised 15 million dollars uh block native is one of those I guess not many researchers it provides the data to met Searchers uh block native is like the pre-chain layer the mempool infrastructure if you're an Mev Searcher or block Builder you would probably tap into uh block native still getting funded another thing miss Warren wants to uh Senator Warren wants to ban which is on chain privacy what's this David yeah Aztec raises a hundred million dollars to build an encrypted ethereum so uh Aztec is like a private layer too is a ZK ZK roll up that is two layers of ZK to allow you to have scale and privacy and so it's like a VPN you put your money in Aztec and then ask that goes and yield Farm on the layer one on your behalf so it's like a private VPN for ethereum do you know really cool do you know a way to describe this as encrypted ethereum as another way to describe this uh and uh disclaimer both uh block native and Aztec Ryan and I are investors in yeah we're excited also jobs guys it's our weekly time to remind you that there are still jobs in crypto it's a great place to be during the build Market Alchemy is hiring a back-end engineer uniswap is hiring a senior front-end engineer a diagram Ventures needs an associate uh for crypto Venture creation rabbit hole needs business Ops and strategy lead diagram needs a senior principal again for crypto Venture creation maker Dow is hiring legal counsel you guys can find all of that the bankless.palot.com job site David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got some hot takes out of crypto Twitter which are nice and hot this week and then Ryan and I got what we are bullish on moving forward into 2020 2023 and then two memes of the week I think two weeks double two memes of the week this week because right after we talked to some of these Fantastic Tools to help you go bankless from our sponsors trufi is d5's largest credit protocol connecting Global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities trufi has completed over 1.7 billion dollars in originations

uh take of the week here's one for me you want to read it out David yeah Ryan Sean Adams says defy has proof of reserves built in perhaps we should try that what a crazy thought what a crazy thought look the uh the way out the way forward has been in front of us the whole time it's like defy hasn't been tried and found failing it's been like not tried totally we have the answer it's called D5 this is proof of reserves built in right uh and so pretty bullish that we'll be able to rebuild on that kind of a foundation moving forward here's a take from Vance Spencer David read it out yeah Vance Spencer says I really feel like there's a lot of innovation happening in D5 right now uh and then he follows and says people are asking for examples so he gives them payment for odor odor flow protocols that's uh something like Mev stuff Mev stuff yes manifold finances what he might be referring to there liquid staking hockey stick growth nft royalty experimentation regionalized slash virtualized defy ecosystems low latency use cases and better front ends and wallets and so these are the things that Vance has identified as getting a bunch of development right now I'm super excited about the better front ends and wallets coming I think that's going to make onboarding a lot easier account abstraction smart contract wallets please please please I want 100 um what about this take from Fubar saying crypto ux is too complicated in sarcasm quotes I think and he's got a picture of what uh you know where you place in your credit card so name on card credit card number CCV code expiration date billing zip but that's not raw all right if you continue there's a also uh more uh creating a wallet is confusion confusing well here is the treasury direct to spin up an account with the treasury I guess uh it is like tax ID number email address bank account and routing number password password reminder personalized image caption security questions uh and then here's I think a Bloomberg terminal with a quote no one cares enough to learn learn etherscan look at this image and tell me that that just image makes sense to you like get the hell out of here that's ridiculous and so I think uh the part message is that yes crypto ux is confusing because you haven't used it before as soon as you use it it becomes super intuitive yeah do you know I I remember a couple years ago when I was talking to like the 18 year old um founders of InStep uh you know who grew up in India and they were basically like do you know what we don't understand is like Banks and traditional Financial Services you know what's super easy crypto crypto metamask defy and just growing up with these things uh yeah I don't think banking ux is better no it's awful I mean crypto ux is terrible sign in with ethereum click a button hit improve and pay done right this is going to get a lot better over the next few years as well I'm gonna wish on that 100 uh this is a take from me uh Ryan you want to read it yeah the last cycle is drawing to a close David says the dawn of the next cycle is upon us wow that sounds very uh epic I feel like I want to charge into battle with you after this where are we going where's the battle David what do you mean well I mean I think you can take this one at face value SBF is in jail three hours capital is on the Run do Quan is in Serbia like yields are at zero I mean like there's not much left to do like the contagion is got to be you mean we've taken out the trash I'm taking out the trash yeah and and and we are identifying bullish sectors again optimism arbitrum all-time high transaction volume still got the ZK uh EVMS and stock where and all this stuff uh uh some things are up and to the right well the other things that are down and to the right are coming to a conclusion I think that I'm declaring January 2023 will be the time where we can look forward and consider us in a new cycle the beginning of the new cycle yeah new cycle so it was a super cycle all along huh it was it was not a super cycle it was always a super cycle for building though wasn't it yeah can we say that always a builder cycle yeah all right man so what do you bullish on yeah and so looking at our notes I think you and I were both impacted by this vitalik podcast that we recently recorded um and I'm bullish on adults structure an agency and so these were some of the themes that I think came out of my head while we were talking to David spillash on responsibility responsibility yeah like one of the big themes of italic has was like yeah like it's crypto small enough where people can impart agency upon it you listener can change the direction of crypto and that is one of the reasons why I got into this space personally in the first place was that crypto was small enough and I had enough ideas that I could help shape and direct crypto and we need more clearly out of 2022 more good adults who can build stable foundations and stable structures and believe in themselves to tilt this industry for good one of the big quotes that's always impacted me out of Chris bernisky was that the plasticity of crypto the window of plasticity of crypto is not infinite there will be a time where we can't really change this industry in a direction that is good for us all and and so I'm bullish Ryan on people that are responsible that are actually building something for the other in parts of this industry to latch onto and I mean I think I think we have done a bang-up job building Bank lists and so Ryan I'm bullish on Bank lists because we have so many goddamn plans in 2023 they're you're starting to tease them out uh launch the acquisition of earnify uh bankless Collectibles a new website coming soon there's other things that are on the Hawaiian Horizon cough cough nft uh and so there's a bunch of cool stuff that we are trying to do because God damn it we want to build structures for other people to also leverage and use and so uh bankless media is going great I'm excited to do this more into the future I love by the way that the guy in the SpongeBob sweaters is telling me how bullish he is on adults and responsibility it's just perfect and I will say I'm not in jail so I get to say that okay that's fair fair uh and look man if you were in jail we'd still be doing this podcast some somehow I'd find a way I'd I'd visit you and we'd you know if I was in jail I would hope that it wasn't for a reason to uh it would be because the the you know the US has gone pretty bad to just you know like it would be something like this um look but man you stole mine mine was agency too yeah I'm bullish on that you know uh instead of that maybe I'll maybe I'll say something else kind of riffing off of what you said which is um what a way to impact the world I don't know if I give off like a like a politician Vibe sometimes or something maybe it's the glasses but um I can't tell you the amount of people have said are you like when so when are you gonna get into politics are you going to do something in politics and I'm like I'm in politics yeah like this is political this crypto movement is is political and it's a movement where it's small enough and it's early enough uh and it's important enough that we can have a massive impact politically and this is like a much pure manifestation of my values than at least in the US you got to pick Republican or Democrat I'm like no thanks I'll pick like um anti-authoritarian I'll pick that where's the party that like I'll do that thing personal agency yeah adjectives like those things I'll do that but that's not represented in a party guess what these values are represented in crypto and this is why I think I'm super bullish entering 2023 that the riffraff is gone right like not all of them I mean like uh Justin's son still hanging out here somewhere I think Richard Hart's like just lurking like they're not all gone but there's been a lessening of them and uh that feels really good because it allows the adults the people who um care about these values to keep building the system that we've been building this entire time and for it not to our work to get crowded out by the noisy ones uh so look agency is is mine too and um impact I think maybe that's the other word I would add to this phrase and I think this is Alpha because at the end of the 2018 bear Market the destruction that was 2018 you saw structures starting to get created uniswot V1 came out in like uh February of 2019 maker Dow died the the original die savings rate came out in 2018 is like and so now there's still plenty of structure left over D5 is still holding up just great and now there's more structure to latch onto come settle and build your structure in this space and be a simple one going from there and just settle in be a settler uh right here we go memes of the week we got two this is great David what are we looking at uh describe the template this is the the wojak meme where things just get worse and worse and worse so you have like kind of the bleary-eyed it would be like Scrappy beard uh whoa Jack starts bad he's asking how much how how much worse can it get and we've got uh Alex machinski flexing his banks are not your friends sure like totally right great shirt uh and it's like oh oh God uh and then the next one it's like even more wiry here even more blursed eyes and again the question is how much worse can it get you then you got suzu and Kyle Davies and then it just continues like uh an insane looking woe Jack how much worse can it get you got Sam Bateman freed followed by dcg and Gary Silber and then the block really just Rises home and at this point you are just watching some like ring version of Woe Jack and it's how much worse can you get and it's the blocks the block almost dragged me down again to the depths of sadness of November what crypto me didn't last but like yeah that was like you know that was rough crazy easy um yeah that's uh that's a sad meme but also tells a story how about this meme actually this is not a meme this is a real this is the front page of the New York Post uh it's a picture of SPF what's the caption here uh SPF with his uh you know his Heritage is all over the place big big bold letters Harry Potter Harry Potter nice you're a ghost all right uh let's let's fade this out I'll do disclaimers but we got a pretty fresh meme that we uh sorry oh my God right we have the best Moment of Zen you have ever heard it is a full length song it is great uh I think that if you are hearing
