hey bankless Nation welcome to another episode of state of the nation we're talking today about scaling ethereum with the polygon ZK evm that was just announced today David couldn't make it for this episode so I am solo with Mahalo and Jordy from the polygon ZK evm project really excited to dive into this conversation a few things we're talking about of course as we said before this is ZK evm season we had ZK sync on Friday today the polygon ZK evm is now out so we talk about it as we get into this episode we're about to discuss what just dropped today so what you can use today then we discussed ZK Roll-Ups versus optimistic Roll-Ups which ones are better and for what purposes we also discussed what happens to the polygon proof of stake chain we discussed the New Frontiers and opportunities that this unlocks and of course we talk about the future of thematic token one disclosure before we get in I am an advisor with the polygon project been supportive of this project for a long time and excited to see what they're doing doing here okay guys we're gonna get right to the episode with polygon but before we do I want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible including Kraken bankless's number one recommended crypto exchange for 2023. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last 12 years dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto Kraken puts an emphasis on security transparency and client support which is why over 9 million clients have come to love kraken's products whether you're a beginner or a pro the Kraken ux is simple intuitive and frictionless making the kraken app a great place for all to

nfters out there the brand new Kraken nft beta platform gives you the best nft trade experience possible Rarity rankings no gas fees and the ability to buy an nft straight with cash does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does and if not sign up with Kraken kraken.com bankless how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another drop the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide your uglies burn the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February bankless Nation I'm super excited to introduce you yet again to mahalo who is the co-founder of polygon and also Geordie who is the technical lead for polygon Hermes otherwise known as the polygon ZK evm Jordi Mahalo how you guys doing today very good you guys just dropped something big we got some news let's start there what just happened the polygon ZK evm what just hit us I'm gonna hand it over to Jordy first because he's the one who's created this amazing technology so let him start and maybe I can add something well uh many is um it's a milestone so this is a milestone for scaling ethereum that's what's uh happening so uh if we go two years ago scaling ethereum was uh I mean nobody so nobody knew how to do it actually it was two years ago after a Blog from vitalik that people started realize how to do that and then we started with more labs and started talking about uh optimistic relapse ZK relapse especially in the CK that we started to build uh I mean only payments for labs but that the the Big Challenge here was to do a zig ABM so when ethereum compatible so something that works exactly the same that ethereum but scales okay which is what means the scaling ethereum and here is where the challenge started and well we started that two years ago uh not even two years ago and it has been uh I mean a long trip in in it's a short trip maybe in time but it's a long trip in in in in in Engineering in in going deep and solving problems and in in figuring out how to to do this how to bring this technology practice practical and today is I mean this is it's not the end of the road it's a milestone but just putting this putting this technology creating the system and making it uh available in the real system in in mainnet this is really it's really an important it's really an important achievement and this is what's happening I mean this is what's happening today and this is why we believe this is an important moment for the the for the ethereum community so this is an important moment for ethereum because we've been on the quest uh in crypto to basically scale our trustless technology to scale ethereum for the past what eight years I mean since the Inception since ethereum's birthday it's been a long time and before that we were even trying to scale Bitcoin and now uh we've come this far we've got this new technology called ZK technology we've built an evm around it so we we can have ZK layer twos that are programmable and what just launched as I understand it is the polygon ZK evm and when you guys say launched do you mean on mainnet is this available for users Mahalo what just launched this morning what can people go do right now yes it's a great question and it's important to state that this is an actual mainnet right so we have been running ZK VM on testnet for months already with very good results we learned a lot we have more than I believe 7 000 applications and smart contracts deployed thousands of transactions and thousands of users have already tried testnet with test assets right we are now hitting the mainnet it's the actual mainnet and we are fulfilling I would say or ticking all the checkbox that you would normally expect from from a full-blown Main and so these are real world real actual assets breached from layer one uh the ckvm is full featured we have multiple external and internal audits uh prover is running all code is visible and uh with the permissive uh open source license so basically it's a full featured complete full-blown minute I would say uh it's important to State and Georgia connect to that this is the main ad Beta And this is a very very complex bleeding edge technology for us it it's very important in this moment we are incredibly excited and Incredibly proud that we have been able to ship this uh this bleeding technology and as you probably know and as many people familiar with the matter know that estimates her that it's gonna take three to five years probably to ship this technology and even then it was uncertain whether it's going to be practical uh what will be the computational requirements will we need data centers to run write this Proverbs how everything will turn out uh we are very very excited and very happy that we have full feature mainnet with very very practical prover we have been running prover the whole test net basically is running the prover is running on regular AWS instances that are costing us I believe around two dollars per hour so this is really really practical technology and we're very happy about all of this but all that being said we really want to advise caution uh uh to users of the main and this is bleeding edge technology this has never been shipped polygon is the first one to put this into production now very excited about it but users should be mindful when bridging especially larger amounts of of assets to mainnet so that's something that is very important for us to communicate every code every complex code needs some time to mature and this technology will certainly need some months to become you know really battle tested and proven so yeah I want to definitely emphasize that guys and we'll have a time to discuss sort of security but when Mahalo says bleeding edge bleeding means you can get cut right and so um you know be cautious as we enter here we'll talk about security the status now and where you want to evolve that to and how it becomes safer in that that trajectory um but before we do let's talk about a user and what they can experience on polygons eke evm right now and just to refresh people Mahalo is absolutely right I you know been the space like couple we've been talking about the uh the Holy Grail of the ZK evm for a while so we have some ZK technology that allows us to do sort of simple transaction based kind of back and forth Bitcoin type of things um but we haven't had the technology previously to create a general purpose uh evm which is the programmability that ethereum brings to the market and now we have that and that's ahead of schedule I want to emphasize that I mean two years ago like the crypto world was saying I don't know this is five years away it can't even be done is it 10 years away and now we're here so that's why this is so Monumental but let's get back to kind of the users for a second our analogy at bankless for a new Layer Two that opens is we got a theme park everyone's online at the theme park the gate's open you can go start to use the rides now right now they may be dangerous rides you might have a roller coaster that kind of you know is tossing people off people getting getting jostled around a little bit all right so there's some danger but tell us about the rides what can people do when they um you know enter the gates of the theme park today do I just go and I set my metamask you know RPC to uh polygons EK evm and then I can start using apps what what are the apps like what's the user experience like is this just like the polygon proof of stake uh network uh can you tell us about that first mahalo yeah very happy to answer that the great thing about dkv I mean why let's just take a little one step back and explain why uh ZK VM has been considered the Holy Grail scaling because it is a technology that simultaneously offers three very very important features one is scalability the second one is security so we get to increase throughput significantly without sacrificing security full-blown uh leverage the security of ethereum and the third very important component or feature is evm compatibility or equivalence if you will uh the third component actually makes uh things incredibly easy for developers and users ethereum evm is the standard for web free programming right and uh it's already a mature ecosystem there are wallets like metamask developer tools Like Remix hard hat solidity is already a pretty mature language and all of that so there's this whole ecosystem that has been built around the VM ZK VM uh one fantastic thing about it is that it's completely leveraging all these tools and this whole experience and develop both developers and users simply continue to use these networks in the same manner like they use ethereum so developers just simply take that their existing solidity contracts they can deploy them on zkvm using the same tools Like Remix like hard hat they're basically no differences for developers and for end users end users simply connect their metamask they submit transactions in the same manner like they would do on ethereum it's absolutely the same developer and user experience with the comparable level of security and with much lower fees and much higher scalability so yeah all in all we're very very excited and we believe this is a very important Milestone what would you add to that Jordy yeah to highlight to that because this is very important it's not so we are not man so we are using exactly the same tuning that means that they are not maintaining a parallel version of to work in our system or a parallel version of metamask or a map parallel version of solidity compiler is so we are using the solidity the ethereum solidity compiler we are using the heart we are using whatever tooling that that you have and we are using that tool we are not maintaining any of those tools those tools are maintained but by the third parties okay and this is what what defines the AVM you know it's like because we are uh executing the evm is ethereum virtual machine okay and this is the what's the the ethereum so it's ethereum virtual machine okay and this is so we are being fully compatible with this uh with this by call and this is what allows to uh use any of this tooling so any of the systems of ethereum smart contract you don't need to compile again the smart contract you just take this smart contract and you deploy it there so it's like an extension of ethereum it's not a new thing it's extension of ethereum and this is I mean this Simplicity because like I remember that you can start the first time that I was doing a presentation about the zkvm I feel like but because I mean okay you just that you just connect to remix you just deploy some smart contracts everything I mean there was nothing new in there people know how to deploy smart contracts so where you see the difference but this this is the magic and this is a cool thing of this uh of this project is that the users don't notice a difference on deploying uh on ethereum or in a zigabia except of course on the price and in the on the throughput is it accurately is it accurate to say guys that everything that is available on the polygon proof of stake Network like all of the smart contracts all of the apps all of the things that you can do there you can fairly easily or maybe like perfectly easily uh Port those over to or duplicate those on the polygon ZK evm is that is that what we're talking about here yeah it's most of them are here they're I mean I need to be just to be very clear uh there are some uh we have mainly we have some pre-compiled smart contracts that are not implemented yet we are working on that and we are going to implement in the next version we are talking about paintings or we are talking about Shadow 56 or some extended so if your com if your smart contract is not using this uh you can just copy them I mean just deploy here deploy there the same way that you're you can deploy something import only on POS or you can deploy that in mainnet or you can deploy that thing worldly or in any other ethereum network you can deploy it in a ckvm here there is this exceptions of this drug compiled smart contracts they are not used very much most of them so I would say most applications would should not have any problem but we are working on that and we hope that in few months we can we can extend that so that every time we're going to be more more compatible on that so Jordan I mean can you guys underline this for me so um or for listeners rather so why would someone want to deploy on polygon ZK evm versus the polygon proof of stake Network why would an app want to be there why would a user want to be there is there a difference in terms of the underlying security guarantees can you highlight what that difference is and tell us about that mahalo yes of course so we have made this commitment a while ago that in polygon we will commit all our resources all available resources to push the frontier of innovation and to ship uh more reliable more performant and more secure technology and we always have known that polygon ps10 is not the end game right this is very Dynamic industry fast evolving industry and zkvm is the next generation of scaling technology that is more advanced more secure than polygon posj itself and that's the main motivation here uh why would someone want to want to migrate for example from polygon psj to to ZK VM someone might when we speak about mainnet people would want to migrate from maina to the KVM because they are there's higher throughput and there are lower fees without sacrificing security so um yeah all in all this is the next Generation uh Tech and we are not stopping here as Jordy said this is a very Monumental very important important Milestones but Milestone but we have very very exciting plans for the future as well this is not the still the end game but it's a very very important very big milestone so end game technology but we're not at the end game we're just at kind of you know chapter one of it um what happens to the polygon proof of stake chain so I think there's been some you know conversation on on Twitter for instance that hey when you know polygon ZK evm comes out maybe the polygon proof of stake chain kind of migrates to this technology I don't know if that's how you see it I know polygon has always seen itself as a a set of Technologies to scale ethereum whether it's using you know uh you know side chain type technology or whether it's using ZK type technology in Layer Two but um I mean obviously the polygon uh proof of stake chain has uh you know reached tremendous success and is one of the highest one of the most used chains in crypto what what happens to it what's the road map for the proof of stake chain is it now Legacy Tech mahalo yeah it's a great great very important question I would say certainly and be completely honest I would say polish polygon pH chain is a legacy Tech we always wanted it to be Legacy that can be new when we started then I don't know three or five years down the line we have to be embarrassed by that technology so to say if you're not embarrassed that means we haven't done our job well right this is again very Dynamic industry and we constantly want to push uh this Frontier of innovation and ship better technology that being said we are polygon pH 10 is not going away it's not becoming irrelevant there there is I believe strongly a clear need for both networks in the market so uh there are certain trade-offs that I'm gonna just explain very very briefly uh D5 applications might want to definitely deploy to ZK VM because ZK VM offers iron-clad security it's fully secured by ethereum submits since it's a roll-up it also submits user transactions to it here volume which gets stored there to ensure data availability of these transactions however zkvm is the throughput is limited by submitting because we're submitting these transactions to ethereum right that's always going to be uh the bottleneck so uh and always going to increase the costs of transactions because you have to pay ethereum guests to store these transaction data so ZK rollups will always have a little bit more limited throughput and a little bit higher transaction fees for D5 applications for example that doesn't really matter if you have a landing application for many of the applications if for example lending Market you take a loan and then you repay a loan six months down the line right so for you security is the priority there are there's a lot of economic value here in these applications so I will say ZK VM is the right choice for me it's highest possible level of security uh and I don't mind interest sections are a little bit more expensive when you have something on the other side the Spectrum like polygon POS chain where you have for example the free games with in-game assets which are on chain and they are not really uh highly valuable but these games have a lot of users and the frequent transactions they might say POS chain is still a very good uh choice for us because it offers much higher throughput much lower fees and that's perfectly fine for some of these use cases so I believe these two sets of uh trade-offs are features for these two networks will remain relevant for different types of uh applications that's how we see it and just basically because we can maybe just show a little bit of alpha there because you're always inviting us and we always uh yeah yeah yeah yeah if you have Alpha please please we are we are experimenting we did we cannot confirm or commit to anything formally yet but we are experimenting how we can leverage ZK technology given now that Jordan's team has shipped zkvm we you're exploring how we can potentially leverage ZK technology on the POS chain itself which will give it uh like renewed even more obvious relevance moving forward but we cannot share anything officially yet but we are actively exploring that as well it's very cool okay so just to go on what you said we have let's say maybe if you could give some order of magnitude estimates I understand like these are just estimates but like let's say transferring uh eth on Main net cost a dollar and um in a in a kind of a layer to you roll up like an optimistic roll up maybe it costs five cents or ten cents five to ten something like this okay um and then if we go to polygon proof of stake chain that's going to cost like far less than a fact like a fraction of a fraction of a penny right so very very inexpensive what are we looking at for uh ZK polygon ZK evm is that gonna still be in kind of like the layer two optimistic roll-up range as far as cost per transaction or is it going to even deliver an order of magnitude of lower cost versus that I don't know if any of you guys have estimates on on kind of the numbers here but this is how users feel it they're like okay it's going to cost me you know a dollar on mainnet 10 cents on a layer two how much is it going to cost me on polygon ZK evm currently currently we are about the same that overall apps I mean it's like one tenth of the cost of the three I mean depending on the transactions because for example that availability we need to pay the full the full price okay and depend on the transaction but it's going to be around one one tenth uh one fifth something between that so it's one order of magnitude uh at the beginning uh we are we have plans uh to go to improve the technology and with the current technology without doing anything we can uh increase one order one one order of magnitude just by compressing transactions and when eip4844 happens to ethereum with this would be at least a one dollar order of magnitude so here is like we have like three levels and of course a charting like probably another one okay so that's that's the the but we we see that at the level so if you see how ethereum it is we can scale easily two three orders of magnitude for sure in the coming in the coming years Jordy another question I think are in people's minds is um we have some experience with layer twos now right for the last 18 months or so I think arbitrim was the first uh Layer Two that um that deployed um it's an optimistic roll up which is different than a ZK roll-up optimistic roll-up versus ZK roll up what you guys are are providing is a ZK roll up a ZK evm fully programmable what are the benefits how like can you discuss kind of the the trade-offs or the benefits um why is Ezekiel in what ways is a ZK evm better than an optimistic roll up if that's even the right question to ask the the big difference here is the the the withdrawal the withdrawal time the withdrawal time in in in an optimistic lab you need to wait one week two weeks or three weeks uh just to do for this challenging game to happen and in uh in in the in the Z case this can go maybe I don't know go maybe to five minutes or just even few seconds okay so you can can be very very fast this is I mean you may think that this is okay if you are there it's why you need to live there okay and you can think but there is one thing that's interesting and is the the the the data connection when you want to come possibility between these these different networks so that one means when you have compost ability between the different networks is that you need to uh maybe just have different networks and and and and transfer phones from here to there and from there to here and and just work in different days that means that you are leaving the the layer two and going to another layer too so in uh roller this this you can do that really fast and and you can transfer and you can connect a lot of networks easily in a this is an optimistic well it's it's you cannot do that I mean you need to buy this challenging yes and the things get much more complex when you want to uh to play that this is some one of one of the advantage the other is of course the cost of capital I mean there is this game and the security is based on the quantity of capital that the mystery Roll-Ups have in there this what this has this cost of course in the in the program we have the the proving the proving cost but this is getting really low right now so it's like it's becoming very insignificant so uh for the rest they are very very much equivalent at the end they are Roll-Ups and and things there is for example there is another thing is in the compression in the compression with the zero knowledge you can we can we can we can compress much more that in uh an optimistic grow up so even the prices are gonna go lower uh on the feature so nature of course the gay rollouts they are coming later because you know the this developing District technology takes its time and and and needs to work but at the moment that where we are that we somehow we solve this technology when I'm saying solve I mean there is a lot of challenges spending yeah but it's like but we have to prove it now I would say that uh optimistic rollouts for me makes no much sense uh because at the end it's the same but you have this proof that you don't need to why to weak so it's it's that's the that's the thing that this allows you to do many much many more many more things and then this is why this is why Advocates of ZK evm have kind of pointed to these two advantages so I'll just kind of uh summarize and and highlight like Advantage One of a of a ZK ZK technology is you can dial it and optimize it far larger so even though you're set you're starting with this like you know it's it's five times cheaper ten times cheaper than ethereum mainnet um you're saying you can push the technology and push the compression push the cryptography to get transactions from like five cents to like fractions of a penny and you have more leeway to do that that compression than on an optimistic roll up and the second piece I think is important because you know people could see this in in at least the US banking system which you know as you know sucks hence the name bankless uh settlement times if I want to wire my money from One bank to another internationally could take three to five days like there's a settlement time attached to that a similar settlement time actually happens with an optimistic roll-up because rather than having it settle in kind of like the FED now or whatever Master central bank settlement engine underlies all of the banking systems you kind of have to settle this on ethereum mainnet right uh optimistic Roll-Ups that takes days right now because there's the fraud proof there's this uh you know crypto economic mechanism with ZK DK technology you're able to just take the shortcut and you can settle on mainnet in um you know minutes and then that becomes very important when we talk about chain to chain Layer Two to layer two types of of interactions and so that is kind of the network benefit that we're also excited about with CK EVMS the other thing I'm I'm kind of excited about is you guys are launching of course you know polygons not a new chain so you it's well it's well known polygon is well known for its Business Development and I'm just reading a list of things that you guys are launching with uh Phantom trust wallet D Bank rainbow wallet connect zerion these are some of the the partners that you're launching with uh which is also very exciting Mahalo maybe could speak to kind of the the ecosystem that polygon has fostered in general and how much of that will how much of that business development uh that polygon is so credited for will kind of bleed over and um get leveraged by this new polygon ZK evm yeah that's a great question absolutely uh um what we see first we'll see we're already seeing a huge level of organic interest for the KVM ZK and really the the bleeding edge technology I think in general there is consensus about that in the industry so first of all we're really seeing high high level of Interest people want to use this bleeding edge the most advanced technology that we have in the industry now that's number one number two polygon Labs as you as you rightly said is doing I believe great job in onboarding uh uh web 2 uh companies big Enterprises traditional companies from all Industries to to web free and I believe polygon Labs will continue to do that as well especially now when we have even more advanced uh technology the third thing that is important to to mention here is that these two networks especially because of these benefits the draw dimension of how convenient to is to interconnect these ZK secure chains We Believe very soon you will be able to observe polygon POS chain community and zkvm community and ecosystem as one single inter very very interconnected ecosystem practically like a single uh ecosystem and that is very very important uh one specific to to say specifically what I'm talking about is uh we have something that we called internet lxly Bridge which is a bridge that enables seamlessly uh seamless message exchange between two ZK secure networks and assuming we're able to leverage ZK security for polygon POS chain with Dell XL by Bridge these two networks practically become one network when it comes to moving assets information any sort of arbitrary messages tokens Etc is that the idea Mahalo of a layer three that people have talked about or is that sort of a something different what is great about this lxl Library implementation and Jordy maybe can chime a little bit more because it it transforms all these EK secure chains into a mesh it there is no anymore layer 2 layer 3 layer four layer 16. this bridge enables seamless connectivity between any networks that parties any two networks that participate within uh this this ecosystem so you can transfer from layer 2 to layer 16 back to layer one on ethereum or it doesn't really matter anymore it's like very is it basically layer one like so ethereum would be a layer one and then rather than layer two three four five and six layer two is just this mesh of all sorts of other layers and it's all kinds of economically secured in the same way so it's all a mesh of layer too basically basically and that's what we need ideally I think we cannot retrieve Mass adoption If These Chains live in some sort of isolation we need all this mesh of networks to become a single homogeneous us execution layer right that can support massive adoption well that is how the internet works so mesh networks are uh pretty important Jordy what would you add to that I mean for me it's funny uh people talking about layer 3 when we don't even have a layer two so let's let's build first let's look first a little too I think that with the ZK technology uh you don't need uh with a good GK technology you don't need that much the layer three and you can I mean this is what we're talking about we can build all these mesh of networks and all of that uh connecting with each other of course you can always build their threes and talk but it's for me it's like okay and layer 50. I I mean it's like let's build layer two layer two uh let's put some of these networks let's connect these networks together let's see how we transfer one each other and let's learn how all this thing will uh will work and and then we think about layer three uh but it's uh for me it's from the technical perspective it's okay it's like because layer twos are not good enough because maybe the proof is too expensive or maybe because you have these uh uh delay times that it makes and let's build the layer three so that we can bypass these limitations of the layer two and so on but we graph a very good player tour okay so we have an extremely good layer too so let's see what we can get I mean I don't want to discard uh layer 3 because it's perfectly possible but I think that the industry should focus in their tools well whatever the marketing folks decide to end up calling these things from a buzzword and narrative perspective right the the vision we're talking about is a layer two net mesh Network that is secured by ethereum which is super exciting guys we have a few more things to cover uh including how this ZK evm is different from some of the others that have come to Market and are coming to Market recently and also the risks we said we would get back to that so if you bridge what are the risks we need to conclude by talking about the Matic token of course but before we have all of those conversations we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized

EVMS that are coming to Market recently Mahalo what's the the competitive manage here what is the the secret Edge or have you approached this problem in the way that that other Solutions haven't yeah first of all I just want to say that we're very excited that we see multiple ZK VM uh projects in the in the ecosystem that's very useful for everyone primarily for ethereum and we're again we're very excited to see that we're also very excited and we strongly believe that Jordan's team have has found a very good balance between uh this evm equivalence and what it exactly uh uh what do we mean by it and practicalities of the network so there are different approaches here that maybe even Jordy can cover or I can cover but the point being is that we were able I I think to strike the great balance where we are fully really compatible with ethereum all the tools are working both developer tools and end user tools as we said solidity works out of the box there zero basically there's zero impact on developer and user experience and at the same time we delivered something it's not like we're one year far it's not like it's impractical it's not like you need a data Center you're just creating proofs today on a commodity Cloud instances right so I think it's more about the balance that we were able to strike and then some great engineering and cryptography breakthroughs that that our team has built uh has uh has achieved uh uh on this on this path and it has been really incredibly exciting being part of the process and observing the great energy and all these breakthroughs and and everything and I think when you just look at the facts polygon ckvm is the only one that is now on the mainnet with real world assets a full featured apart from pairings as Jordy said uh um it's uh the code is fully open source uh fully visible prover is running every transaction is being proven and verified on ethereum layer one so basically multiple load its both internal and external of all the components of the ZK we have including the prover including circuits so I would say all these important checkboxes that you would expect for a full-blown mainnet uh polymon Z KVM is uh is ticking them so uh yeah I think that's just as uh the state of the matter at the moment but I can leave to Jordy maybe if he wants to add some more yeah I'm curious what do you make of this the some people have called this the ZK evm Wars that that are going to to come of course you know um the benefit is of these wars is decentralization and ethereum certainly we all kind of benefit from this but what do you make of this what is the polygon competitive Advantage here yeah we're clinical Mountain I mean when you are cleaning a mountain and you start the community that's cleaning a mountain of course somebody there is people in the community that maybe you're probably in the marketing side I mean they want to fight but at the end we are yeah together I mean it's like before one we want we will want this technology becomes available to the society So it's talking about competition here is I mean there are different projects and when you but there is a challenge like that uh people from the general perspective there is different ways to approach the the the the the problem and uh they are not uh good or bad uh a priority you you start uh with something you see like there's you imagine how the system is and then you just go one way and other engineer is going to do a different way and even the starting points are not the same I mean sometimes when we started the project for example we we had some technology we remember we had some technology available okay other projects Maybe started before they started later and they didn't maybe they started without a given technology or they are starting later and they have a technology that that was not available putting respect to all the systems but said that is I mean there is a lot of difference a lot it's not one it's just different approach different ways different teams doing a different thing what I would recommend and here is maybe for the technical people you know if you are just if you don't care about the technical but would I recommend to the technical people it's just just for example go to the source code and try to deploy uh uh just talk to the player one just go to Gourley or or polygon POS or that's cheap I mean obviously I think it's even cheaper than word we I don't know that but it's like the thing but it's uh I mean just go to a network just try to I mean get the get the approver get the no get the synchronizer get the database and uh just go to all the different pieces uh they are valuable there you can compile there there you can see there you can see how they work and and the good thing is that it's you can use that and at least in our site or disabilities is too too foreign to give as much as we can to the to the community so we to take as much as we can and to give as much as we can and this is the spirit that we have and and the cool thing is that doing that uh if we do that between different projects we can learn a lot I'm sure I mean I'm sure that there are things that other projects that are doing better than us and we can learn and I'm sure that we are doing things that are better than others and they can learn and if we get in this Spirit of collaboration uh the full system will go much much much faster okay here we have a good example for example in terminal in polygon in polygon we have like we have three teams uh working like separately in three different projects okay but we have been collaborating a lot between these projects and this collaboration I would say that the the this result the result of this collaboration is that we could go much faster the fact that for example we are using the the proving system of uh polygon zero or we are using the Stars the same way that polygon Biden is using we are sharing the technology we're sharing the the things we are sharing the technology without barriers without any competition it's just okay I I explain you everything I know about this and you explain everything about now about that and this collaboration I think is the key of the succeed of the success of this project of the polygon we should be able to export this model to the fuel community because and and I personally believe that if we were together and if we were together means just working together in in sharing the the the knowledge on each other not competing but sharing that's the the way that we can go faster I agree with that uh it's it's you know crypto likes to be so tribal at times but ultimately guys it's um this for bankless listeners it's it's us against the banks it's decentralization versus centralization and The Benchmark on when whether we're successful or not is how long we have protected decentralized assets and how much has entered the system right it's kind of the Lindy effect of like time and also value that we have unlocked in the decentralized ecosystem and kind of that brings me to uh the risks which we talked about earlier okay so security is top of mind and this is The Benchmark ultimately for success for all ZK EVMS and I know Mahalo said this is bleeding edge Tech no one's done like people haven't done this before this is a first all right and there's some really uh like Moon math magic stuff that I'm not sure many people on the planet fully comprehend uh on how work like how it how it all works underneath uh like in the engine here and so my question to you is like what are the risks um is there the risk for instance that there is a hack that all assets transferred kind of go to zero like is that a real risk right now and what is polygon ZK evm doing to to mitigate those things yeah yeah yeah so yeah but so here is uh let's see first of all re zero is not but it's not about this is not even about polygon I mean you see it's it's on any system in the world okay so what you are trying to do and what we are trying to do and I think what we all the projects are trying to do is at least a serious projects is um spend invest as much as we can in security that means you just Audi it's internal audits back bounties uh code reviews between peers I mean that's whatever it's whatever formal you know testing former so whatever we can and whatever is in our hands uh uh we put there okay but we need to understand also that the security so if you don't take a risk certain risk as a at the given point the security is not going to evolve securities also get it get evolves when when you assume some risk so here measuring measuring how much risk you want to assume and so what are these probabilities uh this response in order to grow this is a little this is this is this is probably the one of the most difficult things in in the space okay because it's measuring this low risk is is difficult in our case I can explain you I can explain you the the the the the risk so who we are think about risk okay okay so here in in this KVM we distinguish between four kind of risks what we call Smart contracts risk what we call uh uh correctness risk what we call soundness risk and what we call uh uh stop rumor the progress stops okay smart contracts is like any other smart contract it's a smart contract and the smart contract can have bugs okay and the cool thing here is that the the the community you know after the launch of ethereum uh well still some bugs but you have a lot of knowledge and and there is a lot of auditing companies there are a lot of procedures and it's I mean it has been audited two times check it with the right code and the probability I would say that's relatively low but again if there is something wrong in the smart contract things can go bad but like any other like any other smart contract is not no difference here that any other smart contracts okay the other thing is the completeness this is probably the most critical part the completeness means that you are proving something that goes to a wrong state okay uh but but this is a determine is that is right from so you're you are this is in general is that imagine that you put a transaction and this transaction the result of this estate because how you program the state who knows that you have more money okay that would be really bad okay for this I'm again zero risk doesn't exist but I hear I'm quite confident on this uh on this uh on this uh mainly and this is thank you very much to uh ethereum and to the ethereum industry we we not only did the full audit the full audits but we're also passing all the uh ethereum deaths of the of the thalian test Suite so if we're passing I mean we can't guarantee that we are passing this ethereum seed so it should be once it could be something really weird uh for this uh to happen there Okay so all the things together this give us quite uh confident confidentiality here for this risk we are also uh at least at the beginning we want to disable that at some point but in this this beginning training weeks here we are running we want to run a kill switch okay uh well I mean multi C with many people kill switch we should remove that at some point but if we see some we are checking some uh you know some balances and we see some if we have some some some checks that if we see something that goes wrong we can still switch the network okay on this side but again this is I see here uh a relatively low probability okay uh the others are softness somnes is probably the most uh it's the most tricky one because it's the I mean it's not that you are doing the things okay is that you are checking that all the things are okay and it's very difficult it's very easy to forget some of the checks okay and and some Ness mistake in the previous is relatively easy to to do it and here we don't have to the community has not much experience here to auditing and to checking switching here here we did a huge effort again with uh Audits and and reviews and we correct a lot of these softness uh errors okay but here the the the the the cool thing is that in you know in the system the idea is that um if it's so necessary is detected by the smart contract and that means that if there are two proofs so if there are two proofs that uh if there are two proof that within with that coming from the same state and with the sentence actions they go to two different states and you are able to prove uh two things this is a song they serve and what we do is we just shoot down we just call the network and and go we go we go central line so we'll shut down the network and then and update should be done okay and the other protection is that at the beginning we are going to be the only prover that's running the system unless we stop doing the proof so there is a mechanism that if in five days we are not generating approved so anybody will be able to generate the proof but if we are running the proof and we are not going to prove something wrong okay so this is the other mechanism so that's why sowness even being more probable uh uh to happen in some some mistakes which is not good because I mean that would mean that it's a system is centralized but the risk is that the system is centralized not that there is not that the user will lose money I mean excuse me satellite will fix I get it Jordy and there are fallbacks for some of these cases uh of course and I think you've done a great job outlining kind of the risks of not just um not just the polygons EK evm but all evm technology and at some extent uh all layer twos one thing I'll say to you listeners is I remember there was a time when people said a program will blockchain would never work okay because it would have bugs smart contracts would never work and what happened there was a Dao event there was a re-entrancy type bug and everyone was saying haha you're like we were right uh smart contract blockchains programmable blockchains will never work and now look at us okay they do work we've got strong Lindy effects the issues um are have been dealt with and we get stronger and stronger over time I expect a similar trajectory not that there won't be bumps in the road there could be bumps in the road but we're talking about the long game here and uh look cryptography program blockchains can scale we've already seen that proven guys we got to be quick on the last question here but I want to know about the Matic token how is Matic involved in the polygon ZK evm what's it its role do you pay gas fees in Matic what's the relationship between Matic and ethereum and something like polygon ZK evm yeah so so a great question and great to close the the interview with that so first of all when it comes to guest fees we're using ether for guest fees that's what community prefers it makes user experience even better and we're using ether as the guest feed token in ZK VM itself that being said polygon's native token metic will have a critical role in the whole polygon ecosystem that we are establishing right now so currently we're starting with the centralized sequencer this delivering ZK VM itself was the Grand goal we just wanted to prove that it's possible and we're starting with a centralized sequencer uh improver like all other Roll-Ups in the ethereum ecosystem this uh Network needs to be decentralized and metic token will play a critical role in that decentralization of the network as well as in tying the whole polygon ecosystem we already touched up in this interview on this multitude of chains right we even have this concept of dedicated chains which are supernets poly on POS chain ZK VM all these networks will coexist in a very interconnected way and Metric will play a critical role in facilitating and securing that whole ecosystem we will be sharing I believe very exciting news in the next couple of months in our views and proposals how everything will fit together because that's what communities now wondering one question you already mentioned how polygon PS chain is relevant now after the KVM what about supernets how these all components that you're working on how they all come together and the token itself will play a critical role in our mind in connecting all these things together I mean we're very excited to to share with you and with the community in the following months everything that's been happening uh behind the scenes kind of well we will stay tuned for that guys I just want to say congrats on the launch this is a huge milestone big accomplishment um cheering you on I mean as advocates for decentralization and bankless money systems this technology apology is pivotal in our ability to scale it so well done on the launch fantastic news uh very exciting can we end with this then before I let you go what can listeners do to get started on polygon ZK evm is there a website they should go to how to how do I Bridge across from ethereum to the ZK evm if I feel so inclined yeah throw the led2 yeah yeah yeah it's just looking for the link but there is you just go to the bridge I probably uh if you go to just one moment how about this uh Jordy we will make sure to include it in the show notes for sure okay I know uh you're busy building and doing other things but we'll have it in the show notes for you bankless listeners yeah just go so just go to the bridge that ckbm slash rpc.com login and uh uh there you can start the bridge and just stand connect the metal your metamask and you're there let's go to remix deploy your smart contracts just uh do some transfers and I mean just work as a normal as a normal Network and it's really easy I mean new New bankless Frontiers opening up for you uh as we speak this is now available Jordy Mahalo thank you so much for coming on Bank list and telling us more about it thanks so much Ryan always a pleasure gotta end with this of course none of this has been Financial advice uh eth is risky so is ZK technology all of D5 is really you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] foreign [Music]
