we are in a very positive sum game and i'm not going to discount that but at the end of the day it is also a very competitive industry and i'm excited to see how each of the players evolve to try and win welcome bankless nation to the state of the nation this is the episode where we talk about what's happening we relate it to the big picture items and of course we drop some action items and insights about whatever is going on in the news cycle in crypto this week this comes out every single tuesday we usually live stream this on the youtube and it also goes out on the bankless podcast every single wednesday morning and to this week we are talking about the first major protocol merger can protocols merge apparently they can in defy how does a dow to dow merge even work what's actually happening here between faye and rari where are the synergies what are the alignments behind this merger and is this the first of many merges to come all questions that we ask joey and jay of tribe and rari capital but first before we get to that conversation some announcements uh you might have noticed that ryan is no not here at the moment ryan the ai robot is down due to a massive snowstorm that hit the state of virginia he is currently in his car at a gas station wi-fi trying to talk to me and i told him no ryan you cannot come on the the podcast without pristine internet quality so he is sadly not able to make it this week um and in addition to that we also had vitalik buterin on the podcast one more time that podcast came out on monday we talked about the future of the ethereum roadmap what is left vitalik thinks that we are perhaps 50 percent of the way done once we get the merge with the ethereum roadmap but there's so much left in the ethereum roadmap to unpack lots of metaphors and cool analogies to kind of understand what's left in the ethereum roadmap but we also talked about what vitalik thinks about the rise of the alternative layer ones uh in the first half of 2021 ethereum really stole the show but in the second half the rise of the of uh the eath killers the alternative layer ones really kind of dominated the narrative what does vitalik think about that he also wrote this article called endgame which illustrates what vitalik thinks is the logical conclusion of every single smart contract platform that exists every single blockchain they all are going to converge upon the same outcome so what does that mean for ethereum the one that has sacrificed scalability versus others that have sacrificed decentralization how do all of these things converge really interesting conversation uh we also had cooper turley on layer zero i interviewed cooper in person in puerto rico had a fantastic conversation there that is coming out on that came out on the podcast this morning tuesday morning so definitely tune in to both of those podcasts the gmi index another index out of bankless dow and the index co-op is live uh wednesday wednesday is going live the gmi index is a index full of uh defy tokens that aren't in the dpi and so definitely worth checking out i'm really excited to get that launched out the door we'll have a link in the show notes to check out what is in the gmi index and lastly our friends at on juno want to tell you about this sponsored message we all know that banks hate crypto but not anymore on juno is your

this message i will refrain from asking myself what is the state of the nation this week uh i would not do such a thing without my my partner ryan uh i'm sure he will be back soon as soon as he gets power back into the state of virginia but until then we are going to get into the conversation between the first and most significant doubt to doubt merger ever between tribe and the fey protocol and rory capital we've had uh jay from rory on the show before but joey is new so let's go ahead and get right into that conversation with joey and jay uh about the first ever significant dow to doubt merger right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over

guys some really interesting news has come about lately and we are definitely going to unpack it here on today's state of the nation so just just for a little bit of context in in november jaywin jay of rari went to the tribe forums and joey of tribe went to the rari forums and you each proposed to each other's communities about the benefits of a potential merger between these two daos between these two protocols and this was debated on for a little bit over a month and then just last the last week of december this was put to a token vote uh for each of the community and it passed this merger proposal passed overwhelmingly uh 93 to one percent uh margin among the uh rari dao uh and then 90 to zero among uh the fey of the tribe protocol uh and so now according to this merge uh proposal the the these organizations are now going to merge uh guys tell us how does this feel to i'm pretty sure this is most one of the most unprecedented things i've seen in a while uh how does it feel to be in this moment in crypto history right now uh jay let's start with you yeah it feels really exciting honestly like this came together pretty fast right but i think that like it just feels so right i don't know any other way to describe it and i'm i'm super excited like i think from the first time that i that me and joey started talking right it's just like you can feel the energy right you can feel the energy between the teams you can see the energy on twitter and now you're going to see the energy and the products that we're going to build together right and like it's just absolutely exciting to me and i'm i'm excited for everything that we're going to build together joey what about you how does it feel to be at this point in history dude jay just did the thing where he said the same thing i was going to say i i he said it just feels right i mean it does like and so i mean we can talk a little bit more about like the history of the merge but the the tldr how i'm feeling is just incredible like the energy's through the roof um it makes so much sense like we're always trying to escape to where the puck is going in defy i think that was a big idea with fev1 that was the big idea with fuse that jay had permissionless lending fully decentralized protocol owned liquidity for a stable coin and now what we're where we're going is like we're going to make the best product suite for daos and for web3 um and we're going to use fuse and vault and fey and like the teams are so aligned and the the the market timing is perfect like couldn't be better and i'm super hyped to jam with you all on it um you know over the next hours so totally yeah so we're definitely going to unpack what the merger actually looks like why the merger makes sense uh but uh i'm a big fan of being able to name things so we have rari and we have tribe what are we calling this new thing uh what's what's the new name for the thing that comes out on the end of this merge yeah so it's it's the tribe dao that's like like up until now we've been kind of pay protocol and rari has been very capital and those maintain so like tribe now is like more than just rari and more than just say it's like all of the products that we build the branding that goes under the tribe dial and like fake protocol is one part of it i'm sort of like leading fei labs big part of say protocol rory is still like you know being led you know a lot by the infra team and jay but we're together under the tribe dao okay so uh for just to make sure that listeners are up to speed with us i want uh each of you to explain what uh your respective protocols are all about and then also explain uh the synergies that are involved with uh this merger uh so jay let's start with you what is rari capital what does rory do and then why why what about faye what does fey have that rari really wants and and why does integrating rory and fey just make sense yeah so to to start off with what what exactly is rory right right he's a lot of things so let me start with that right but our main product today is fuse right and fuses surrounding this idea of let's enable any asset in the entire world to become lendable or borrowable right so anything that's on the blockchain anything that we can get an oracle feed for anything that's on chain link right you should be able to take out leverage you should be able to bar against it you should be able to do whatever you want with it really turning every asset into a productive asset and alongside this we have a yield aggregator which can direct liquidity into all of these different pools of pools of lending and borrowing that we offer and we have a couple other smaller projects like nova which is basically this like l1 to l2 transaction layer but but at its core these are all products that that feed the the main fuse product right and the the cool thing about the fey integration is we we spoke to joey before v1 was even was even live right and we we conceptualized this world at which faye could be borrowed directly using by directly using the the the rarifuse protocol right and that that evolved into fay becoming the first protocol owned pool right it was actually the fey governance who governed their own lending and borrowing pool i was like the the first time in history that that was possible by an external token holder group and then that suddenly like that that relationship only continued to grow with time right faye again was the first ones to to to decrease their fee with infused they were the first ones to initiate token incentives they were the first of many within the rory capital ecosystem which is why i was so excited about the fey team and again the the big piece and the big the big drawing thing for fey inside of the rari ecosystem is this idea of liquidity right it's they've developed a very very strong liquidity engine right yeah it has a stable coin component to it but at the end of the day what fey really is is a liquidity engine right and what is what is fused is fused as a way to get liquidity on any asset so these two things were basically a match made in heaven for for for us right so when when talking to to the team and talking to everybody about what is the future of fuse it obviously needs liquidity in the stack and that's why i was really excited about the conversations with joey excited about all of our collaborations is because that was the last key piece in really owning lending and borrowing and now that's what we're going to do joey let's turn to you and take this from the tribe side of things what is tribe and what does try need that rory has yeah so there's kind of two questions right because we have two tokens so what is tribe and what is today and i think that um well we can start with bay because really the tribe is the governance token for faye protocol at the foremost like that's what it was when we launched when i said tribes i mean holistically the whole entire thing yeah exactly exactly and so like um the the the tribe dao has been governing say protocol which we consider to be like among the most defined native and forward-looking stable coin projects that like we're trying to like i said skate to where the puck is going so they is a stable coin it's a usd staple coin it's backed by this really powerful idea of protocol own liquidity so instead of having like an over collateralized model like maker dow which is pretty governance heavy and subject to you know some inefficiencies i mean the maker's incredible project um the difference with fey is that all the assets are owned by the dao they're managed by the dao the fees are earned by the dao the trading and like portfolio allocation that's all done by the dao and then um so it makes say an extremely decentralized asset we're like primarily backed by ethan decentralized stable coins so um if usdc or usdt was to completely nuke or the regulatory environment was extremely unfavorable faye would still be strong it would be one of the strongest staple coins out there that's according to our value proposition but more than that what tribe is is tribe is the asset that controls the fey parameters and it controls the protocol and liquidity the pcv protocol controlled value and um this is a super powerful idea and it's what jay mentioned about us being a liquidity engine like we discovered very quickly that our product market fit is actually not just being a stable coin but it's being a partner to daos and a partner to platforms we provide liquidity and we bootstrap markets all over the place and we get compensated in tokens we get compensated in yield for doing that and that's how we generate revenue to continue to adequately backfay in addition to making it an attractive opportunity for tribe holders to be incentive aligned with this ecosystem so you can think about it as like a two-sided market where we're trying to create a stable coin and bootstrap demand and utility for the stablecoin at the same time as partnering with dows and earning yield for token holders so it's a really nice synergy and what rari has that we need is rari is a perfect product for us because now we can bootstrap all of these long tail fuse pools and we've earned a ton of revenue like millions of dollars from these other dows um for borrowing faye and just generating interest and we're putting some of our other assets into fuse now we're actually moving all of our liquidity mining rewards over to fuse because what that allows users to do is it allows them to lever up on their yield farming positions which generates more demand for fey more tvl for views more fees for the tribe dow so it's a super reflexive loop and um we're going to go all in on the future product suite ferrari um you know they're building vaults we're going to put a ton of capital into vaults they're building um but we're building our first joint product together which is going to be called turbo and we're really excited to talk about that um so that's really where we're going is like building these products for dows putting the liquidity engine to use and making d5 like the next level you know d5 2.0 or whatever you want to call it like we want to be at the forefront of that before we go further i really want to unpack this whole liquidity engine thing because that's something i still haven't yet wrapped my my head around how so um uh you're saying that the one of the products of of tribe is the fae stable coin but that's not the it's not the prime product it's a very significant one but there's this other thing that you're saying is like a liquidity engine where you have uh the the stable coin and it can provide liquidity and that's different from something like a maker dow which you know really just has died that's their one product their one job is to pre-induce demand for the die stable coin you're saying um tribe has this uh alternative side of it it's additional side to not only just a decentralized stable coin but also a liquidity engine well can you just really unpack that what that means for listeners that really don't uh they are hearing this for the first time yeah so i recently had like a cool like paradigm idea around this so if you think about what's important in web 2 it's compute and storage you need like you need to be have like services that can answer your requests and you know make your app run and you need to store data um so if you analogize that to define web3 you need two things compute you need products like fuse but you need liquidity instead of storage so liquid you can think of liquidity as value storage instead of data storage and that's what's so important about defy and so what fey has is we have both sides of the market we have value in the form of hard assets like eth and we have value in the form of synthetic stable coins with fey so if you need a stable coin we have a stable coin for you if you need eth we have heath for you we could put it in your protocol we can make both sides of a market and that's a huge huge advantage because products need to dilute themselves to hell with liquidity mining just to get enough you know to bootstrap a market and even then they're probably still going to lose but with fey you could have 100 million dollars that's diamond hands that's making a market for you that doesn't cost you anything or it costs you something much less and we're actually starting to get token allocations from projects who realize how powerful this is like volt protocol they're going to integrate with us very heavily they're making a rye fork that's kind of like halfway between rai and mim and it's going to use views very heavily we're really excited about that project and we think that that's just the beginning so we're building a lot of products to like make these services more available to more dows and that's what turbo is um we'd love to talk about that whenever makes sense but um that's kind of the tl dr does that kind of answer your question all right so the overlap that i'm seeing here uh is that both protocols seem to be targeting the long tail of assets where uh fey is a stable coin that can put liquidity uh across defy on wherever it is needed and then rory capital and its fuse pools also can provide borrowing and lending for again the long tail of assets and so so what i'm seeing here is rari is adopting fey as it's like official currency of the rari ecosystem uh and so where where both um protocols are are targeting the long tail uh and this seems to work out well for each other because rari capital needs to uh bootstrap liquidity in some of its fuse pools and fey just is better and better and better the more and more liquid it is uh jay do you like that description of rari adopting faye as its own native internal uh currency so a couple of things there i'd say first of all like this idea of the long tail is definitely just the go to market right we're still in the go to market phase of of both fuse and fey i would say we're still in the early stages the first inning i would say that that's like once we've conquered that right there's no reason that we won't move upstream right into the more into the more common assets that that everybody has and into into more different use cases for faye right and then in in in terms of viewing fey as the official currency of of rari holistically i i would i i don't know how i feel about that completely quite honestly right like we aren't treating faye any different than any other stable coin at the protocol level right and we have no intention of treating any other stable coin any differently like i i love sam i love the entire frax team i love dola i love all of these other stable coins what the collaboration with fey is about is about building a layer on top of the protocol and that's really where a lot of the cool stuff that that us and the fey team have have talked about isn't necessarily at like cutting cutting like giving fe a competitive advantage and cutting out all other stable coins from the fuse platform it's about okay now that we're connected with fey what cool  can we build on top of fuse together right and that's what that's what like the cool part is it's not necessarily doing this like anti-competitive practice of cutting out these other stable coins because genuinely like i want there to be other stable coins oh like definitely at least over the short to medium term because the competition will make us better right as as as a tribe yeah i completely agree with jay um we're we're very focused on making sure that the fuse platform has the best possible user experience and having competition at the base player is super important and where the partnership really shines is that fey is a a completely willing and incentive aligned partner to all of the rari products and like that's where it really shines is that like we're there we're gonna go hard on fuse and we're super incentivized because it's the same token it's the tribe dao but that doesn't mean we're gonna out compete or be anti-competitive with anybody else in fact that yeah i agree with everything jay said like it's not an official currency but rather like a default partner if that makes sense yeah yeah that does make sense um one of the dynamics of stable coins and well really all tokens but specifically stable coins is if you have a stable coin you have the ability to mint it so tribe has the ability to mint faye and again within the bounds of responsibility to make fey actually like pegged to a dollar does this power to mint a stable coin and the collaboration with or or now uh merger with with rory how does the ability for rari now to be able to freely mint faye does that impact or benefit the liquidity inside of rory fuse pools or benefit rari in any way i think that like fundamentally faye has always been a very very active player in seating various different fuse pools right and i would say that like us us hopping on board the tribe doesn't necessarily change that because they were already super active right now there's a proposal being put in place for like optimistic approvals right and creating a very very strong procedure for what the seating of liquidity looks like what the upper bound of liquidity looks like and basically standardizing this process and creating creating a machine line out of it which i'm i'm pretty excited about however um i don't think that necessarily what that looks like fundamentally changes the the the one exception to that is the the product changes that were the products and the protocols that were conceptualizing that will fundamentally change the way that that fey is seeded into various different fuse pools not necessarily from the pcv itself but rather from other dows and that's what joey was alluding to with with the turbo product is an instrument to basically do exactly that so what do you guys think are the most powerful synergies behind this merger what synergies really gets you guys get you guys excited um joey i'll start with you yeah i mean jay kind of teed me up really well i'm gonna i'm gonna shield turbo now so it this is something that we this was kind of the the premier product that we had in mind as our kind of first like joint venture where we were we talked about this during all the community calls about the merge like we have a huge list of things we want to do together but this was such a no-brainer to me and so basically the idea behind turbo is it's kind of an evolution of the maker down model of a stable coin so in maker dao the supplier and the borrower are the same person like if you want to generate dye you have to put ether some other acid into a vault and then an interest rate that's fixed by the doubt and you get die and that's kind of the mechanism so i had this idea what if we split up the supplier and the borrower to two different entities just like on compound but instead of using a money market you have a synthetic issuance like fey so it's kind of combining fuse plus maker dial and fey is the the backbone of this and so this is our turbo product and it's extremely powerful because it's like it's a strict improvement on the on the pre-existing model in almost every way um so here's the benefit for users of turbo our target market is doused as it is for like you know for fuse and for um you know for faye we want dallas to use turbo and the way it looks like is let's say the uniswap dao wants to create a liquid lending market for uni um what they would do is they would collateralize a fey loan through turbo and they would pay zero percent interest but they have to put that fey back into another fused form so this is kind of a two-step process so the borrowing side the generation side is done by the dao and it doesn't cost them anything then they put the fey back into a fuse pool and that fuse pool um is now a market determined interest rate that could have whatever assets they want it could have unisocks it could have uni it could have fey it could have other stable coins but they're going to have this base layer of fee liquidity that was generated by the uniswap dao for their users to go lever up on uni or get capital efficiency against unisocks or whatever and there's also a revenue split so the uniswab dao would actually earn part of that interest back to the dow and then the tribe dial the way that we benefit is obviously more utility for faye plus um more uh yeah plus revenue like we would be earning the same interest that maker dial uses but there's this great incentive alignment this great separation of concerns meaning it's gonna be a huge product it's really like liquidity acceleration is the way that ben has been describing it and um a lot of the like yeah i think it's a really really exciting um really exciting products jay do you want to uh riff on that or add into a different synergy that really gets you excited about this merger what's your favorite synergy that is coming out of this yeah i i think like joey joey covered turbo really well it's to be like a no-brainer for daos right like dao's don't actively like manage their treasuries nor should they honestly right it's a very passively managed thing right so what i imagine that we'll see is a lot of large dowels coming in depositing because it's a no-brainer they earn interest they get to provide their users lower cost of borrowing right it's it's going to be really cool for for fuse in general and for phase adoption the the other key area that i'm most excited about is is this idea of of d5 verticalization right we i've spoken a little bit about this on twitter but basically this idea of the growth of the d5 mafias right where we're starting to see it in terms of the danny's mafia in terms of like mim right wonderland et cetera et cetera right you you have all of these different mafias and i'm excited to see them them all come to light right you have the olympus mafia year now building we're now building the tribe mafia and they are each experimenting with different pieces of incentive alignment whether one token revenue shares treasury swaps et cetera et cetera it'll be it'll be really cool to see how this evolves over over the coming the coming months in the coming year and seeing what what what is required to build a mafia is it an amm is it a land to borrow is it a stable coin is it all three what else is necessary for the growth of them and and what's going what's it gonna take to to win it right like obviously we we are in a very positive sum game and i'm not going to discount that but at the end of the day it is also a very competitive industry and i'm excited to see how each of the players evolve to to to try and win [Music] i want to unpack how or what's happening with the tokens because uh in this merger there's only the the rgt token is being subsumed by the tribe token uh but why do that strategy rather than a token swap uh where uh rgt tokens get put into the fey treasury or the tribe treasury and then the tribe tokens get put into the rory treasury uh why well instead of doing a token swap why do a token merge isn't that just like way hairier and more complicated uh versus a token swap what's the thought process behind that whoever wants to take that the easy answer is like these treasuries that we all wield are too big right it's like a treasury swap doesn't do anything beyond like a cool medium post that gets the community excited for about a week and like we've seen this time and time again that like the the the benefits of like a value extraction will far exceed the the the size of it any any decent treasury swap right and like this was about going all in with one another and that's what that's what we're here to do joy you want to add anything to that yeah i mean i think the a lot of the benefits stem from what what jay said which is this deep like protocol level incentive alignment where we have the same token there's no question it's like fey and rory like it's not like oh we did a treasury swap but we also did a treasury swap with compound it's like no we're all in you know and um the other part that i think is extremely underappreciated is the decentralization benefit like the tribe dao will quickly become a hydra of like a bunch of different development teams that all have a ton of incentive alignment and all work towards the exact same token and i think that that's an extremely powerful incentive alignment and regulatory like you know we want to create something that's truly decentralized and this is the way to do it you get multiple teams with different products all building under the same banner and that's something that we care a lot about why is the rgt token getting turned into the tribe token and not the other way around how did that decision land yeah i mean it's a pretty practical answer to that basically there's a lot of time locked tribe all over the place versus rari was almost completely liquid so it's operationally easier and tribe was also just a more liquid asset and larger market cap so it was kind of i'm just like okay let's just use tribe but um that wasn't like a power move or anything it was just kind of like how the cards fell logistically it just made more sense yeah yeah um jade what about the rari treasury how big is the rari treasury and what's happening to that yeah it's just not being transitioned over right like how we're thinking about it is now rory and faye we're all under this tribe banner right we're here to support each other no matter what so we inherit tribes treasury we inherit everything of tribe just as they inherit everything of ours besides the treasury obviously just because that doesn't get converted over of course of course and how was this uh when you guys came to each other's communities and proposed a merger what were you guys anticipating were you like oh with like i hope they like this i have no clue or like what was what was the sentiment at the time of the proposal i'll tell you when jay so i i think a lot about rory and i've thought a lot about rari since we first heard of them and so i'd actually thought of like potentially some kind of merger a long time ago and um when jay like actually reached out to me and said hey i think it would be sick if we considered like maybe even merging projects and it immediately felt right like when he said it because i had already thought about it and like the the timing was like not perfect but it was like very clear that like where defy is going we need some consolidation and some some true incentive alignment so it was like a very radical idea i knew it was going to make some waves that made me excited and i didn't know exactly what to expect but i expect the same thing with most like high profile proposals that some people are going to be really stoked and some people are going to be really scared and we got that and i think that's totally normal um i actually have this funny theory i was going to make a tweet thread on it it's called the god theory of daos so the idea is that if god ran your dow about a third of people would still be upset at all times because like you know you like it's impossible you have such diverse competing interests in the dao that you can't make everyone happy so you have to kind of try and just split the middle and do things that the majority is in favor of and i think that's what we saw with the merger the initial proposal was crazy there was a lot of questions we pivoted the proposal a lot to make it um really optimal for the community and then we took it to a token vote and we saw that the stakeholders were really aligned and that took work but it was worth it what were the some of the big things that um stuck out to the community initially it's like hey no like perhaps this idea in in general is good but like these specific things we want to change anything stuck out like that yeah i mean there was a lot of details i think the communities obviously were like really emotional about the the peg price which makes sense and some of the terms around like you know for tribe holders we added a rage quit um like i think that we tried to keep it simple there wasn't a ton of stuff um and so yeah it was pretty much just like figure out where the majority of stakeholders would be comfortable and just like you know pivot accordingly and i think we landed in a pretty good spot and everything went smoothly um i think over a third of the rgt has transitioned at this point um which is pretty cool to see because we weren't sure how much rgt was like frozen in random places so um yeah it's honestly so cool like it still hasn't fully hit with me i don't know how jay feels but like is crazy to merge two tokens at this scale especially two projects that pretty much independently had product market fit like it's normally one dow that's in trouble like acquiring another one but this was like two totally separate projects that were doing great and i think this is a landmark moment in d5 i'm proud to be a part of it so i've got some rgt tokens uh what do i need to do basically there's a there's a merge website that you can find on our twitter and on our on rari.capital i'm pretty sure and it'll just basically walk you through like how to how to how to convert your tokens over and it's it's really simple you just press how many connect your metamask and you're you're converted over so it's just a matter of sending my rgt tokens to a specific contract yeah i mean yeah basically gets burnt and you get tribe instead and uh what's the what's the um when i say i i put in 10 rgt tokens how many tribe tokens do i get in return how does that work i think the final peg price was 26.7 or something something around there um and that's that's like heart hard-coded in right so it's like no matter when you convert it that that's the price that you're guaranteed and how is that price determined that was what governance voted on right so there were there were various different parties that came together to to basically propose that price and that's that's what governance approved on both ends well fantastic so relatively simple uh one third of our all rgt tokens are going to to transition over and turn into tribe tokens uh i mean i'm assuming not all 100 will actually ultimately get turned over into tribe what happens to those remainder rgt tokens yeah there's this there's this funny thesis like flying around the rari community and i'm totally not endorsing it because i want everybody to convert their tokens into tribe because then they can participate in governance but there's this there's a thesis running around that like once the vast majority of the supply has been converted that rgt will turn into a meme coin in like two years from now or three years from now and everybody who's sitting on rgt will just be like super like just like i don't know happy about it um so i think that's holding a large percentage of the supply but the thing is that thesis doesn't work until the majority of the supply has moved over so i i don't know what's going to happen that's pretty funny well i've definitely heard of weirder things happening in the land of crypto but i do take the point that it has to be a smaller minority in order for that meme to work out um i'd imagine there's some other like messy parts about merging uh two dows because this has never really been done before as far as i can tell especially not at this scale two different dows two different discords two different teams of people uh what what's happening with the discords like is one discord being just like you know uh abandoned and telling hey everyone we're like we're meeting in this discord like what's going on with the discords yeah so there's a lot of um there's like a like rari and faye are both pretty like broad products and with like very distinct like governance and so what we did is we kept the same on-chain governance like there's a rari dao there's a tribe dao that are both or there's a fey dao that are both powered by tribe so there's two different like there's two different governor alphas there's two different time locks so it's all like just to minimize the overhead of switching costs like we just kept everything pretty much the same um and for the contributors we actually took our feilabs internal comms and moved it all over to a tribe dao server with the rari infra team and all the rari contributors and all the tribe community contributors and that's been honestly awesome like it feels so much more like a dow than it did before and we're this is something that we care a lot about philosophically and something that we've emphasized in our development like we haven't been as aggressive as we could be because we really focus on getting community buy-in and governance is hard but it's worth it and i think that we're seeing the benefits of that as part of the merge so i'm pretty pumped about it and what about like stuff like emails is there somebody doing like hr stuff for google suite like how does it how does this all work yeah how i would think about it is like operationally these are two distinct entities within this larger spiritual being of the tribe right this this thing that's a value aligning both parties so when you look at it right ferrari doesn't have hr right we function as a as a group of people just trying to build cool who are part of a dow and we all work for now the tribe asset to to incentive align us all towards this common vision right so there is no merge of emails right it's still two independent teams and i mean there's there's a future where there's more than two independent teams right maybe maybe we'll scoop up some more maybe we'll build out some more incubate some more i don't know right and the tribe will only continue to grow and thrive the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever

the tribe is now turning into a dao of dow models we've kind of seen this poke that's head up this concept of dao with dow models in different spots and it seems like that's what tribe is turning into so now tribe has uh the the fey side of things and then also how has the rari side of things uh and and just do you have any thoughts on the dao with dow models both for specifically the tribe dao of daos but also just for broader uh the broader concept of dao's at large is this a theme that we're going to see in 2022 joey i'll start with you on that one yeah absolutely i think um consolidation like like i mentioned before it's like where's d5 going and what we realized is that treasury swaps aren't super effective at incentive alignment um competition is fierce in d5 like you could fork code community like your only moat is attention and capital and development talent and like attention is hard to keep a hold of that's like very fickle and capital is hard but luckily like the fedau has a lot of pcv that's our huge advantage and what you need is you need like incentive aligned contributors who are really talented and hungry and i can't think of a better partner than the rari capital infrastructure team the most talented developers the most creative aggressive team and together like with turbo we're getting that out the door even faster than i thought we would and we have so many more products that we want to build to make it even easier for more dallas to join our ecosystem so yeah i think we're really trying to like skate to where the puck is going and um and allow for consolidation incentive alignment and defy and that's something i'm really bullish on both of you guys have said that competition is so fierce in the world of defy at the moment and while we do definitely live inside of a positive some industry that doesn't mean that competition still isn't here uh does that do you guys think that uh this is just the first of many do you think other dows are going to start to look at potential merger opportunities just as a competitive advantage um jay i'll start with you on that one yeah i think it's inevitable right especially as we like the the market volatility that we're that we're headed into in the uncertainty of 2020 and the potential lumen bear market right these these are all good things to keep in mind as as you have mergers and acquisitions happening in the space right so i think we'll see both i think we'll see dow buyouts we'll see down merges we'll see dao's collapse and hostile takeovers these are all coming for defy it's going to be super fun to watch because it gets kind of game of thronesy but like i i i think that it's like inevitable for there to be massive consolidation because that's the only way that people can compete like effectively as well jay do you have any advice for other dows who are thinking about merging or just any lessons that you've learned over the last six weeks or so and just this experience of merging two dowels yeah i would say a it's a pain in the butt i can imagine make sure to be like make sure to be properly excited about it and that you want to go 100 all in right and then the second thing that i'll say and this is definitely the bigger and most important pieces if you're considering a merger and acquisition offer or considering going to a governance proposal and pushing it through you should come to the tribe first right we're we're gonna we're gonna be the best right we're gonna we're gonna win right and if you want to be on the winning team you should come join us is this perhaps tribe's new competitive advantage is uh they have uh gotten more experience with merging dows than anyone else in the space and therefore perhaps it's easiest to just merge with the tribe yeah i mean like that's that's a great use case right it's like you can you can go build your own project or you can come merge with us we can see you with 100 million dollars in pcv you suddenly inherit all of our socials like whatever you want to call it social capital right you suddenly get access to our development teams you get access to our auditors like there's soon gonna be a case on why you wouldn't join the the fey team and there's also this other side to it in terms of let's say you're gonna go and build like a fixed interest rate protocol right you can go and ship it on your own and maybe right if you if you don't join the tribe there's there's a future here where the tribe can just fork you and we can seat it with 100 million dollars and who are people going to use right a protocol where you get cheaper rates and 100 million dollars are already there or a protocol that one guy's just shipped himself right there's gonna be this network effect in joining the tribe to the point where everybody's gonna want to join the tribe i think there's a a conversation that we could have here about uh a historian of mergers and acquisitions in the traditional business the web 2 world uh who maybe if they're savvy enough with web 3 and crypto they might be able to teach us some lessons here totally joey uh what are what are your biggest lessons that you've learned in this merger uh now now that you're on the other side of this merger do you have any advice for other dows or organizations that might be considering merging themselves yeah so i would say i have i have like two different categories of advice one is for actually proposing a something like a merge or something like very very like big for governance um i think trying to propose a framework for doing things about a very like a proposal that's going to take a lot of negotiating or a lot of like community buy-in discussion try to have like vote on some ground rules as soon as possible and then like move forward with a very clear plan like i think we did a really good job given how unprecedented the merge was but it's so many mistakes and there are mistakes that could be like easily avoided within hindsight and i think that's just comes with uncharted territory so reach out to us we can we can advise you um but yeah like vote on a framework vote on like staging talk like at a very high level try to like iron out the big details before going lower level and have a process for filling in the details that's my advice on the dow side and if you're if you're a builder um i wanted to kind of riff on what you guys were talking about earlier sorry i was grabbing a charger so i um i was uh video off but um i think if you're a builder i would say 75 of token projects i talk to don't need a token and so my advice is don't build a token tokens are hard it's distracting like if you want to like you know hit the market and like have this crazy token and do yield farming fine launch a token but if you're here to like build something cool launching a token is a huge distraction so try and actually just go all in with your favorite dao wink wink you know tribe dao but like try to get you like being a strong builder so underrated like you can get a huge token allocation from these dows and just build your products and then you get all the leverage and all the power of that dow behind you um it's more decentralized you don't have to focus as much on like legal you don't have to focus as much on raising money you're just you'll be taken care of you'll be totally incubated i think it's such a no-brainer um for us and for like potential builders that like we really want to like talk to you and we want to encourage you not launch another stupid but to use tribe or or you know ohm or whatever your favorite big mega dow is like go do that and don't like don't launch your own token one of the things that's come to mind is that um we've seen people like uh jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg summon to congress uh because they have um for anti-trust conversations because the facebook just buys up all of its competition uh in order to just not have any competition and then it just becomes the massive gargantuan that it is uh is is it possible that this is the same like conclusion maybe in 5 10 15 20 years from now like some dow is just like the mega dow and it's kind of just like too big to fail i really hope not right i i think that is a poor outcome for what we are trying to build right first of all i'll start by saying there are a lot of other competent teams in the space right and like we want competition we're going to be pushing for competition right and like as we said like it's it's in our blood right like we're not going to limit fuse or do any anti-competitive things however we will be pushing for this style to become as big as it can be and doing so in in a way that is spiritually not similar to facebook or amazon right and i think that starts with things like decentralized governance transparent decision making right keeping all token hold there's active in governance right making sure that they're pushing for a better protocol these are all things that will ensure that we are actually delivering value to the world and to to the token holders at the same time yeah i agree completely with jay i think consolidation is going to happen and i i genuinely believe in a world where things that are the d5 dials are going to be bigger than would be legal for a centralized company like i think that tribe dial has the potential to be bigger than facebook and like we're not going to be the biggest dow you know like there's going to be huge huge douse and like ethereum itself is a dow arguably and i think ethereum is gonna be of comparable size to like the entire internet in terms of the value and network effects that accrue to it so like these cryptographic organizations are going to be insanely massive and i think to jay's point about decentralized governance like that's the key these are transparent immutable protocols and that is what makes this worth it is that the benefits of scale don't get corrupted by power because the leadership has to be extremely focused on writing rules and writing code and being transparent to protect users and to like all the problems you get from antitrust you won't have with these daos because of the the cryptographic nature but you will have all the benefits and that's where i think the economies of scale really kick in and it gets super epic and i'm so excited to be a part of it with the tribe dow and we're gonna do whatever we can and listen to the community make sure we're not breaking any laws but um you know i think it's a really exciting vision so what are the goals for the tribe dao moving forward uh i think this this merger still has to to finish i think uh more or less we're still in the relative beginning stages of this merge uh what's left in this merge before it's completed and then once that point happens what are the goals for the tribe dao after that so short and medium term goals for tribe um jay i'll start with you yeah so to me the merge is basically done right there's some rgt that's left to like be migrated a decent amount of rgt left to be migrated but the teams are basically operationalized within this within this tribe ecosystem right so what's what's next there's there's there's a lot of different things that that i'm thinking about right and that that joey definitely has many many more that i'm gonna definitely forget to say right but it's all under this idea of okay what what does it look like to be a like a citizen of a financial free internet right they're a financial free world right um i think there's a lot of different components to this right stable coins lending and borrowing are things that we've shown that we can do well and we're going to continue to double down on those efforts right so what you're going to see is fev2 has like is an amazing amazing thing right you're going to see the introduction of risk curves on the face out of things and i'll let joey talk more about that um and on the rory side of things you'll continue to see us double down on lend and borrow right significantly we're in the process of working on fuse 2.0 which is going to have a ton of really really cool improvements right and basically continue to try and be the flagship spot for lending and borrowing not just long tail assets but also normal assets right and we'll continue to do that but then when you zoom out and outside of outside of fuse obviously we're gonna push out the yield aggregator we're to have a formal road map also soon but when you zoom out you have fey you have rory right in my my grander roadmap for the tribe for 2022 will be a to establish an identity for itself right i feel like tribe is going to find itself in 2022 as really the symbol for this financial freedom and then b what what else can we do right it's like we've developed our own little bubbles as joey said these products vastly have product market fit what does it look like for us to expand outside of the realms of modern day defy and that's what i'm having a lot of fun brainstorming and ideating around is okay what does it look like to onboard the next 100 million people and get them using the face table coin every single day joey in your in your mind what are the short and medium term goals for tribe yeah so i think i think jay again hit it on the nose and that's one of the cool things that has emerged that we're we're always so like the vision is so clear like it was such a like no-brainer we were going in the same direction let's just go together uh you know you go farther together and um the merge is operationalized i think there's going to be some identity building so there's more of like a social component of the merge that's not totally complete but i think that it's pretty clear the road map is that cryptographic freedom financial freedom sovereignty like bankless these are things that we care deeply about you know and um i think that like fuse and fey are just the beginning turbo i think is going to be a great product and i have this this grand vision of building the entire compute layer for daos the liquidity layer for daos to be like um a one-stop shop for all of your needs as a dow and like you don't need to go anywhere else you go to the tribe now and you get your lending you get your borrowing you get your swapping liquidity eventually you'll have options fixed income set products we want to verticalize the whole stack and whether we build those products in-house or merge with great teams or acquire early stage builders it doesn't matter but we're going to do it we're going to have the whole thing in-house and we're going to allocate all of our resources towards that and i think that that's the way that that we win and i'm super super excited about it and i couldn't you know i couldn't be more happy with the partners that we have like we're working with the right people we have the right backers we have the right community so now it's just execution well joey the number of times that you and and jay uh agreed with each other just is very indicative of of how this these uh dows already make sense to merge into one so uh best of luck and and uh thank you for pioneering out into this brand new area of crypto that we never really saw before which is dow to dao merges uh i i expect to see many many more in 2022 and each one having their own story so guys thank you for coming on the show and telling us your story about this one thank you for having us yeah we're uh we're really grateful um we'd love to work more with the bankless community like i think we there's a lot that we can do together and um yeah we'll be at east denver we've got some great announcements coming like turbo is going to be a huge product and we have a lot more that are going to be even bigger than that that are going to be coming earlier this year so um just super stoked and thanks again for the time this was a really great great chat fantastic all right action items bankless nation if you have rgt tokens you need to get those and turn those into tribe tokens so there will be a link in the show notes to take you to the spot to get that done also i had a fun time reading both joey and jay's proposals to the respective communities about why this merger should go in in the first place so if you just want to give that a read because it's pretty unprecedented it's kind of a industry first so we're worth just understanding what's going on and so those documents those forum posts will be also available in the show notes as well as always guys
