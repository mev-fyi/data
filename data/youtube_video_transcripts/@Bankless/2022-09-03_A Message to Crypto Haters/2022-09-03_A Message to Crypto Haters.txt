but the reason i wanted to say this 99 of the crypto industry is a joke is i think that we should say that explicitly to lower the defenses of people who aren't on the inside of our industry but are on the outside looking in the very first thing we should say is guys we acknowledge all of the scams all of the shenanigans all of the stupidity yes you are that you see it that you see in here you are correct we acknowledge that i'm not trying to defend any of it it's stupid and then after that you kind of say but there's something here there's a sliver of like incredible technology and uh political social movement and social layer that is absolutely going to change everything and if you stop at the 99 of the joke part you don't get to that one percent will change the world then you'll miss out on this thing
