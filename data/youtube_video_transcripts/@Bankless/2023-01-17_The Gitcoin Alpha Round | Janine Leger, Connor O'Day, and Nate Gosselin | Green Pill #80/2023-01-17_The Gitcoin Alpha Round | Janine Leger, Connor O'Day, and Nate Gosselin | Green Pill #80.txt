foreign [Music] ation on this Greenfield episode we are talking about the get coin grants decentralized Alpha round so a quadratic funding round hosted by getcoin on the completely new decentralized modular protocol that gitcoin has built so uh on this episode we've got Connor and Janine from the Partnerships team on at Bitcoin and we've got Nate from the product team on gitcoin and we are talking in this in this episode about the one million dollar Alpha round for uh climate web 3 projects eth infra web3 projects and web3 open source that is happening from January 17th to the 31st so this episode will air on January 17th the date that the round is has started and the reason that we have this episode is that we wanted to talk about bitcoin's Evolution into the protocol uh we wanted to tell you about the the first Alpha Protocol round that is happening on top of grand chance stack and the allocation protocol so that means no more sign in with GitHub no more centralized platform this is a modular decentralized code base that anyone can fork and give their Community flexibility on how they allocate their resources much simpler ux and much more elegant technical architecture so uh disclosure on this episode I am a co-founder of getcoin but have since disaffiliated since it's become a dow I hold GTC I hold eth and I hold die these are tokens involved in building the ethereum ecosystem on bitcoin that is not why we do this episode we do it because we're excited about quadratic funding on git coin Bitcoin has created 72 million dollars worth of public goods funding for the ethereum ecosystem many of you listeners have gotten money or given money on get coin grants and um yeah so uh we're just really excited to see this Alpha round launching and um and and basically quick primer on quadratic funding if you're not familiar already quadratic funding is based a way of allocating a matching pool to the results of a crowdfunding campaign and so during this two weeks between the 17th of January and the 31st of January there'll be a one million dollar matching pool that will be allocated to the results of a crowdfunding campaign and during that round the matching will happen quadratically which is basically a mathy way of saying the number of contributors to each Grant matters more than the amount funded for each Grant and that's what quadratic funding is it's actually a really powerful way of pushing power to the edges decentralizing and creating more democratic way of allocating funding in the ethereum ecosystem but now really in any ecosystem that uses the grant stack and quadratic funding so uh there have been many notable projects that have been funded by Bitcoin the centralized version in the past most notably uniswap 1 in 16s you're in finance infrastructure projects like Prismatic or Lighthouse have been funded by Bitcoin in the past and I'm really excited see what projects get surfaced in this next round of get coin quadratic funding is kind of a collective intelligence mechanism that lets you see what the ethereum community is excited about because what they're funding on bitcoin is what they're excited about and quadratic funding upregulates the projects that the most people are most excited about so this episode is a banger if you're into quadratic funding if you're in to get coins Evolution into a decentralized modular protocol and Dao then uh this episode is for you if you're interested in contributing to the one million dollar climate infrastructure and web3 open source round happening on January 17th to 31st then this episode is for you so without further Ado I give you Conor Janine and Nate from gitcoin Dao enjoy coordination the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty Goes Down Glow is a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe Reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously

work Summit hosted by Opus glad to have you all uh excited to talk about the grants Alpha round so uh this episode we're recording on Monday January 16th uh tomorrow when this episode airs on the 17th grants Alpha round will be live so what is that and how can people get involved I'll go uh three different rounds that we're running as a test on the protocol it's going to be the first test of the get coin team runs on the protocol and the three rounds are open source software and we've got each infrastructure and then climate Solutions so we're really excited to run these it's a curated all three of them are curated rounds with grantees that have previously done rounds previously on the protocol um on our product and are now going to be the first ones testing out the protocol with us so we're super stoked about it and kind of when are we when are we running them yeah so this round kicks off tomorrow or today if or yesterday in the past if it depending on when you're watching this uh January 17th at uh 12 o'clock UTC so earlier in the morning for anyone in the U.S on January 17th and it'll run until January 31st and one one addition I just add to what Janine said is that this is essentially kind of the first test round of the git coin program or what will evolve into the git coin program so the thing about the new protocol is that it's you know kind of fully permissionless and self-service and anyone can run their own qf round grant program um any type of sort of uh Grant infrastructure uh in the future at any time and git coin will kind of have our own set of rounds that we run on a recurring basis some that are you know new some that get replaced uh but we kind of plan to keep up our Cadence of rounds that we've been doing for a few years now but on this new platform and yeah so this is going to be like the kind of first taste of what we plan to run and then you know we're helping a lot of other organizations kind of hop on and and start using it as well and so we're not going to be the only ones running uh Grant programs and doing quadratic funding on the on the protocol uh but this is just the first uh the first step towards you know us running our program and then enabling everyone else to run their own as well right so listeners may be familiar with Bitcoin grants rounds 1 through 15 that ran from 20 January 2019 to late 2020 to and it sounds like there's a whole new platform that's decentralized and modular that uh is being used to run these rounds so what kind of product differences can can people expect if they're used to the old platform Nate maybe this one's for you yeah yeah definitely um so we're really excited about uh the way that we're building out the the new protocol and then also the the platform and D apps on top of that I I think one of the really interesting things for us when we were working with our old platform was just how much customization people wanted like as communities would come in they'd be really excited about the the core concept of quadratic funding but then they would want to have like their own sort of take or on sort of tweaks that really fit what they were trying to do whether that was eligibility criteria or wanting to give weight to different types of Voters there's just a lot of different things that go into how you as a community decide how you want to allocate your resources and the old platform really can handle that so I think the the thing that I'm most excited about when it comes to what we're building today is just the flexibility uh like we've really been identifying like what are the different decision points that a community would want to have in terms of um Distributing their their resources and now like we're giving them the ability to decide at every point of that like what makes the most sense for them I think in terms of the overall like app that we've built on top of it um I think what people will probably see is just it's it's much simpler like in the old world there wasn't much of a back end to speak of it required a lot of like deep knowledge of our systems for like an operator like Conor Janine to come in and run around we've really been investing in that UI so that we really can give it to um to anyone who wants to run around and they can log in they can configure make all the choices that they want to make around the round themselves and then deploy it and operate it without needing a big technical team or without really needing to understand our stack at a a high level um I think the other thing that we've been doing on the uh more like donor facing and grantee facing side is trying to streamline the overall experience so I think the one big shift was that on the old platform you could come in for a specific round and donate on a variety of chains you could donate on mainnet you could use CK sync you could donate on polygon we changed with the protocol so that each round will run on one chain it'll either you know run on mainnet it'll run on L2 but I think what you sort of lose in flexibility there I think you just gain an ease of use from a grantee perspective you don't have to worry about porting over from different chains from a donor perspective you have like one clean kind of browsing experience so I think we've we've definitely stripped it down for this first Alpha Protocol round but I think it's also given us a really strong platform so that as we start to get into these these next rounds you'll start to see a lot more experimentation on top of it in terms of curation and sorting and things like that so um I'm really excited for what's coming got it so where it started was this this platform that uh that was centralized in monolithic and was hard to tune and where it's going is decentralized modular allows communities to uh because of the Simplicity of the modular code base tune it towards their own needs and now anyone can kind of take quadratic funding on bitcoin grants that was working in ethereum and apply it to their own Dao evm based Community is that directionally correct yeah it's exactly right um I think we we as the Dow just like really didn't want to be a a bottleneck on quadratic funding rounds I think there's just so many people who are excited about doing that so this this first expression of uh our protocol is allowing anyone to come in and run a quadratic funding round with um civil defense with kind of like the things that we've become to known come to be known for uh at Bitcoin uh and then I think the Step Beyond this for us is starting to just like add more and more tools into that toolkit for communities so adding in additional sort of allocation uh flavors adding in different tools things like that so we're excited to see where it goes yeah you said the the word allocation there and it just triggered a thought in my in my mind that on the governance Forum there was some debates about what to call these these protocols and uh is there is there a final name for them yet I think there is I hope I'm not going to get uh skewered for this but we're going to be calling it The aloe protocol um which I'm really excited about it's based in allocation uh just really speaks to the things that we're trying to do uh with this protocol um and then we've been building out a series of of apps on top of that that we're calling the grant stack and that's what anyone can come in to use um to run quadratic funding rounds or do whatever they want but the aloe protocol is really the the engine under the hood that we're also hoping becomes a a really strong foundation for Builders who are interested in um you know community-based fund allocation uh so you said that anyone can come in and run around I see in my notes here that y'all have run two test rounds on the protocol to date with UNICEF and Phantom Janine and Connor you want to talk about those results yeah I mean I I think it was like we did those into Samba um so we had a two-week round for Unicef and then Phantom had a much longer round Phantom actually ran their own around themselves so it was like a very self-service way of doing it whereas UNICEF we worked with them and did a lot of the operations and engaging the grantees and engaging the donors both I would say were successes um the UNICEF round we had them put up 50 each in the matching pool and really what they wanted out of it was like how can we start using crypto to help you know projects that were already funding um and how can we help our community get engaged and also like feel empowered to both donate to the grantees and the grantees being able to you know rely on their communities to donate to them and it was just a big success across the board like you know Nate and the product team has been doing a great job building the protocols we sped up the launch of testing these protocols for a partner instead of running with the UNICEF Innovation team was not a small feat to start with but it all went pretty smoothly they had 10 grantees in the round so the interesting thing is the UNICEF round was a curated round um they brought in grantees that they knew and trusted and wanted to support and I think that worked really well just to like learn about the protocol for them um and we ended up you know more than doubling the amount of funds that they put in so we had a total of 80 Ethan Edition that came from 15 500 donors for that round and I was sort of donations that came in over a two-week period that went to the 10 different grantees we had someone from our community build a great Dune dashboard that sort of tracked all the funding and how it was you know being distributed which was awesome to follow along with um and the grantees themselves some of them had never used crypto before some of them you know are blockchain based projects and it was really cool seeing the non-crypto native ones being like oh whoa like I can do this like this is how I create a wallet this is how I engage my community some of them around their own Twitter spaces um so it was just like really cool seeing how we're actually using these protocols to empower communities to fund you know their own projects and them feeling empowered to actually do that themselves without Bitcoin necessarily doing all of that work in the background so that was awesome to see for Unicef and then the Phantom round was a great one to launch and kind of see what happened there because that was more self-service so Nate might actually be able to speak to a little bit of like how we set that round up and how we sort of just let them do their own thing yeah yeah it's a phantom approaches pretty early on um as we were building out the protocol expressing an interest in and being an early test partner I think we had Conor had had a ton of conversations with them um in kind of our centralized grants days uh and they were just that Community has been one that's just been really excited about quadratic funding um in general and when it came to start testing things out they were just kind of the the ideal partner they were really willing to um get in the weeds with us like understand um you know how we wanted to build it understand like how to get feedback and just really be there as we were trying to to work things through and I think they were really excited just as this feels like the beginning of something for them uh you know they they ran initial test rounds they'd put up about 35 000 uh USD in their matching pool um I think it was a 125 000 uh FTM tokens they ended up getting over 80 projects uh accepted into the round which was great um given that it was a just kind of an early start for them um and then in terms of donations they had over 16 000 uh unique donors they also got about 80 000 in direct donations so they almost tripled um the amount that they put up in the matching funds which was just really exciting to see um and they're looking at this as a way to you know continue iterating and build from here I think one of the things that's been really exciting for us too has just been um I think the level of like interest in both quadratic funding and public goods in the Phantom Community I think they've been really well like interested in just sort of understanding like how do we think about um best practices how do we think about encouraging like good projects in our area so uh yeah just been really exciting to see that come up and I think they've been looking at it as a big success they're they're excited to um get ready for their next round yeah one of the things that's exciting to me uh about this is this this idea of um you know open source code in general is is a networked good in that everyone who downloads my npm package or my pip package and submits a bug report back to the maintainer and that gets fixed makes it better for everyone else who is using that and I kind of see this this same sort of pattern forming with grants protocol this new code base that's totally modular because uh the what we what Bitcoin learns from the UNICEF and the Phantom rounds accrues value back to the mechanism design for the ethereum round and vice versa so in World in which there's n numbers of people using the allocation protocol allo protocol to uh fund their public goods then it just gets better for everyone else that's using it and everything sort of compounds from there I'm wondering if you can kind of like draw me a trend line from UNICEF and Phantom to this ethereum Alpha round what comes what comes after the alpha round from there what's what's what's coming in 2023 from from Bitcoin so yeah I can hop in here um so more from a like the rounds of a running perspective not necessarily the product um our plan is currently to kick off kind of a larger protocol launch and get coin program launch in April um so basically you know we've been doing these kind of quarterly uh round cadences for for four years now and we plan to sort of keep that up so the point of this Alpha round is to you know do a larger test of the protocol in its current state with you know hundreds of grantees uh and when we kind of open the floodgates to the full launch we're expecting you know probably closer to like a thousand Grande's or more in in these rounds or these groups of rounds so our our sort of road map to get there um I think in February we'll be doing a lot of retrospectives on how this round went you know what kind of bugs we found uh ux issues uh what you know if it gets civil attacked or attacked in any way we'll take some learnings from that and then we'll kind of go turn around keep building through February March and in March what we want to do is run a few more sort of smaller scale test rounds but ideally with a lot of our kind of external Partners so we want to help enable other projects to run their own Grant programs but um you know more so to get used to the new protocol the tech how they can kind of set things up themselves and then lead this into something in April where we do more than just three rounds maybe five maybe ten that Bitcoin is kind of operating and hosting uh potentially featuring some other rounds from you know Partners projects in the ethereum OR broader you know evm compliant web 3 space and and kind of go from there so you know with our own program currently the plan is to keep up this quarterly Cadence so do these kind of large Festival like like rounds every three months but what I think users can expect is that there will sort of be a lot of different things going on on different uh you know cadences at different times different lengths so rather than just having you know one two week period a quarter where there's a bunch of rounds happening at once you might find that you know this doubt or this chain decides they want to do something every you know two months or six months and they might run longer programs or shorter programs and so I think we'll start to be testing you know how that works when there's overlapping and varying uh programs going on but but yeah the get coin the Bitcoin program uh full protocol launch is planned for April and we're hoping to stick to that timeline and kind of continue from there on the three-month Cadence uh from a product perspective though Nate I mean I guess you could probably share more on what users could expect to be different in a few months time um compared to what they might see right now when they use the protocol yeah yeah um so I think one way to kind of think about this is right now we're we've poured a bunch of concrete but it's still kind of wet I think a lot of what we've been trying to figure out is what the what the ultimate foundation of the protocol should be I was mentioning before like what are those decision points like what are the things that you want to be able to customize and I think that's that's something we're still learning as we build this out but our hope is that from a protocol perspective um in April there's a pretty set uh protocol standard that we can start to um enable people to start building upon like having better developer documentation really start our developer Outreach to enable people to do that um on the kind of Grant stack protocol I think what people can expect is that uh or excuse me on the grant stack um point of view I think what people can expect is that uh in addition to the program that's running that there will have they'll have the ability to go and self-serve start creating their own rounds um one of the things that we're going to be doing once this round ends is kind of taking a breath as Conor said to shore up our documentation and just make sure it's really easy for people to come in and do what they want to do so that when everything goes live anyone who wants to come in and run a quadratic funding round will be able to do that using Grant stack um on their own set it up set their decisions and kind of go from there as we kind of widen the aperture and look a little bit further out into the year my hope is that you just start to see more functionality coming on top of that um so I think on the quadratic funding side we've built I think like a very kind of clean V1 of qf that enables you to come in and do kind of like the basic version of qf but we want to start adding in the ability to do I think more interesting versions of that or or variations of that where you can start providing different types of weights to your community when you can kind of experiment with matching caps experiment with different types of civil defense so I think there's some like really interesting things coming on on the qf side specifically I think some of the other things that we're really excited to build on top of the protocol are this idea of project reputation um so I think one thing that we hear from communities when they're trying to run grants programs is how do I know which projects to trust and we're trying to create the ability for projects to really earn those almost as stamps like for people to be able to learn like yes I've been a part of different git coin rounds or yes I've shipped XYZ features um just helping people really understand like who these projects are so that they can start to more easily engage in funding programs and I think the other thing that we'll be adding on top of this is just more um additional types of Grants programs and funding programs so being able to do things like direct rounds quadratic fund voting is something that we're really excited about building so the tldr is that come April the product will enable you to come in and run a self-serve quadratic funding round with all the documentation you need and as we push out towards the year you'll see additional functionality on quadratic funding on top of quadratic voting direct grants programs as well as some project reputation so TBD on what exact order that comes in but that's what we're eyeing through the rest of the year and I think something that I'll I'll add in there it's like one thing we did fall you know these elf arounds with Bitcoin was just do a few small simulated rounds ourselves just to like learn about how the whole thing worked so we came in with like 10 grantees put up just like a small amount like it was like two thousand dollars that we that we put up um got a few donors to come and contribute and just by kind of creating a like container it was a safe container that we got to learn in that we got to test it in that's what we would love to see Partners do too to start like if they're concerned about going in and like running a whole big self-service round and they're like I don't know this is a lot of funding I don't know what how reviews are gonna look I don't know how donations are going to look like the beauty of the protocol will be that people can go on do something small just to test it out and then run as many or as few larger rounds as they want and moving forward and I think what's what what we're trying to build is like a world where you know anyone can come around around at any time but we'll be you know running this get going program on a regular Cadence so you know starting at quarterly and that's really focused on like funding public goods at our get coin Community cares about and we're saying you know anyone that wants to come and run around at the same time as us to get like more discoverability to get you know more insight into just like how we run rounds um learning from just like our marketing being a part of that like running around at the same time uh where you do want to fund public goods as a partner um and you're just trying to learn at the same time like we're we're stoked to have Partners running around at the same time so that's something I think I'm pretty pretty excited about yeah it feels like y'all have entered this sort of like ooda Loop of Udo is this idea when you're in an unknown territory in which you can uh observe what's happening around you Orient decide what to do and then you act um and it's this iterative Loop that I remember being in in Bitcoin grants rounds one through I think I was involved through like rounds 12 uh in which we would kind of uh just plan out around talk to vitalik see what he wants in the mechanism uh roll out the rounds and um get the data back and then decide what to do what we learned from the round and it was it was that cycle of sort of being in this dance with the community through which we tried things like negative voting and Collections and checking I think Bitcoin was one of the first d-ops to integrate with the layer two because uh you know there was just so much usage on on bitcoin and with the median transaction costs or median transaction being like a dollar having having really low cost transactions was really important so just entering into that dance with the community is what I'm really excited to see Bitcoin do uh with the with the new modular protocol and it's a whole new team a whole new governance system a whole new code base and and so y'all are going to be climbing towards towards better allocation Resources with the community it seems like I mean I guess like what's the global Maxima that that you're iterating towards as you as you kick off these rounds in 2023 I think personally the the thing that I am most excited about is this really fluid sort of resource allocation for communities I realize that's a lot of buzzwords but I think you know the communities that I get really excited about are the ones that tend to be sort of like local you know like neighborhood communities like it's a neighborhood sort of coming together to decide how do we want to like pool some resources towards improving what's what's here what we're working towards or more sort of like Regional oriented things this idea of sort of like localism or like digital localism I think is is super exciting and what I see for um and I think what excites me about the protocol is that if we do all this right there's an opportunity for communities to really easily say like okay these people get to decide what we're going to decide on here's how much money we have and that's a vote system you know and get to a point where like we can decide um in groups like really quickly how we want to put our money against something um but I think what that also does is is kind of give us a spot that we can start to plug in like ongoing funds like I think this is what it's been such an interesting application for web 3 protocols where if you're Gathering some sort of fees you can just kind of Auto Direct them to a grants program or something on our protocol and just continually continuously be um pushing funds towards what your community needs I'm excited to see how this starts to like Port over to um day-to-day lives too like is there some sort of always on funding that we can be directing to to Regional communities local communities things like that let me ask you the state is there one perfect coordination mechanism that is going to be the right fit for all communities to allocate resources to their Commons I love this question uh my my personal feeling is no um I think that I think that there is going to be a a plethora of sort of tools and it's going to be like one of our jobs I think is a dow is going to be understanding like which tools are right for which situations and how can we help communities figure out what makes the most sense like I think quadratic funding is super interesting when you have a large engaged Community that's willing to donate on top of that and sort of like supercharge what you're doing um I think things like quadratic voting are super interesting when it's maybe a smaller Community or or you have like a more um kind of credentialed community or something like that so I think there's a lot of room for design and learning but no I don't think there's one one specific thing so the aloe protocol the allocation protocol really it seems like that's going to get forked a lot and there's going to be like aloe protocol sub QV allo protocol pairwise quadratic funding allo protocol Macy quadratic funding um and then if you all want to get really weird there could be allo protocols for Assurance contracts or hyper certs or uh sortition um demurrage ranked Choice voting like you know Griffith Griff uh the founder of giveth and I just did a a podcast on coordination mechanisms and it uh we found like 25 different coordination mechanisms and so I'm I'm curious to see how wide and deep the allocation protocols get is it the allocation protocol that'll be forked and and how does that sort of like vision of of trying out all those different mechanisms resonate with you as as the product lead yeah it sounds like exactly what we want to have I think when I think about the protocol like the things that are going to be really powerful elements of it um I think one is like the concept of like a project in its reputation like if you're if you're trying to allocate funds you're trying to allocate funds to somewhere so knowing that like the place that you were allocating to or the people that you were allocating to or are trustworthy or like capable of doing the thing that you want to do I think is super important so that to me is like something that's that we need to make sure is like shining through um but I think the other part of this equation is just what are the different ways that your community your verified Community can make a decision um so I think the more that we have those decision-making mechanisms whether it's quadratic funding or one of the other 25 from your list um I I think that's exactly what we want to see happen right so if I just want to put pinch and zoom on this so git coin is no longer a quadratic funding maximalists because there's other allocation protocols that could be built into grant stack did I hear that correctly or is there a shade of gray there I I would not claim to speak for Bitcoin uh I am one note in the network so what I know likes to say um I I I think like I love quadratic funding as a mechanism I think it's a super important mechanism I I'm curious what Janine and Connor think I think it's going to be a key part of like our program going forward I think from a protocol perspective I think there's going to be a ton of different opportunities it just seems like for what bitcoin's doing right now quadratic funding is like the best way for us to express our opinions as a community okay I kind of think adding on that like agreed quadratic funding right now is working really well for the program so like getting that right on the protocol is step one like let's get that let's get that sort of locked down but then kind of to the point of like why we're building a modular protocol it's like the hope is that it builds and fix and changes in different people come in and build on top of it and bring like totally new allocation design to the table um I think qf is like a step in the right direction like if you think about the Fiat world and communities like how communities work where it's like any Financial allocation is there it's a membership model right it's like you're paying a friend you're paying a specific amount every month think about like a Country Club think about Soho House think about um any any random Community it's like you're paying a membership and like you don't really get to choose what's in there you're just like okay well I guess I'll be a part of this and like I don't know where my money's going um but like imagine you can kind of fracture that out like qf is a great way to stop but like that's just the beginning of a really long road to get much more dynamic in terms of how we're allocating and meeting and reaching communities needs yeah I I plus one of that I mean I personally think that like quadratic funding is sort of where Bitcoin has found its Niche or like originally found its Niche um and that's you know it's really what we're known for and what a lot of the web Community um you know kind of sees get coin ads and what they use our platform for that said that doesn't mean it'll be like that you know forever there's other qf platforms coming up uh and already out there's there's other mechanisms that keep going plans to experiment with but personally I'm I'm very bullish on qf and it doesn't have to be qf in its current form or necessarily like just kind of plain vanilla quadratic funding I think even on the old grants platform that we ran that was fairly centralized uh it changed a lot over the years you know we it initially was just kind of like one big matching pool or one small matching pool um that all grants were sharing we started playing around with categories where grants had to be in one category they couldn't be multiple and they had a certain amount of you know matching allocated to each category uh we started doing we actually merged it back into get together to one large round again uh we added things like like pairwise qf where it actually looks at the donations and the patterns among donors and we'll we'll dampen uh groups of donors that look like they're colluding uh we added things like matching caps so there's a maximum amount that one Grant could take that then redistributes it to other grants so you know we we kind of experimented and played around with them mechanism a lot to see how that changed the results and we're going to continue doing that but now we're at a point where we can enable anyone to kind of do that and you know experiment in their own way and and take what you know they learn from each each iterative round and to build on that or to change that and so to kind of go back to the initial question of like you know what what are we excited about or what's like what's the addressable Market here you know in the short term I'm super bullish on qf and coordination mechanisms that kind of can happen in the gitcoin protocol as being a part of the Dow tooling stack so um you know maybe a dow has you know they have a governance token they like vote to make decisions they also have a regular grants program this will just be like a piece of that puzzle that you know lets them say okay we're going to allocate you know X percent of our funding to this matching pool and use that to incentivize Community donations Community votes and and more you know active contributing and decision making and so I think it kind of fits in you know in a lot of dows or layer twos or you know kind of like a decentralized protocols where it's a decision making tool um in the shorter term and and I think that's primarily because you know web3 also has these uh kind of ux you know bear barriers to get over and water adoption you know we need to make all this simpler to use but in the next you know one to two to three years I think this could really kind of fit in as a piece of the Dow tooling uh stack but then longer term like I would love to see this adopted by uh you know communities governments uh maybe smaller scale you know towns or states and you know even larger scale uh nation states or whatever replaces them eventually where uh this is just a coordination tool a fundraising tool and a capital allocation tool that all types of communities local digital uh and Global could use right it feels like to sum it up like Bitcoin 1.0 was was fishing for you in in in Grant stack allows it teaches you to fish totally speak um the other analogy that I see out in Market is the uh I actually read this on the coin forum someone posted about it but uh like the op stack is a way of composing an L2 with modular components so that anyone can take the optimism code base and build an L2 um whereas like optimism their old version was just like they ran an L2 for you um and and the the Sim the parallel I see with Grant stack is that Grant stack is a modular set of code bases that allows you to run a plain vanilla grants program or quadratic funding grants program you can compose any sort of Grants program using the grant stack similar to how with the op stack you can compose a uh L2 um yeah is it any reaction to that or is that directionally correct yeah that feels right um I think there have been a number of like and like I think you might have talked about this analogy early on too but like I've always really enjoyed the idea of like the wordpress.com and wordpress.org kind of analogy too where it's like we're like there's just a basic system for running um you know running blogs in that case that's the allo protocol uh and then having like Grand stack on top of it for people who want a little bit more hand-holding but um but yeah I think that's absolutely right like we want we want people to be able to like get into the code base of the protocol experiment with it build on top of it um and in the meantime we're also going to be providing a really simple UI for people who want to just be able to um run this without having to get into it so there's the express lane where you hit a button you get in touch with bitcoin's Partnerships team and they'll help you run around in the fast lane or you can Fork it and go run it yourself and that's the analogy with WordPress uh where you can go to Wordpress and you can just spin up a Blog and pay five dollars a month or uh you can Fork the code base and run it uh you sort of see that Spectrum from Full Service to to doing it yourself exactly exactly and I and I think a big a big piece of that that's like a huge unlock in it from uh what we did is like the platform previously to now we have the protocol was like before was like how many rounds could we run and it was all based on like the operational team and how yeah what capacity we had um as well as like people having to run on our coldly Cadence and now sort of shifting into the space where it's like run a grants program in your own capacity in your own way it doesn't necessarily have to be the same way that we've been trying to get people to run rounds um like you could just do it just to hire people right like if you want to have a subtraction mindset of hiring and not bring people internally but you just want to find projects that are building in your ecosystem like run a continuous grants around for for the uh and see where that goes so it's just like this like huge unlock from a operational capacity standpoint where it's not reliant on our team anymore in terms of how many rounds run and when uh yeah and I guess I would just adding and I think Kevin you actually maybe can speak to this a lot as well but like you know we didn't build again this is because you built a lot of the the initial you know sea grants platform through you know 2019 over over the years secret stands for centralized grants yeah yeah so that's the old grants platform that you know many of you if you've donated to do uh a Bitcoin grants round before that's the platform you were using uh and yeah so you know Kevin you were obviously an instrumental piece in launching that and maintaining it for a long time but like the reason why it was built in the way it was wasn't that because we wanted it to be centralized we wanted to control it you know we wanted to like gate who could use the the platform but more so out of necessity uh because I think you know if if you haven't solved for uh you know preventing civil attacks or fraud or uh you know identity systems then like the whole the whole mechanism of quadratic funding just told really breaks and you know I still think maybe we're not there yet we're like we have a robust you know trust trusted like decentralized identity system um but you know we we sort of had to like admin these rounds um as as get coin and kind of make sure you know grants are being approved in a fair way uh donate donors weren't gaming the system we weren't getting you know civil adapt and like a widespread way uh and if we kind of launched it as a decentralized platform I think we were missing a lot of those identity tools that that really allow you to like prevent those those attacks so you know for a long time like we were kind of in control of these rounds because we had to have all these things on the back end where you know we're sort of ensuring the fairness and preventing uh malicious actors from from cheating in the system but I think the whole web three space has evolved a lot in the last four years and you know specifically like the the decentralized identity piece is is it's going to be key to kind of enabling this this decentralized this open permissionless qf or other protocol and so that yeah I think we're getting there you know it's still sort of an experiment we're still trying to like figure out the best solutions for decentralized identity but it's not like we always wanted grants to be centralized I think this was always sort of the goal to decentralize it but um that identity piece is sort of like the key thing that either makes or breaks a decentralized protocol yeah I think that that's certainly a theme on the podcast this year decentralized identity allows us to track our counterparties and uh you know in a privacy aware way so you know at least track who they are and build repeat interactions and positive some games on top of that and now Bitcoin passport is here and it's actually happening um we only have five minutes left so I'm wondering if there's anything I didn't ask that anyone wants to say uh just keeping mindful that among the four of us that we only have five minutes left so Jenny and maybe I'll go to you next yeah I mean I think the big thing is like this round ahead it's about a start or it has already started when you're listening to this like please go donate like test it out give us feedback like we're still on the alpha stages of the protocol and we really want to build with the community so please help us like test it out give us feedback um we'll link to the donation links in the show notes so uh let's just make sure to make that happen and like go in these next two weeks donate to different grants we've got a bunch of awesome grants in there um I stoked about who's actually going to be in these three rounds and like this whole thing happens and works well if we've got a community that's donating and participating so like we couldn't do it without any of you guys helping with funding the projects that are most important in this ecosystem yeah and and maybe just to like very quickly step back because I'm sure we'll have some people on this thinking like how can I get involved where do I apply et cetera and we haven't really talked about that but these these Alpha rounds uh we we put out a governance post and maybe we can link that or it's just discussion and feedback requests on the alpha rounds but these are not just open for brand new applications um of Grants unfortunately uh what what we decided sort of as as a down as a community is that you know for the for these early stage rounds as we're testing out the products and you know kind of civil and fraud prevention um we need to like sort of start small and grow so the three rounds uh web3 open source ethereum infrastructure and climate Solutions uh are only open to a subset of grantees from the old platform the centralized grants platform and we set that threshold on the amount they've raised in Prior rounds or the amount of unique donors and so we set out send out specific invites to to those existing grants to help was you know test out the new protocol and uh there were also new eligibility requirements so just because grants are invited doesn't mean they were automatically approved um but so these these are all kind of a a subset of existing projects um they all should be approved and live on the platform now so you can check them out and I'm not sure if we mentioned this but these rounds each have a 333 000 matching pool or die so a million dollars in total so unfortunately it is too late to join the round however what we want people to do is to you know donate to test out the protocol you know try to break it try to test out weird edge cases and help us report bugs and improve the user experience and then come you know March April we'll be doing many more rounds that are kind of open to the broader Community to brand new projects uh that you know will want everyone to join thanks Connor Nate any last words uh just underlying uh underlining what's been already been said like go donate the rounds we'll have the link in the show notes um and yeah give us feedback a lot of feedback for him as well but really excited to hear hear what you all think and also excited just to get the the tools in everybody's hands so thank you great well uh action item for The Listener go to getcoin.com click on the link up top to go to the alpha round and donate kick the tires on the new quadratic funding protocol and thanks to Janine Connor and Nate for joining me on the Springfield episode thanks for having us thanks so much yeah appreciate it that was fun [Music]
