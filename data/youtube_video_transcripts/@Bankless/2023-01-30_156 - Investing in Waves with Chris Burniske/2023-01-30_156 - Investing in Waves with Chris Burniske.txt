when I'm looking for a spot to surf on any given day I'm always looking for the best spot that has the fewest number of people because I'm not going out there to compete with other people I'm going out there to ride a wave and I think that you can draw parallel to how I invest and how placeholder invests in that we're not so much in competition with other funds we're not so much in competition with the leaders of these ecosystems we want to be intellectually drawn to certain projects and certain value sets and we want to ride that wave with that ecosystem welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys the episode title investing in waves are we talking about surfing are we talking Capital deployment the answer to that question is yes David and I are chatting today with one of our favorite crypto investors of all time Chris bernitski a few takeaways from this episode keep them keep track of them number one Chris uses the term trashy to describe many 2022 projects why do you use this word uh he also describes uses that word to describe their Founders number two why crypto is like surfing and how you catch the best waves number three we talk about the advanced warnings in 2021 that we should have all seen that crypto was in a massive bubble number four Chris's rules for staying sober don't fall in love with your coconuts if you have no idea what that means that's why you should listen this episode uh number five the current crypto Market cycle why Chris has suddenly flipped bullish he's bullish now in 2023 and finally we discuss Chris's bull case for Solana we end with that and a few other things this is a fantastic episode David what should folks pay attention to a while ago on a weekly roll-up run I gave the take that polymaths really understand crypto better than anyone stuck inside of one vertical like economists don't understand crypto but people who understand economics and computer science and psychology under crypto and Chris is really the embodiment of that he understands so many different ways to evaluate crypto and he applies them and that's really I think the magic behind Chris bernisky in this episode in particular we really carry through psyche psychology individual psychology Market psychology group think and how it changes throughout the Cycles how groupthink is different during the bear Market versus the bull market and how you can understand group think ride the waves of groupthink but not fall victim to group think and so thinking about this episode through the lens of individual psyche it's individual psychology is going to be very useful to just making it through the bear market and also not falling victim to the bugs the the virus of the bull market some housekeeping for you

Chris uh the last one we had with Chris was actually over two years ago two and a half years ago so it's this one's been a long time coming now we had Chris on with uh Kathy Wood from Arc invest uh in in the meanwhile but we wanting to pick Chris's brain for a while he is of course the co-founder of placeholder VC he's the author of crypto assets he's considered I think but Dave and I consider him as one of our mentors in this space in fact I would credit Chris as one of the three people most uh four Mount into getting me into crypto and particularly after I read his crypto assets book back in was that 2017 I believe Chris it's great to have you back on Bank list how you doing thanks Ryan and thanks for the warm intro good to see you both you know what I'm just I just wanted to Glow you up there because um thanks I'm really happy to be in crypto and uh you know I I first started getting interested in in Bitcoin in 2014 but there wasn't very much else there in crypto for me uh and I think that changed partially after I started getting involved in ethereum and then I started to understand the asset space after after the book crypto assets so thank you my friend um I probably didn't say enough good things about you I I I'm glad to be in crypto and it's in no small part because of you well that warms my heart here and um you know the reason Jack and I wrote crypto assets at the time was uh because there were really only Bitcoin books and um the space was growing to be much larger than Bitcoin and of course writing a book we we started writing that book December of 2016 and we finished the first draft March of 17. in March of 17 was actually right when everything started going crazy um like I remember through March we're like watching the prices like 2x 3x 5x like I think Ripple went crazy all this kind of stuff and we're like oh my God like how do we um how do we cover this in a book right um because things were moving so fast but we just proceeded you know with the core things that we thought were important to investigate and I think in time it will just be viewed as a history book right it's a point in time it's kind of between 16 and 17. lots of people asked for an update I think think we could write a killer crypto assets V2 it's just finding the time I think the the decision to not Chase what was currently happening in crypto in that present moment and stick to your guns about writing via for the original tent uh the book crypto assets and not and not adapting it to whatever it was the present moment of crypto at the time is very on brand for you and something I appreciate about you Chris is that no matter what's going on in the machinations of the crypto Cycles you always seem to be able to keep a level head on your shoulders and kind of see through the short-term noise and the crypto Twitter conversation of the moment and keep yourself focused on on the long term so I guess we weren't done blowing you up enough in the intro well yeah you know like I would kind of echo that because it just didn't uh yeah I mean it wasn't just that it interested me in crypto after kind of reading that book more but it also informed how I view the space which is I think at you know where of a similar Viewpoint in that crypto assets was very much a kind of thesis-driven investment type book as David said it wasn't about kind of the narrative at the time of you know xrp is going to be the new Swift or whatever it was back in 2017. um you really laid out a framework for how you actually evaluate the value of these things and I think that thesis-driven investment is really what we've tried to instill in in bankless is this is about long-term perspectives you know three to five to ten to twenty year perspectives not the current narrative in the moment we're not Traders uh we're not narrative um investors and Traders rotators we we are fundamentals investors and that kind of framework I think still applies very well definitely and I mean you know Society is a string of generations that I'll learn from each other um and I learned a lot of that from Kathy Wood you know working at arconvest um in the time that I was writing that book I was getting to know my two partners at placeholder Joel manager and Brad Burnham who are both very strong thesis thinkers um or thesis crafters and so um and then also around when I was finishing crypto assets Joel and I were completing um our thesis summary for placeholder itself and so there were a lot of people around me as well you know no no book is written by an author just sitting on an island um and I learned a lot from all of those folks that um bolstered you know my own conviction added pieces to it um and you know all those people remain in my life and continue to um ground me you know as as we proceed through crypto and then I'm sure we'll get into crypto Twitter and how I use that um I think that can be destabilizing if you're not careful yeah I've felt destabilized at times to put it mildly on crypto Twitter um well let's start here though because I want to provide some continuities so the last time we had you just solo on an episode was over two years ago in fact almost three years ago can you believe it um I think that's the record for the longest gap between repeat guests yeah and this is um this was episode number 20 when we were just getting started okay now we're in the uh the hundreds probably drawing closer to the thousands yeah built's a huge brand you know my hat off to you like oh I watched you guys rise all through the last bear market and become stars in the bowl and you know here we are back in the bear well thank you for taking a risk on us by coming on this obscure podcast back in 2020 but I I want to ask you now so reflecting on like the last two and a half years or so um I remember that the episode we did at the time where you you described kind of this bullishness on crypto abortionists on ethereum you describe kryptos this uh infinite white space was a line you used um and I want to ask you about the last two and a half years so what do you feel like you got the most right over the last two and a half years sure I'd say the most important thing I got right which was not easy to get right at the time and that was right around when we spoke as well was just ethereum um in 2018 2019 around when I started noticing you guys and I'm sure you recollect this as well um eth was crashing right it was going through an Ico deleveraging event um Bitcoin dominance was Rising rapidly to the upside uh Bitcoin Maxis were out with the pitchforks um The Narrative was that eath was dying eth was irrelevant even if you talked with um a lot of VCS you know say traditional VCS were just like uh you know cryptos doing that thing again it's you know falling 80 90 percent just forget about it and move on to the next thing and then even crypto specific or crypto Savvy VCS were losing conviction ethereum they're like you know it's taking too long to process Network upgrades you know is the transition to proof of stake ever going to happen um you have all these next generation l1's coming about that are going to eat ethereum's lunch so um and you guys remember this right you remember it oh yeah how oh yeah um and so eth fell sub 100 you know that was pretty shocking like the first day that youth fell sub 100 I like I just didn't even want to look at training you know it was like so painful um and you know that's actually part of my own Journey right it's like getting better and better on those horrible days of just being able to withstand it and actually just keep buying as opposed to being so disgusted that you you can't handle it um so that you know um hardening process say of of um having conviction and bolstering conviction in ethereum while most people were running in the other direction was really important for myself really important for for placeholder um and it it allowed us to um you know have a very large East position itself but then also do a ton of venture investing around ethereum um seating teams like um you know we see that CK sync we see that balancer we see that Uma um and and a number of other core ethereum names and the valuations were amazing the teams were top-notch there wasn't really that much competition for it because most VCS were looking in other places um so you know directionally that was um I think the most correct thing um you know from a financial perspective but more importantly you know from a values-based perspective and what it brought to the the crypto space and uh how about the flip side of that so I got asked the the other question of over the last two and a half years what what did you miss what did you get wrong well I'm always surprised by how much the trashiest projects can pump um trashy so um yeah trashy um and you know I think an easy one to just say would be Luna um and I remember speaking with loon the Luna team it was the Defcon that was held in Japan I forget when that was um but it was in that time frame um the last bear and Luna was sub a dollar and I remember specifically I just wanted one question answered and that was did the price of Luna have to keep going up for the system to remain stable and it was danced around a lot but ultimately the answer was yes Luna has to go up in price forever um and that's so clearly a broken system like nothing goes up forever um and nonetheless the price of Luna seemingly went up forever um and you know I like if I had been a Trader I could have minted I don't know 100 200x like something like that and so it's that's one place where like temporally for a period I was wrong as a Trader or like financial gain maximizer I was wrong um and then ultimately I was right but it takes time and you kind of just have to you know stick to to to what you believe I would say something where I remain wrong because I guess you could say with Luna is ultimately Vindicated but something where I remain wrong is we we expected nfts to be a big thing I mean nfts is just the non-fungible side of the Universe from the fungible side of the universe that's clearly going to be huge in the digital context but what I didn't expect is for the vector to be you know pfp profile picture nfts oh yeah you know of monkeys worth hundreds of thousands of dollars um that was surprising uh and you know now I've I've accepted it and you know I would say one thing I that 2021 taught me is if I have a really allergic reaction to something I need to look closer at that thing uh an allergic reaction is not an excuse to look away but it's actually a reason to look closer um because it's like that uh intensity that I feel in a say negative Direction probably to a very different person you know incurs intensity in a positive direction um and you know this is I think part of the practice as an investor of um stripping your emotions out of the process I mean you can use your emotions you can observe your emotions but you shouldn't let them shape the intellectual process so they can be indicators to you that feed into the intellectual process but the intellectual process should remain um you know objective and rooted in um study and reasoning that's a fascinating lesson I I hope bankless listeners heard that if you have an allergic reaction to something it doesn't necessarily mean stay away it means Chris is saying investigate it further yeah yeah ask why figure that one out because there might be something to it I I want to go back really quickly before we continue moving uh to that the word that you used which piqued my interest when you're describing Luna uh trashy it was a very interesting way to describe a project and I I'm I think I'm taking that to mean as I read between the lines a trashy project would be one that Chris thinks is focused on short-termism short-term price pumps for example short shortcuts in general that would make a project in your eyes more trashy than another and you're saying that was very much exemplified in Luna at the time is that what makes it a project trashy it's just this short-termest type of thinking in your mind yeah and it's a strong word for me to use I guess but if you so it's definitely that short-termism it's definitely that focus on you know the pumps and the announcements and the announcements of the announcements and that's also even just the way that the leader or the leadership comports themselves and if you observed doe Quan's Behavior online he was not interested in rigorous intellectual debate like you look at how vitalik you know behaves or you look at Mustafa from Celestia or um toli from Solana I think those people whether you agree with them or not you will see them sometimes go very deep in debate and like there will be different types of snark that they'll inject because they're all human and that's fine but the overwhelming response is not one of like snark or you know derogatory responses or whatever and what I saw in dokwan's behavior um was basically someone who's high in their own Supply power tripping and the responses are not one of substance but they're trashy and like they're geared to um like rile up a large group of the population right and be like rah-rah like speak to those emotions we were talking about which clouds reasoning right and so like it's a manipulative process in my mind um if if the followers of this individual aren't aware of it um because they feel like they're going to battle they're all charged up you know they're all in they're making money um but it really shuts down say uh the the more important thinking parts of the brain call it the prefrontal cortex or whatever um and that almost always leads to bad outcomes in crypto of course I think this is really uh tapping into one of the things that I think makes you stand out as a navigator of the crypto world is you have this inherent focus on um individual psychology being being self-aware but also the wear of the biases of of others and the way that psychology changes as a result of the crypto cycle everyone's like psyche does change depending on where we are in the market and honestly like the market is of course our Collective psyches and so maybe another way to identify what a trashy project is is a project that creates a certain amount of just psychological response in people that is only sustainable during active uh High activity High fervor bull market type uh psychological environments uh does that track with you and then how do you this this also uh if listeners don't know you are a surfer uh and I think this ties in that kind of behavior ties into surfing where you have to be patient you have to know your limits just like how do you think about these things and and how do you navigate them from a psychological perspective because I think everything that you say is always rooted in some sort of uh admission of bias or psychological understanding can you just elaborate on all of this well um gosh there's a lot in there well so I'd say first you're you're correct and you're further defining of trashy and it's like um another thing that happens is um there's this like bubble psychology that's created around a project like that um where because the leader does it it justifies everyone else to just like respond in this screaming way to any criticism right um so that's something that happens but actually what that creates If You observe that um is like it's a monoculture right it's and like from uh my science background and anyone can really know this a monoculture is weaker right you want biodiversity in an ecosystem um biodiversity creates a lot of resilience um and so like you look at the ethereum ecosystem there's a lot of debate I would argue same within Cosmos same within Solana and we can come to Solana but like at the depths of the bottom uh last year for Solana there was a lot of good conversation about how to make Solana better and like people acknowledging say that um you know the things done around FTX and Alameda um needed to be learned from it wasn't people like screaming and being like leave us alone or like you know um and and so the substance of the conversation is really important to me um and and what ecosystems are trying to improve upon or learn upon relating it to surfing I'm the type of surfer who um I so I love a bunch of different kinds of waves um and I come to know the waves very well and for people who don't know surfing like at least surfing on a reef is deterministic so the bathymetry or the underwater topography will determine the shape of a wave and then swell Direction in a bunch of local conditions will further Define how good the wave is going to be but I am always when I'm looking for a spot to surf on any given day I'm always looking for the best spot that has the fewest number of people because I'm not going out there to compete with other people I'm going out there to ride a wave right and and I think that you could make uh you could draw a parallel to how I invest and how placeholder invests in that you know we're not so much in competition with other funds um we're not so much you know in competition with the leaders of these ecosystems we want to be intellectually drawn to certain projects um and certain value sets and we want to ride that wave with that ecosystem hopefully it's a growing wave um and we're not so much distracted or perturbed or even drawn to a wave that has you know hundreds of thousands of people on it because all those people are there it's more like oh that's a really nice looking wave and there's actually not that many people over there I should probably go ride that wave I love this illustration of I I think it should be pretty clear for listeners like that is an investing uh metaphor uh and it also just works so well with with surfing uh it and Ron and I of course opened up this podcast talking about like hey we really respect you as a thinker and as a thesis-driven investor and a lot of that has been imbued in bankless right like ride the Theses over the long term not the not the short-term narratives and something uh uh I guess I'm kind of proud of is is during 2022 uh January 4th of 2022 a little bit over a year ago I got in a fight with uh Daniel sesta uh and then he sent his frog Army after us and then two or three weeks later the the system the Wonderland system blew up uh a few weeks later we got into a fight with dokwan uh and durwell dokwan and his army was at the height of the cresting cresting of its wave and then a few weeks later Tara Luna blew up blew up uh same thing kind of followed with three arrows capital and then same thing followed with SBF when we had him on there seems to be this moment where these waves crest and because bankless we are a media company we we talk about things that are cresting uh there seems to be this pattern of people especially in these in the second half of a bull market uh where they're cresting and that is their last gasp for air before they go under uh and I think I think the alignment that we have is as bankless as a thesis-driven media company and placeholder as a thesis driven Venture Capital firm is is we're approaching these things in the same way where like there's a big wave and we'll talk about it on Bank list but man does it rub us the wrong way I'm sure that's how how you react as an investor as well well yeah I I mean I think the podcast you guys did with um Eric Voorhees and um SPF was you know a seminal moment um in crypto and I think it that was the moment when a lot of people realized Sam had no clothes you know Emperor had no clothes um so yeah it's it's a tricky position you guys are in um I mean we're all put in tricky positions but like how do you um remain you know how do you behave in such a way where you're not going to push away say all of these guests because you want to get them on your show right but then you want to ask them tough questions and you want to in that question asking reveal who they actually are but if you irritate them too much while they're at the crest of their wave you know they're probably not going to join or they might rage quit or you know there's there's a balance there I think one thing we've learned is just like ask a lot of questions and I think that maybe not over the short run but over the long run um people are smart yeah we have we have faith in the people who listen to the bankless podcast and um if you can allow an individual to kind of articulate themselves ask lots of questions tell their story then listeners can kind of decide for themselves um that was very much the case in the Voorhees and SBF debate that you were just mentioning Chris where it's basically we're just like okay you guys talk yeah and through the process of talking that's when Sam really revealed that indeed he was wearing no clothes before he took that approach too he was just like asking quick questions you know firing something back letting letting SBF respond uh yeah that was that was the model I you know I want to get to kind of uh the market and your sentiment as well because I I think I recall on Twitter um because I follow you and I encourage everybody to to go follow Chris uh berniski's Twitter account uh we'll include a link in the show notes um but you were somewhat bearish on crypto in uh 2021 and 2022 and I should specify not long-term bearish I don't think and again this is just my perception so you correct me if I'm wrong sure but this was a time when a lot of people believed in this idea popularized by three hours Capital called the super cycle which is crypto will never go down in the way that it's gone down in previous Cycles like there'll be no more 70 plus drawdowns in this asset class we've reached Mass adoption now and we're in the super cycle phase I distinctly recall you on Twitter during this time period where everyone's bullish pushing back against that um I I guess I'm curious as to why you had the conviction to push against that in that time that was not that was not as popular uh what indicators did you see how did you know that we were not in a super cycle at the time if you can put put us back in these shoes in in 2021 and maybe early 2022. sure um well I think the first thing to recognize is that a uh super cycle narrative is a symptom of euphoria so it's actually something that I would look for as confirmation for me that actually strengthens my conviction that something's not right it doesn't actually make it harder for me to be bearish it makes it easier um and I think that's an important unlock that a lot of people have to go through is um not feeling the tug of really strong momentum at extreme moments of the market either you know bull or bear but instead seeing how strong that momentum or that tug is and it's you know Euphoria at the top it's hysteria at the bottom and using that as the marker or the confirmation that something's not right and it's not going to last forever um in in the direction that everyone is saying it's going to last so that would be kind of lesson number one from that point in time um as I recall I think I got pretty publicly bearish in Q4 of um 2021. I I actually got faked out in May of 2021 you know I don't get everything right I one thing I'm worried about is um people are starting to be like you know Chris is always going to be right okay we glowed him up too much David we gotta we gotta have some put down the second half episode I'm definitely wrong um you know many times um and 2021 or may of 2021 I was wrong in that I got blindsided I don't know if you guys remember May of 2021 but oh yeah um that that was basically the blow off top of defy summer 2020 um everything was going crazy I think that's the first time that eth got into the four thousands um quickly very deeply yeah very quickly a bunch of defy names hit their highs actually in May of 2021 and never got back to those highs um and then like June July um I think even into August I'm not looking at the charts right now but there were a few months where like we I think BTC retraced to the high 20s low 30s um and you know a bunch of names got walloped and by wallet I mean you know over 50 declines if not more um and I didn't expect that to happen in May so I was kind of Blindsided um but then June July August it didn't feel like we were done yet um and then I would say what started to unnerve me into October but it was really like uh November December was um the parabolic rise of a number of new names right so like Luna Avalanche Solana um and then the behavior that accompanied those parabolic Rises right so like first there's the super cycle that's the symptom of euphoria then you look at the charts they're parabolic on the new names and people are saying oh well BTC and eth aren't quite parabolic but like the thing is and this is where it helps to have been in crypto for a long time um as you understand the maturity of these assets you know that as they get bigger as they get more liquid um you know they're going to move a little less so like BTC will move the least then eth then you know probably next cycle soul and so like you you kind of start to understand the risk Spectrum in that way but we're seeing parabolic prices um something I was seeing on the Venture side was actually Innovation was slowing um while deal Place uh deal Pace was increasing and like basically frantic deal Pace where people are like you know we're nice to meet you we closed yesterday kind of thing um and um and then also even just the ways that um entrepreneurs treat VCS changes bear to Bull so like in a bowl um you'll have a lot more entitled behavior um from Entre entrepreneurs and then I think the important thing for a VC in a bear is to not then pay it back by being entitled you know like because the balance of power swings in in a bowl the entrepreneur has all the power and a bear a VC has a lot of the power um and so just observing um you know say more bad entrepreneur behavior um or just uncouth I guess entrepreneur behavior um that was happening a lot into uh late 2021 so there were a ton of markers um you could also see it I think in like a number of like uh and we'll get into some on-chain stuff but like look into Bitcoin I think is a great resource public resource for a lot of people to track um Bitcoin on chain metrics and ratios and you could see it getting pretty topy so when you have a crazy convergence of things like that um it's it's it's it's a very strong indicator so I'm never using one indicator and the last thing I would say is like um growth equities have been in Decline for a while like inflation was starting to Peak up like the writing was starting to be on the wall that um you know the tides were going to change from a monetary perspective and um I'm not as much an expert in that round but I talked with Kathy Wood a fair amount you know and um and I have other people that I subscribe to um in terms of newsletters and that's a benefit of being an institution um that were like giving me some warning signs of the of the tides turning Chris I want to ask uh you said you flipped bearish in the Q4 of 2021 and I remember I remember that you were the first like uh crypto Twitter person that I remember who was like you know okay I am now bearish and I'm tweeting about my bearishness uh and uh for for me and many of many others it's like man that would that's really early like there's got to be so much left in this in this bull market uh and I mean it's a 10K baby and like you and you were a little bit early in terms of uh a little it was a little bit early in time it was a little bit early in price It ultimately came to be right uh because we went down so bad but you had to have gone yeah I think you went throughout 2021 being bearish sticking to your guns while a bunch of crazy stuff happened uh and then only to be proven right it would well into to 2022 and I and I remember like my personal relationship with with 2021 was hearing the words oh that's a top signal oh that's a top signal oh that's a top signal every single month of 2021 and I I remember the top signals of 2017 which was my first real exposure into a crypto cycle even investing in the first place like Katy Perry's uh digital asset painted fingernails like yeah that was a really good top signal and it was also the top uh throughout 2021 people couldn't you couldn't go a week without getting a top signal but by half halfway into 2021 I was like or yeah 2021 I was like what's the point of like listening to these top signals we had top signal yesterday and we all have a top signal tomorrow like I'm getting top signal fatigue so how did you maintain how did you like can uh stick to your guns because I started writing off every single top signal that I had in 2021 because it didn't matter like their top singles left and right but you stuck to your guns the whole way through and through you never fell victim to the super cycle like bug that everyone caught including myself like so how did you just grit your teeth and like uh go all the way through 2021 without uh uh having to capitulate yeah well actually it's funny uh uh a moment in crypto Twitter that I remember is you responded to one of my tweets in Q4 being like shut up Chris I'm busy collecting free money like doing donuts with like dollar bills falling and I was like uh thanks David um somewhere David knew that this was oh yeah I am the top signal yeah I'll add to the top signals out there um I mean I want to be clear about like the fact that I'm always making tons of mistakes um in entries and exits and and maybe I shouldn't train that as mistakes such as like I'm not trying to optimize like buying everything or right at the bottom and selling everything right at the top because it's actually impossible um and anyone who aspires to do it is just gonna end up getting whiplashed because when prices are really low they're gonna just keep waiting and waiting and waiting and be like oh well you know btc's at 15K I'll buy it at 10K and then BTC 10K and they're like well I'll buy it at 5K right or you know the the the flip happens to the upside and so what I do is um you know kind of an easy way um and I always have to be careful because placeholders are registered investment advisor but like a mental heuristic or or like a framework to use would be okay if you have an investment right um and you put you you put your cost into it so that's your 1X so like you put a hundred dollars in you've got a hundred dollars for that investment so you're at 1X if that investment goes 10x right so now you have 10x your cost you should consider taking in my opinion at least 2x out you just guaranteed doubled your money and you have eight acts of that investment writing that investment doubles again you now have 16x of your original investment you know still in the market if you take something like 4X out you're now sitting at a 6X realized and you still have 12x of your initial investment wait you could do that you could take money off the table you're allowed to do this possible that 12x doubles it says 24x you take another 4X you just 10x you guarantee 10x your money and you still have 20x of what you originally put it and now there's only so long that you can play this game um but I encourage people to you know look at their cost in different Investments they've made set up now like in the bear Market you know prices where they would be really happy you know if it hit this price and what amount what multiple of their costs would they take off the table at certain prices and this is called chaunching out or legging out um and you can do the same thing legging in you know where you buy at certain prices and you just keep buying and buy and buying because if you don't do it and if you don't have a plan you won't exit and you'll get lost in the bubble psychology um or you'll get lost in the bearish psychology so like if you don't have a plan then like you know when it let's say you put in like I don't know let's say you put in a thousand dollars and it's now at ten thousand dollars you're gonna be like well I'm gonna wait until this is a hundred thousand dollars before I you know take any money off and then once that 100 000 you're like well I'm not that far from a million so I'll wait for a million and then you know you get caught in that as opposed to um you know taking money off the table it doesn't mean that you're not a believer in the ecosystem or ecosystems that you're supporting and in some ways I would say um selling when everyone is buying and buying when everyone is selling is actually helpful to the volatility of that asset right because you're like you're dampening the upside and you're dampening the downside because you're doing the counter Trend Behavior so not too euphoric not too depressed yeah and then like the thing that people will struggle with in both situations is like you know let's say like I don't know you started in the last cycle you started taking profits um when eth was at 3K you know well then by the time it's at 4500 or whatever you're like oh it just ran another 50 I could have made 50 more but then like when he said you know 800 or a thousand or 1200 you're like well I definitely should have sold at 3K what was I doing and so the important thing is to like not kick yourself and not aim for Perfection um have a plan um that's good enough that you're satisfied with um and chances are you'll you'll do well if you stick to that plan um getting a two to three to four x is unheard of in almost any other asset class you know um and so and then on the downside um when things are dropping you know similarly if you have price targets and you buy there and it falls another 50 so long as you keep buying and you don't shy up the thing that people do in Bear markets is they make their trade sizes smaller and smaller that's actually the wrong thing to do you want to either keep your trade sizes equal or go bigger because the units you will buy at the bottom with an equal trade size or a greater trade size will blow you away later um and then you can end up with a really good average price even if you started buying a little high I think this is like Evergreen an evergreen Insight right uh and it's basically that the idea is look next bull market you're going to be drunk okay and the time to make your plan of how to get home from the party is not after you're drunk all right you got to make those plans in advance When You're Sober and when you can think it through not when you're like drunk and partying with everybody else because that's what a bull market is and it felt this way the end of 2021 didn't it people getting tattoos I mean like with their favorite crypto assets like the market was crazy everyone was drunk and if you didn't have your plan you weren't going to uh actually ever sell yeah another thing that happens um and and this I you know I've kind of developed the analogy more animalistically but it's like if you think of us um you know I live in a tropical place so I'll use coconuts and these crypto assets are these magical coconuts when they're going up and it's like they grow brighter and brighter green the more they they go up and we become more and more attached to them we get the tattoos you know we go to parties we really identify with them we tell everyone about them so the more they go up the more they're these magical green coconuts that we just can't possibly part with yes so if you don't set a plan to part with them then you're so emotionally attached that you can't possibly sell them and then it's super painful if you part with some of them and then they multiply even more and you're like oh my God you know if I hadn't have sold those 10 coconuts they'd be worth 20 coconuts now right and so you kind of drive yourself crazy um with the magical coconuts to the downside they become these withered nasty red decaying coconuts and you're like oh my God I had so many beautiful green coconuts and now they're all withered and you know how do I only have two coconuts when I'm once had 100 coconuts right and then like that pain and it truly is pain that it causes in your brain then causes you to act irrationally and sometimes that will cause people to capitulate sell the bottom because they just can't take it anymore they're rotting they smell bad you want to throw in the trash they turn from loving them to hating them it's a very emotional thing I think this is the first time the word coconut has ever been uttered on the bank like 10 times just then uh Chris not not too long ago last November we did a Twitter spaces together and we talked about a number of different uh indicators that the market had bottomed and this is uh to to save myself from tweeting at you at during the bull market when I noticed that you flipped bullish I was like oh Chris berniski's football list the seasons have changed and I was around in November of uh this last year so I'm wondering if we can if we can kind of run through some of the things that made the changing of the seasons happen for you there was a number of different things we talked about is there some on-chain indicators there's some crypto Twitter uh sentiment uh that you were looking at also some macro inflation what what triggered the changing of the seasons for for you Chris sure well first off I'd say you know that was well done by you and that you you know moved on the dime and intro week we set up that space and um FTX was in the midst of melting down I think that week it was the week after yeah or the week after yeah bullish yeah well that's the right time right that is the time that is the time um I think what had happened is that I was waiting for one last big capitulation um and when I saw after Tara Luna you mean yeah yeah correct after Tara 3ac if you just looked at like um what was going on in the markets um in the macro data and and by markets I mean equities and crypto but it was particularly apparent in crypto we just like we were kind of weekly rallying but we couldn't really get off the floor it was kind of clear we're just limping along um and that reminded me quite a bit of the back half of 18 where we just kind of limped along and we were like limping limping limping no strength no strength and um an environment like that when there's so much fear you get one more big Catalyst and and like prices were already pretty low but you get one more big downside Catalyst and you get like a major capitulation flush right because like you're limping along because there's not that many buyers um people are like a little like they're like well I don't I don't want to sell here but they don't have a bunch of conviction to hold and then you get that event where it's like FTX and it's like I'm out you know and then it's just a capitulation flush so that definitely happened in the price charts we we got capitulation um sentiment wise you also saw basically um everyone go into hysteria I shouldn't say everyone but the majority go into hysteria um and you know there are a lot of previously credible well-reasoned people that were running around spreading rumors on sparse information um and you know with with flawed reasoning and you know basically everyone in their brother and sister was um going to be insolvent next right and like once you start to see enough of those claims go viral that you know to not be true um then it's like okay this is like Peak irrationality to the downside um and then one thing I want to I want to pull out right there is you just said enough these claims go viral it's one part where people are making the claims but the sentiment of people also need to enable those claims to go viral and that's the other half of the equation there's there's two players there's the people seating the takes and then there's the market accepting them and that is going viral and so both factors have to be true that's actually a really good point um because it's a way that I use my Twitter handle um or that I observe others other other Twitter handles like bullish takes will be Max virality at the top right and bearish takes will be minimum virality at the top right and then at the bottom bearish takes will be Max virality um and bolus takes will be like you know people just don't want to hear it or like there's like hundreds of responses as to like why you're incorrect so we can use Twitter to generate Alpha we just have to do the opposite basically okay this is only for you and you don't get to share it it doesn't get shared and know that if you share your opinion people will hate you until like three months later um but uh so so that was like crypto specific stuff and then um we also spent some time talking about macro and you know the rates of change and we're seeing some early signs of um you know inflation tapering also there were Whispers because that was November that um in December was going to be a 50 bips hike from the FED as opposed to 75 um that ultimately came to be true and so um there were a number of things within the macro data um that were pointing to slowing rates of change and I remember spending some time talking about that and it's worth reiterating because this was a key lesson um that Kathy taught me which is you know markets are always forward-looking and so they're always taking rates of change and projecting them and so um markets don't bottom on the absolute best or worst numbers they tend to bottom or top on the apps on the absolute highest or lowest rates of change um and and that's a really key thing to drill into the the rate of change um or you know and since we're talking about psych just to add one more quick uh since this episode is really about psyche and and how the brain works in relation to the markets uh your brain doesn't release dopamine when it receives a reward it received it releases dopamine on the anticipation of receiving reward so it's always front running so the rate of change is is built into markets and also your brain too yeah that's awesome I like that um and so um you know like at the margin if you have like a really bad rate of change which is what we're going through for a lot of 22 and that rate of change is starting to get less bad those first signs of less bad are really important to pay attention to now people a lot of like more uninformed people will be like but inflation is still so high but that's the absolute number um and what's more important is that the rate of change is starting um to to falter or get less bad and that is the setup for more optimism right because then people can start to project okay by this time you know inflation will have gotten better and you know we can buy risk assets again and rates will be at XYZ or whatever it might be so this is why you uh you flipped uh bullish then Chris so is it is it true that of course none of this is financial advice none of us have a crystal ball but um do you think we've seen the worst of the uh of kind of the dip have we already seen the bottom for at least assets like Bitcoin and eth um I think that eth and soul have seen their bottoms I think there's a small chance BTC could revisit its bottom um and that's you know maybe a little counter consensus but it's only because like I mean Souls 3x off its bottom um and eth is 2x off its bottom and uh btc's like 50 off its bottom um and so it and and btc's the first to be like majorly influenced um by you know a bad situation in macro land and so even though I expect things to continue to ameliorate here it wouldn't surprise me in the second half this year to have some major shock um you know or something that um sets us aback and I I can more easily see um BTC falling 33 you know back to um you know that level presuming it stays here which I actually also don't think it stays here um so there's a chance that that happens right that BTC would go back to its bottom and that's just specifically answering your question um what I anticipate to happen is everything puts in higher lows so like I could see 50k is like an important number for BTC so I could see a reach for that and not quite getting it um I could see you know eth reaching for you know call it three between three and four okay um I could see Seoul reaching for 80 to 100 kind of thing um but then like there's really strong support for BTC at 20K um for East right around where it is now to 1200 um for Seoul at 30. so I'm prepared for a whiplash scenario like that um I think that like if we get another big move up here um which I kind of expect that's going to really cause people to fomo and that's going to start to get mainstream attention and there'll be like this mini bubble I think where people be like oh I gotta allocate or like people who've been on the sidelines be like I can't take this anymore right and then you're setting up for like um uh uh just a Max paint scenario like Max Whiplash people get like overly enthusiastic but you know rates aren't at a place that we can sustain huge moves and risk assets I also think there's a lot more work to do on the Innovation side of crypto to really have uh um fundamentals driven um rally like sustained rally and so that's where you know I think we'll get whiplashed at some point this year yeah certainly I think uh people will make the mistake of not resetting what normal prices are in their head as they go through this bear Market where you know the bot we've perhaps we've set the bottoms but for people with or will probably forget that like going up uh to like maybe two-thirds up to our previous all-time highs is now kind of the normal and now it's considered inside of a particular range this is exactly what happened uh during last bear Market 2018 to 2020 where ether bottomed at 80 and then went all the way up to the high high price of 360 dollars before going back down to a hundred dollars and people just weren't expecting a three three and a half X in prices but uh without without triggering a bull market like how could you go up three and a half X without that being a bull market uh and it was exactly the moment that people fomo into that that went on for like a year and a half or so before we actually broke out as a result of D5 summer and and uh and actually did begin to set new highs uh and I actually remember that moment in 2020 where uh ether ranged between like 300 and 100 like three different times and then when it broke up and hit like something like 425 me and many other people around here too was like oh yeah it's on like real we all believe it it was pretty easy to identify in that one moment but for a lot of newcomers that's a novel experience for them so so Chris what when you after we go through this perhaps 12 to 18 months of chop that we are perhaps expecting what what are you really looking for to say like all right we're done here like the bear Market's over uh new new bull markets on like what what needs to be true for that to be your reaction I think the main thing that needs to be true is um we need to see new applications and New Uses of crypto that are blowing all our minds and that's what 2020 was with defy summer who were like whoa like this is crazy you know this is a whole financial system and yeah like it's rough at the edges but like it works and I can do all the stuff that I can do in a traditional Financial system and I couldn't do that in 2017 couldn't do it in 18 couldn't do it at 19. but I could do it in 20 pretty seamlessly with the full Suite of services um and so um and this is where I would kind of segment a future expansion into like a conviction or fundamentals based rally first that kind of exhausts itself Then followed by like the copycat scammer Euphoria rally which will take certain things higher um but will actually like really divorce itself from fundamentals um and so and and that conviction fundamentals-based rally just requires new things to be built right and like and even actually for the different layer ones you know very much including eth all those new things being built drives a lot of underlying Demand by pressure for the the underlying layer 1 assets right and then like everyone starts being like wow all this new stuff is happening no way am I selling oh no way am I selling eth or Soul or a box or whatever right um and so then like you have all this Demand by people being really excited um by what's happening and that's what tends to set up these kind of like step ladder moves upwards you know what though Chris um all that seems too simple in some ways and yeah here's what I'm like asking about it's like isn't this how you know the 2014 through 2017 kind of the the doldrums and then something new happened oh that new thing was smart contracts and this thing called ethereum then 2017 uh we had icos and you know makeup and the exact same thing happened 2018 to 2020 all the way to do defy summer it's like should we just is our base case then just to anticipate the same thing playing out once again and even on like a similar time scale like okay yeah this is the point in time where you have like uh two years or so of building and we wait for cool stuff to happen and then after that you know we get to kind of the fundamentals rally and then after that we get kind of the you know the fake scam Rally or whatever people you know people want to call it and it's roughly on like the same you know four to five year uh cycle is that just the base case is that how crypto works because if so it feels like this is so predictable man because we've seen this story at least twice maybe three times well so this is a really great question and um makes me there's a lot of ways to approach answering it um on one hand so I've bounced around in my mind about this but I and where I've ultimately settled is um assume humans don't change because they don't that much um right and so like that is the the starting assumption and then if you were to deviate from the pattern you have to have really good reasons why you're going to deviate versus just saying oh this is too easy to predictable because like I went through the this is too easy too predictable uh into 2021 you know and that that bowl and then the bear of last year into this year so I've kind of been through that of like how is this happening again like this is this is ridiculous yeah um and so but despite me feeling that it didn't prevent it from happening right um so that would be uh my starting place is what are the reasons for this being different I would say the number one biggest reason or maybe there's well I I feel more strongly about there being one and that's just where rates go like if if a risk for free rate of return is four to five percent um for a sustained period that sucks so much energy out of risk assets like equities um like crypto because all of a sudden your base rate of return is is you know five percent so in order to like take more risk than a treasury you know you got to be getting 10 15 20 30 you know or or more um out of something like crypto and so that just ends up discounting all risk assets more so that I could see um clamping things and and you have some like some heavy weights of traditional Finance you know drucken Miller or um Howard marks from Oak Tree saying that like we have a regime change like this is going to be a fundamentally different period going forward like these guys are predicting like a flat decade for like risk-on assets aren't they they are now where I start to question maybe these guys are too old and too out of touch or too actually like beholden to their own patterns is when I look at and this is where you would put me more in the the Kathy Wood camp where I look at the the rate of change and the rate of info uh Innovation and like the massive amount of like GDP growth occurring within crypto it's insane right it's like triple digit caggers every year and and those guys marks and whoever they're not paying attention to that or like I mean drucken Miller is favorable to beat BTC but they're not like in the weeds being like Oh my God look at how much this is growing and if they could believe that an economy was growing you know at a triple digit kagger they might be like well that could probably you know overwhelm a a stricter money environment and so this is where I guess I have some conflict in my own head um the way that I deal with it is I actually don't really care whatever happens because like I have a plan I have you know price targets which are meaningful to me in placeholder and if we hit those price Targets in 2025 I'll take action if we hit him in 2027 because things are more delayed then it'll just take me more time and I'm not in a rush right um I believe that the you know we will have multiple crypto networks in the trillion plus range right um and so um that's where my head is no one can say exactly how long it'll take the starting case would be okay if we just repeat the past Cycles 2024 is a big year next year is like a like Rising expansion 2025 is the crazy year right if we're starting to see the patterns then it's like okay pay attention guys like it's happening again whether you like it or not the other thing I'd point out is we're all crypto nerds we live breathe and eat this but for most of the population crypto kind of comes and goes right and it's like oh like this cool thing is back like I'm just gonna like YOLO into this it's not like oh we're doing this again and like look at where eth is and PTC is and like I shouldn't use this app or buy this you know monkey pfp it's like wow I just really want that thing because everyone wants that thing and then that's kind of the the herd psychology that'll fuel a lot of stuff so even though we're maybe going through this meta experience of how is this happening in Mass to all of us I think that a lot of people are not going through that meta experience and just you know going for it and the the bad memories of crypto from a few years past have like faded for them I guess that's true David not everyone in the world subscribed to the bank list podcast yet and so some people some percentage of the population will miss this episode with Chris and not realize What's Happening Here Chris I want to open up the conversation to uh you you gave me the line uh people don't change uh and another topic of conversation uh and I'll premise this with uh the episode coming out on the bank this podcast after this one is with Anatoly from from Solana nice and one of the conversations that that you and I have had that is that um uh eth versalana is the new Bitcoin versus eth uh whereas like in 2018 to 2020 the small small young ethereum Community was getting absolutely hazed by the bitcoiners we were just we could not break out in discourse we were just getting punched down like none of none of what we said like really like stuck with um but we believed it and so we stuck through uh and I would like to say that history has definitely Vindicated us uh definitely been on the right side of like yes you can run an ethereum node it is actually easy to do that no matter what they say um and you you said that well The Hazing of the Solana Community by the ethereum community is is similar now I'd like to throw a flag at that but I I'd like I'd like to First hear from you is like why how you see the similarities between these two uh these two phases of the crypto Cycles here sure um well one line that I remember from the last podcast with you guys that I liked was um uh the strategy of an underdog is Unbecoming once you become a king um and I think that that progression you see also like if you personify a community and so it's like when I joined the bitcline space Bitcoin is like largely an underdog everyone got along everyone was running on a boat together it's really when ethereum got you know circulated as an idea and then launched as a network that it caused this reaction within bitcoiners who felt like they were better than or whatever and especially following 17 into the bear of 18 to 19 and BTC held up much better than eth did and then like the what would become the Bitcoin Maxes you know they felt king and queen like and they punched down at ethereum and instead of supporting ethereum in a time when it could use the support and a lot of people were working to you know address the things that that that needed to be addressed be they like you know the structuring side of icos or you know scaling ethereum or developer tooling or whatever and if you're really paying attention to ethereum you saw all these things happening um but then like the Bitcoin Maxi attack was relatively uninformed and and kind of fixated on the same handful of tropes and I think that's also revealing when people have like a fixed set of tropes that they just keep going back to and it's actually not like it's not that compelling it's it's a it goes back to the idea of like it's emotional it'll get people to be like like we got that guy but like it's not you know intellectually compelling so that was the Bitcoin Maxi against ethereum folks in 1819. I would say that um ethereum is you know more Innovation focused than Bitcoin bitcoin's very conservative and it has innovated at a social contract level but some of that Innovation at the social contract level requires conservatism in the technology um and certainly the supply um and so that's important like I think of the Bitcoin Community as more conservative and the ethereum community is more Progressive I'm sure there's some Bitcoin Maxes that would hate that framing but because the ethereum communities they hate a lot of things yeah that's true they're gonna hate anything I say um so because of that I think that like ethereum Maxis or ethereum supporters by and large are a little there's less vitriol I think the arguments are a little better against Solana um like it's you know I I think that it's a better attack say on on Solana and I think some of it is is Justified like something that um you know placeholder only so we studied Solana from the white paper in 2017 onwards um but really only got involved um later in 2022 uh and you know one of the sticking points for us was you know what is the concentration of this project you know how distributed is ownership um how Open Access um it is this network and this asset to as many people as possible and and basically lift lifting as many butts as possible and I would argue that like what Solana went through in uh late last year and especially Q4 after the FTX collapse was like hugely decentralizing and like gave a a lot of opportunity um to people that hated on Solana for different reasons to support Solana um and from and then like if you approach it purely from from a price perspective you had salon at 250 260 at the end of 2021 all of a sudden you had salon at eight to ten dollars or you had and so like the opportunity is very different for someone at eight to ten dollars and that's open access the other thing is like if you hated Solana for the FTX support then you can't hate Solana more because FTX goes down it's actually like one of the things you hated about Solana was the FTX and Alameda support in the structurings and I agree the Alameda structurings were gross but now that is you know a cancer that has been removed and so something that I see too is like when someone is like just emotionally committed to hating an ecosystem it doesn't matter what the ecosystem does to address the problem they're just going to find a different angle to hate it and we see this with Bitcoin Maxi still against ethereum they're just like on to the next thing to hate and like they're never draws will never be unlocked is the new thing right and so and there's always going to be the the next thing and I see some of that behavior and I certainly saw it in Q4 of 2022 against Solana where like Salon is getting its teeth kicked in you know it was down on the floor a bunch of the things that people claim to hate were getting ripped out of that ecosystem very quickly um and um and so then the opportunity was there and you know place all their chose to move in and support it um and then other people chose to kick it while it was down and you know it's up to you as a person what you want to do but and and I can get into more of the substance of like the work that led us to move in and support Solana but just from like a you know this this Maxi kind of phenomenon and what happens when the community is down that's what I saw happening against Solana uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap

first app with arbitrum experienced web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free I think there's a there's an interesting failure mode that I saw with a lot of the kind of and still see with a lot of the Bitcoin attacks on ethereum bitcoin Maxi attacks let's call them in that whenever they were talking about um ethereum they were trying to do sort of an Apples to Apples type of comparison in that like you'd ask like oh why aren't you bullish on ethereum well it doesn't have a 21 million uh Supply cap right yeah and you're like okay but uh the root of that is you want a ossified monetary policy right and look how ethereum is evolving towards that um XYZ you'd respond yeah but it's not fixed cap you're like why does it have to be fixed cap right isn't the principle of Bitcoin that it should be algorithmic and not up to the discretion of you know sort of a a set of individuals and here's how ethereum is getting that so what they would constantly try to do is they would try to map they would try to say well this is different than Bitcoin therefore it's bad and I very much agree that it's important for open-minded people in the ethereum community to not do that exact same thing to Salata to be basically like this is different than ethereum therefore it's bad right you have to go back further to kind of like the base principles of the thing and I think you have to recognize that Bitcoin is different from ethereum and that ethereum is also different from Solana and you can't say because it's not exactly like ethereum uh it is not worthwhile they can be different things in the same place um and that and that said Chris I I want you to give kind of the take to an open-minded uh ethereum Advocate right now because I think there are a lot that actually listen to to bankless and I think an open-minded ethereum Advocate might be like okay Chris give me the pitch then for Solana from an ethereum perspective right recognizing that as maybe different but keep in mind we've seen the rise and Falls of many alternative layer ones that have promised things uh that have promised things in terms of transactions per second in terms of kind of like architecture promised to be better than ethereum because of XYZ and they haven't made it back the next cycle where's EOS for instance I mean there's a slew we could kind of mention if you went back in time to the the darling Heath killers of 2017 to now so what is the case for to an open-minded ethereum let's say uh for Solana what what would you say well um I'll approach it first architecturally um which is that Solana's sole focus is um consensus at the speed of light and um that speed and its more seconds per transaction so like the speed or the latency at which transaction is clear opens up a lot of new use cases that I don't think that ethereum necessarily needs to solve or is super focused on solving um and that differentiation is a benefit I think to having soul in your portfolio alongside eth rather than a detriment so like the more different ecosystems are the better from my opinion because the less overlapped they'll have actually in what the builders are doing even if there's like muck raking and confusion on crypto Twitter um and so that um North Star of of consensus at the speed of light and I would say the um focus with which totally pursues that um reminds me of you know the focus with which vitalik pursued you know expanding the programmability of a blockchain network with a VM which at the time a lot of people said is silly and won't happen and there'll be you know the um the attack vectors are too vast and all these things and then you know but vitalik and the team that he gathered around him had the singular focus on it and they did it I would say that totally had as a similar singular Focus another founder that I would see having a singular focus in this way would be Mustafa at Celestia which is almost on the total opposite side of Solana but on the data availability and modular stack um and what's important for me is like when I come across these Founders who have like a singular first principles focus on things they can like debate that thing from a whole bunch of different angles and like you'll see interesting conversation occasionally between even the three that I just mentioned and they'll all like entertain the others approach and understand it but have the reasons and the principles for why they have chosen their own approach and I would say they all recognize that these different approaches have trade-offs and it's not like uh this thing is best for all things it's more like the system I am designing is optimized in its set of trade-offs for use cases that I care about and like Tully's originating um inspiration I think aside from just nerding out on blockchains and being great engineer was um you know as a daytime Trader you know feeling like he didn't have equal access to the same latency that everyone else had and so like totally in a way wants to give everyone equal access to latency of computation and transaction processing and that's his goal and I would say if you gave everyone equal access to latency um then you know that's the substrate for a much fairer Financial Field now you can make arguments why ethereum will do that too and I think that ethereum is building towards a future like that um as well the ethereum future is um more layered right l1's l2s now we're talking about l3s um and I would say that like and this is where I'm gonna step into the um say the developer personality of the different ecosystems so like if if I look at ethereum it's like um a much more like rainbows unicorns optimistic like um let's um let's explore you know the vast world of what's possible a lot of it won't work some of it will be amazing in a step change progress um and it's also like uh a kind of like Cipher Punky meets cosplay environment that that speaks to a crypto native yeah right um Solana and and this started to get my attention as I was taking Solana deal flow um through 2021 um Solana is a lot of web 2 folks a lot of traditional Finance folks that wander into ethereum land and they're like I don't know what to do with the unicorns and rainbows like and like who do I talk to and like you know this just doesn't make sense to me and then they wander into Solana land and they're like ah this is very familiar like I know how to build in this environment I know who to talk to and I would say even Within Myself I originally had an allergic reaction to Solana in that I was like no no you're doing this wrong this isn't like Grassroots or organic enough like you know ethereum is the way to do it um but the thing that I started to notice Solana was able to onboard a lot of these very high caliber people very quickly and they found the environment welcoming right and then they they became attached to it they wanted to build in it um and that was super interesting to me because it was like these are High Caliber people who want to work within the blockchain landscape but they actually don't feel at home in ethereum land and they're finding their home in Solana um and and and then they're sticking like they're staying they're not like migrating home to home to home so that that started to get my attention um and then I also started to see some people within the ethereum community that wanted um some components of what Solana had deciding to build on Solana instead of ethereum and that also got my attention there wasn't tons of that but a good example would be the Orca team um and orca is I think one of the best user experiences in all of crypto it's a amm on Solana I think it's every bit as good as uniswap um and that team one of the founders was yutaro who worked as a researcher at the ethereum foundation was on the core team at Uma um and then decided to build something on Solana and it's not like he was an ethereum hater that wanted to prove everyone by working on Solana he had strong roots within ethereum and ultimately chose um as an engineer who valued some of the things that Salama gave to build on Solana um soul and team I'm not as close with um it's a public markets um position that we've built but they also have ethereum Roots um another uh swama team that I work with is Vault um and vault is the founders of FanDuel so FanDuel has as much market share as DraftKings they've built a you know massive success consumer app they know how to do it you know they they have say the blueprint for Success um and they're choosing to build a dynamic Music nft Experience on Solana and like I talked a lot with Nigel the CEO there at Vault who is also the CEO of FanDuel and that's where this really started to unlock for me of like he feels welcome and at home within the Solana ecosystem um so you're seeing a lot of that and then you know I would encourage everyone to look at electric capitals developer report from 2022 and you know I think that uh like one of the headlines there is this is setting aside um ethereum in Bitcoin but ecosystems with a thousand plus total developers um grew you know salon and this year over year Solana grew 83 polygron grew 40 Cosmos grew 25 and polka dot grew two percent and so my takeaway from that is of the uh ecosystems after Bitcoin and ethereum Solana is the biggest fastest growing ecosystem of developers and then one thing I've learned as an investor in crypto over time and we're touching upon this earlier is I need to sometimes divorce what speaks to me most directly personally from like what will speak to a large group of people so long as it's still a net positive for the world so like a younger more riled up more like Cypher Punky Bitcoin ethereum me would be you know allergic and aggressive towards Solana right and say like they violated you know these key tenets of what you're supposed to do to launch a blockchain network but having gotten to know Tully and Raj and the team and the people working towards things my belief is they're working to bring net positive change to the world um and they attract a lot of developers who don't have a home elsewhere within crypto and if they continue to do that then the economy that they create or the systems of production of goods and services are only going to continue to grow and we've seen that for example in their nft ecosystem which is second only to ethereum and which has continued with really great activity through the bear market right it hasn't it's not like all those people have left and you know the opportunists are all gone and so it's not even just on the developer base it's on the user base there's a fair amount of stickiness Chris throughout my uh history inside of the ethereum land once upon a time I think around maybe around 2019 to 2020 uh I was really I was doing my old POV crypto podcast with my bitcoiner co-host and in the ethereum world I was the the bitcoiner if you will I was the one that was taking in a lot of the Bitcoin values and taking it back to the ethereum community being like hey guys there's something real here we should pay attention to attention to that and I got teased I was like uh jokingly uh warmly teased as like the Bitcoin mole inside of the ethereum camp and maybe bankless listeners are like that doesn't make any sense David's the biggest youth Maxi of all time well uh I would just like to say it's like yo like there's a lot of valuable things about Bitcoin that I've always wanted to try and instill inside of the ethereum world because there's value there and lately it's been a little bit of the opposite where uh some other eth Maxis or like David why are you giving Solana the time of day like why are you doing this uh and to me it's I'm not as convinces you are Chris but to me it's that if we as ethereum supporters do have the conviction that ethereum is what it is we should be able to understand why people feel compelled by Solana and still make our arguments uh and and so like my argument would be like uh all of that was great Chris uh the ethereum layer two layer 3 ecosystem can still do consensus at the speed of light uh eventually the network effects of ethereum will uh Trump over the the cultural fit that Solana is happening yet I also appreciate and understand that that is a very real corner of the crypto universe and my convictions as an ethereum person need to not be blinded by what you called like my initial like toxic reaction towards anything that's not Bitcoin or ethereum and so like that's really been my motivation for exploring the the Solana ecosystem to make sure that my biases are in check and I am actually able to make strong coherent sober arguments that aren't just like tribal regurgitations I I'm worried about tribalism on the Solana side as well because when any Solana listener just now is like oh David the L2 ecosystem is a failure on ethereum because they're all multi-cigs that kind of take is sort of Vibes similarly to me as the bitcoiner saying like you can't run an ethereum full node like okay like let's not but not bet against the arguments or the the road map of ethereum because root ethereum has been able to prove that you know it does execute on its roadmap given enough time um but but what would you say Chris too the close-minded eth Maxi who's like Solana will never work like if we're again going back to what has become the theme of this podcast which is it's like uh personality psychology and psychological biases what would you say to the ethereum crowd about um how to approach uh Solana and other topics like it well I I think you know modeling your approach would be uh perfectly valid and um you know it's a mature thing to do and it doesn't mean that you have to like go and support Solana wholeheartedly even if you make the investigation I think that um you know I guess I want to drill into like L2 and then Solana um and I think that my expectation is like um I expect a lot of l2s to be a success you know we were the first money into ZK sync um I love the ZK sync team um we don't invest competitively at the Venture stage and so we didn't make the other L2 Investments but I think that there's high quality um L2 teams um out there outside of zksync and um I mean clearly already in the numbers they're getting traction and I agree that like it's grading to see Solana folks try and tear down L2 you know uh progress just as it's grading to see the ethereum max that he's trying to tear down the salon of progress and there's hypocrisy everywhere right and so then it's just kind of like okay we just gotta accept that you know we're flawed humans um but on the idea that um you know l2s will achieve um consensus at this at the speed of light I think you're correct that it will eventually happen um one thing I've grown to appreciate more is is there is a real advantage to being able to provide it months or even years earlier um and if Solana provides consensus at the speed of light years earlier than l2's reliably do then that's going to get all the people that want the low latency applications to be building there or if not all a majority or enough to make it really sticky and then the other thing is like because Solana is svm based and not evm based it's not easy to migrate something you've built on Solana to something on ethereum right um and unless we have svm so Solana virtual machine l2s that settle into ethereum which which we we will get actually like I expect to see the Solana virtual machine proliferate as an execution environment with different settlement and data availability layers so that's going to happen some people would say well that's can obviate the need for soul I don't think so because I think that Seoul and Solana will remain the canonical chain for svms and where a lot of the assets are originated just as we've seen with ethereum right like we'll see ethereum teams go multi-chain but the canonical asset stays within the ethereum contract and so what what I think you'll end up seeing is like um a lot of loyalty and stickiness at the asset level to Solana as the canonical implementation but then migration of of the execution environment two svms that sells different settlement and data availability layers and one thing that placeholders played around with as an idea is like it's the thing that's stickier or the thing that's stickiest for the developer is is actually like the virtual machine and the developer tools that go around it um and I think there you basically have evm svm and cosmosum um as like you know key environments um that that you could build towards um maybe within cosmosm I should um throw in tendermint but um and and that ends up being like if you think from a developer perspective the things that they have to learn and what take them time right and it's not just like an easy Port um those can be very sticky so um I guess in conclusion I expect ethereum and Solana and Cosmos for that matter to coexist um and to grow together and I don't think that um one has to win you know to the detriment of another press one uh other just piece on uh Soul token so there's a difference between value creation of course and value capture and so you could see a world where Solana that the blockchain is used quite a lot but why does it necessarily mean that Seoul the token will capture value I know that um ethereum sort of went went through sort of ethereum went through this exact exact same thing and and this this is a process by the way in 2018 2019 and it just to give you know folks basically people are saying hey eth can be used but eth doesn't have to be valuable and then there was a chance of kind of a layer zero sort of the social Community uh myself many others in ethereum are saying no eth is money and you should value in the same way that ethereum is yes there needs to be some hardening of the monetary policy but you know it's going to harden anyway eventually did Harden but now we we get to a place the triple point a triple point asset right and by the way a lot of the triple point asset ideas is inspired by um something that you brought to Crypt as a tension this idea of three asset super classes right and you remember this right commodity and uh you know a commodity uh Capital assets exactly exactly so come on Ryan are you uh um are you I need to go listen to make this podcast again uh to get my story straight here but Chris are you basically predicting that Soul the token will follow the exact same path of ethereum or has your view um the exact same path as ether or is your view shifted on this that like yeah why does soul the token need to accrue value because right now it's basically if you look at the economics of its bleeding money in that they they pay a lot more as a block excuse me they pay a lot more for Block space subsidy than they are generating in terms of block space sales which is kind of net negative uh from a profitability perspective are you just anticipating that that will change in the same way it has for ether yes in a single word yes I I expect there to be an evolution um to you know elaborate um when I look at Souls inflation and I placeholder has like an internal tracker of a bunch of metrics but um Souls inflation I think is six percent um annually right now um which is quite low like from a yielding perspective for the people who are putting up that Capital the reason that's relevant to me is um the uh yeah current annual Supply inflation is like zero to one percent um say is like three percent Solana is six percent um and then like a bunch of like near and flow or more like 20 um and I went to 22 um and that data can always be you know a little bit off but I think that's directionally correct the reason that's super relevant is like I think one way that valuations for proof of stake assets are going to find their footing um is going to be around these yield rates um and I'm not denying that eth has the best setup right and it's the most mature um but like the lower yield it is that basically implies to me the lower risk the validator set views the asset is having um and so they will tolerate lower amounts of inflation but continue securing the network and so that's really key as like an indicator of where this is going um if other networks say need to inflate twice or three times as much to keep their validator set engaged and Solana is is inflating way less um so that would be a starting place um in terms of fees uh again this is just like the latest I have 24-hour transaction fees for salon at about 50k which is you know double Avalanche triple file coin um like six seven X Cosmos Hub 25x yeah but like 1 100. you know and this is where I'm not um I'm not uh I'm not uh debating that ethereum is like a much harder asset at this point in time I'm I'm more at that place of like the indicators or the race rates of change are that Salon is going to continue um Solana already is on a path to harden its asset and will continue to do so that makes sense so you're not saying that there's a different science that you're basically applying to Solana you're saying just it's just earlier in the process is your thesis definitely way earlier so speaking of that our 2020 episode uh with you is entitled ethereum opportunity he said over the last two and a half years that was your biggest win is this like the Solana opportunity to you is it like equivalent to uh ethereum in in 2022 similar yeah I think if I had to pick an ecosystem that's contentious and that um you should pay attention to and in its contentiousness it's undervalued it would be Solana um placeholder um each bear Market tends to pick a ecosystem or two and build a aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem um and so the last bear was Ethan Bitcoin because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify and then what I mean by aircraft carrier if you take ethereum buy a bunch of the core eth asset but then Venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are you know working on say at that point in time lending or dexes or asset management or whatever and then you can pick the best teams of the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective we're doing that exact same aircraft carrier strategy around Cosmos and Solana right now um and um what I'm seeing um and like I would say that the three most exciting Innovation environments for me um that I also see materializing in you know user adoption and growth are ethereum Cosmos Solana um and I think that if you talk with a lot like it depends on who you talk with but like generally objective um analyzers of the ecosystem I I would say would would largely agree with that assessment um the difference though is Salon evaluations are at least at the Venture stage much lower than ethereum and Cosmos so like right now ethereum deals Venture deals are 5 to 10x what I underwrote things in 2018 and 19 in terms of the the like starting seed or series a evaluation um and you know what that means is if something goes 30X total for a VC but it's marked 10x higher I get a 3X instead of a 30X and so it starts actually just not even fit my return profile or like what I'm aspiring for um but Solana um valuations at the Venture stage basically exactly where ethereum valuations were in 18 and 19. and it's one of those like deja vu repeat things where I'm like this is priced at what and there's no competition for this deal and you know the team is this High Caliber it it just kind of blows my mind um and so like one that your users could check out would be tensor.trade um that's a nft platform Pro trading platform probably the closest analog would be blur within ethereum this is built by two guys um they've built the whole thing they've never raised money they're Solana nerds they you know love the network you can follow them it's Richard and Ilya they're like so about like optimizing the front end to match like the speed of the Solana back end and it it reminds me of like the type of grit and passion that I ran into with ethereum teams in 1819 who just no one was paying attention and there weren't like you know dozens of VCS all around you know collaborating for around or you know um touting a bunch of you know over promises let's say and so um from The Venture perspective Solana's fruitful ground for me I'm also doing a lot of work within Cosmos I would say that Cosmos is a more consensus investment ecosystem at this point though and so valuations for Cosmos are somewhere between Solana and ethereum at the private stage well Chris I think in addition to being the bankers podcast with the most words coconut in it it's also the bankless podcast with most words Solana in it as well totally soon no we already have I think we just said it more times I don't know well yeah I think I said earlier this this call I I had like a slip I said like [Laughter] [Laughter] so Chris this has been a lot of fun you know uh thanks for spending so much time with us today I I guess my question as we're kind of closing this is for you to zoom out and look at crypto because I know in addition to price appreciation and investment um over the years because you know I've heard you speak so many times I just know a little bit about your value Set uh it's important to you that crypto is a net good for the world as well not just that we all make a lot of money I mean that's cool everyone wants to do that but I think you're here as well because you actually think crypto is going to bring about a positive force in the world my question to you is have we achieved that yet is is crypto a net good and are we on track to achieve that if not I would say that the um blockchains as an open data substrate that allow for verifiable computation inevitably make it such that this will be a met good for the world and then it's up to the builders and the investors and the early participants to kind of dial the knob to Maximum Impact versus minimum impact within this net good substrate and what I mean by that is like and this goes back to a lot of placeholders original thesis summary which people can find online um but if you if you look at how web 2 is currently architected um those are that's proprietary code and proprietary data and we basically it's the new digital fiefdom um and you know we all labor for King Zuck and King Zuck makes all the rules and you know we just take it and we have no um control or governance rights against King Zuck and you know you either uh toil on his land or you know go elsewhere don't exist um and we spend so much time in digital worlds that we can't exist on all these monarchies we've gone through this um from a social like uh Evolution standpoint already and blockchains as this open data substrate also allow for governance forms that are much more democratic that are you know of the People by the people for the people um and so the all the promise and tooling is there to allow us to do that now it was a very messy process to go from monarchies to democracies right like lots of revolutions lots of turmoil um lots of you know dictators that were way worse than the old monarchs uh and you know really just took advantage of the system or like took that period of disruption and used it to their own personal advantage and so we're gonna get that we're gonna get more Lunas we'll get more three ACS you know we'll get those things that um make me not want to associate and distance myself from crypto in the next you know scam rally let's call it in a few years time um following the the conviction rally but the the substrate um will remain you know Bitcoin will continue producing blocks uh and and issuing Supply according to its social contract as will ethereum as will Solana as will Cosmos um and what's great is each bear Market we get to reset uh by and large the opportunists leave and we can reassess you know the current state of things and I love crypto most each bear Market because I look around and I'm like wow there's way more cool people here and neat things being built and uh we're having all the conversations I wish we had been having in the bull market but at least we're having them right and like even if you look at Solana you know it was having a lot of conversation at the depths of Q4 2022 about like ownership right and like how to structure um uh Community tokens so that they weren't predatory like Alameda those were things that ethereum folks were rightfully calling out Solana folks on in 2021 but that the Solana folks didn't want to hear it then but a year later it was being addressed um and so I take heart in the fact that those things are being addressed I weirdly am most optimistic about crypto and bear markets and most pessimistic about it in Bull markets just because of like the social dynamics that we've discussed at length here um but this will inevitably be for greater good and it's incumbent upon each of us to turn the dial towards Maximum Impact as opposed maximum societal impact as opposed to maximum personal impact well Chris I definitely uh was going through my 2018 2020 bear Market my first real bear Market thinking the entire time's like man if only the bull market would arrive if only the bull market would arrive and then uh that feeling then the bull market arrived and that good feeling of like yes the bull markets here lasted for about three months and then I realized oh no what am I getting myself into and now I'm what have we done oh and like now I look back on the last bull market and it's like yeah that one like me with the Chihuahua looking at the Vietnam like helicopters like flying overhead I'm like oh that was awful I'm so glad I'm back in a bear market and so uh I'm definitely a cycle behind you and I appreciate all of your mentorship and leadership as we were exploring the frontier of crypto for sure I appreciate you guys putting out um good information on uh widening variety of networks I think it's good growth for bankless itself well uh we we can't stop won't stop always talking about things that are decentralized and and to get that crypto can bring people and Chris thank you so much for joining us to talk about that today thanks for having me um action items for you bankless Nation one go back in the archives dig deep go listen to that episode the ethereum opportunity with Chris all the way back in 2020 we'll include a link in the show notes for you also it was mentioned we have a developer report you should check out from Electric Capital Chris mentioned that will include a link in the show notes and guys this is actually the second episode of the year that we're releasing as an nft collectible uh Chris has agreed to put 10 of the proceeds to shielded Labs which is a Swiss non-profit that's spinning up to further support the decentralization of Z cash so that's a good cause as well the auction for that nft episode happens at 3 P.M on Eastern so we'll see you there risks and disclaimers got to end with this none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to banklesshq
