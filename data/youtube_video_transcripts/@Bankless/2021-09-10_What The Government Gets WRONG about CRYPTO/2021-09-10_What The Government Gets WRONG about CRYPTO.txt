you ready let's go let's talk about our shadowy super regulators david that is the that is the subject i think this week and everything that they are doing we've got to start with maybe the the few events that happen starting with uniswap so on friday just after we recorded our last weekly roll up it appeared that there were some investigations going on at uniswap and from the sec uh tell us about that david yeah so uniswap got a letter from an investigative letter from the sec asking just just for more information about the business um i mean so in in theory these letters are totally just like peaceful and just casual it's like hey we would like to know more about you but also like the context the sub-context is that like we are looking to like figure out what to do with you guys uh and so like while it doesn't indicate that they that unit swap has done anything wrong or is being charged with anything the sec is just probing into uniswap trying to like get more information is not it's not a positive thing it's definitely a negative thing this is not the kind of letter you can ignore right it's not the kind of thing oh junk mail just gonna yeah sec i don't know them i'm just gonna recycle that one you cannot ignore these letters and um it's also it's like you know perjury some very bad things can happen if you falsify the letters or don't provide the necessary information it just gets you in the bad books with the sec as well so i think investigation is um maybe a bit more serious in some ways it's not a formal charge but this is not a a small matter like i don't know what questions are being asked from the sec to uniswamp but uh you can bet that there's a lot and like very detailed right and so uniswap is is definitely this is unit swap labs of course they're definitely need to put in the time to answer these questions right as accurately as possible so that that in and of itself is sort of a shot across the bow yeah yeah and that is just the first of the the regulatory issues that came out this week so like that story is currently being like told like we're going to just here be hearing more and more from this i'm i'm sure the sec is not done with uniswap or d5 this is just the first of a very long story but that story took another turn this week when coinbase was informed by the sec that the sec if if they release a product which they have been in open communications with the sec uh if they if coinbase was told by the sec that if they release a lending product then the sec is going to sue them uh and that is extremely aggressive uh and there's absolutely no dialogue going on between uh the sdc and coinbase or anyone in the crypto space and so this has been a this blew up the the whole twitter sphere and cryptosphere in the last two days what do you mean by lending product for people who aren't familiar what does that mean right so people will might remember blockfly getting a cease and desist letter from the sec because they the sec said that their lending products are securities um which has you know some debate about that again i'm not a lawyer don't listen to me about any of this um but uh the this is the same kind of deal like so lending products are maybe securities and the sec is trying to get coinbase's lend product which is just the same that we've known like all these other centralized lending products right like common deposit your bitcoin your ether your stables and then we'll get a yield on them the problem is that the sec doesn't like is that like how they are how yield is being achieved on these things is opaque and so investors don't have like good uh clarifications or clarity on how that yield is coming and so like if like a black swan event happens maybe depositors might actually lose their deposits which is not enjoyable um and so that's what the sec is claiming that they are trying to protect from what's coinbase claiming coinbase is claiming that none of this qualifies as a security it's like you know it's we're lending money we take your ether we take your bitcoin we lend it just like if you you know lend money to a bank and they generate interest on those returns it's just a lending product this is not a security and is therefore outside of their jurisdiction but the scc is coming back and saying coinbase if you release this we will sue you right right what they didn't do is provide explanation as to why the lend product is a security they just said if you release it we're going to sue you which is meaningfully different than providing any sort of guidance or indications as to their logic or analysis as to why this thing is a security at all apparently in the letter in a letter to coinbase they said that they have done the analysis but they didn't share what that analysis is right and so the threat is that like when we sue you and take you to court we already have our analysis ready to go rather than broadcasting that to the entire industry and saying like here is our guidance here is our analysis and allowing the industry to work around that they say like okay we've we have our analysis we're going to keep our cards close to our heart and then if you like you know do anything wrong and if you break this analysis we're going to sue you which is just like infuriating it's infuriating it's what that is yeah it's absolutely infuriating and i can understand the frustration because this is um this is not a typical move right where a three-letter agency from the fed comes and says hey we're going to sue you if you do this thing and then the company that's being threatened like this comes out and tells everybody about it right usually the legal advice that you get in a situation like this is like don't talk about it right right until we can reach settlement until the investigation is over but this is coinbase now saying uh okay it's on we're gonna let everyone know what's going on uh and so the drum support legal officer has written this blog post um that that's clearly not meant maybe it's partially meant for the sec but it's more meant for public support wouldn't you say uh the title of it the sec has told us it wants to sue us over lend we don't know why and then brian armstrong put out this um this twitter thread about and it begins like this some really sketchy behavior coming out of the sec recently and he goes into story time where he talks about um what the sec is doing he says millions of crypto holders have been earning yield on their assets over the last few years block fi is an example of that david as you said makes sense if you want to lend out your funds you can earn a return everyone seems happy with that a bunch of great companies in crypto have been offering versions of this for years so coinbase came out recently and said they would be launching their own version if you're a coin based customer you might have seen the announcement in fact gemini has a version of this david like block file like this isn't even the only exception is doing this uh celsius um we were planning to go live in a few weeks so this is all built out it was all ready so we reached out to the sec to give them a friendly heads up and this is what they always recommend by the way the sec always says hey come tell us right if you're doing something well in this case it sounds like it it kind of backfired um they responded by telling us this lend feature is a security okay seems strange brian says how can lending be a security so we ask the sec to help us understand and share their view we always make an effort to work proactively with regulators and keep an open mind they refuse to tell us why they think it's a security instead they subpoena a bunch of our records we comply demand testimony from our own from our employees we comply then tell us they will be suing us if we proceed to launch with zero explanation as to why look brian says we're committed to following the law sometimes the law is unclear if the sec wants to publish guidance we are also happy to follow that it's nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry by the way he says but in this case they are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why no clarity this is something gary gensler promised david clarity we're not getting clarity instead they're engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors whatever their theory is here feels like a reach land grab versus other regulators he goes on with a few more tweets i won't i won't finish this out but that gives kind of the tone for what's going on here and here's the thing like coinbase from day one has always been their message their branding their total their approach to all of this has been we're going to be by the book like u.s regulated okay finance like bitmex these companies will be more aggressive they'll list other products earlier but we're going to play it by the book because we think that's the better long-term strategy for a company and for a u.s based company at the cost of growth and they could have done things the binance way and gone into kind of hyper growth but they decided to play it by the book and it feels like they're getting punished from that and like i gotta say if if you're a regulator you can't get along with coinbase i mean who can you get along with yeah they're like the goody two-shoes uh you know teacher's pet of the crypto industry they do everything right and like if just like you said if if the teacher's pet is getting in trouble by the teacher then there's obviously bias towards the whole entire classroom right yeah something wrong with the teachers what's going on this is this is uh hitting the front page of the wall street journal by the way scc investigates coinbase over crypto lending plan on the front page of the wall street journal so they are getting the press i wonder what kind of public support they're getting they certainly have the crypto industry support here's a take from niraj david you want to go into this yeah so this is something we haven't covered about this yet uh the sec wants coinbase to turn over the name and contact information of anyone who has said that they are interested in their lending platform so like think about this if this is a security the people who have expressed interest in in purchasing said security doesn't change whether that's a security or not and so niraj says uh why would that be relevant to their investigation into whether the program is compliant or not and so the sec is targeting people that have expressed interest in lending their crypto assets on coinbase they want your name they want your address they want your phone number for why i have no clue prosecute them in the future i have no clue i mean i do have a conspiracy actually but so i'm on this list because when i saw the coinbase email like i love to try things in crypto so i put my hand up and i was like yeah i'd love you know i'm gonna need to get a new co-host sometime soon i'm on the stc's list for this but why would they want that what's like what are some of the ideas floating around okay so the the conspiracy which again i'm on board with is that uh when we again when we zoom out and view the nation state as a holistic concept we have the treasury who's frustrated about people who aren't reporting their crypto taxes which is legitimate uh and they have tried and found tried to find ways to find the same information like who are all the people that like own crypto or have interest in crypto then we now we have the sec coming from the other side who's making this claim that this uh lending product is a security when everyone's like why the hell is this a security while they are making that claim they're asking for everyone's you know name birthday address their their nation say identity uh and so like the conspiracy is that like the sec and the treasury are like pincer attacking crypto people by trying to figure out who they are right and and that is in my opinion an infringement on personal privacy and personal sovereignty that's that's my take look i i i don't know if that conspiracy theory it like holds but you have to i don't know about an explanation right like what is the explanation for why they are asking for all of these details right uh here's kind of a take i meant to to say when we were talking about uniswap this is the complete backwards way of how a regulator should approach a uniswap or a coinbase i mean coinbase has built a phenomenal company like a company that the us as an economy should be proud to host within its borders right like part of the next silicon valley but uniswap too uniswap is even more amazing one of the most innovative and empowering tech projects to come out of america an american team in the last decade that's what i think unit swap is david and i feel like the the us should be giving hayden adams and the unit swap team a medal right like thank you for doing this instead those guys are getting an investigation this is like a financial prison type stuff this is completely backwards from the way they should be handling it yeah what's going on to me is like we have found ways out of this financial prison using defy that's what defy is breaks you free from your banks is the lines we've been using and then we have the treasury and the sec is like no no get back in your cage i don't know how how did you get out of your cage get back in your cage that's basically what they're doing yeah and i i i do feel like that um let's do some other takes from around the crypto industry this is from jake travinsky i think this is interesting david why don't you read it yeah jake says if the sec thinks that all non-bank interest products are securities that require the offer to become a public reporting company then they're not just picking a fight with crypto they're going after the entire fintech space so this to me this take lends itself towards headlines uh itself towards um the whole concept of protecting incumbents right like protecting the banking encumbrance you know the banking uh the banking side of the world all the bankers they were probably okay with fintech because they were built on banks but now that there's crypto fintechs don't need to be built on banks anymore they can now be built on crypto rails which is again breaking free from your bank so to me this uh illustrates how this might be incumbent protection rather than just like you know investor protection get back in your cage get back in your arcade yeah look at this adam cochran part of me wonders if the sec's unwillingness to provide coinbase guidance on why they are blocking their lend program is because they can't right like maybe they've realized that things they think are a security may not at all be accounted for in an act from 1933 they don't like it they have concerns feels to them as if it should be a security but under the howie test exchange act they know won't really stand up in court they don't want to set a precedence that would make the this industry harder on them so adam's basically saying maybe they're doing this backroom threatening because they don't actually have a case right it's a bluff car it's a bluff and coin base is being like no sorry we're calling your bluff maybe they've finally overreached and like played their hand extended their hand too far and maybe now is the time where we're coinbase and why shouldn't it be coinbase david it's gotta be so well resourced like they they have the reputation they have the prestige they have the leadership to actually stand and fight this maybe now is the time maybe this could flip into a good thing hey sec get back in your cage get back in your cage what is what so some of these crypto natives uh what does chain link god think about here he is responding from brian armstrong right so shane lingard says so the sec is pushing people through a minefield without telling anyone where the minds are yet at the same time telling to not step on any of the minds or else you you will die this makes zero logical sense right yeah this is just the approach that we have been asking as long as i've been in crypto we've been asking for more regulate regulation clarity and instead of giving it to us they're just taking us to court which is absolutely insane and absolutely irresponsible and against the american principles get back in your cage get back in your cage mark cuban he had a response to this too good to have more allies and mark cuban is definitely an ally he responds to brian armstrong he said brian this is regulation via litigation they aren't capable of working through this themselves and they're afraid of making mistakes in doing so so they just leave it to the lawyers just the people you don't want impacting the new technologies this is the key line you have to go on the offensive this is mark cuban saying hey they're trying to do regulation by litigation so like they better arm up because we need to go on the offensive as a crypto industry and settle this in other ways settle this in the court of public opinion settle this in the actual court system as well we need to get offensive because they are clearly being aggressive it's it's no longer like live and let live right uh this is actually some aggressive impact like i want the ability to lend through my coinbase account i like coinbase i use it why shouldn't we have this ability these are all great questions uh jerry britto what's he say right bruto says if true this is pretty underhanded i know it's easy for me to say but coinbase should go ahead and launch its product let the sec sue it and go to court let the sec make its case and let a judge decide what the law is jerry britto basically saying coinbase take the offensive coinbase don't ask for permission coinbase we need you guys to to break free out of this financial prison and lead the charge out of it right and i i and to push the sec back this is government overreach and we need people to plant a draw a line in the sand saying like no no no like back off that's how this can get resolved though right right and i mean if they're not gonna if the sec is not gonna give us regulation willingly we will force them to give us regulation by beating them in court well then you have like then you have court case uh like rule rulings and you have precedent established i just wonder how long this process is going to take right so like i do think this is the sec is not going to give us clarity so we have to get clarity by the courts it just takes so much longer to do it it'd be so much easier if you had a regulator that was just like armed across the aisle hey crypto's doing some great things we have these concerns right let's address these concerns over time but we're not getting that from the sec maybe we're getting it from other government agencies i'm not sure but it doesn't feel like we're getting that from the sec right now so i guess we have to go to court but what does coinbase do do they just release this product in the meanwhile yep and then people sign up yep fight the court battle alongside i wonder if they'll do that i i hope they do [Laughter] here's the big take here um i just have one question to sec who are you trying to protect their mandate is to protect investors david are they protecting us yeah this is not now they're investors in bank no investors in banks ryan bank investors that's who their job is to protect it feels like i don't i don't actually know who they're trying to protect i know it's not the average retail investor right is it is it banks is it the treasury is it their own regulatory control is it you know some other shadowy figure in uh like in the nation state government some bond i'm not sure i don't know but it's not us right i do know that but that would be the question i think we would have to gary gensler it's like who are you guys trying to protect right i'm not feeling protected by this i didn't i just don't like the plot yeah did you get your dydx airdrop absolutely not do you feel protected because you didn't lost out on a significant amount of money let me tell you that okay so this is this came this take came from eric connor who talks about anthony anthony cesano anthony and i talked about this on a recent podcast episode but i think the elected officials are extremely underestimating the influence coming from the crypto community there are there's a gigantic power culture and wealth shift happening that most are ignoring and i think the sec is making this mistake as well like the the the crypto news uh ecosystem like what you guys are listening to right now is vibrant uh we got mark cuban we got like all of crypto twitter who like there's a lot of wealth in crypto and so like all of these people have interest in like rallying their support behind coinbase and against the sec wreath witherspoon now yeah yeah we got we got wreath breathe um uh inside joke okay um but like that that all the nation state regulators don't understand how uh vibrant and engaged the crypto community is and how willing we are to like die for what we believe in like we will we will take this all the way to the very end and i'm not sure the regulators will do the same for whatever the hell they believe in yeah i'm not sure there's that fervor either and um yeah this is um i think this is a actually going to turn into a good thing for crypto so there you have it guys are we at war with the regulators i don't know we didn't fire the first shot though seems like they did yeah but we'll see how this ends hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you
