[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless david we just had balaji srinivasan on what a fantastic episode i was going to ask you what we covered but i almost feel like asking like what didn't we cover we talk a lot on the bankless podcast about bitcoin and ethereum being neo nations right different new types of organizational structures and i i thought that i think that's a really compelling thesis and it's something that we've been sharing readily on the bankless program bellagi takes this a big step forward and ryan you you called balaji the guy that thinks a decade ahead of everyone else and so bellagio's taking that that metaphor that like you know these things are kind of digital nations and he's he's pondering the idea of what happens if we make a real nation what happens if we make a real country a country that starts in the cloud and then actually manifests itself somewhere in the world with a sourcing of capital to purchase property and then actually construct a real country that's not a joke balaji is actually having this thought about how to make a real country and so since we talk about this on the bankless podcast all the time it was just a perfect fit to get him on the show to talk about how do we go from a metaphorical country in the clouds to a real country on land so that's that's what we covered in this a very ambitious podcast i expect this podcast to sound unrealistic to you maybe maybe even a little bit crazy but that's what happens when you have a conversation with with basically like somebody who feels like a time traveler david it's like i mean if you heard bellagi when he first got into crypto and bitcoin right like um at the at the very inception of things bitcoin is a completely bonkers crazy idea right or even uh defy and ethereum completely crazy bonkers ideas the fact that a uniswap can deliver 4 billion in trading volume and it's a tiny protocol written by you know one individual on a 100k grant that is unrealistic and crazy so there's sort of a a pattern to these kinds of ideas in crypto and a lot of times blodgey has has proven to be right so if this episode sounds crazy to you that is to be expected but it might be crazy and right right that's exactly right like imagine you can go even further back and say like okay it's 2010. you just read the bitcoin white paper and for some reason you're compelled by it and so you go to your friend and be like oh my god there's gonna be this new money on the internet imagine how crazy you would sound in 2010 well now it's 2020 and kind of all bets are off on things and so i'm kind of hoping that the world can appreciate the the effort to maybe create a brand the idea of creating a brand new nation from scratch uh maybe that's not maybe maybe because it's a new era maybe it's not so such a hair brained idea it's cool too because we start with present times we we talk about the legacy of covid and this distrust in institutions that has fomented and then we get into those broader topics of the crypto civilization or as blagi calls it the network state so this is definitely an episode that you do not want to miss all right we're going to get right into the episode with bellagi but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you own crypto what really matters is the security and ownership over your assets being a part of the bankless nation means having complete sovereignty over your crypto the easiest way to do that is with a ledger hardware wallet a hardware wall is a little device that manages your private keys for you so you don't have to worry about proper private key management your ledger hardware wallet keeps your private keys private but still lets you have easy access to your crypto the combination of my ledger hardware wallet and metamask lets me store my crypto assets in the most safe way possible but still lets me easily access uniswap or all the other defy apps that i use on a daily basis if you already have a ledger wallet you can use the ledger live app to participate in some of the money verbs that we discuss in the bankless program the ledger live app is your headquarters for managing your personal crypto finance it's a great tool to manage the assets you hold on your ledger as well as receive a portfolio summary of all the assets that you have stored using the ledger live app you can buy bitcoin ether and stable coins and have it sent directly to your ledger hardware wallet skipping over the trusted exchanges and getting your assets into your control you can even use the ledger live app to swap crypto assets natively inside of the app so you never need to send your crypto assets away from your ledger to make a trade buying a ledger is like buying a fire extinguisher the best time to get one was yesterday especially if you're doing something silly like holding your crypto in a hot wallet that's always connected to the internet if you haven't gained full control over your crypto yet go to the link in the show notes and get your ledger today if you are looking for the front page of defy look no further than xerion.io xerion is your home base for managing your d5 portfolios xerion offers a central place for you to engage with all of the d5 protocols and assets that you engage with on a daily basis but all in one central spot i've loaded up a wallet in xerion is giving me the portfolio performance of all the assets in this wallet over time as well as a breakdown of all the assets that i own as well as all of my transaction history that i've ever done in an easy to view fashion xerion also lets you invest right into d5's best yielding financial opportunities right from their homepage xerion also makes it super easy to access interest in defy using applications like compound and ave in the background and you can also exchange your assets using the xerion app using an exchange aggregator in the background to make sure that you always get the best rates you can even use the xerion mobile wallet to add your metamask or arjun or another ethereum address right into your mobile wallet so you can see your portfolio and engage in defy on the go here i just loaded up my argent wallet and now i'm going to load up my meta mask as well and xericon will do the same thing it will add all of my assets and wallets together all in one space and give me a portfolio summary of what's going on adding wallets is trivially easy if you already have a metamask you can get it right into the xerion app and it can sync with your desktop app as well and the best part is you can also buy ether right into the app itself use the invest tab to look at all the things that you have invested in as well as other opportunities and coming soon to the xerion app is the ability to buy and sell your assets straight from your mobile device so download the app it works on ios and android go to xerion.io plug in your wallets and get a historical report of your portfolio over time as well as a comprehensive breakdown of all the assets that you own and how much yield they're generating for you all right bankless nation we are super excited to have our next guest this is bellagios foreign no one blends the academic plus the startup world plus the venture world quite like bellagi this is going to be exciting conversation with him he's got multiple engineering degrees multiple exits he was early into bitcoin he sold a company to coinbase as well i think belashi lives a decade or two in the future his superpower at least it seems to me is to be able to see things before the rest of us and we're going to ask just what he sees on the horizon today bellagi welcome the bankless nation thanks so much for being here great to be here all right man so two things just hit all-time highs bitcoin market cap and coveted infections in the u.s how do you feel about that well uh so you know covet i haven't i've been been talking about it too much recently simply because it's just become so so so dumb in the west in many ways um you know basically well i'll i'll say a few things about covet first is an interesting thing to do is to google covet worldwide deaths and what you'll see is an interesting graph where which i don't think actually has been circulated that much it shows this total exponential rise going into may of covid and then it actually does kind of flatten out at roughly 6 000 to 8 000 deaths per day for like the last six months and with a lot of oscillation that appears to be due in part to you know testing mainly on saturdays and sundays or rather not testing on saturdays and sundays and you know the thing is that from like the early perspective of covid it wasn't obvious that this was the way people would flatten the curve uh namely that the exponential would flatten out at 6 000 deaths per day as opposed to 60 000 deaths per day right that's that's not like an obvious place that it lands up you know um and it's actually kind of remarkably flat given that this is like an average or a summation over the whole world it's it's like a bunch of different curves that are happening at the same time you know some some countries are going up when our countries are going down it's sort of yoyoing back and forth um that's kind of one aspect number two is you know look i'm you know as uh hopeful for the vaccines you know as anybody the pfizer and moderna you know vaccines that have been announced but these are you know sample size of like 100 people um we'll we will see what happens when you scale that to a billion there's just always stuff whether it's manufacturing issues or or you know compliance issues or what have you compliance i don't think in the sense of fda getting you know they know enough to not try to block this for dumb reasons probably but um but compliance in the alternative sense of people actually taking it due to you know anti-vaxx or anti-pharma sentiment and you know people might think oh the vaccine was rushed or i believe in vaccines in general but not this vaccine whatever so will you actually get compliance will enough people take it will it have issues at scale that are not seen in you know the relatively smaller trials i don't know i mean the the optimistic take is that it will be um it'll be fine and covert will be a memory by this time next year the pessimistic take which i think is you know where i'd probably put more probability away not a hundred percent but is that kobe's going to be with us for several years maybe maybe the better part of the decade nobody nobody you know was expected 10 years of iraq right and nobody expects 10 years of covet um and and yet i think that's something that is a possibility especially in those place in the world that can't afford a vaccine or you know won't have great compliance with the vaccine or will resist it for other reasons whatever right um so you know it's interesting because covet i shouldn't say has been stamped out in asia but it's just been taken more seriously in asia and they just seem to have a functioning public health system that has gotten the thing under control but not so in the west so it's it's not the lesson that anybody wants here everybody wants to point fingers at this or that political faction in the west but it feels like there's some systemic you know systematic thing that the west is doing incorrectly that asia is doing right um and that's just sort of hard to copy it's like oh do a social network or a search engine and there's a thousand details that facebook and google get right and so copying the way that asia does it may just not be easily possible um and he said you know what is a legacy that coveted will leave behind you know this is not original to me this is one of my one of my friends who made this comment but i think it's very much true um you know cope 2020 is the year the internet began um by which by which i mean um there's this concept i have of the primary and the mirror for example in the mid-90s um you know the new york times put its first website up and it had you know it's just like a curiosity the new york times on the web you know we put we put some articles up here just to look at this new technology the world wide web right and it was just a few articles you know and and the primary was still the physical paper and the mirror was you know the the website and then over time sort of like wiley coyote you ever seen wiley coyote from lincoln's of course yeah yeah you know how wildly code sort of shifts his weight gradually from one leg to the other like like this right right so gradually shifting weight uh you know imperceptibly you know and by degrees over time the new york times.com website became the primary and the paper became the mirror it basically became a printout an imperfect rendition of what was on the web which was the complete version um and there were certain things of course like links to tweets or data science or interactive graphs and so on that were really digital first products um where you know the the paper was um was not just just not gonna reflect that right at best it could include a url to go and look at it online right and uh even still i you you can still think of the ny times as well as the other you know newspaper side says transitional things because you know like they still buy um they still buy paper right they still have like a like a lumber operation and an ink operation you know um you know there's you can you can sort of invert the normal dictum which is never listen to somebody who's still buying by the barrel you know or never argue with someone who still does right um so so lasting impact that covett has though as i think all these legacy institutions will start to get examined and you'll ask how do you do the digital first version okay so just as an example i i talked about the ny times the primary in the mirror um everything is turning to having the digital version being primary and the physical version being the mirror or secondary or the printout or the expensive version for example um you know people used to talk about the digital divide right now the three billion people have phones um and you know probably everybody in the world is going to have a smartphone eventually um it's on on pace to get there very poor people have have you know smartphones that were only the province of the extremely wealthy you know like like a relative you know within our lifetime right um so so everybody has a phone and digital stuff is cheap and so that actually means is we're flipping it around so that the actual divide is the physical divide that is to say you can make an assembly of a thousand people online very inexpensively but the physical version is is is is no longer cheap the physical version is the premium okay so it's flipped and so that means is every event is digital first every document is digital first that already happened prior to covet but you know increasingly so every court hearing every uh everything for education everything for health care the hygiene argument has has sort of shifted at every meeting is digital first um so everything has been shifted to be digital first and um it's the physical that's a premium even for really important meetings quote-unquote get-togethers gatherings like weddings right um you know people are doing skype weddings you know and and right now that seems like you know kind of a a sucky sort of thing but i think that once you start thinking okay what could i do with a virtual reality wedding well actually it could be extremely fancy you know it could it could be extremely fancy and it could be better it could be better in some ways certainly you know like video games whatever you can have very interesting visuals you know you have perfect control over every pixel every guest can attend they can stay the whole time you know it's it's something where um you know look i'm i'm not arguing that people won't still want physical weddings but the digital wedding will be one tenth or one one hundredth as expensive and pretty good and the physical wedding will be like extremely deluxe it'll be like the difference between saying oh my god they had a they had a wedding in in you know that that that destination wearing that really fancy location wow that must have been expensive it'll be like that the physical version will be expensive um hence the physical divide that's what you mean by the the the start of the internet being 2020 it's basically like and that's very weird for for us to think about because most people think oh yeah the internet that's sort of old technology i mean that's been around for most of my life but you're saying that um previously it was not part of the fabric of our lives in the way it's about to be over the next over the coming decades correct that's right so you know you can call it the internet flipping it's like the the internet was uh just learning to be what it could mature into up to the point we are getting to to now and that that's cut the legacy of covet covet is pulling that into the now it's pulling the future into now at an accelerated rate that's right and i think you know social distancing caused more social networking so balaji ryan started off this uh asking about like well the coveted infections in btc is that both are at an all-time high and the the reason why we wanted to start this podcast off is to talk about the juxtaposition because there's not not just only that is is extremely juxtaposed but it seems to be the fabric of society is moving into the extremes right we are we are the the distrust in institutions and the the banding together of different ideologies is is really a very has created a very polarizing world and and we wanted to get you on the podcast to talk about like how you are seeing this distress in institutions be filled like there's a void that is left by these institutions how is society coming to terms with this void that is being left what is what is scarce today is trust but what's abundant is computation and so the rapprochement that we're going to have is we're going to substitute computation for trust everywhere that we can so what does that mean well so you know an obvious version of that is um like bitcoin right in the sense that or ethereum blockchains in general um where you have somebody who is you know democrat or republican they're sunni or shiite they are you know chinese or japanese they're turkish or greek um they're you know protestant or catholic they're on one or the other side of some historical divide right but they despite all the things they don't agree on they do agree on the state of the bitcoin blockchain on the state of the ethereum blockchain and not just they agree on the state of it they they agree on the state of it not just like in a oh yeah you know that it's true that the sky is blue today okay they agree on the state of something that is extremely materially and financially important which is the kind of thing that people tend to have political arguments over you know the scarcity is what causes conflict so we have an example of something where computation has sort of forced uh you know that's where global consensus is now feasible uh in this environment where everybody is kind of you know advocating for their own thing and they've got these politically constructed truths into the gap is coming crypto and over time that's actually where facts are all all facts are on chain if it's not on chain it's not true um that's very deep point i can i can drill into there's a lot i can say about that i i wanted to dig into that for a second but just uh to to ask clarify what one point that you made so you said computation is getting cheap i think people understand that of course that are listening right like moore's law these sorts of things we've observed this over our lifetimes but you also said uh trust is becoming more scarce why like what what has fundamentally happened in the past like 30 years let's call it to shake our trust in the institutions that we as a society formerly trusted i'm probably a little bit older than you you know i was i was a teenager in the 90s and i remember you know before like the internet became very mainstream you know probably some of your listeners are in their 20s and may not have that much of a memory of that but essentially you know in that time even in the 90s it you really didn't hear from that many people you heard from your parents you heard from your teachers you heard from you know the people who were on tv or you know you picked up the newspaper but the number of different people that you heard from was was fairly limited and it was actually a big deal to you know be on tv it was a big deal to have a broadcast license that was like a a regulated thing um and so the um the thing about it was there just weren't that many voices online um or not voice online there weren't any voices contending for your attention because there were relatively few of them they had come into some sort of consensus on their own now you know really you can push it all the way back 1950 i think was peak centralization and as you move forward and backward in time things get more quote unquote decentralized or polarized okay so so in many ways it's sort of a mirror moment you know we're more similar to the 1800s than we are to the 1950s in many ways but you know so for example you have like the advent of cable news the advent of cnn and you know like the repeal of the fairness doctrine all those kinds of things allowed for more opinions to be on you know on the air and then things of course started to accelerate but the internet and especially i'd say blogs in the early 2000s suddenly you started to hear from way more voices way way way more voice than you know microblog and social media and you know initially with facebook and twitter those sort of started in you know like facebook started at harvard you know twitter started in sf and they started among social networks that pretty much agreed with each other you know facebook for example was basically taking colleges and then high schools and putting them online and so there were implicit moires because you could only friend somebody who is at your same institution and and so on and so forth i think a critical moment was you know september 26 2006 when facebook networked the networks okay and um that was a moment where growth really took off it was a huge experiment it was very not obvious that it was going to work um that people would friend each other outside of these institutions because people were sort of cautious about doing that oh you know with a little stranger impact me online that was like there's a natural caution or sort of suspicion of strangers in the 90s and and the early 2000s it was weird to do online dating there's going to be weirdos online etcetera right and then then there's a period of about ten you know five to ten years of like the open internet yay and everyone's just online and they're like hey this social media thing is great let's everybody connect with each other about so like from 2006 to roughly 2015 and then of course what happened is by the early 2010s a lot of people you know actually this happened even pretty quickly with twitter um you know in the middle east voices had been even more constrained than they were in the us so you know the impact of facebook twitter was like boom gasoline you know on on a flame like all these people could speak where they never could speak before and once you have multiple voices that's actually what causes distrust and the reason is if there's only one voice in its broadcast then no one can argue with the voice right but if there's end voices and they're all arguing with each other um you know like people start to be you know they look left they look right they look up they look down they're trying to figure out who to make sense of maybe they make sense of nobody maybe they side with one person more voices more people with the microphone more distrust so i think that was a fundamental thing that caused it the other thing that caused it was once you network the networks all of these rays and assumptions i mean you know before some you know steel worker in in pennsylvania rural pennsylvania and some you know like i don't know a graphic designer in la could blissfully ignore each other's thoughts for their entire lives they would never know what each other thought about various things um you know the the the press would never think of it as you know in the 80s or 90s would never think of it as an important thing to go and you know maybe once a while they might do a lifestyle story but they're not going to like take a live feed of this guy's thoughts and pipe it into the other guy's thoughts it just wouldn't happen there's there's scarce you know time on television you had a 30 minute you know news segment or whatever right um but now those people can find out what each other thinks and they can't stand it they can't stand each other um and the implicit sort of boundaries that have been set up before were just totally collapsed and uh it's as if you know you took these three billion people and you just teleported them into a battlefield you know which is the internet you took down all borders and all boundaries no one has a home they're just boom just transplanted to the plains of you know megiddo where you know armageddon is arising right and that's kind of what happened in the 2010s this is so i i find this so counter-intuitive because basically what you're what you're saying is this uh open communication protocol that we call the internet that we think is so great actually destroyed societal consensus but like i think the the way you're talking about it makes sense blaji but like is is that a good thing because it wasn't it wasn't that these people um didn't have the opinions that they had necessarily it's just that they couldn't express them is this moved to decentralization from the 1950s forward a good thing or a bad thing or is it just neutral is it just a thing that happens and we're just on a you know in the in the trend well so i actually so i i do think much of it is good i think you know my macro is the internet increases variance okay that so that's that's a macro concept that you can apply to many many different sectors for example you go from 30-minute sitcoms to 30-second you know tick-tock videos and uh 30 episode netflix binges okay you you go from a nine-to-five job for the rest of your life to a failed son who stays in mom's basement or a 20-something year old tech billionaire you go from you know the the nightly news where everybody kind of has this normy mainstream opinion to extremely well researched things where people are reading google books and and and pdfs from from you know like like scientific outlets where you can educate yourself to this incredible level or to the dumbest of online conspiracy theories you know and and so in every area what you see is the internet increases variance even in areas that you wouldn't normally think of for example if you look at the data on uber and lyft rides okay relative to taxi rides they have both much longer and much shorter rides than taxis do okay because it was more convenient to call in your borough lift sometimes people will take it for a block where they wouldn't normally call a taxi but also because you you can calculate how much the cost is going to be um you know and people are sometimes used as a car replacement they also tend to take longer rides so it's taken that distribution and just pulled it apart and increased variance right you see this with with book sales you know the um you know with with amazon you know the long tail of books the number of different kinds of books that people are reading the number of different channels so why is why does that happen you know first there's the kind of empirical observation the internet increases variance why is that happening well the answer is whenever you disintermediate you remove the mediator right and nodes can correct connect directly to each other and that mediator is like an averaging um you know force right it rejects some things it it forces things into like a middle of the road kind of thing you know like like the person who used to decide who got on tv would would de facto enforce a sort of normative consensus you know the the person who would um you know decide was on the front page of the newspaper uh all of those quote gatekeepers basically were mediating things and what they were doing was they were capping the upside you know because you'd read some like dumb i don't know maureen dowd column or whatever because she's still she's still i think you know writing columns but you'd read some dumb column or whatever in the 90s but it wouldn't be like a completely lunatic you know conspiracy theory on their hand it also wouldn't be extremely insightful you know it'd just be mediocre and uh and so what what's happened is we've gotten more downside and more upside so everything i just described with everybody sort of meeting you know to to for this armageddon battle online i think is absolutely real but of course at the same time we have open source and we have google and we have you know like incredible amounts of of learning and content and commerce and so on that's happened thanks to the internet right and you know like just like yourself and myself or most of the people we've met on twitter you met all of these really interesting smart intelligent valuable people that that enrich your life online you know so there's a huge win to it there's also a huge loss and what i think happens is um you know i have this concept that all progress actually happens you know on the z-axis what i mean by that is you know for example you start a company because you're you're tired of some existing bureaucracy right you leave google you leave well you know you leave ibm okay uh you leave microsoft then you leave google then you leave facebook and each time what's happening is you you leave the bureaucracy you start something often it fails if it doesn't fail you start getting more um employees and uh you know you start building up you know processes and eventually what happens there's a flip from burn rate to bus number do you know those two things burn rate and buster number like burn rate okay so burnary is like how much how much money you're burning bust number is how many people can get hit by a bus whether your company's still alive right um and you know it's it's colloquial or whatever right but you know point being that early in a startup every single person must be indispensable okay because you're trying to control costs they all have to be total killers unique you know amazing amazing people at a certain point you know once you've gotten the scalable business model where you're repeating it and you've gotten to 10 or 100 million revenue and you need to get to a billion um at a certain point now having seen this many times you know as a venture capitalist an angel investor and and having done it myself a few times um what happens is you start having to uh go from burn rate to bus number where everybody goes from being completely irreplaceable to you're not doing your job as ceo if they're not all replaceable because if one person can you know get sick or quit or something like that it'd crash the site and you would not be doing your duty by your now millions of customers so that is when bureaucracy starts and in the best sense what bureaucracy is is sort of scaling the founders instincts you know the founder kind of writes down what they would do and now you can kind of act as if you were jeff bezos or whatever you know doing customer service himself you know and and that sort of scales themselves and then eventually becomes jeff bezos's designate scaling themselves you know that manager says how the manager would do it and on on and on right um so in a sense a properly functioning bureaucracy is like a set of algorithms that humans rather than machines execute okay and it's meant to achieve a result and it's meant to sort of scale what that human would otherwise do themselves but they can't anymore and it's meant to sort of put a level of intermediation between you know this one unique person rather than having a unique person anybody or any anyone of a class of people can now come into the role and they can do this legal role or they can do the system enroll and amazon.com won't crash if one person quits okay now what happens is as you do this this necessary thing it's like the transition from a single cellular to a multicellular organism as you do this necessary thing as you introduce this bureaucracy you introduce stultification you introduce deadening in a sense of individual initiative how could you not because you're making everybody indispensable or rather you're making people dispensable you have to do this and as you make people dispensable their alienation from their job increases because they realize oh someone else could do this i'm not that unique they don't really need me i can go and do something else this isn't that important and so on and you can save this off to some extent as the thing keeps like growing right but but that that's sort of like a necessary thing that happens and then what happens is you quit because of the bureaucracy okay now that seems at first should just be a loop where we just came back to where we started where you quit from the bureaucracy and you rebuild the bureaucracy right i i call this the libertarian founder rebuilds the state because you find that you know if you're a small libertarian or whatever you know you find that you actually need to there's reasons that various progressive or conservative or whatever things are out there the larger the organization you start to realize you need to actually have some of these things people want a bureaucracy the you know the first or the tenth employee is simply not the same psychological mindset as a ten thousand in terms of a risk reward okay all right this this bellagi this is why the pendulum swings back and forth like throughout time throughout history from central asia centralization to decentralization but i think what you're saying is right like i think what you're saying is um if we talk about decentralization is it good or bad well like what you're saying is there's going to be winners and losers because the 1950s were very good for someone who is average right whereas this more decentralized world is not really built for people for for kind of the average it's not built for the bureaucracy central centralization even kind of the corporate example he gave it optimizes for the average but in this decentralized world we can sort of optimize almost for the exceptional the exceptional people and the exceptional individuals exceptional projects really stand out like someone someone like in the crypto space like vitalik you know teenager sort of created a white paper right except exceptional individual and his true talents were able to be fully expressed in this decentralized permissionless world only possible by the internet is that kind of what you're saying yeah i mean though i would say one thing that's very important is i think the right metaphor is not a pendulum because that sort of makes it seem like there isn't any progress i think the metaphor i think about is a corkscrew okay so if you look down on right as you look down on the corkscrew it looks like the dial is just turning around and around you go you know 12 all the way to 6 back to 12 and so on which is similar to the pendulum metaphor it seems like you're just coming back to where you are right but if you think about you know ibm to microsoft to google to facebook to you know bitcoin and ethereum you're making progress there you know like that there there is a stack of technologies you're building up where you can do more things with with more you know and and as you go and you you know centralize decentralized you know you see this within computing as well right you go from mainframes to personal computers to cloud to mobile to you know like um yeah you know now decentralizing with uh i mean mobile isn't sensible centralized and decentralized right because you know all the services are up in the cloud and the local thing is is on your phone um and now you know back to crypto where you know you bring your private keys locally progress is happening so that's what i'd say there on your other point yes absolutely vitalik's a great example of this um i would i would also note uh that there are folks who were sort of propped up by that existing system who are now falling as a consequence you know and you know that's like the you know in the 1950s what did you do you went and you sat on an assembly line and you pushed the same button every day for 30 years okay um in 2020 what do you do you're pushing a different key every second on your keyboard right and so like the um you know just just the level of innovation and difference and creativity and novelty you need to put out each day is just very different now something else to think about is the 20th century was exceptional in terms of how average making and homogeneous it was that say if you go farther backwards in time okay um you know it like the idea of there being one telephone company and two superpowers and three television stations was actually a massive destruction of diversity of different ideologies of different cultures different ways of thinking leading into kind of the homogeneity of 1950 and these two just giga empires going at it okay um if you go farther backwards in time you know you go to the 1800s um you know like there's frederick jackson tournament concert the frontier thesis the u.s frontier closed in 1890 and if you go further backwards you have you know the time of the robber barons or everybody was able to start you know companies broader barons by the way you know today you'd call them entrepreneurs or founders because they you know they built oil they built railroads they built mines they built all the stuff that that helped build a country um and uh you know at least if you're in the us and you also had private banking where people could issue currencies uh you know very similar to crypto you had um you know sort of uh these communes which are sort of like the intentional houses so people would just go out west and take a bunch of people and you'd start a commune like the oneida commune and whatnot that wasn't actually out west was kind of upstate in europe concept right and yeah conceptually it's basically out to the middle of nowhere pretty much and um and so the uh the thinking is that um our future is really like our past you go further backwards in time and a bunch of like pseudonymous people started a new government now 70s 70s right um and and one of the reasons for that is communications technology at that time imposed necessary decentralization okay you had lags of when a message could get from point a to point b you know the telegraph brought people closer together but you know before the telegraph okay you had the lag of you know physical mail getting somewhere you didn't you don't have you know if you go further backwards you didn't have photos getting somewhere and so on so the ability to coordinate people was just fundamentally limited um you had to build the whole thing as a decentralized system and your ability to enact a uh you know a very centralized thing was was less as you came into the 20th century you got mass media and you got mass production and so the ideologies that preponderated you know like um nationalism and communism and and and you know like kind of the fusion that that was the us right uh democracy you know slash capitalism these were all ideologies that sort of justified control of gigantic numbers of people okay and and you know justified control in the sense that those people heard those ideologies like okay that's legitimate for you to control me to at least some extent it's sort of like a self-referential loop right but um but now i think what you've got thanks to technology shifting thanks to the fact that you know instagram with 12 people can defeat kodak with 12 000. thanks the fact that whatsapp with 55 people can change text mail messaging for for billions of people um you you have new ideologies that are becoming feasible and older ideologies that are really showing their age because they were built under a time when just assumptions were different and you know this is the technological determinant thesis by the way which is every ideology you can think of has always been around what's changed is the technology to make them feasible or infused bellagio i want to take a step back and kind of make sure our listeners are following through the cycles of conversations that we've gone through because there's a through line here to everything and i want to make make sure that the listener understands how we got here we started this conversation talking about how uh there was a in the 50s you you said uh talked about how that was peak centralization there was like one canonical newscaster there was one canon or a few canonical sources of truth and we didn't really have this distrust in institutions that we have today and then you kind of cited how the internet is offers variance to the world and and you cited that it was a good thing it's uh the internet is a democratizing platform if you have a voice you can get a voice on the internet you can create your own blog now you don't need to have to listen to the one canonical source of truth there are new sources of truth that are perhaps different in alternative and also right and then also perhaps not right there's there's fake news and there's real news but for whatever for better or for worse the internet creates uh every version of everything and some of some versions will be bad and some versions will be good either way we have more people able to have voice it's a democratizing technology and as a result of that we've lost the signal right to some degree some people have lost the signal right uh there's the absence of one trusted source of information means that it's harder to find truth right it's harder to to take trust in these legacy institutions because uh in some instances the legacy institutions are being proven wrong and also they're also being proven right um but there there is the as a result of these democratizing technologies we are losing our faith in previous institutions and you've gone through a number of iterations of like how the world has responded to this like regardless of uh our our uh lack of trust in institutions there still seems to be some progress and we can take an evolution in silicon valley tech companies to illustrate some progress forward into the point where you cited like now we have these things called bitcoin and ethereum and that is also on that same spectrum of progress right like there's cycles of history revolutions of history these are all the same patterns and so what me and ryan want to want to get to is okay so we have this we're in this period of of there's a lot of noise and the people are looking for signal especially now and when we see ahead of us perhaps we only see more noise in in the next revolution of history in the next turning of the corkscrew where do we get that signal like how do we as a decentralized group of people uh find consensus find truth where does that come from in the future great question so you know one of my sort of one-liners which i think you also found interesting is you know crypto anarchy is is interesting but i prefer crypto civilization you know i i i thought that was you know right okay so here's what i mean by that if you were sort of to rank order states of being right um you know the worst of all states is sort of tyranny combined with anarchy that's like you know venezuela or to a lesser extent you know significant lesser extent but still not zero like san francisco for example in san francisco you know you you park on the side of the street and you're one minute over and you'll get like a hundred dollar plus parking ticket but you can like defecate in the middle of the street and nothing will happen to you and so that's that's the tyranny on the law abiding like the the poor uber driver or whatever who is just getting crushed by these fines you know um and it's actually a really big deal for them because it's like you know can you can like take away their it's very unfortunate you can take with their entire day's earnings one of those tickets um but they see the guy who's not working at all you know just you know basically have you know doing drugs or or attacking someone in the middle of street nothing happens to them so that's like that's like the worst of all worlds then you have actually just pure anarchy where there's like no government um and that sucks as well but at least you're not you know prevented from doing things by the state you know you can self-organize this is a little bit like russia in the 90s in some ways there were gangs what have you but the oppressive state wasn't there to the same extent um and so the state was at least absent it wasn't like actively promoting you know disorder and tyranny then you go up one level and you have crypto anarchy and crypto anarchy is anarchy in in the physical world in some ways but you've got a digital order you know it's like the apocalypse but with internet okay um and uh you know in some ways that's what covetous right the apocalypse about the internet at least it wasn't early early early months um and um and that's actually what bitcoin's like disaster model is kryptos disaster models uh so crypto anarchy is you now take anarchy and you put a layer on top of it which is you have contracts you have you have a realm in the cloud where there is order and there is logic and there are rules and those rules are enforced by encryption and so on and so forth um even if you know the the land around you is if not mad max um you know like the u.s this summer you know and the last few months has certainly not been normal you know there's there's many shades of gray of course between like totally cop copacetic and mad max but it hasn't been normal you know and um and yet like the internet still works cell phones still work there's still incredible degree of order in the cloud and now you go up on a love level and now you talk about crypto civilization where you say look yes crypto anarchy is better than anarchy which is in turn better than an arc attorney but i prefer crypto civilization crypto civilization is i can bring a group of people together to get to mars okay i can bring a group of people together to build an integrated circuit or a hardware device because it's actually still pretty hard to to build those things you know um like semiconductors like the the actual physical manufacturing still requires the coordination of fairly large numbers of people eventually the robotics maybe that that goes away but that's we're not yet there um and so how do we actually um you know build a crypto civilization well there's a lot of pieces this i've thought about lots of pieces um i have uh i've a book coming out called the network state you can you know if if you want to get updates on just subscribe at biology.com uh sign up it's all free um but but let me just touch on a few pieces of this so the first thing you need is you need some source of absolute truth um i i give like one i shouldn't say one cheer that's not exactly right i give partial credit to the post-modernists who you know have essentially the logic of everything is a power relationship deconstruct everything it's all situationally or contingently you know true if you have power you can change what is true you can divide truths into a spectrum of political truths on one side and technical truths on the other side so like a political truth is um you know who is uh the ceo or where is the border or what is this money worth okay and those are things where if you can write enough software to people's brains you can change who is the leader of some organization or where the border is or what the money's worth because if enough of those people agree on it that thing changes okay um on the other side of the spectrum are technical truths which are truths about you know uh genetics or physics or mathematics like you know what is the genome of this virus and uh you know how how many microns in in diameter is it and how quickly does it replicate okay it's like social consensus versus like scientific truth yes that's right and and the thing about a technical truth the fundamental difference is a technical truth exists independent of human brains whereas a political truth can be changed by affecting human brains covet 19 was a huge shock to america because so much of the us has been set up to simply assume that everything was about a political truth okay it's all about lawyers and pr firms and politics and media and hollywood and you know it's all just like convincing other people to do things versus um even finance even wall street like is it's the best of the east coast institutions or legacy institutions in some ways because it's at least zero-sum you know right um and and so it's all just convincing people to convince people and that's all fine until there's something that comes in that cannot be convinced because you know the coronavirus and i mentioned this it's highly non-compliant with regulations it is willing to commit murder you know um and uh you know it cannot be regulated it's fully decentralized blah blah blah borders without the passport right exactly that's right so so you can't bomb it you can't regulate it you it doesn't get demoralized by negative press coverage it has no bank account to freeze or seize it is just this pure force of nature you know and it's uh it's something where you realize that um much of the us much of the west is uh it's it's what i call founding versus inheriting okay much of the west has is basically just operating on inherited institutions you know it's inherited names it's inherited fortunes but it's inherent institutions in the same way that someone who's like the 10th generation scion of a factory they can collect a you know a check from their trust fund maybe they can tell the factory owner hey make t-shirts with this color rather than that color but they certainly wouldn't be able to like repurpose the factory to go from you know like like task a to task b let alone build a new factory from scratch and that's kind of the problem that covet presented to western institutions is it had to do something new they had to do something new which they were incapable of doing as opposed to folks like let's say bezos or zuckerberg who have founded something from scratch like gigantic multi-million person you know logistics operations or multi-billion person networks you know communication networks those are very difficult things to do those are from scratch whatever you may think of them they they are the kinds of people who can organize large-scale things from nothing and um so the point being that um these inherited institutions not set up to deal with technical truths um founders do have to deal with technical truths and so one of the things to think about is how do you get people to agree on technical truths now a big aspect of crypto is it took things that were previously holy mean meaning totally political truths and starting putting them into the realm of technical truths you know so like who holds what money well now we've actually put some cryptography around that and is that not just the inevitable march of humanity is that not the thing that we do we put things into technical truths and then we build off of that i don't know if that's the inevitable march of humanity i think that um you know there's significant regressions right so if you have you have you studied the renaissance in detail do you know how much you know about it not since ap euro history no okay yeah so like i mean this is this is a little bit of an exaggeration or you might quibble with this but you know imagine if um you know like a a server went down like google went down or something like that and um just all server copies were deleted and someone had to sort of restore what they knew of google from like one person's get checkout okay that's kind of like you know after you know the roman empire fell you know people copied these manuscripts and it was like a big deal to find like oh another piece of source code from this ancient culture that was like way ahead of us and it was like copying of those like old pieces of sorcerers like whoa they were so much smarter man i was able to recover this we would never be able to do this one from scratch right and so like you sort of pieced together like a thousand years later the tattered remnants of what had been a great civilization and then your people were able to rebuild but it really was like you know a thousand year setback you know which is which is a big deal now there's folks who will argue oh you know the dark ages wasn't really dark there was progress in the medieval era etc but you know there's a reason that the renaissance was a renaissance is that they were like wow those old people were actually smart and more advanced in us in some ways yeah um so i wouldn't say it's a guarantee of civilizational progress i i do think there are ideologies that can crash a civilization and take it down hey guys there is so much left in this interview coming up next balaji gets into the differences between what he calls a crypto civilization versus what some people call crypto anarchy we also ask him the question is there room in the world for internet powered coordination groups that have the ability to grow to the size and the influence of a nation-state how a national consciousness might develop among this group of people how this new nation might generate gdp and revenue for itself and also why virtual reality is important in the establishment of this new nation we're going to get into all of those topics it's such an exciting interview but first we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focused on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in d5 why earn's various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer earn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset wiren employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment wiring is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the iron system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that wire has to offer at yearn.finance that's y e a r n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing so back to this idea of a crypto civilization bellagi right so some in the crypto space i think are content with this idea of bitcoin citadels and crypto anarchy right but you're advocating for something more something that i think dave and i in bankless have talked about often we've talked about um the purpose of crypto is to solve human coordination problems right particularly the difficult to solve coordination problems so like what kind of things like what is a crypto civilization what sorts of things can we build on top of these trust machines like is there room for completely self-sovereign internet powered organizations that could even become as complex and as interesting and as coordinated and maybe as powerful as a nation-state one thing i just want to talk about with like citadels and so on i mean one issue is we've seen so many post-apocalyptic movies that people have this sort of romanticized idea of what that is but all the actors in those movies have perfect hair and makeup and you know they go off set they've still got a flush toilet and you know whatever like and and and the thing is that you know in real life you have supply chains you know and lots and lots of things that you just completely take for granted you know supply chains are very important and supply chains in their own way are a social dependency until you have like robotic autarky which i do think can come okay i'm not i'm not against that but you have to actually realize that is itself a serious huge 20-year plus technological project to have like robotic antarctic farms and mines you know where robots would mine and farm everything for you that's becoming possible go look at like vicarious.com um look at rio tinto look at some of the stuff that boston dynamics has done of course and you'll see how how much robotics has advanced in terms of grasping and packing and you know remote mining and stuff but it's a big deal right so supply chains exist citadels are still unrealistic for that from that standpoint because you have social dependencies um so crypto civilization would basically mean using crypto to sort of rebuild civilization and when i say rebuild by the way there's a saying you know um that that's very famous you know from the early age of the the internet uh or the commercial intent which is there's only two ways to make money online that i know of unbundling and bundling okay and so what sort of happened with social networks is we unbundled the nation state but i think what's going to happen is we're going to rebundle the nation state into a a concept that i'm calling the network state and the network state starts you know a concise definition is a network state is a virtual or vr social network with an integrated cryptocurrency a sense of national consciousness and a plan to crowdfund territory okay and so there's a bunch of things there you know i'll pack unpack them but essentially it is um it starts with the observation that if you uh if you think about the emergence of btc and eth right ten years ago bitcoin didn't even exist or okay it exists in 2009 i say 12 years ago bitcoin didn't exist um but basically by about 2013 it was listed on bloomberg and cnbc um you know there's a price taker for this pure internet phenomenon and it was it was the first of its kind like purely from the internet holy cow you know uh as opposed to something that had been uploaded from the offline world right this was a digital native object like the thing we were talking about at the beginning the primary in the mirror this was primarily digital it had no offline analog right and so being listed there was this huge win and now of course we don't think of that as that remarkable um but but it was a big deal and uh in in the same way something i've thought a lot about is if you look at the list of you know countries in the united nations there's 233 countries united nations just off the top of your head do you know how many of them have a population less than 1 million i would definitely say most of the majority but i'm not sure how many it's about 30 have a population less than 1 million and about 60 percent have a population less than 10 million so so the reason that's counterintuitive is most people live in big countries okay so most people live in china india you know the us right even russia germany france the uk so you think okay yeah most countries are kind of like that actually no most countries are small countries and what that suggests is okay well look if if a million people in one place that's a nation state it's got borders we call it estonia right um it's got a seat on the u.n security council it's got a flag it's got you know like it's got recognition from these other governments could you take a million people online and if they develop a sense of national consciousness which to be clear could take years or decades you know or even longer okay um you know i'm not saying it's like an overnight thing but if they if they do that well you know there's a concept of national self-determination could they not crowdfund territory right in the in the same sense that the you know estonians can afford estonia right like in the sense of like probably i haven't looked at the actual deeds and and land records but you know it is likely that those million estonians own most of estonia right um a million people could crowdfund territory and they could start by doing it with enclaves so that is to say they don't all have to be next to each other at the beginning um if you think about google or facebook uh have ever been to a google office i have not i have not oh really wow crypto really is a different culture you know it overlaps with tech but crypto is to internet tech as internet tech was to desktop uh tech yeah totally right so so you know there's it's interesting to hear you say that because you know i sort of straddle both worlds right and there's you know just like there are folks who made the transition from desktop to the internet but yeah okay so you have not actually visited major tech companies have you ever been to any of them nope no wow i came i came from a world of physical therapy oh wow okay that's so interesting and and i'm glad i'm glad to hear it okay so i'll say something which you may not know okay so if you have a google badge right and you visit a google office anywhere in the world it's like a little piece of google it's a fractal polity okay you walk in and the branding is just so the couches are just so there might be some twist for like you know google spain or whatever maybe some of the signage is in the local language or something like that right but it's recognizably google everywhere in the world your login works um your your you know your internet connection works you're allowed to be there yeah you're allowed to be there exactly right like we work i do have that familiarity with we work okay exactly and in the same sense you know like to to give one chair to defend the honor of the multinational this is also why the frequent flyer actually likes starbucks and mcdonald's and so on you know it's it's like okay i've got a familiar experience yeah maybe it's not going to be that great but i know they're going to burn the coffee just the way that i know it's going to be burned you know it's it's a devil i know right um and so like my day is not going to get worse right so speak right so so you just bound downside by going there and actually that's often a valuable thing to do right it sounds like what you're talking about right so like like going back to this funding and territory that sort of thing national consciousness vr i think those are the three things you said are part of a network stake it sounds like you're proposing like the new ico but it's it's not an initial company it's initial country offering well like we could actually like fund one of these countries to be so i i have a friend who uh is american he found out that um through you know his uh ancestry he has a small portion luxembourgian actually in his family relations so he went through the process and applied to the country of luxembourg and now he and his family actually have a luxembourg citizenship which gives them access to like uh europe and it seems very much to me as i was hearing a story and i think luxembourg has a population of like six hundred thousand people that this is a country that almost like punches above it's it's absolutely it almost like acts like a startup in that it is looking to attract um citizens it's almost like uh you know dave and i and i'm sure you have balaji you've read the sovereign individual right that that whole thesis that i think i probably got a lot of people in crypto twitter on to that by the way if you go back and look yeah i'm sure you did like and like uh but but the idea is basically i got from teal so you know that's legacy give credit yeah and that the idea thank you peter uh that and the idea is basically that nation states would have to be competitive for population sets essentially and i see that in luxembourg is that kind of what you're saying that a digital nation would essentially do is attract some population and like i'm i get kind of the vr part i think the funding a territory part makes sense right because we've seen sort of icos and what crowdfunding can do what is this national consciousness piece how do you get that so one thing i'd say let me just talk about a couple of things you said first just on the ico bit um the thing about icos is you know like i i think they i'm mostly negative on them but not completely um the thing that's good about them is that you you can do capital formation and so on right um instantly all that stuff the thing that's bad about them is it's a promise of fast money you know and you know venture capital has many flaws but one of the things it evolved over time which you sort of take for granted when you're in the space is a mechanism to select for people who have ambition more than avarice okay and what that means is you give them 10 million dollars and the first thing they do is they don't go and buy a sports car with it or whatever they're putting it into the business right this is almost like it's it's incredible to the extent to which that sort of assumed that any deal that i refer to somebody or who is referred to me we have already done sort of that pre-vetting mechanism to such an extent that you forget how important vetting mechanism that is to some extent right when you just open it up to the whole world of course there are crooks of course there are people who just want to get money now right and and so the one the big problems with icos is too much money like up front versus like you know um like building it over time of course some people who can you know obviously ethereum's ico was great there's some icos that have been great i'm not against it as a thing what i think happens the rapprochement that happens is you bring a lot of venture terms into icos to protect investors so for example for your lock-ups and you know agreements on who can sell when and the equivalence of boards and all the type stuff and that's entered into by all participants so you sort of bring some of those structures you know on in there okay so that's kind of one thing the reason i just wanted to push back on that is like starting a new country it's not like a it's not a money-making endeavor per se it is uh it is something which is um it's meant to actually get to a level of stability um it's a civilization-making endeavor you know uh how do you build a stable civilization that can get to mars that can can do a brain machine interface that can do limb regeneration that can do reversal of aging and life excision that's my interest in it okay so there's no go so is this is this goal to make to perhaps like generate a community of online individuals and then some somehow like crowdfund money to purchase real property somewhere real land is this is this a goal to answer one of the original questions that we started this podcast with is where are we going to look to for institutions into the future it's like well that's right our current institutions our current governments aren't really doing their jobs and so we will just make our own country and we'll do it ourselves is this the goal of this whole thing yeah so so the thinking is i don't think many institutions that predated the internet will survive the internet oh interesting okay including the nation state including the nation state now the thing is that there's two ways to get to a network state one of them is like a retrofit of an existing nation state which sort of networkifies it in the same way that you know buildings that that were exist in the 1800s got you know uh lighting and electoral power if you go to east the east coast have you been to like like a boston or something like that or let alone europe you see these old old buildings that have you know have been retrofitted for power and for lighting which weren't before right okay so one way of doing it and and you know some examples of network states good versions you know coming from below coming from the state up to the cloud up good versions would be like estonia um you know a bad ver you know like taiwan singapore fairly you know computer savvy and so on a bad version arguably is like china and maybe where the us is heading actually in some ways where it's like you know the technologies using cruising to oppress and to track and to surveil okay um and you know china also does good things with technology it's not purely dystopian so you know i want to give some credit to them i know it's it's it's not that fashionable to do so it's not like every single person there he's like oh my god get me out but a lot of people are a lot of people do want to get out so it's not it's not the ideal vision the alternative is rather than having a retrofit where you take an existing state and you kind of retrofit it for the network you start with the network and then you get the state now how do you do that well um you know that that's going to be a process of degrees but just to give you some proof points um if you think about hq2 right you think about tesla and the geiger factory so amazon hq2 negotiated amazon negotiated with new york and and washington dc and other places say hey look if we bring 25 000 people um to your district what can you give us right can you give us guarantees that we can build there you know can you um like you know tell us that you're not going to impose new regulations or fees on us in the next few years right and you know cities bid on this right and you know some that didn't like it but they did also bid on it and uh you know elon did this with tesla like his geiger factory location he got places to bid on it google did this with google fiber um and uh boeing did this with its uh plant and eventually based in south carolina and an interesting question is can we take that out to the confines of mere companies if we do that for communities okay can we organize communities to do collective bargaining with governments fascinating fascinating and so the thinking is crypto allows you to have binding online commitments so if you have a million people who each put in a thousand dollars that is a billion dollars provable hard currency you could show to you know the government of xyz and you say hey look this district over here is totally unoccupied um what if we pay you a billion dollars or you can see we're good for it or we pay you 100 million you know a year for 10 years right and we set up this smart contract which is doing so on the condition that um self-driving cars are legal here and we can build whatever we want bellagi how reasonable do you think that this is i think it's extremely nothing i've described violates the laws of physics right um we're you're just talking about a large online crowdfund and not even that large because amazon hq2 is only 25 000 people what what are the layers of the stack here so i'm trying to understand right so we've got vr right uh you get that right so like and but like the chris let me explain why the vr component by the way is important here okay do that and i also want to i also want to hear about kind of the crypto components right so from crypto something like a bitcoin or ethereum obviously we have some kind of a money or we have a staple coin and then with d5 maybe we get basically kind of financial infrastructure and then like decentralize possibly gonna be get involved somewhere decentralized identity i i would that that seems to be part of it but also like the smart contract layer can almost act as sort of a financial uh you know law uh system or a corporate law system if you will like are those based components or maybe you could describe some of the components we have now that we didn't previously have that make this even feasible so very briefly vr is important because vr architecture is important um this is something which people outside the field don't really know but architecture has gotten into vr as much as like traditional finance has gotten into crypto like it's it's a fairly big thing in architecture for maybe the obvious reasons you can walk around the building you can have clients look at it it's just way more real when you can see it in 3d you know oh that's you know that beam is in a weird location oh the window sells a weird location oh the light will come in this window weird we should move the window you can get you can basically virtualize it okay and what that means is um what hasn't been done but which i want to do is make that a social thing where you know john winthrop in the in the early uh you know kind of pre um pre-usa america uh had this concept of you know the city on a hill okay and and the idea is that the uh the city on a hill was um you know how how you'd build this amazing city up on a hill that would be a beacon for everybody and so on right so the update of that is i think of the city in the cloud okay we build this thing in this in the cloud which is this amazing futuristic city and we can debug it and argue over it and edit it and fork it and whatever in the cloud yeah because it's it's bytes right so if if somebody disagrees with it you could fork it and materialize a different version in a different location because when i say materialized by the way um you know vr architecture you can get it to autodesk quality right you can have the location of every pipe every wire every outlet um every you know like drop of paint can be fully specified in these vr environments in fact that's how things are constructed in in autodesk you just need to uh i'm not saying it's trivial okay but autodesk does have stuff where you can upload to the cloud and and and see it in vr as well right so so existing architecture firms have software for this kind of thing and and there's already energy towards it in that space it's not just like one person trying to do it point being you can envision getting to a buildable blueprint in vr that you can walk through not just for a single building but for a community not just for a community but for a town just for a town but for a city okay and um and then you know songdo for example it is possible to build a city you know like there are contractors out there you know in china i don't know if you've seen some of these videos they can snap together a train station in nine hours you know they can build a skyscraper in like a few days um you can also by the way constrain your vr architecture for the purposes of rapid materialization you know for example maybe you only use shipping containers or you only use these kinds of power outlets or these kinds of windows you know it's like your library of things that you can drag and drop into place is constrained in a certain way by cost or materials or weather or whatever right okay so that's a vr component what's the crypto component crypto component gives you a lot of stuff it gives you um you know the currency of course it gives you smart contracts for binding kinds of agreements you can do crypto credentials this is something i'm going to write more on but i think it's a missing component for kind of online work is approvable approval scarcity of credentials that that would actually remove a lot of interviewing time if you could just prove you knew python and how well you knew python and then you know jobs just open up to you you could just then qualify for github tickets that you could do for a hundred bucks you know if you knew python right um crypto is also something which allows people to crowdfund it allows them to make long-term provable commitments it allows them to do encryption it allows uh you know people to do hosting that sort of sovereign hosting blah blah blah all the things that you know we know crypto can do perhaps most importantly um and i don't think people realize how important this is something like ens is a crypto identity that allows you to earn and speak under one name you can speak under you know one pseudonym earn under another student your state name they use on official forms is yet a different one and um you know this is something you can use to log into websites it it's something where everything that you do under your online names you can have it factored and organized and um you you basically own all of that digital property and this lets you exit and move between network states as well because you've got the self-sovereign identity so it's like your identity and your wallet and your private keys and so on all kind of coincide and you mentioned you mentioned um like property right so we've often talked about bitcoin and ethereum and especially ethereum being sort of like a digital property rights system that's independent of the nation state would you depend on something like an ethereum for example for a property rights for a a network state like this yeah potentially i mean lots of small countries by the way they they do what's called dollarization or harmonization have you heard that term yes so dollarization is they peg their currency to the dollar right harmonization is they outsource their regulation to the u.s rather than doing it themselves you know relatively few countries actually have like their totally own sovereign military and sovereign currency and sovereign regulation and so on so forth they actually outsource much more than people think you know and so in that sense sovereignty truly is a continuum and you don't have to start i mean very few countries did start this way um you don't have to start as like okay i'm going to try and be like you know invading iraq or whatever you know that's actually probably a stupid idea you know um what you want to do is start with um mutual positive interactions with local governments where uh you are hey uh you know we're just gonna build a self-driving car zone over here in this swamp where we're going to take video of it with drones nobody's living there um you know we'll pay you x dollars per year uh we'll you know we'll abide and this is critical initially you're just building new towns or new cities right you your initial agreement's probably the first 10 or so that you do of these communities um you are abiding by all local laws you might ask for one the first one you don't even ask for an edit you just showed that you can build a town from the cloud which is amazing okay the second or the fifth through the 15th you ask for an edit which is hey let us do self-driving cars hey let us fly drones here you know hey let us let this be a fintech regulatory sandbox we can just start a crypto company here sort of like you know casinos are allowed on some native american land right um hey let us uh you know do stem cells here like stem cells are allowed in germany right you start asking for regulatory breaks where everybody who comes into this special innovation zone is there for the regulatory break for the for the innovation and they've all gone in eyes wide open right and then with success in that you you push farther right and and this is the same model for example of special economic zones that the u.n and world bank and others are all very familiar with and have endorsed except you're not like it's not focused on taxes per se what it's focused on is regulation because a tax is a is a quantitative thing it's like okay i would have gotten x percent now i got y percent but a regulation is a qualitative thing where it's literally impermissible to do it in the first place impermissible to use or drive that self-driving car right and making it permissible to do something those impermissible is a binary thing and that just unlocks something totally different we've been talking about this network state this sort of crypto nation but two things in my mind seem to be missing the first question is what is the economic engine of this thing is there some sort of incentive structure to contributing and then let's get into the social layer of this thing but first the the economic engine what powers every every you know nation has an uh economic engine of some sort what is this nation's economic engine so i think um it's going to be digital labor for digital currency where the digital labor aspect is uh it comes from a digital university and so the idea is that you know cities in the past were begun on the basis of being near rivers or oceans or coal mines you know natural resources of some kind more recently they've you know been that's become more commoditized thanks to shipping and so on you don't have to be next to a coal mine to get access to coal um you do pay some surcharge for being far away from it but you can get it shipped to you uh and so and not just from one location but from n of the locations where it's being mined right and so instead uh what matters is um the proximity of a university uh of some kind so stanford and berkeley are one example but certainly you know oxford and cambridge and other universities around the world have sort of catalyzed these sort of local tech ecosystems and in the cloud if you could build a digital university that issued what i call a crypto credential namely a provable certificate that shows that you have a certain skill you know and it could go very micro right it's like i can code a binary tree and rust okay and the code the source code that you have to do that is put on chain as is the integration test that evaluates it and it's maybe co-signed by a proctor who saw you type it in and maybe it's encrypted so it's not easy for somebody else to copy but that you could easily give a view key to somebody so that they could run an integration test against it to confirm that you actually coded at this time right maybe there's other features as well but those are just some of the some of the things that gives you something which is like a very fine-grained qualification you might say okay well why do i care if they can code a binary tree and rust okay well now let's say they've got examples where they can code not just a binary tree but a skip list in a b tree and you know like they've coded a compiler and an operating system they've basically gone through the list of major algorithms and data structures and they've done so well in rust and they've got like 70 different examples okay that might be somebody who could contribute to the parity code base right if they've done the same thing they've done it in go that might be somebody who's qualified to contribute to the geth code base right and so now you did is you just made the impedance matching from somebody's skill to their work much much much easier and um it could be something where okay uh you know someone who has that crypto credential and they submit a pull request your open source project you're more likely to look at it um or you just may you know merge it given that they you know you probably want to review it for security and other types of stuff but um you're much much more likely to to look at it uh if they interview with you they're you're much more likely to um give them an interview so basically like uh crypto labors right and they get the the crypto nation provides them credentials in this model of things and of course that's a powerful labor force of course they're all a credentialed labor force which is pretty interesting does the crypto nation get its cut does a percentage of the earnings go to some tax system as a as a nation state might do or is there some sort of like issuance fee some sort of inflation that happens in the background so like what is the economic engine that actually pays for the the national infrastructure if you will so the simplest is um and you know several thoughts on this first is if you build an economy there's like 500 different ways you can take fees off of that economy if you need to do that right right but the simplest is you boost people's human capital and then you take a cut one way of doing that is um you know the the the lambda school model where it's an isa right um you know that is to say you you train you you take a a worker at walmart you train them in programming you place them in a programming job and you know lambda school for some people increases their income like a hundred thousand dollars a year and then they take a cut of that via the isa right so you literally increase somebody's human capital you take a cut of it that's a win-win-win all around right okay so you educate the individuals and then as a result of that education they go out into the workforce and you've invested in them with an isa an income service agreement i believe yep and then you get your dividends paid to you by the labor of that person that you educated correct that's right and so they've made a hundred thousand dollars more a year and they give you back 20 or 30 000 something like that right that's a lambda school business model um another business model is you know something like on deck where people pay to be part of a community um and they get mentorship and and help out of it sort of like um you know like like uh what's my college sort of like a college alumni network if you can't get into a college you know or you know you can't attend remote or something right but it's much cheaper than that still you know reasonably priced so that's another version where it's a membership base like community base you're part of a plan alignment and then so the laborer gets uh credentials access to these credentials what other public services do they get from the nation state so if i'm in the nation of the united states i get a pretty robust legal system for instance you know you know generally nice place to lay uh live um good good rule of law um you know there's geographic i guess you know weather sorts of advantages there's economic advantages if i'm close to a place like york city that's you know financial hub of the world these sorts of things those are the the network effects that the united states has and the benefits of being a us citizen how would such a nation state or such a crypto nation attract these types of laborers what would be the perks or the public goods yeah so good question so um well first i would sort of contest your premise which is um i think that uh the value proposition of you know if you separate out into physical america and digital america okay and you say physical america is you know being physically present in the united states and digital america is you know having access to internet services not all of which are american but many of which are so that's amazon.com and google.com and wikipedia and whatnot right um i argue that much of the value proposition of being physically in america has been uploaded to the cloud over the last 20 years in the sense that you can live an american grade life in thailand or poland or you know um like big swats of brazil and you know so on and so forth right in good chunks of the world especially in asia much of asia you can live uh in eastern europe you know western europe um much of the middle east or at least parts of millions that aren't you know in war but like dubai for example pretty nice place to live israel you know um and good chunks of south america as well you can live an american-ish life sometimes american plus um because it's better you know the streets are cleaner in asia you know and uh your email is the same you know you log in and boom you're in the same gmail no matter where in the world you are right do you mean irrespective of whether you have an american citizenship or not if you're using sort of these quote-unquote like american that's right that's right i mean build services the thing is that you know 20 years ago you know 30 years ago um there wasn't even the concept like 30 years ago you had to come to america to get starbucks and mcdonald's and you know clean streets and so on and so forth over 20 30 years the world has dramatically changed and lots more places have become livable you know it's like the the the sort of things that you take reason i just say starbucks is it signifies a certain level of sort of consumer affluence that you can afford afford to pay four dollars for burnt coffee or whatever i like i like the particular way they burn it by the way but you know it's just sort of a signal you've got at starbucks you've got an apple store you've got high-speed internet connection you've got food delivery you've got um grocery delivery you've got amazon delivery you've got printers and you know your your plugs work your power works waterworks all that type of stuff right the basics um plus you know a little bit more than the basics you know you can get in much much more of the world now than you could 30 years ago 20 years ago so bellagi one one question that i have with the formation of this whole nation is why the the incentives are there but what about this how does a social fabric cohere when the american revolution established america there was like a very similar shared set of values that people wanted to see instantiated and i don't think that while there's plenty of incentive to move to this new theoretical nation which with that has an intrinsic advantages and intrinsic uh incentives to be there it seems to be missing a social purpose a social coherency how does it how does a community arise in this newton-like nation well so actually that's a huge part of what i talk about in the book short version is absolutely you know when you think about france the first thing you think about is not the french stock market god bless them okay the first thing you think about is not you know the valuations of their tech companies or anything you think about the louvre and you you know i know i'm pronouncing that wrong yeah uh you think about you know the eiffel tower and you think about baguettes and and le fromage and all this stuff right and um and you think about their their culture because they really do have an amazing culture they've got some they've done some amazing things um and that's what kind of defines them as as a country it is their art it is their food it is their you know architecture it's all that stuff right um and you know what's interesting is whenever you have large assemblies of people they're sort of a default culture forming process we don't usually think of this but you know the 100 something million person social network called japan created sushi and you know the 300 million person social network called reddit helped create keto you know and uh you know keto came out of reddit it is absolutely a diet of the internet you know and uh you know you can argue it's a subculture it's not the entirety of 300 million i would agree with you right but it's not the cuisine of any country yet but i think it will be okay and so in the same way once you start thinking about nations as just large collections of people with a shared culture you should one should also realize well actually the us is unbundling right certainly people have talked about it as you know like blue versus red or whatever and that's an important aspect but it's unbundling in lots of other ways um you know it's got cloud people versus land people you know who are working remote versus working with their hands it's got you know um like folks who are secular versus others just the commonality that bound the us together is just less there and um so you do have to rebuild that online and uh you know i think it's a it's a gradual process it's not going to happen overnight but you know things like uh you know articles that you agree with piece of art that you like generating culture together hanging out together socializing together i think you know video games are underrated because they're remote play as opposed to remote work um you don't normally think of it this way but you know for example there's a company which i respect and they do like a zoom coffee right and look zoom coffee is fine you know but you're sort of inventing a ritual you know um to to do that you wouldn't normally do right um you know it's a little unnatural to come and drink your coffee in front of the monitor right you know what is natural is to get on call of duty or fortnight you know with your friends and blow something up right um well what's also natural i think would also be like finding people via facebook or twitter right that's a large part of how communities are established that's right but we in in this podcast we've talked about how facebook and twitter kind of represent google they kind of represent their own internal nations are these nations uh invited to this new nation or is that against the ethos is that against the purpose of this whole thing so what do you mean are our facebook and twitter nations and vibes these new nations are asking yeah like is the social fabric of the nation established through a twitter medium or is that like antithetical because it's using an alternative twitter it's using web 2 technology when it could be using a more decentralized medium oh well i i mean the technology is certainly one aspect of it but i think the fundamental thing is that twitter and facebook are utilities not communities okay right so the whole point is um basically that um you know twitter in particular is just the public war zone right right people there look i mean you're on crypto twitter i don't even need to tell you what that means right like people basically you know for for a number of reasons twitter has set it up to optimize engagement guess what a significant number of humans do things that i would never have thought to do which is like run up to strangers and just say fu at them right and you know i remember like a year or two ago i had a thread which was like twitter is not real life yet but it will be it was just before corona actually i think right and the reason is i think the question i want to was getting at is the what holds the social graph of the network ah of the that's what i think that's what i really meant to do so good question so the answer is different network states are held together by different things so i think the first network state you know the one that like you know i may build is um held together by the goal of uh immutable money infinite frontier eternal life okay so that is to say you know bitcoin digital currency of course i respect ethereum you know but um like immutable money infinite frontier like mars and eternal life meaning reversing aging right and that kind of stands for a sense of uh you know of progress technological progress um and really pushing the frontier the great acceleration as opposed to the great stagnation and it's it's sort of something it's a little bit of a shibboleth you know the shiblet is it's like it's a term from religion which is like um a seemingly insignificant you know customer tradition that distinguishes like one group from another okay um so if you like you know peter thiel zero to one if you like my book if you like my twitter feed if you like mark anderson's it's time to build if you like elon's spacex you know feed uh if you you know can do physics if uh you are willing to um fight back online uh not necessarily to start a fight but certainly to fight back if necessary and so on and so forth there's a bunch of these sort of cultural checklist items and i'm not saying every single one of them is is critical but all those things together if that's like a particular kind of person you know it's like the pro-tech you know pro-future kind of person um and i think that's like that's a network shape i'm interested in building something which is it sort of restores what western civilization used to have which was the arrow of progress right the sense of not manifest destiny like conquer someone else but um you know to to get to space right to transcend the sense of transcendence you know to overcome our limitations to advance mathematics to uncover the secrets of the universe you know that that's the the sense of the explorer the the pioneer to reopen the frontier right that's the kind of um spirit that i'm looking for for the first network state and the the interesting thing about this bellagi is right so somebody could take all of the open source that is built through the network state that you're envisioning fork it and cr instantiate their own network state with say a different set of values right something like that is like super like conservative or super regressive or like they're really passionate about the keto diet right whatever and uh then it's almost like a kind of a survival of the fittest sort of you know which economy which network state is going to attract the most sovereign individuals to live there and to grow its economy that's right so so that's right so basically um you know i think the first network state we will set up for forking in much the same way imagine if bitcoin was set up to fork at the beginning right completely different world if had if that had been like a design decision from the beginning i don't think satoshi could have envisioned what happened with it you know like he he or she or they um figured out a lot of things but it's pretty hard to predict the craziness of crypto or last you know 10 years right um but had you set it up to fork uh which which i which i would intend to do yes you could build a vegan network state you could build one that was focused on let's say latin right you know for example the israelis were able to revive hebrew which was a dead language you know you could have a latin network state that wanted to revive latin and greek which i mean greek is obviously a live language but you know what i'm saying that those used to be studied right um you could have one that focused on like shipping container housing and uh you know there's there's various subcultures and communities where they're full expression the reason i mentioned veganism for example is there's a whole supply chain associated with that right it's everything from food preparation to um it's something where if all the people opt in you know and they know it's all vegan by default you don't have to ask people's dietary preferences etc you um you just know they're all vegan right and in vegan zone yeah you're in the vegan zone that's right and so you you know somebody doesn't have to ask they don't accidentally eat meat by mistake they don't accidentally eat eggs by mistake uh you know none of the pots and pans if you're really religious about it you know some people are literally religious vegans you get it you get there's a certain benefit from flipping all the switches so you can go full stack on something and the assumptions are just baked into the firmament right so is this reorganizing the world from like if we take this experiment this thought experiment out to the nth degree is the borders of the world reorganized by shared but shared sets of values in in all particular forms yeah so i wrote an essay on this actually in 2013 called software is reorganizing the world where essentially i predicted that um because your actual community it's not about your nation state or your state of mind right actually to go to something very fundamental right um the whole piece of westphalia uh you know 1648 which established what we think of as a modern nation state you know what what preceded that was you know the idea that the the catholic church could have influence anywhere and uh instead what happened was like okay this is our turf that's your turf we've got a government it is the sole you know holder of the monopoly of violence over this territory that's your territory catholic church you're not a sovereign here right that all of those assumptions actually were not things that just came out of nowhere they they were fought over and negotiated for a long time um there's a fundamental presumption behind that which is that people in the same geography people who are close to each other in physical space implicitly share the same culture and therefore can be bound by the same laws okay but now when people live in anonymous apartment complexes and don't recognize each other you know people live in these uh huge apartment buildings and literally wouldn't recognize somebody who's living 10 feet away from them you know but what they do is they they recognize somebody who's 3000 miles away from them via snapchat or whatsapp or whatever right and so that's a different distance metric you know the distance metric in physical space you can think of it as a so-called great circle distance which is the distance between two points on the face of the surface of a sphere okay um whereas the geodesic distance is the number of degrees of separation between two people in a social network now the great circle distance is an approximation because in practice you know you're going to be constrained by oceans and by you know mountain ranges and deserts and so on and so forth but roughly speaking it's like the transit time overland between two people okay um whereas the geodesic distance is you know it's basically the speed of light so it's the distance in a social network and increasingly that's the one that really matters because that's where you're spending much of your time that's where your trade is happening that's your social network those are the people you're talking with and so you're in just a totally different headspace than the person next door who themselves is totally different headspace than the person next door to them right and that's the state of affairs we're in right now but i think that because humans are still fundamentally physical beings you know um that's like a rubber band that's going to snap and it's going to snap in such a way that it pulls people up into the cloud and then down into an area where they can all coalesce together right and covid because it just pushed remote everything because of covid because of starlink um crypto's a big component uh all of this stuff is going to you know especially if in the if a vaccine is deployed right um which would be wonderful obviously but if a vaccine is deployed the world doesn't just go back to what it was it is a fundamentally remote world now right digital nomadism spikes right because anybody can work from anywhere all the stuff we've been talking about for the last decade just goes totally vertical and it becomes more feasible to just go and live with the people of like mind you know it's a plane ticket to go over there now of course it's harder for people with families it's harder for people you know who aren't as mobile and one of the things you want to do is you want to bring down that cost of exit but here's the thing even if only a relative does some of that cost of exit come as a result like i i would imagine the legacy world if you could embody the legacy world into one like leviathan the legacy world doesn't want that to change like the nation state isn't interested in this new future world what what are the frictions coming from the legacy world that's going to like kind of slow this progress down not everyone is ready for this kind of change [Laughter] it's it's going to be interesting um i think that it's one important thing is that um you know the world is no longer the united states you know or china right uh that is to say you know the us is 300 million people china's 1.1 billion 80 percent of the world is neither american nor chinese right 96 is non-american um so i think a lot of this is probably going to be done outside the u.s in various ways number one um number two is you know it's it's not illegal to leave a country in fact it's a u.n human right um to be able to leave uh you know to like the right of people to emigrate this it's funny all the stuff i talked about in terms of right to exit um you know years ago i think people appreciate that more with lockdown and with planes being shut off and so on and so forth when that's taken away that you're like oh wow the right exit is actually pretty important you know now the right to exit is not the right enter a country may not decide to let you in it may be due to corona maybe do other things you know um but i think that we're in for an age of much more global migration than was previously possible and many more nations are going to become nations of not just immigrants but also immigrants what's funny by the way is you know for ireland for india for china for other countries those you know mexico those countries all encouraged their citizens in different ways or at least certainly didn't extremely discourage them from leaving the countries that have discouraged citizens for leaving tend to be the ones that are really bad you know like cuba like east germany which set up the berlin wall and shot people for trying to leave um like russia the u.s actually passed something called the jacksonvanic amendment you guys know what that is no no jacksonvanic was passed to allow soviet jews to be able to get out of the ussr because they weren't able to practice they were you know particularly oppressed you know there right and so that's the kind of country which you can't get out of do you by do you know why the berlin wall was set up in the first place so people couldn't get out yeah but the context of it was um after world war ii you know the allies you know the u.s uh britain france and the ussr split up whereas the u.s and britain and france on one side really the us coalition and you know the soviet union on their side and berlin was set up in this odd way you can look at a map where west berlin um or rather the west germany controlled part of berlin was part of east germany okay and it was behind enemy lines okay it was in this weird enclave kind of thing okay and um so because of that uh what that meant was that it was a weird loophole um that you could walk out of east germany into west berlin here's here's actually i'm going to paste this into our little document or whatever so you can just kind of get a visual of it um so so you you could walk out of the the eastern block into west germany and gtfo out of this horrible you know communist dictatorship right um now of course that was quite a loophole and east germany did not like that especially once all the professionals started doing it because those are the people that the communist regime was giving the worst deal to so they came with a term called republiflooked which pathologized anybody who left and it was something which was basically like oh you're a traitor for leaving um here i'm just pacing it in over here you're a traitor for leaving i can't believe you're doing this um you know from the moral standpoint as well as the interests of the whole german nation leaving the gdr being the german democratic republic is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity those who let themselves be recruited objectively serve west german reaction and militarism is it not despicable when for the sake of a few alluring job offers or other false promises about a guaranteed future one leaves a country in which the seed for a new and more beautiful life is sprouting for a place that favors a new war and destruction you know that kind of tone right um and basically um republiflook was this thing where uh you know the country that sucked everybody wanted to leave it and they started to put up barriers to leaving it and then eventually a wall where they shot you for trying to leave and that was there for 40 years uh so i mean it's it's something where um actually you know 40 is not exactly 40 it's 38 years okay but that is something where uh unfortunately i think some countries will go down that route i think other countries are going to be more favorable to migration either a because they're net winners or b because they're just more enlightened about it okay so another question i have so say the the the right to exit um like citizens start exiting countries in in various ways but what about the idea that um like countries still could use the the threat of force to make lesser countries smaller countries less powerful uh countries sort of their their satellite state right almost um subjugate them do you think that basically in geopolitics it's sort of the the rule of the jungle blodgie or do you think that like there can be a more peaceful coexistence like for a crypto nation would a crypto nation have to have a military for instance i mean that's crazy as that sounds well i think that um you know we're getting to so a few things first is um india managed to get its independence non-violently right so did singapore so it is possible to do so that's kind of one one major concept that's an important inspiration i think also that you know you don't have to go to full sovereignty right away you can i mean just getting a special innovation zone where you're building a new city where you have dispensation from the powers that be um you know there's 233 countries in the world some of them will want entrepreneurs to come near and build you know the self-driving car detroit right so i don't think you need a military to do a lot of this stuff number one okay um number two though you ask you know could it be possible that somebody you know that governments will get very oppressive and so on unfortunately that is possible however um i i would also say you know in um there's this sort of toy problem in differential equations where you've got two armies and you have the assumption that um like the first army is n soldiers and the second has m soldiers and the n soldiers can kill the m soldiers at a rate k1 and the m soldiers can kill the end soldiers at a rate k2 and so what happens is each side is shooting the other and knocking down its soldiers which knocks down the ability other guys to kill this group and and vice versa right so you know basically blam blam blam blam and who wins right um and you know if you've got more firepower but fewer people you might you know take them to zero faster than they take you to zero right okay um and so in a sense you know you're losing power even as you're fighting better guys there's a there's a modification of that which is it's not that their guy is um shooting you and therefore reducing your firepower it is one where using your firepower causes enough public backlash that it reduces your firepower okay so hard power the use of hard power especially if it's filmed depending on how it's filmed and how it's put out there potentially reduces the support for further ruthless measures of hard power it very much depends on the context and so on but it can be delegitimizing okay so for example when the ussr went and did um you know the invasions of you know hungary and of um czechoslovakia um like in in 1956 um you know uh when the soviets rolled tanks in there or when in 1968 when they rolled tanks into um you know the the during the prague spring uh both of those were things where the soviets put it down but they did so with just brute force right and um and those you know like they caused people to know that they were not free people you know and it did take 20 years it wasn't something that happened overnight but they paid a price for that which was delegitimization among people at least behind closed doors you know and um you know i think that that price paid for the use of very coercive hard power is faster in the internet age with encrypted you know end-to-end messaging and so on and so forth it's you know if you're brassonly you know attacking or censoring or you know doing something in a way that's non-consensual you might try to suppress it and it might be partially suppressed in mainstream channels in in china in in you know the us and whatever country but it will uh it will ultimately erode support for that regime um at least this is the that's a positive take right the negative take is you have a regime that's so efficiently totalitarian that it can actually reprogram people's brains enough that they don't even question it um you know i i think that's going to be hard in the age of the internet for lots of reasons but i can't say it's impossible so we have to work towards that or against that rather um to towards a better future instead so blaji this has been so incredibly fascinating um i think i think it's obvious too many who are listening that like you know maybe coming to this podcast thought they were in like the the end stages of the internet or the technology is over that this is the very beginning but yeah to kind of pull this full circle and and wrap this up we we talked about covet at first and the world becoming more decentralized and even more variant leading to this distrust in institutions uh and trust being the scarce commodity and then we've got crypto as this trust substrate and then we started talking about how crypto could be used not just for anarchy purposes but to act build actual civilizations even network states as you call them but remind us put a bow on this for us why is this all good for the world like what problem would this sort of thing solve right it would solve the problem of how to address regulatory harmonization i know that seems like it's out of nowhere but i think of that as actually the most important problem in the world okay let's say what huh okay i've never heard this term okay let me explain harmonization is the process by which small countries outsource their regulation to the united states of america okay so this is in the same way that a small company might outsource its law outsource its login to facebook right a small country might outsource its regulation to the usa right and when it does so that means that the american bureaucrats at the fda or the fea or the sec or what have you basically have a global hammer lock on regulation um that's to say they are able to just quash um innovation worldwide because they're the police you know they can literally order raids and fines and seizures they can get banks to pull your account usually it doesn't come to that but you know lots of threats happen beforehand usually when they just point the finger at you in the press everybody just scurries away because they're so scared of getting hit right and um the issue there is that you know when's the last last time you elected a federal regulator in the u.s they typically have career tenure they're they're so-called plum book appointees which are uh the folks who are appointed by a new administration and those are the most senior officials but the rank and file including fairly senior people just one notch below like the commissioner or the director or whatever the rank and file including this relatively senior managers often have career tenure which means they can't be fired and they're not elected so they're not subject to either if you whether you have an electoral or market theory of accountability they're not subject either but they also have a hammer lock on worldwide innovation through this process of harmonization now cracks have started to form in this for example like you know in different ways like brazil has more liberal drone laws in some ways singapore has been doing self-driving car zones germany's experimenting with stem cells and you know allowing people to do stem cells the uk has a fintech regulatory sandbox um and you know russia and china kind of have their own regimes for technology in many ways uh so the hammer lock is sort of breaking you know and of course you've got uber you've got airbnb you've got crypto um the us stranglehold over worldwide regulation is is breaking when i say stranglehold it's like a few unelected unnamed unaccountable unfirable people who have this hammerlock but it ha it hasn't fully broken and in particular for physical innovation it hasn't broken yet and what you really want because here's the thing um the naive person let me look i'm sympathetic in some ways to ron paul or what have you but ron paul was like in the fed right and the reason that's like laughable is you know the fed is at the center of a thousand a million different things it's like uh it's like this extremely important hub node it's like saying end google or aws okay if you just did that without a replacement the whole system crashes um however exit the fed is much more reasonable right exit the fed is btc exit the fed is build something up over time which gains backlinks in a gradual opt-in fashion and gets through a thousand different proof points in a million different tests and it gradually becomes the next financial system as opposed to trying to do this overnight switch over just end it without any replacement okay you have to you can't just end it you have to replace with something better so in the same way i think exit the abc agency exit the fda exit the sec exit you know the faa etc comes when the 96 percent of the world that is not american realizes that harmonization may be holding them back i mean corona has really taken the bloom off the rose right if you thought that the fda was like this competent regulator the fact that it held back the tests that have could have prevented the pandemic in the u.s from becoming a pandemic like i don't know if you remember this in february emergency use authorization was denied to academic labs preventing them from rolling out coronavirus tests so that's why the country was flying blind for weeks not knowing how many people actually had disease so it was able to grow exponentially out of sight okay and uh you know that's that's a very concrete undeniable very large scale consequence example of what you know bureaucratic inertia can do something that had the cost of trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives that was in part on fda certainly in part on cdc and pardon you know the white house in part on you know like the the state of new york and and every other state um but it's definitely something where had we had better biomedical technologies had we had better quantified itself but we had better uh you know and faster genomic testing there's many innovations i can point to that were held back by fda over the last decade for example you know your apple watch would have had way more sensors in it um had fda not nerfed it right 23 in me would have been at you know hundreds of millions of people so you might have been able to get pharmacogenomic analyses of you know individual drugs and vaccines and immunogenomic analyses of you know which uh which particular immune things affected your disease response if uber and airbnb if if you saw the taxi and hotel regulations were holding back hundreds of billions of dollars and that's just taxi and hotel regulations what is the fda what are the fa what are the sec holding back what are these ancient alphabet agencies holding back it's going to be in the trillions of dollars but even more than that it's going to be in the millions of lives the only way we can demonstrate that without crashing the system you can't just end those agencies though because they're at the center of everything like every approval goes for them every company is hooked into them you have to create new opt-in regimes outside where everybody opts into them they take the risk they deal with the bugs because there'll be lots of failures at the beginning and you have much faster innovation and over time enough people gravitate towards that that it proves itself or not in which case it's you know just like a coin or whatever you know so to speak it fails right and then you know the failure is limited to the 100 people who tried it out um rather than you know trying to impose that new regime on everybody right makes sense so this solves for a bunch of things for those people who are what i'd call technological conservatives they have an intact regulatory system they can if they like the regulations they can keep them for those folks who don't your body your choice right you get enough people together and now you can get a jurisdiction where you actually have bodily sovereignty because you know we can do bungee jumping right we can do skydiving euthanasia is legal people many people believe you know like marijuana other kinds of drugs recreational drugs should be legalized when you add all that up it doesn't make sense as to why you should be so restricted in terms of other kinds of medical procedures that could help you and getting new regimes for doing this i think that's the most important thing we could solve for biomedicine for other technologies belaji it's very clear that you have spent a lot of time thinking about this we speak often on the bank list program about how these crypto economic systems are social scaffolding for organization right bitcoin as a money is a tool for people to coordinate around ethereum as a property rights management system is another tool for people to coordinate around and we also we often speak about the logical conclusion of where this goes what happens when we find new institutions to coordinate around and so tip of the hat for being 10 years ahead a decade ahead of everyone else with how these things can actually manifest themselves as organizational tools in the real world so thank you for coming on the bankless podcast and sharing your ideas with us they have been already extremely valuable to me and i look forward to listening back on this episode in the future as some of these ideas begin to manifest themselves in the real world thank you guys action items you can go to bellagi s dot com sign up i think he is going to be sharing more about his new book a network state that is coming out as well as other items of interest if you enjoyed this conversation we will also include in the show notes hyperlinks to all of the references that bellagi made during the show there are quite a number of them so we will include that check those out lastly five star reviews on apple podcast guys we are moving up the charts with those five star reviews just reminder if you love bank lists give us a five star review tell us what you like and we will pop up the charts and get bankless and crypto up into mainstream risks and disclaimers everyone none of this was financial advice eth is risky so is crypto as is defy you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us thanks a lot [Music] you
