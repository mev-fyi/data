welcome to bankness where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys exciting episode for you this is the sequel this is part two of what's next with vitalik buterin we ask what's next for ethereum in today's part two episode we talk more broadly what's next for the world what's next for AI and the intersection of crypto this is the social and philosophical side of ethereum we get into the question of what have we created here what is ethereum holistically is it like a country a network State as Bellagio might say or is it a Dao if it's a Dao how should daos be governed should we use a corporate governance structure or should should we take the learnings from philosophy and political science and apply those things to daos and then we end with the biggest question of all have never heard vitalik comment on artificial intelligence and his thoughts but he gives us those thoughts today is AI coming to destroy Humanity we ask him that question will there be a peaceful coexistence and what is the intersection between crypto and artificial intelligence crypto of course being a decentralized technology AI being one that centralizes are we in for the cage match of the decade of the next Century maybe that's ahead vitalik as well thinks AI could be coming sooner than he previously thought I think this is after a trip to Silicon Valley and talking to some experts so a lot of content to unpack of course this is a second part of a two-part conversation with vitalik if you want last week's part one go back on the RSS feed and you can download that you should see that guys of course we're just going to get right to the conversation with vitalik buterin but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the webview world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you

philosophy and maybe political science here and I I think one question that we're left with ethereum is okay what is this thing that we have built so far uh there is this notion I know you're familiar with it of the network stake the network State rather uh and this is a concept most recently put forward by uh biology he was on the podcast as well recently and we asked biology who's been a long time in in crypto of course from the very Beginnings uh do you think that the the network state is kind of the the main thing that the crypto project is focused on and his answer was yes absolutely that's what we are doing money is just a subset of the network state I'm curious your perspective on this vitalik and I know you have thoughts but let's talk about um ethereum uh first do you think ethereum is an example of a bellagian network state or a network state of you know some some other uh conceptual framework I would say no um and I mean I would like I think ethereum has a very important role to play in network States but I would say yeah ethereum is like a bit of a higher layer thing and uh the reason why I would say that is that at this point in the uh ethereum Community has grown very very big very diverse very pluralist in a lot of ways and one of the things that that means that it sacrifices is definitely an assumption of alignment on a lot of like issues that people really care about especially on non-crypto related topics right like I think uh if you look at you know even Bitcoin 10 10 years ago and or like even ethereum eight years ago and you asked like a question of uh like what do you think the right federal minimum wage is or like what's your view on how Healthcare should be provided or you know what's is your perspective on immigration or um you know who's right in some like geopolitical situation you know like 10 years ago you would have gotten a lot more alignment and I think these days you're gonna get less alignments on those kinds of issues and I think that's uh an inevitable part of the ecosystem growing and it's also a healthy thing right like a Glenn loves to use the phrase like facilitating cooperation across difference and to me facilitating cooperation across differences definitely yeah part of what both you know blockchains and a lot of the equipments on blockchains is going to be about um One Look probably just a very concrete example just to kind of uh dive like very briefly into the weeds before we dive back out of what I'm talking about is the whole ens Brantley situation right like that was something where people within the ethereum ecosystem who are passionate ethereans and who have done ethnames you know they did have a very different perspectives on that situation that they care deeply about and I think it's a testament to if the ethereum ecosystem and even to ens itself that we were able to navigate that and even navigate like pretty close to a 50 50 split I think in the ens Dao's decision of like whether or not Brantley should be fired right uh without uh that really turning into like a big skill some of the Brit that breaks ethereum um all together um but to refresh people with with the Brantley situation Brantley had some uh controversial comments what was it at the time that you know a subset of the ethereum community disagreed vehemently with uh and yeah any other any other light on that for for folks that weren't familiar with the current event as it happened in ethereum World yeah I mean like he basically has kind of traditional uh religious views on uh topics like uh you know homosexuality and uh and like those kinds of topics that are like I mean definitely extremely out of step with uh you know especially people who have a more left-wing uh left-waning ethos um and what was the what was the outcome so the outcome was that there were a lot of calls to uh basically fire Brantley or you know cancel him uh for various meanings of that term and I think he did end up getting pushed out of true names LTD the company but there was a vote to try to push him out of the ens Dao and I think that vote ended up failing um so you know Brantley is part of ethereum wins and there are people in some kind of sub- islands of ethereum who do not really interact with him or wants to interact with him and then there are some people who do right and he did he did um you're right in that he did not get kicked out of the Dow or did he did not lose a lot of his like delegation but he did kind of be removed socially he had much less presence on Twitter uh people listened to him a lot less and so while the formal Dow did not remove his power he did like kind of socially take a few get like knock down a few rungs if you will so there was some sort of like hybrid outcome to this absolutely yeah um and I mean the yeah the crypto space I think has uh you know obviously yeah continues to intersect with uh geopolitics more and more the other big example of that it was um obviously the whole Ukraine uh situation uh this year and uh there I think uh I mean I'm like I personally am not aware of like ethereum Community I actually you know maybe yeah maybe within the Aragon team which is uh Russian um there's uh definitely yeah more people who have like takes that uh vehemently yeah disagree with uh my position and I mean I guess your your position on that issue um but uh and there has been some uh even a Twitter drama on that um but yeah more and more of these uh do crop up and more and more of these will crop up but I guess my view there is that uh you know like I have uh views on each one of these issues and we have views on each one of these issues and I don't think that like our role as participants in the ethereum ecosystem should uh cause us to shy away from expressing our views on uh on some of those topics because I mean though those topics are very important I think some of what you're saying vitalik is that ethereum is is almost like uh two credibly neutral to become obligian Network State like it doesn't have strong enough opinions it's kind of like asking the internet to become a network State well what is the Internet it's a whole bunch of tribes coming together to to interact so but but but maybe so if ethereum itself is not a a network State and can't become one it doesn't have a social fabric that has enough um you know coherence I suppose around a particular set of values other than being decentralized and being credibly neutral itself uh then is ethereum a substrate for spawning other network States on top of I think absolutely um and um I think ethereum like it absolutely is still a uh both a substrate and a home for a lot of different sub communities that do have these uh much more uh detailed and opinionated visions of the kind of world that they want to see and like I do think that ethereum to some extent does sort of structurally have some opinions in the sense of like if Yuri person that really does believe in the world economic Forum vision of a casual Society then like there's just much less for you that ethereum can offer right so I do think that you know there is some extent to which ethereum as a thing has a values baked into it and there are values that are shared by like that are much more shared by the ethereum community than by the Yeah world as a whole right um but the I think the the right level to try to make some of these more opinionated Visions come to life is by yeah things came like sub communities that are close to ethereum and that are even proud of their alignments with ethereum but they do sort of recognize their distinction from ethereum itself and this so that do sort of both give permission to people for for people to still be ethereans but at the same time and not not one not liking uh their vision and and uh also by doing so uh kind of give themselves the freedom to like really have these like stronger moral commitments uh without um you know fear of kind of offending people by speaking for ethereum as a whole right so like I would love to see um multiple ethereum Network States um I would uh I I think uh within the network State concept like there is a lot of room for the uh um like some kind of concept of uh kind of coordinating layers between uh Network States in general right like I I do think that once there are multiple Network sites there are going to have some they are going to have some common interests uh that just have to do with uh the fact that that they're all Network States um I think uh there might even be value in co-locating uh some some of them beside each other for example um so that you know they can interact with each other but without literally being part of the exact same itself and uh you know the sort of the high levels of alignment that come out of something like that um and I think ethereum is and can be part of the alignment layer but there is probably also room for other kinds of alignment layers between the different network States as well uh so you know you know it it'll be interesting I think you know we'll see how that whole vision is going to evolve I mean I think uh just basically saying like saying that Network states are something that should be free to be more opinionated is something that's uh probably even going to just create a better world because we'll get more more interesting uh divisions that will try to use the concepts to be able to do more when we when we talk about the world economic forum and ethereum we're comparing like the value systems of these two like polls right uh but I I think it's fair to say that the world economic forum is very like opinionated and it's very like political and ethereum is designed to be this credibly neutral platform and I think perhaps it's a fair take to say that the reason why we can't really find much room on ethereum for the world economic forum is due to that difference right like we can't really find a way to include the wef's values on our our credibly neutral social settlement layer there's just like not room for them to to appear and so when we talk about other network States or other political systems that do find good ways to inhabit space on ethereum and maybe there's more than one maybe there's a number of them that's that's true there are able to to do that because they are more aligned with the value values found in ethereum or they fit inside of it a little bit better and so ethereum as a system of supporting many many Network states does come to actually like proliferate its values upon the World by supporting many many other network states that fit on top of ethereum that fit well inside of ethereum's structure and so ethereum kind of becomes like The Meta structure that allows for many many Network states to proliferate and I think what you were saying with like uh co-locating Network States maybe both in physical territory but also two two Network states that are just like very similar are also going to be able to cooperate with each other work well together and grow stronger because of that cooperation and so I'm wondering if like where you if you see this kind of like trajectory for things and network States being built on ethereum where if there were if we're going to get a proliferation of many many Network States some of them are going to be able to fit better than others and the ones that fit better than others are able to adapt with each other better than others and then this is kind of the snowball that carries us into this bellagian network State future that I think he is very very hopeful for is that a fair uh take for the future I'd say so yeah I mean I think it's uh I mean it's definitely true that some ideology is fit better into both uh ethereum ethereum and the network State world uh than uh others I mean the world economic forum is an interesting case right because like there's the world economic Forum as an actual thing and then there's the world economic Forum as like the thing that Twitter trolls mythologize it into and I yeah I mean I I get I always get the feeling that like I I haven't been to the The Forum myself but you know I get talks to like people who have participated in it and like and you know there are very diverse people and there's definitely people that like just wants to create infrastructure for schools in developing countries um but so you know it is a forum and ultimately a forum like internet forums are like places where discussion happens but at the same time forums like the uh our Bitcoin Forum yeah you know they do tends to like skewed toward particular ideologies as well so he always you know there's there's always a balance between those two Tendencies and uh I mean I think there's definitely a the sum aspect like the the concept of globalism right like that that's an interesting one like uh I don't know if you saw there was that uh Twitter poll I made where I basically asked people how they uh identify me and one of the questions was am I a globalist and do you like globalism and uh there were people who said they like globalism and I'm a globalist and there's people who say they don't like globalism and I'm not a globalist and this is because there's like actually two different meanings of the term globalism like when is this sort of uh you know Cosmopolitan Vibe of like someone has the same moral value of whether they're from the United States or Canada or Uganda and uh you know I'm I'm gonna be open to treating any of those people as my brother um and then there is globalism as in one world government and uh like I'm obviously a fan of the first and not a fan of the second and I think a lot of people are fans that were the first and not fans of the yes second but they yeah still um like they just disagree on the semantic question of uh which one of those two of the world the word globalist belongs to and you know even within the world of the world economic Forum I think there's uh definitely people who are very ideologically inclined toward the second but then there's uh I think also people who are much more inclined toward the first and don't care about the second and I think as a yeah a kind of global um you know you could call it sort of alternative liberal you know with uh you using the word liberal in the lower case uh sense um movement uh there's an opportunity to try to like really split those two and to like basically show people that like some notion of global Brotherhood you know it doesn't actually require gold political centralization but it's uh yeah this is I I think these are all fascinating things and like obviously um why why even let's so the social science side of of this crypto movement is maybe in some ways more interesting than the the technology side but you know you're talking about the semantics of words words like uh globalism and how that's changed I also think the semantics uh behind words in crypto have changed so um take the word Dao that used to mean something different than what it means today and I would even say uh a year ago it meant something different than it does today uh you wrote a post uh which I uh read yesterday I was quite fascinated with and the title of that post was Dows are not corporations and I think you were responding to a a new kind of um concept or I guess um thing that's been in Vogue recently which is the idea that all dowels that we have on ethereum and other crypto networks should get their together a bit more should get a bit more organized should nail down a structure and should start to resemble more corporate governance I think you push back on that claim and you think that some Dows maybe are fit for corporate governance but others are should be more public should be more inspired by the political scientists in the political science that we have um and maybe that's the lens of ethereum we'll start there but back to what is this thing called ethereum is ethereum a Dao and like what actually are Dao should they be managed corporately or are there new governance systems that we're unlocking here hmm it's a good question I mean I think we haven't really even fully defines the term Dao as some of the examples and that posts uh go into right like there's this sort of vague notion among a lot of people that I doubt still should be this kind of logically centralized Singleton where money goes into one place and there's a global vote on every funding decision and that's clearly just a bad model and that's a model that probably doesn't even give people what they want out of douse and then there's this alternative architecture that's uh kind of inspired by what Ukraine Dao is doing where you have the core that makes these decisions but then you have pods and pods have a much higher level of autonomy and that seems like something that actually like gives people more of what they want out of a decentralization so and like obviously Ukrainian was not the only one like there was also Vita Dao which is uh doing a life extension research there's uh all of the various Dows that are trying to like run uh long-term pieces of infrastructure so uh you know reflexor for a ride maker for a maker Dao claros then optimism retro funding and all of these things so I hope that we're going to learn a lot from these examples I hope that a couple of years from now we're going to have like some much better models of what a good dowel looks like and uh you know once we once we learn from them then you know would the ethereum foundation be able to become a Dao based on that kind of bottle you know we'll see um I guess that that was one of those things that's also been a huge meme from uh close to the beginning um and then you know optimism uh obviously yeah very Dow controlled like what other dials we're going to see within ethereum ecosystem and we'll see him it'll be interesting why why why why don't Dows just all operate with a corporate governance structure I mean there is the argument vitalik that we have baked out corporate governance over the last you know 200 years uh We've made it pretty efficient there's a CEO there's an executive team there's a board of advisors there are these Governors that that keep them in check these are called shareholders and it works pretty well like um all of the the products that we experience in our in our modern world were brought to you by Corporation right uh somebody on the S P 500 went and created this and so these these joint stock ownership companies the corporate structure works pretty well isn't a dow just trying to mirror that or is there something different here it's a good question um I think there's two arguments that I have against that line of thinking right well one of those well I mean actually three arguments right in in the post like one of them is that some things require censorship resistance and uh corporations are not good at censorship resistance another one is that corporations are good at building products but they're less good at providing infrastructure right so like for example social media companies have completely failed at uh satisfying uh people's uh desire for some notion that like the the content decisions that they're making are fair right and that and that's the sort of thing that Dallas might actually be better at than educational forms of corporate governance and then a third one is this the fact that like well actually corporations are designed around the idea that they're second order organizations and they can appeal to uh first order courts uh when uh something goes wrong right like uh the like you get 51 attack a uh company right and uh like potentially 51 of the shareholders could try to vote to like kick out the other 49 but that is explicitly illegal and the uh mechanism that enforces that is itself a uh you know the ultimately the government that enforces shareholder laws right and so if we're going to build a dow them then the Dow has to include all of that functionality that's normally provided by nation states by itself and uh you know corporate governance is not good at doing that but political science like that's exactly the sort of stuff that it studies yeah that's uh it's definitely fascinating to see how that evolves um maybe let's switch back to ethereum for a minute and and kind of the the end game I guess if if you know using as simple words as possible vitalik how would you describe ethereum's end State like at the end of this long road map the theme of this episode I think has been what's next at the end of all of these things that we've talked about so far of what's next what does ethereum look like and what does it deliver for the world um I think well ethereum's uh ethos from the beginning right I think has been to insist on a few particular values but otherwise not have its own picture of like what specific things it brings to the world but uh weave that up to the ecosystem and lots of different groups to create their own Vision um and I think just having a well-functioning global cryptocurrency is a huge amount of value by itself like it's uh especially valuable to what people outside of uh the the first world uh and you know in places like Latin America Africa uh Eastern Europe and uh other you know Central Asia and other places that have a harder time with the existing Financial system um ethereum being the yeah substrate for Dows that index mechanisms that do other things so identity is one of the biggest examples like can we create some kind of more decentralized model of identity and uh really yeah you know start with uh what some of the tools that the ethereum ecosystem has already whether it's uh you know accounts and uh hopefully soon social recovery wallets and ens and like things like popes and like try to really uh optimize that and do what we can to build it into something that's like really good at providing what people want out of an identity system um like what would it be uh being a base lawyer for Dows in general like uh I mean Network states are I mean we just talked about those for 10 or 15 minutes but like what would it actually mean for ethereum to be a base lawyer for things like that um things are like proof of humanity um would would be a would have always been no one of my favorite applications um other kinds of uh censorship resistance applications some other kinds of like credibly useful and decentralized applications like uh you know could we actually do the whole blockchain based social media thing and try to create social media platforms that are like more incredibly neutral unfair in some way so well like I don't think there is one vision for what ethereum could do I think there's many different visions and I think once ethereum manages to solve its scaling problems it's going to be in a much better place to help be the substrate that allows all of those emissions to happen arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects

securely Bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrum or Boba networks I love that part of the answer the question of what's next for ethereum is like like question mark we don't actually know what's on the other side it's like a 2-0 adventure um vitalik before we uh close this out finally uh Danny Ryan came on the podcast earlier this week and uh he told us that you had some thoughts on AI artificial intelligence that is um vitalik do you have any hot takes on AI like are you worried about since we're on the topic of what yes are you worried about AI in society it's like are AI is an existential threat to humanity do you see any intersection with crypto give us any hot takes yeah well the what I really want to know actually out of this is like AIS are not going to have bank accounts but AIS can totally manage private keys and so like what intersection does this did we just create a substrate for AIS to gain control over the human race and it's over now yeah so when I was uh visiting the Bay Area like as a part of my trip to SBC I also visited and uh talked to a bunch of various AI people like people from anthropic and open Ai and uh some of the big you know AI firms and just general AI boosters in the space and I was surprised by the fast timelines that a lot of them have right like going in I think my timelines were more that you know we're going to get like the something like the singularity um by yeah you know sometime around 2075 and when I gave this a number to people they're like oh wow you're crazy how can you possibly think AI is going to be that slow and wow like a lot of them are literally expecting human level AI uh before the end of this decade and um you know the singularity yeah God yeah so I mean these are obviously inside views and my default instinct is to be a skeptical but uh you know like I think it's important to ask the question of uh like well what if they're right and uh you know what if over the next decade or two AI basically ends up eating the world and then the question that we have to think about is like what is the role that crypto has to play in in uh AI dominated world right like uh you know our structures that uh kind of insist on the idea that like humans are the only kind of significant actor in the space like are those going to survive a uh an AI transition like what would uh an AI even look like would could crypto be a part of uh like somehow democratically governing the AIS that come out would uh crypto be yeah something that could help you know coordinate like some alternative uh you know AI uh projects so that the whole AI transition doesn't lead to just massive centralization in uh one or two companies I mean I don't know uh but it's uh I think it's uh importance for anyone to be yeah thinking about the future of crypto as a space to also to be a like also have the question in mind of uh you know how does AI play into this and like what would a merger of uh well not a numbers are about like what would the interplay between crypto and AI look like I don't yet perfectly know the answer to this question but I just think it's a really important question that we need to be very serious from thinking about do you have any thoughts on like um AI ethics and making sure that we embed you know human oriented ethics into AIS very early so that we don't get an advanced general intelligence that kind of runs away from us I mean Nick bolstrom has talked about this in his books Elon Musk and other is wondering if you've looked at that angle of things it's a very good question so actually the people in the Bay Area that have fast timelines they're also more optimistic about AI safety and Nai alignment than they have been before um the way to explain like the reason why is because a lot of the like very doom and gloomy AI alignment Theory like it basically implicitly assumes that AIS would be grown by Base by essentially playing real-time strategy games against each other right like if you think of how something like Alpha zero was grown right it just uh you know it's able to learn to play a game Bike playing against itself billions of times and then it just becomes really good at go and you just like take that model and you translate it to optimizing it manipulating the natural world as a whole and with that kind of a uh growth uh pass like it's easy to see why that AI would be totally um just unaware of uh and not able to be aligned with human values right because uh lee AI grew and uh even developed its patterns of thinking without any interaction with humans the ai's path to becoming intelligent was not would not even be the same path that humans took where um you know there's this uh complicated uh interplay of uh cooperation and competition and there's even a big argument to be made that human intelligence basically evolved as a result of humans having to play political games against each other right and uh AIS would just be a completely different concept and so or or they would be born and raised in a completely different way right and so maybe the whole like would the AI just turn the universe into paper clips to be able to calculate a little faster things here is like a really excellent question to ask but the AIS that we're seeing today there AIS that are grown by basically learning patterns of human behavior and uh it's basically repeatedly attempting to pattern match the situation that they're in to the human behavior that's been uh repeated the greatest number of times in a context that's similar to that pattern and so the AIS that emerge out of that kind of learning process just are going to be AIS that are sort of more naturally human uh by default it also means that we're going to have slower takeoff because uh like there is a natural divide between being able to get to human level intelligence and surpassing it because human level intelligence uh like you can get to human level intelligence if you're just a really good pattern matching engine that learns from all the humans but moving beyond human level intelligence requires you to like actually come up with things yourself so it's still like a it's still a step higher basically right uh so we have more time the AIS are more likely to be human-like uh we're more likely to see multiple AIS instead of one single AI dominating everything uh so all of those things paint a more optimistic picture and also they're the work that's been happening in AI alignment now like it's less theoretical and it's more practical like it's trying to say how do we take the AIS that we're building today and uh how do we try to make them be as aligned as possible and that's a path that seems to be like slowly starting to make more Headway so I'm I mean obviously we still have very big problems um I think uh very big problems from the risk of you know the AIS that take over being unaligned and I would say also a political centralization risk from like bad versions of AI alignments Theory being used to justify an idea that AI risk means that AIS have to be um you know in a lab where only a couple of large corporations run by sort of self-appointed ethical High priests uh should be the only ones that have that have access to the capabilities and uh you know this if people who design who build the jambo's power fully eyes end up having that kind of mindset than like what would that mean for the political structure of the world that's kind of like a a secondary AI risk that I think is uh also worth thinking about especially in the nearer term right because like the eyes that we have today those are there are more like more than a decade away from like pay-per-club paper clipping risk but uh you know if we enter a world where like the US and Chinese governments can make deep fix but no one else can then uh like in some ways that's worse than a world where where everyone can make a deep weeks because it just you know gives it just sort of you know unbalances the balance of power it's award to particular organizations so I know I think uh this like that stuff is also uh stuff that's uh probably worth uh thinking about and it's definitely been more on my Minds than it has been six months ago but I know we'll see that's interesting yeah and I'm wondering if you um you Vibe at all with uh with Peter thiel's take where AI is kind of a centralizing technology whereas is crypto is a technology of decentralization and almost like a defense a bulwark against the centralizing uh functions of AI does anything in that idea resonate with you I mean that's an idea that I've repeated myself multiple times right I think the question is like how do we take that from sort of the world of theory and the world of like abstractly thinking about Ai and crypto as sort of ideologies for the world and into the question of like well what concretely can crypto do to try to mitigate the chance that uh AI leads to centralizing everything which is faster or further along in its roadmap ethereum or generalized AI that's a good question it depends on how far you like how far you want to go I do still expect that we are going to get ethereum like fully finishing its Vision before we'll get to to a human level AI but like even close to human level AI like that's going to start to make our world look very different this is a fantastic uh bear Market content for us on the AI side of things um I think actually we want to explore this a bit further uh taking notes yeah taking notes I'm curious from your perspective is there anyone in the AI field that we should be talking to on Bank list is we're looking at this hmm I will I will think about this and if I find names I will send them to you
