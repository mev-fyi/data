binance could face fraud charges from the Department of Justice but what is the Department of Justice waiting for bankless Nation happy first fry of August David what time is it oh Ryan it's the bankless Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere into this bullish Frontier I'm claiming it's bullish this week it's a very bullish week to me I think David came down from the mountains bullish okay so um what was the elevation of Matterhorn and how did that go uh the elevation of Matterhorn was 14 690 feet you can't necessarily judge a mountain by its elevation um matterhorn's very steep yeah it was good I mean but that a ton of elevation is high though right that elevation is high as far as Mountains go I mean high is high is relative I wouldn't call it super high like Everest is 26 000 feet or something like that um okay yeah yeah I mean I was definitely like feeling the altitude that's for sure did do you see my comment that's going to be the elevation of Matterhorn is going to be the top price during the next Bull cycle so give us that number again 14 000 what 14 690. there it is it has been prophesied yeah I'm looking forward to like as ether pumps through this next bull market it's like oh it passed my Summit AT Baker oh it passed my Summit in Pollocks oh it passed up my Summit every year you need to tweet that every single time it does man that's great well it's great to have you back dank it's really good to be back I'm I'm dankless David and beckless it's bankless it's great to have you back David it's not the first time the word dencliffe has been uttered I'm very excited to be back it's a very good time to be back it's a very good week to be in crypto I I was a very entertaining week um good things happen some bad things happen and more good things and bad things I would say and like I said I'm feeling pretty bullish I don't know about you all right no I'm feeling bullish too although there were some bad things that happened this week starting with the Curve exploit which we got to talk about that led to a Cascade of events across all of defy everyone's talking about the CRV token right now we did an entire episode on that I think we gotta get the recap in today's roll up David what else we covering well else we got the base launch date is announced we're about to drop the base and a meme coin frenzy has already happened on base so it's already had its mean coin frenzy cycle or at least the first of perhaps future Cycles Richard Hart is sued by the SEC for fraud and issuing unregistered Securities man like I never thought I'd see the day but here we are so we're going to talk about all of that and why some people are thinking that the Department of Justice is not far behind and then also binance is in the hot seat and depart speaking of the Department of Justice investigation for fraud are they too big to fail does that matter for binance um what else we got Ryan we got some birthdays don't we we got a birthday to celebrate in the episode I'm not gonna tell you what birthday we're about to celebrate but uh it's a big one it's an important one so stay tuned in the show guys for that David while we're here we gotta shout out our friends and sponsors over at stator a new staking protocol that is also decentralized which is very exciting David what's going on with state or what do they want the Bagless Nation to know brand new is taking as a service protocol on the scene with as low as four ether for your boss so if you want to run a node with stator not just stake with stator but run your node with stator because it's a permissionless protocol you can do this you only have to stake for eth it's one of the lowest capital requirements that I've seen they also are issuing SD token the native token of the protocol to people who stake so if this Peaks you there is a link in the show notes to get started staking with stator staking with stator kind of rolls off the tongue all right let's go see what's cracking oh thanks Kraken for these fantastic charts what's bitcoin price when did you think of that one it's not gonna lie it was a while ago you know I've been waiting for that I've been waiting for you to come down the mountains oh my God I'm glad you did a Bitcoin started the week at 29 400 down point three percent to 29 330 Bitcoin lost a whopping hit 70 so that is flatter than flat I would say that's pancake flat right there yeah that's about eat the price it's price a little bit a little bit actually down you know down um 18 075 down to one and a half percent to 18 uh 140 I didn't say uh eighteen thousand were not there yet that's later 1875 down to 1840. uh 18 000 would be past your Matterhorn Peak there you gotta climb a higher Mountain for that to happen that's exactly right that's a great excuse to go climbing another round man I was uh I'm not gonna lie a little bit worried for you on this one you know you're posting about like snow conditions and you know whether you should do it or not and uh yeah so I think we're good for now um how about the ratio Bitcoin ratio yeah down about one and a half percent so point zero six two it's stayed in the low point zero sixes for a while now can I zoom out here for a second it's been kind of flat summer hasn't it yeah it was it's been flat since the start of the last bull market it's been flat for a very long time it's been like two years now I'm looking back in June and then this is what ether does it is a stable coin and then it goes vertical all right well it's great we found our stable coin finally the centralized sale coin we've been waiting for how about um the crypto market cap David 1.2 trillion over 1.2 trillion total crypto market cap I mean it goes up it goes down but it's been on an upward trend for seven months in a row now yeah ever since um FTX yeah I mean not too bad to be above a trillion as we always say David let's talk about all of that eth what it's doing what is it doing it's getting staked Yep this is crazy to me look at these numbers can you read them out I mean this isn't new news it's just the news is that there's more of it happening 25 million ether staked is the threshold that we have recently passed 22 and a half million is actively staking with 2.5 million over 10 percent is actively queued up waiting to get in wow yeah and then I think there's like a 30 to 40 day wait time now yeah like if you're in the queue you gotta in order to get in the staking Club you got to wait 40 days which is pretty incredible yeah man a lot of interest there but what happens when more eat the steak that means yield goes down you'll go down yeah okay is that okay are we happy with that I don't care what's up goes down yeah I don't know it's part of the um part of the game I mean y'all oh please unstake and I will gladly take take your issue wins he'll take the issue and Steve will take all the Mev um let's talk about a another type of yield and that is uh interest payments um interest payments yeah fastest growing U.S federal expense did you know what is this chart that we're looking on uh they're about to pass one trillion dollars I'm I'm of course talking about how much the US government has to pay in interest on its debt because yup the US government is in a lot of debt look at this chart right now what are we looking at uh we are looking at the chart of government debt um it it looks like a coin Parabola um that's how I would describe this uh so in 1991 we're looking at maybe four trillion dollars of government debt it had already started to increase pretty fast um at that point for the decades prior moving up to like 2005 we're at a doubling of 8 trillion uh in debt moving into 20 12 we're at 16 trillion so another doubling 2019 20 22 trillion of debt to where we are now 32 trillion dollars in debt and that makes according to this tweet about one trillion dollars in uh interest payments that the government has to make this year this is more than the US spends on defense yes and you know the U.S spends a lot on Military that sounds like spiraling debt that sounds like spiraling debt well uh related to this Fitch Fitch is a ratings agency so they they rate various debts of different kinds which downgraded the U.S debt rating basically their credit worthiness um to AA plus from AAA and that apparently one is grading lower than AAA is double A Plus these ratings I think could do it with a redo but whatever crypto can't fix that yet David um their statement was why so why did they downgrade the U.S uh a few reasons three primarily fiscal deterioration over the next three years okay that means they expect the um legislators and Congress and the president to continue spending number two a growing General debt burden oh we just saw it 32 trillion dollars number three erosion of governance um related to its peers so the us having an inability to actually govern itself some of the comments that they gave are pretty funny um the U.S government lacks a medium-term fiscal framework I think that's related to the governance issue like they just you know we can't govern our own spending um the budgeting process is extremely complicated they cited uh U.S politicians don't really know what's going on with their own budget you're too confusing to even be a proper government wait we're hearing this through the grapevine a little bit um but then also they cited the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare we got an old population uh and just like shout out to Kyla and her humor boomers are booming very true um Luke Ramen has a take here the U.S cannot mathematically sustain their debt and deficits without sustained negative real rates that's a problem when you raise rates so don't tell me the downgrade doesn't make sense tell me which suckers at the card table collectively have a big enough balance sheet to hold 32 trillion in debt at negative real rates yeah that's the question I don't know who's buying bonds David do you who's buying bonds you buying any bonds not me I'm buying ether the internet yeah the the bonds that are both giving you real yields and also capital appreciation I remember talking last week we were talking about like the FED because the FED raised interest rates last week a quarter and quarter 25 bips if you will I like I like the cut of your jib dude but the comment I made is like man I haven't thought about macro or interest rates we haven't talked about the FED pivoting in forever now it's like the market a kind of have has like written off how big of a deal these interest rates are anymore because they are also slowing down and getting smaller but also inflation's coming down but also like all of the points that people have originally made is like sure we can jack up interest rates of combat inflation but the FED has a date with Destiny and that Destiny is to print money at some point in time and so I think there's a decent possibility that the markets have written off the the pivot we've forgotten about it but at some point in time the money printer must resume and whether that's one year three years five years ten years I don't know but like I think the market has written that off David you're starting to sound a little bit like to me yeah yeah oh I guess your bullish crypto you're you're bearish um government debt um do you remember I think it was a couple of Roll-Ups ago where I asked this question um about you know all this fed tightening I mean interest rates raised from basically close to zero percent all the way to you know five above five percent right and I remember being told at that time and a lot of the prognosticators were saying that will absolutely devastate everything like that will be a catastrophe widespread job loss like stock market will go down like all of these bad things it would happen and so um I mean I was told the FED tightening would nuke everything and the question is why didn't it guess what I think Ray dalio is a listener to the bankless podcast because he heard that question maybe and wrote his entire post about that this week and thanks right he answered the question and I think he did a good job answering it here's the here's the take from Ray dalio on why there was a big government engineering shift in wealth from one the public sector the central government and Central Bank and number two the holders of government bonds two the private sector which is households and businesses this made the private sector relatively insensitive to the fed's very rapid tightening to a more normal monetary policy and as a result of this coordinated government maneuver the household sector's balance sheets and income statements are in good shape while the governments are in bad shape so that's why unemployment is low feels like the private sector is doing okay the stock market is almost all-time high because you know who took all the bullets for us the government the U.S balance sheet that 32 trillion dollars that we were looking at over there and bondholders that was the take um he simplifies it a little bit more simply central banks took on a lot more debt so their balance sheets deteriorated and the central banks printed a lot more money which caused inflation to rise and bought a lot of the debt to get money into the hands of the private sector which now as a result is in relatively good shape financially so yeah bondholders took a haircut the government's balance sheet took all the bullets uh the private sectors doing okay wealth inequality increased even more um and that begs the question of what's the next phase of all of this and I think the answer according to Ray dalio is more money printing as you're saying but a different type of money printing we already did the QA QE thing we already did you know the buying bonds thing The Next Step according to Ray dalio's you know long-term cycles and and his planning is basically like helicopter money directly to the people to uh decrease wealth inequality all sorts of government programs fiscal and Central Bank programs kind of become the same and we're just printing money and and giving it to the people uh that's kind of The Next Step why do the people get the money well because look at things like the stock market's at an all-time high right um but also wealth inequality has increased in the U.S but don't the people need to like you know grab their pitchforks in order to induce the motivation in order to get the helicopter money ah yes David right they're not and then we're not gonna be like hey we've decided to give a distribution to the people like no I mean look out there are you seeing pitchforks because I see pitchforks they might be a little bit in the distance where I'm not seeing people so much anger like politically I mean look at our political climate I think so much of yeah I see there's a number of Step a gap in that happening and then also helicopter money I don't see those things like having a smooth directional I don't think it'll be smooth but I think that there is increasing anger um you know we I blame social media for some of these things blame the internet for some of these things I think a lot of the anger just in general the question answered the question of why is everyone angry all of the time is due to wealth inequality due to like shrinking pie due to lack of economic opportunities there's again the you know the top ten percent the top one percent are doing fairly well in this type of environment but a lot of people are left behind uh the whole rural versus Urban thing you know that's that's another lens on this uh I mean we're we're dealing not to get into politics but 2024 in the U.S political scene is going to be looking real Rocky for many reasons for lots of reasons but one of them I think is a part of the wealth inequality story yeah yeah and I think one of the big things that people were looking for is a depreciation of house prices housing prices and that has not happened like if you but if you bought at the real estate at the top of the market in 2021 you're doing just fine like you're doing great student debt is another example that you know whole large conversation I mean there's there's many thing areas where this is spilling over into Political but let's move on let's talk about uh tether for a second did you know David that tether now holds more UST bills than Australia pretty crazy alrighty then okay I mean I don't know how many t-bells the Australia holds less than tether yeah tether David has 72 billion dollars worth of tea bills and apparently this is uh larger than the nation-state of Australia so um there's a comment from Collins Belton about this wow if true tether is apparently holding more tea bills than Australia and also the UAE and many other countries at this point regardless of whether you believe on their history I think it's hard to see the US government railroading these guys easily anymore what does that mean you think about that who's the USG and what's railroading uh usg's government he's saying the US government oh yes what's railroading I think what he's saying is basically like um the US government is not going to shut tether down is not going to completely like oh is it them too big to fail yeah I think that's what he's saying basically when something like this gets too big the government doesn't kill it because that would be um thankful for everyone involved instead of killing it they just legitimize it in some way and so Collins is making the point that this seems to be what uh could be happening with tether I mean they got a lot more t-bills than most countries I'm not sure how I feel about that I've that's probably bullish for crypto assets because it reduces the systemic risk of tether but then crypto just made another bank that's too big to fail I'm not sure how to feel about this I don't know I don't know how to I'm going to take I'm going to take the bullish side I'm bullish because of it not right it's bull week so uh when in doubt you choose bullish uh David what do we have coming up next coming up next curve exploit and it's Founders Mega loans sends defy into a hot seat uh base surpasses arbitrum and daily transactions and it's not even live yet and a protocol has celebrated its eighth birthday starting to throw a little bit of bread breadcrumbs your way we'll figure out who it who or what it is but

proof of stake would become a layer 2 zkevm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves curve Finance was hacked this week and it sent shock waves across all of defy and crypto David what happened here yeah so there was a vulnerability in the coding language Viper that curve used for some of its pools so this is actually pretty damn deep in the tech stack and so I I don't think it was anything in the way that curve pools were built but because they use Viper and because Viper forgot forgot to have these like re-entrancy checks uh in their in their code base as a result it allowed for a re-entrancy attack which is a pretty known attack it's actually how the Dow hack got drained back in 2016. and so curve had a re-entrancy attack thanks to I guess thanks to uh the coding language Viper that forgot to have re-entrancy checks in it 70 million dollars was drained from four curve pools the pindle eath pool the um metronome youth pool alchemics eth pool and then the curve slash eth liquidity pool um about 20 million dollars was actually recovered by white hat hackers and Mev Bots interestingly enough which is a interesting little side quest of this story um but the the big story is that because of the curve eth pool 5.1 million dollars of curve tokens 7.2 million curve tokens uh it was drained and then taken into the exploiter's wallet now that that's one thing that's that's bad um because this exporter gets 7.2 million dollars the reason why this goes from a bad story about curve to a bad story about Defy is because the curve founder Michael igorov had taken out about 110 million dollars of stablecoin loans against his 460 million curve tokens which is was almost 300 million dollars at the pre-exploit price then once you put seven million dollars of curve tokens into the hands of an exploiter people start to react to that because that is you know we are just one button press away from dumping 5.1 million dollars of curve tokens into the market so people start to withdraw liquidity people who are providing liquidity to curve across defy either in stable coin pairs with um curve or each pairs with curve they start to join liquidity because they don't want to get dumped on so liquidity starts to dry up around curve and so that makes a liquidity profile around occur very precarious and especially when Michael has 110 million dollars of collateral uh of borrowed stable coins against his curve collateral he is under duress his positions are under address and if that curve exploiter decided to liquidate his curve they would cause a cascading liquidations if um if Michael was not able to bolster up his positions he has since sold about 16 million dollars of curve to pay back some of his loans but he still has 90 something million dollars in loans to pay back across D5 protocols now here's all of the D5 protocols that Michael has put curve tokens into and borrowed stable coins from Ave V2 is the biggest one coming in at 3 300 million curve tokens which is 34 of the circulating supply of CRV Abracadabra has 51 million frax lens had 41 million inverse Finance at 25 million staked out had 3 million Silo had 2 million this guy put curve across defy and then borrowed stable coins uh like like I said 110 million stable coins and so all of these are in precarious positions if curve goes down to the price of I think 34 cents it's currently at 38 cents last I checked but if everyone's at 34 cents he would be liquidated and that would be 38 cents what did it get that low uh it did flash crash that low but not to the point of uh it actually being liquidated in D5 protocols so we're still we're still good here for now um kerf price is currently at 58 cents which is where it was 24 hours ago as well so we're he's looking good for now um but it's still not a good place to be um why what did this man do with the 110 million dollars that he borrowed from all these D5 protocols well just a few months ago he happened to have bought a 40 million dollar mansion and also a second one so he's got two million like multi-million dollar mansions in Melbourne Australia uh and that he bought one of them he bought just a few months ago I don't know about the other one seems like it could be related to the um the staplecoin borrowing but it seems like I don't know for sure we don't know for sure let's say let's so that's you know a question I suppose yeah so there's actually a ton more in the story and we did a 45 minute an hour long episode yesterday that got released uh so we are just kind of giving the highest level of Recaps so if so if you want to catch up on this and go dive down into this there's a there's a fantastic article that bankless uh the bankless newsletter team put together shout out Jack and then also we use that article to inform a podcast that we put out yesterday uh and so that you we have just given you the high level recap The Story Goes very deep um but that that's it right there I mean the tldr is we're gonna be okay this is uh not systemic Beyond right now the CRV token yes and also if you are a D5 protocol Governor then you who has CRV as collateral you need to pay attention but other than that you're fine some cool things going on in the layer 2 world this is after all later two summer I'm just layer 2 summer for about two years now but uh it's definitely Layer Two summer now the base mainnet has just been announced that the launch date for that that date is you ready for it David August 9th okay this is next week the next roll-up you hear base mainnet will be launched there's already been some activity on base mainnet as well um should we talk about that yeah sure so the base has been open for developers to go build stuff and some developers have definitely built stuff and some people have just went on and minted tokens and meme coins and started trading them and so this has been like the news of Base in this last week or so uh this bald token was launched on July 30th so just like four days ago it's literally called bald right it's called bald it's called bald why is it called bald because there's a meme that bald Founders are bullish I'm pretty sure that was DJ and Spartan that started that and so you know this is Brian Armstrong's chain it's not actually but you know associated with coinbase therefore associated with Brian Armstrong who is a bald man who is a bullish bald man and so the ball token was made and so that launched on July 30th when all tokens are minted they all start at a valuation of zero and that went to 50 million dollars in Market capital in just under a day with over a hundred million dollars of trading volume now this is a pre-mainet base one of the reasons why this just you know rocketed to 50 million dollars in market cap is because you can't actually leave base you can only go on face you can't go out of Base there's no off ramp there is now since an off-ramp but while this thing was pumping there was no way to get off of Base uh and so ball token which has created 50 million dollars out of thin air and you know what happened next Ryan uh tell me it was a rug and so as soon as it hit 50 million dollars the bald deployer joint over a thousand ether of liquidity and others removed six thousand eight hundred ether of liquidity and another person released 1800 ether of liquidity so over about about 10 000 ether was joint of liquidity and this thing goes from 50 million dollars down to below 10 million dollars we are the valuation of bald not that it matters or you should care but if you are curious the valuation of bald is about 11 to 12 million dollars uh as of now as of now after falling about 90 and so a short little you know token meme coin Mania in base um but the founders removed about 32 million dollars now we've seen meme coins before I mean that you know I've seen a lot of mean coins of course this this is the first on base and it was certainly the largest last week congrats base you got your first and you're just talking about the liquidity being drained uh there's more to that because the the person the individual Who removed the liquidity seems to be the founder of bald the instantiator of the meme coin uh and this individual the founder was actually the lead rug puller here and withdrew 32 million dollars of eth liquidity uh so it was basically a Founder rug meme coin that happened on the base blockchain do you guys call yourself a Founder if you just founded a meme coin yeah I shouldn't have said founder what is that scammer like enter is it a scam because like but you never I'm assuming they never brought like advertised here's what I'm gonna do with this base token it's gross I don't know what it is what we use for it but like we'll call it gross that's for sure uh but there's some conspiracy theories going on about this on who is the uh the Minter the the scammer in Chief behind bulb um so there's a lot of this conversation going on in crypto Twitter this is one accounts uh hype saying to summarize thousands of eth between FTX and bold the ball deployer was the first voter on all Sushi uh proposals listen to these Clues the bald deployer tweets the same sentence structure as who SBF what first time we've used uh those initials in a while the ball deployer was the biggest dydx farmer the ball deployers dydx post sounds a lot like SPF in terms of sentence structure the on-chain activity lines up with court dates and bail of who SPF we know SPF was doing stuff through VPN recently okay a lot of the sleuthors are doing sleuth stuff okay and there is all the lines going across all the different like Clues this is total crypto Twitter conspiracy theory but there is the possibility at least crypto Twitter is considering the possibility that the rugger in Chief was actually our friend SBF and can you imagine David that one of the biggest frauds in history just like hypothetically imagine okay Charlie conspiracy theory gets out on bail from his parents basement blanches a 30 million dollar rug on one of his biggest competitors chains called bald and he thought no one would notice like if that's the case that's what happened now I personally don't think that's the case after the sleuths on crypto Twitter have kind of batted this around but I will say it does seem like the individual who deployed this has some ties to automated research right which is that is a fact that is a known fact that is a fact and uh is absolutely crazy here um this is another take somebody who's been doing some sleep sleuthing what does this say yeah they say Igor says all right I've been sitting on this news all day but let's look at the bald bass bald Twitter account which is the account that issued the base Oak and deployer address this this is definitely someone from Alameda but I don't think we can safely say that it is f FBS this is definitely someone from Alameda but we cannot safely say that is SPF even though he's a psycho um is what this person says and so yeah so if you sleuth around and you go back to the originating address there is a um It's associated with Alameda research um so you know scammer is going to scam yeah and they say that Sam has no access to um a laptop or a limited access so um yeah it's like it's like I don't know the details of it but he's like he can access like the New York Times and you know government approved websites uh I bet you he cannot uh be issuing contract addresses on ethereum I bet that is not allowed so they say but the conspiracy theory lives on on Twitter um anyways as a result of all this bald has made base surpass arbitrum again before base is launched bald transactions surpass Arboretum transactions in daily transaction volume 35.3 million transactions settled in one day um which interestingly enough Ryan has made base profitable so the layer 2 base uh sequencer has accrued seven hundred thousand profit dollars of profit in just three days which is about 85 million dollars on an annual basis now this is straight Alpha for coin price in my opinion do you think Wall Street analysts understand how to value that thing it's like it's not even it's not even on mainnet and base coinbase whoever whoever is validating base I think 15 of these profits goes to uh the optimism Collective actually um but on an 85 million dollar annual basis pre-main net launch if that's what coinbase would get I doubt wall Street's considering this although coinbase does have an earnings report that that that's coming out shortly so maybe we'll see something in that um I'll take a look at that I don't think wall Street's considering it although and so you're saying this could be a bull case although you could also make this a bear case because the driver of all of this profit was a scammy meme coin and it's possible that U.S Regulators point to coinbase and say ah so this is your your crypto chain that uh you you say is going to revolutionize Finance in the world and the very first big hit on it and a driver of your profit is a scammy meme coin rug pull right so I don't know bearish or bullish on this initial use case here I choose to interpret the bullish scenario it's that kind of weak huh although like yeah it is that kind of way uh but you know bass is a permissionless chain and uh just in case anyone was confused you not need to go through kyc to get on base you can go to the base layer 2 through the ethereum layer 1 without doing any sort of kyc Anthony cesano had a really good take this week about this funniest thing about this launch of base is that it's only meant to be for developers the official public launch is scheduled for early August that's August 9th um but d-gens are so starved for volatility that they aped anyways amazing see you know bullish appetite trading appetite is on the table people want to buy tokens right now for this crap though it's like Casino stuff I hate it hit it hey yeah we're gonna get there token's gonna token David at some point the like high utility good for the world use cases will crowd out and buy the block space use cases come first the better use cases are harder and therefore come second yeah say that again so I believe it the dumb stupid easy use cases come first the harder public goods good for Humanity bullish use cases are harder to do but they come second oh well speaking of that I've got another story for you uh Richard Hart you remember that a dumb stupid meme coin uh token called hex what happened with that this week not just hex yeah so the SEC has sued Richard Hart over hex pulse chain and pulse X alleging that he raised over a billion dollars across three different unregistered Securities since beginning in 2019 he also defrauded investors by using investor funds for personal Goods I think there's plenty of evidence for that on crypto Twitter and it just he just flashes that around the lawsuit says that Hart continually touted these Investments as a pathway to grandiose well for investors claiming that hex for example was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man although Hart claimed these Investments that were for the vague purpose of supporting free speech he did not disclose that he used millions of dollars of pull chain investor funds to buy luxury goods for himself as a result of this suit uh hex pulse train impulse X have all dropped a lot I put a I got a chart um uh tab if you want to open up that one hex went from one penny to half a penny down 50 which is pretty bad pulse chain went from .001 dollars so one tenth of one penty down to six hundredths of one penny this is really annoying because the denomination on these are so low okay that's part of the strategy here and then pulse X goes from I'm sorry about this point zero zero zero zero three down two point zero zero zero zero one eight we should do these are market caps it's also hard to see the market cap on these things just because of the way that these yeah but anyways uh hex is down 50 pulse change is down 40 pulse X is down 40 which is pretty bad I put these two charts together I've layered on the hex chart on top of the Terra Luna chart and also scaled it up to market cap did you know that it's very Peak hex was double the market cap of Terra Luna wait what yeah it was worth 80 billion dollars the Peak at the peak of hex it was a top 10 token bro it was it it was yes what is wrong with this industry dude this is what we've been doing man it's not great 80 billion dollars 2x the evaluation of Luna uh before Luna went to zero ah oh man okay this is another part of the story David uniswap at least on the user interface side delisted the hex tokens the official uniswap user interface uh basically delisted it now does that mean that uniswap the protocol has also delisted hex no it does not does that mean that yeah specifically the front end so uniswap.com does not let you the front-end website that you find in your browser does not let you buy or sell hex anymore uniswot protocol does not know about the uniswap.com front end those are different pieces of Technology there's many different ways to access the unisot protocol so hex is still trading on uniswap no token can be has ever be or will ever be de-listed from uniswap the protocol but the uniswap labs company who operates the uniswap.com front end has not as disabled the ability to buy or sell or interacts with hex in any particular way which I think is just completely fine if I ask you something right so um as as I'm as I was thinking about hex right so there's no question in my mind this was sort of a self-promotional meme coin for this individual Richard Hart his real name is Richard Schuyler by the way Richard Richard Schuyler I said sure it's not as cool as Richard Hart I mean he used this to personally get wealthy I I remember um David you know as part of the kind of The Ledger League all sorts of addresses were like these these sorts of things I actually received a physical mailing from um hex and pulse chain promoting their token right I I don't know that this came from Richard Schuyler or who this came from but like on Twitter everything it was it was very clearly a pump and dump right uh memetic scam coin promoted by an individual right so um I it's incredibly distasteful not what this industry should represent and we could go on about it I think the question in my mind is what is the actual difference between hex and xrp though all right so here's here's the problem I worry with the SEC um I cannot defend this individual this project cannot defend it at all but if you give the SEC an inch they'll take a mile and I expect they will make similar similar arguments that they made in the xrp case um in the hex case and who is willing to defend ex Richard who is willing to defend hex who's willing to defend pulse chain I'm certainly not right but is it a security is the asset itself a security is bald coin a security are all the dot coins a security I don't think they are so I'm not entirely excited that the SEC is coming for a token I'm sort of excited about the outcome that you know hey we get another kind of scammer off the streets right that's great that's great um but what about the precedent what's your reaction to that what do you think about this yeah it I think the point that you are making is that xrp and a hex it can be claimed that they serve very similar purposes which is to enrich the issuing entity the one the major difference between Ripple is that they actually had some intent of doing inter-bank settlement transfers as scammy as one might think Ripple is they actually had some intent of building something and one might say that Richard well he did build a chain he raised a billion dollars and maybe he spent one million dollars actually building the thing that he promised to but the intent is just so different also I don't think ever Ripple directly like touted financial gain about xrp and if you the lawsuit says Hearts continually touted these Investments as a pathway to grandiose Wells for investors claiming that hex was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man that I don't think Ripple ever did that I guess what I'm saying is I don't know that um this passes the Howie test any more than xrp does yeah if if we went through the litigation process I think what you're saying is like yeah you would find similar the reasons why xrp is not a security might be similar to The Reason Why hex is on a security yeah so then the intent of the founders is so subjective right or like the intent of the issuers is so subjective and then then you're saying like Okay while we can't support Richard Hart and I would like to see him punished is this the method that we want to see that happening and I think you're calling into question that and I'm happy just to take this isn't the appropriate way of using Occam's razor but just taking the simple approach of saying like I don't give a I want the man in jail I just worry about the president the sets in general it's like Gary Gensler Stacks it up as a win what an easy target it's kind of the same thing they did with the SPF basically which is like of course SPF was a scammer and no one could defend him and like then they go and they present and they see exhibit a this is what crypto is here's your God here's your hero his name's Sam beg but free and he perpetrated one of the largest scams in history uh that's all crypto is and they win their cases that way and they chip away at us um so that's what I'm worried about the kind of the credible neutrality is but like what's weird is now it sounds like I'm defending Richard Schuyler and x and Paul's chain and I mean Richard sec I am not doing that at all to be clear I just I worry about the precedent this sets but it might not just be the SEC yes uh bringing a case against him what's this piece of the the story okay so this is now speculation um but Martin shkreli uh was engaging with uh Eric wall and Eric Wall is um he's been interestingly a part of like the whole hex ecosystem not as a promoter as like one of the guys trying to take it down and like help help prove the fraud to the hexicons even though they don't want to see it anyways Martin shkreli is replying to Eric wall and Martin shkreli is the guy who went to jail for uh jacking up I think like EpiPen cost remember him and now he's in crypto and so he goes if you look at page 90 of the sentencing guidelines he is already at 40 points which if you look up the sentencing chart in the same PDF is recommended life sentence with all the victims it's a rough situation if he gets cuffed so this is I think some um this is talking about the Department of Justice and so Martin shkreli is saying that he might rack up enough whatever these points are rack up enough points and Martin scaly would be very familiar with this as as somebody who he racked up he said 39 points and if you get to 40 points the sending sentencing chart can put you in jail for Life what are these points is this like like fraud uh I think yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure um I've never I've never racked up any points I've never been charged by misappropriation yes right it's a different set of causes and these caught these things seem more relevant to uh the individual in question at least in my opinion rather than the SEC making a determination as to whether some particular meme coin is a security or not I just don't want them to do that but I do want our justice system to catch scammers right that would be nice so I asked Martin shkreli what do you think the odds are that the Department of Justice picks this up and he goes 99 if they have the goods on misappropriation which I seem they likely do and he goes it's likely that he um cops he like settles to 10 to 15 years in jail if he goes to trial 25 to 30 years is easily on the table so I don't know I'm trusting Martin shkreli is not something that I would do but he has he's got experience in this matter having gone through this uh and so he's saying that it's it's likely that um eventually we will find Department of Justice charges upon um Richard Hart meanwhile David in another Court uh do you remember Kyle Davies the three hours Capital co-founder how could I forget well he uh said he apparently renounced his U.S citizenship and so as a result of doing that I'm no longer an American citizen the U.S courts have no jurisdiction over him is that how that works David can you do that can I just say I'm not a citizen if you break if you break a law and you just you know I was not a citizen I actually listened to it there's an old Planet Money episode about this I used to love Planet Money it's gone it hasn't gotten been so great lately but there did they did an episode on people who just like declared independence from citizenship so they uh wouldn't have to pay taxes really yeah there's been like a handful of court cases about this who people just say I'm not a citizen anymore and they're also living inside of the United States when they do this uh and there's been a whole series of like legal efforts about this it's you can't do it it doesn't work that way it doesn't work like that no not at all um so that I mean he's just trying to abscond from participating in bankruptcy and and all these things that he has to do um he is currently in Dubai I believe uh which is a non-extradition country um but uh yeah basically Kyle Davies is saying that the United States courts can no longer tell him what to do because he declares to no longer be a citizen of the United States which again the United States says you can't do that well certainly racking them up this year David you have a tweet here dokwan jailed in Montenegro awaiting extradition Alex machenski charged by the Department of Justice check SPF house arrest awaiting trial check three hours Capital permanently exiled from the U.S and all extradition countries we'll see check Richard Hart suit by the SEC speculation of dog indictment what why are you putting this checklist together David this goes back to our permission to be bullish weekly roll-up was that last week's permission to be bullish man like we're cleaning up the industry Like Richard Hart sued by the SEC I will say fingers crossed that the Department of Justice is not far behind three hours Capital like they're not in jail but they are quarantined as far away from the United States as possible and all United States Allied countries you know the West they could go to jail that I would I will give like a two-thirds a majority check box but they're still left to be do things to be done there same thing with SBF he's under house arrest he's waiting trial I'm assuming he's going to go to jail if I want to place faith in society Alex osinski charged by the Department of Justice dokwan is in Montenegro waiting extradition to the United States it's who else is there we got him we got them all you know another question here is does this act as a deterrent for the next cycle when a new scammer thinks there's easy prey out there in crypto and I'm gonna launch my token I'm gonna do my fraud I'm gonna do it this way when they look back back and they see well the previous cycle look what happened to the the scammers in Chief last time Justice was served does it act as a deterrent because if so that is also bullish moving forward it means hopefully we have less scammers entering the space because um it works like the real world right if you commit fraud and it's egregious then Justice will be served and uh yeah I think that is bullish as well yeah Richard Hart got away for all of his Shenanigans for way too long you know there's a documentary being made by him about Richard Hart about Richard Hart about hex yeah August 4th and fifth wow that's in two days oh my God the timing of this is great it's a documentary industry has to love this like Hollywood's Gotta Love what happened in crypto and you know the last few years uh so much material there are so many stories that are some of the craziest sitcomy stories ones that crypto Twitter does know about ones that they don't that I wish all of them could come to light but there's too many of them we'll get a few though I think we'll get a few uh David speaking of great content what's coming up next coming up next eth is getting an ETF at least a Futures ETF perhaps binance could face fraud charges from the Department of Justice uh but what is the Department of Justice waiting for we'll talk about that two protocol birthdays this week these answer these birthdays keep on changing something turns eight something else turns two the world coin debate continues some angles that we might have missed that we're going to cover and also 750 million dollars magically appears in Bitcoin buy pressure where'd it come from I don't know but we're going to get to all these stories and more but first a moment to talk about our fantastic sponsors that make this show

against the binance but they're concerned about the cost to Consumers according to people familiar with the matter are reported by semaphore.com federal prosecutors worry that if they indict binance it could cause a run on the exchange similar to the one that befelled the now bankrupt platform FTX causing customers to lose money and potentially spring a panic in the crypto market binance and his co-founder CZ are already facing charges of course from the SEC in addition to the Commodities Futures Trading commission so the Department of Justice wants to charge binance with fraud but they're not going to out of fear that it will cause an FTX Style run on the bank which is interesting do you want to interpret that as bullish this week David okay so either CZ and binance are completely solvent there's probably fraud but there could be completely solvent and they're not getting charged by the doj because the doj doesn't understand how to tell the difference between FTX and binance or binance does have a hole in its balance sheet and the Department of Justice does know something and so this is a real concern I'm going to cautiously go with the former because I kind of in grouping binance and tetherfud is the same things like I've heard 10 000 tethers floods I've heard about 5 000 binance funds but that is the news yeah I might who knows it's always been our take like it's really hard to speculate you just don't know I guess my speculation though is there's no way this is as bad as SPF if there's something no there's no way there's no way uh yeah but there might be something here we don't know yet but cz's response as usual is what four four what does that mean he tweeted this out for uh the morning of before is his his shorthand for ignore fud fake news and attacks so um nothing going on here just four um what would you expect me to say right yeah yeah no matter what for yeah David did you know this though China is actually binance's largest market by far 20 of their trading happens in China and I thought crypto was illegal in China but apparently it's the largest market for binance you know what I don't know is how does China feel about binance how does the Chinese government what is their stance towards binance do they care about it do they not care about it do they think it's good I think it's bad I don't know the answer to that question I don't know the answer either although um didn't binance originate in China yeah and then had to move yes um friendly jurisdiction so it it can't be super friendly and they're not in great terms right but this is crazy do you know even if Finance totally pulled out of the US and Europe as a result of this they'd still be the largest crypto platform in the world yeah in terms of trading volume it's pretty that's how big Asia is it's pretty hard to State how big binance is finance is like wow like 70 to 80 of all crypto trading volume and coinbase is not 15. maybe it is 15-ish yeah we'll uh we'll watch that we'll have to see how that evolves David it's birthday time we've been teasing the entire episode whose birthday was it this week it's ethereum's birthday ethereum turned to eight ethereum turned eight on July 30th is when the first proof of work block got minted by ethereum uh in 2015. um it's been a crazy crazy Journey here's uh left Harris on the day of the uh and I'm pretty sure that's vitalik uh on the day of the first block of ethereum yeah wow eight years you know what's crazy I came in I remember coming into crypto and this is something I tell all newcomers into crypto I came into crypto in 2017 two years two and a half two years after ethereum got started and I felt so late and now we're eight years into ethereum and people are gonna people coming in probably in 2021 probably feel the same crypto has a way of making you feel late eight years man look that's what like second grade and that's that that's still pretty young like just an eight year old or a year yeah I was very young yeah 400 billion dollars in secured value you add up all of the tokens 3.6 billion in annualized profits thanks ultrasound money for that uh and a total of 17.8 million blocks of uncensorable digital property that's not too bad for an eight-year-old not bad yeah it's not better than I've been me at eight years old that's for sure happy birthday ethereum uh and maybe to celebrate Uh something's going on in The Ether Futures ETF race what's this yeah so here's what's uh ether gets for turning eight it gets an ETF Futures and so a handful of companies uh bitwise van Eck pro shares grayscale volatility shares have all submitted an ETF futures for ether or six of them all at once interestingly enough that's actually when you think about it you know eight years time to get here that's not too bad not too bad like all the way from like a just a project in a white paper in somebody's head all the way to like the CME regulated futures for a new type of digital commodity uh that's pretty amazing yeah how much is uh ether market cap right now 150 billion so I think that's like 200 something it's like top top 50 uh assets worldwide yeah 220 billion dollar market cap well there you go that doing great that ETF might happen before the Bitcoin ETF which might be interesting now this is not a spot ETF this is a Futures ETF and Bitcoin already has one of those but this would be the first time so yeah that's kind of cool news and David as usual the Canadians are ahead uh while Americans are fumbling around with the Futures each year for E powerful Canadians will start staking eth in their spot ETF later this month this is DJ Spartan uh Canadians already have a spot ETF so what is America waiting for wow I think that's the question I love how it's staked that's so good yeah so the ETF isn't ether it's staked ether because of course it would be why it makes sense they're gonna nuke our yields bro we're totally gonna Canadians uh David you know that wasn't the only birthday though we also have to celebrate another like baby birthday a two-year-old yeah it's coming up coming up up this week is not yet so we are on the cusp of eip1559 turning two this was August early the first week of August 2021 is when ether started being burned for the very first time uh as of of now as of two years 10 billion dollars of ether has been burned um which is just nuts 9.6 thousand dollars of ether burned every single minute for two years in a row you know David somebody brought this to our attention um so that is eip1559 so that's a different type of burn on kind of transaction fees what would happen if we started burning Mev Oh you mean as in what it's going to happen in the future when we put Mev burn into the protocol I mean that's that's a likely future trajectory what are we looking at here we're looking at a chart of ether burn with and without Mev burn with Mev Byrne we would be what very deflationary this looks like so without Mev burn we have been at net deflationary by negative 0.285 percent okay with Mev burn we would have been negative half a percent so we would be twice as deflationary with me V burn than we currently are oh almost twice almost twice the furnace just keeps getting bigger love it and it's and and Ryan it's still a bear Market the bull Market's ahead of us imagine imagine the burn then uh this is a release from metamask attention stakers you can now stake your Matic with metamask portfolio check it out we talk a lot about metamask portfolio Medifast is actually a bankless sponsor but this is really cool to see if their user interface in the in the portfolio app and you can actually stake your Matic tokens you can take ether as well but adding another verb to the metamask portfolio stake to steak yeah so okay so this I think is hey this is cool because metamath portfolio we're going to talk about um with what I'm bullish on and it has to do with setting up my battle station my bull market battle station um which you should do uh teaser um but metamask is now making it easy to stake for a layer 2 Network do you think it stops IT polygon no it doesn't just stop a polygon all Layer Two networks once they decentralize once they become permissionlessly validated you're going to be able to see that stake button oh am I allowed to do this uh yes uh tomorrow I don't think the announcement is out but today off-chain Labs is announcing shared sequencing permissionless validation of arbitrum so you're going to be able to stake your ARB token and validate the arbitrome train so Arbitrage stake optimism stake CK sync stake any layer 2 that gets to the point of decentral decentralizing the sequencer and allows for permissionless validation there's gonna be a stake button I mean probably so there should there definitely should be and why stake for yield right for the yield bruh yeah peace stake your ether for the layer one stake your Layer Two tokens for the layer two everyone pick your layer twos that you think is going to get the most yield and press the stake button that's probably coming to metamask portfolio eventually so much cool stuff going on uh this is another cool thing going on this is an EIP that almost escaped my attention eip6968. this is readiness it's waiting for you to get that one cut me not getting that joke no don't do that keep it in keep it in enables ecosystem chains what is an ecosystem chain it's a chain with contract secured Revenue CSR that means the contract deployers can earn sequencer fees when their contracts consume gas okay break this down for the Layman what is this EIP proposing yeah so this is uh remember Kanto remember the Kanto chain that had a brief moment of yeah but a chain because of CSR contract secured Revenue so if you built a chain a contract on Kanto you would get fees at any time as a developer you get fees anytime that you use them to use your contract is like a sustainability mechanism so this has like all things anything that's been put into a chain is now an EIP for ethereum this is the way that it goes this is never mind um yeah p6968 is contract secured revenue for Layer Two so this is meant to be for Layer Two specifically uh and so any Layer Two can accept the CIP to create a contract secured Revenue primitive on top of their Layer Two And so it's an incentive to get devs like it pays Debs like if you are a Dev and you make a contract on a layer two and people use your contract you get money so it's a financing mechanism it's so huge I think this is massive I think it's incredibly bullish so what this means is basically like if you create a kind of like a public good you don't have a monetization mechanism like let's say you create a very cool stable coin on a layer two that starts to accrue a lot of value a lot of you know transactions around it you actually get paid sequencer fees in order to do that it's a whole new business model I think on top of player two and that's what's exciting here yeah there's been a lot of debate about contract secured revenues and the economic models behind it and whether they're good or sustainable or not we haven't seen them actually meaningfully get adoption and perhaps there's good reasons for that maybe we haven't seen enough experimentation but now we are seeing this experimentation move to the layer twos speaking of moving to layer twos uh the the layered the temperature check for cello this is the temp check that of the cello layer one uh the governance checks like hey do we want to move to a layer two past 100 to zero uh okay no it's completely zero 56 million to 632. I call that 100 to zero uh officially going to be a layer two yeah we spent a lot of time last week talking about world coin I think there's just a couple of things to to tie off um the first is this tweet thread from Eric Wall it's actually almost like a Twitter post these days uh it's pretty long so we probably can't read all of it David but what's uh what's the tldr here Eric Wall does a fantastic job just unpacking technical subjects for Layman and so it's it's simply too long there's maybe it's almost a thousand words I'd say uh so I can't read it it would take five to ten minutes but there's a link in the show notes so go read this tweet thread I think if you want to understand the strengths and weaknesses of world coin and specifically where those weaknesses are and why this thing might not work this tweet thread is for you uh he just unpacks all the nuances very very well um and and so if you just want if I feel actually like complete on the world coin conversation because of the sweet thread this is just such a weird awkward photo of Sam Altman um this is a mid-journey photo David this is there's no way this is real there's no way this gotta be it's Gotta Be yeah you're right yeah I don't that you a human would not know not to post like that okay so that's so that's the call to action if you want to read the sweet thread I highly recommend it uh also this week that I saw a tweet here that Ryan's got pulled up from Martin koppelman who's also a creator of a different decentralized identity protocol and so he was retweeting this tweet that um did some address analysis from worldcoin addresses so they've detected um like in this tweet um in this image three different clusters of world coin addresses that all appear to converge down to one address and so it looks like 130 individual addresses actually are just three people exactly so it has been um civil attacked and so if you read the Eric well Tweeter Tweeter Twitter Twitter thread X thread um he basically the tldr is like yeah every single World coin account is 100 verifiable a unique pair of eyeballs that doesn't mean that it is in the hands of a unique person and this is what we are seeing here today so this the whole premise of worldcoin and even anyone giving legitimacy to World coin which in included me bass is based on the fact that they can actually produce civil resistance and if they can't do it then this thing is worth zero and so uh where it's not yeah that's the base requirement for decentralized identity is you have to be civil resistant if you're not then the solution just doesn't work so yeah um just because you can prove unique eyeballs does not mean you can prove unique humans and so that this is the weakness that is seems to be appearing with the world coin um with the world coin thing binance received a deposit address of a bunch of world coin tokens from a hundred and different 150 different wallets within 48 hours after launch profiting about ten thousand dollars um so this is you know hey that Ubi World coin distribution somebody is farming that many people are farming that and they're profiting from it which breaks the whole system um you got to fix that if you're gonna do this well um microstrategy David they're continuing to buy Bitcoin um microstrategy is about to pump another what 750 million dollars into Bitcoin dude thin air man they deserve they're minting microstrategy shares out of thin air just to buy Bitcoin and it's working I totally knew this would work um Sailors channeling demand for Bitcoin ETF into demand for micro strategy shares he's printing infinite microstrategy shares and buying finit by night they're buying yeah finite Bitcoin central banks and governments should take note maybe they're the next ones to do this is is kind of the point you know um I was looking at like an old e-trade account I have and there's a boomer there's a crypto section nitrade and you know what they recommend because you can't actually buy you know a spot ETF of course the grayscale products that kind of thing also microstrategy crypto exposure in your e-trade account then buy microstrategy stock and they're not wrong but it's so messed up I'm just gonna chalk that up to Trad five failings last bit of news here from dcg says it's close to reaching an agreement on its Genesis chapter 11 bankruptcy so in a letter to officers dcg says after a month of tireless negotiations led by dcg leadership we are close to reaching an agreement in principle to resolve the claims in the grayscale chapter 11 cases so we expect to bring these places to a close soon so maybe the grayscale excuse me the dcg um uh story is coming to a close here which is just around the mark the time for the bull market to start so that makes sense yeah and getting that story close would be bullish um David I've got some damn straight we got some bullish questions coming at us and number one will op tokens accrue value how does base fit in that's a question from a bankless listener also are else used as safe as ethereum we'll get into that there's also a pretty hot vitalik take this week on the state of crypto right now and it's bullish of course the theme of this episode where did vitalik say that it's bullish I don't know I'm I'm putting words in his mouth but guys right back we will be right back with all of that just after we thank the sponsors that made this episode possible mantle formerly known as bit Dao is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one not only does this reduce mental networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web free space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web onboarded like game seven for web free gaming and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramp so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize

toku.combanklist or click the link in the show notes question from kefu I think I've heard of value accrual to op from the main op chain via fees and Mev but will there be any value accrual from other op chains like base to the op token itself how is a layer 2 token like op going to accrue value David yeah so this is a really really good question I think from the early days of Base uh mainnet launch they said that they committed that they a want to be a part of the op Collective because they used the op stack chain to to create base and being a part of the op Collective means that you need to contribute some of your sequencer fees of your layer 2 towards the op Collective to help Finance the retroactive public goods funding effort basically put the money in the op Collective it's like a tax on Revenue yeah I think the number is 15 10 to 15 I think is right we are like I said earlier in the episode we were doing a episode with Ben Jones and Jesse from base about the law of change which is how this standard is going to be set and if you are an OP stack chain and you want to be a part of the super chain you must abide by the law of chains which assures some level of block space quality and assurances well also and also like what what does it mean to be a part of the op Collective and that's probably where a certain number I think again I think the number is 15 but it's probably up to governance anyways that's quite kind of cool it's like a confederation of Chains It's a union yeah it's a Union exchange yeah you can choose to be a part of it or not but if you do choose to be a part of it you have to pay your taxes yeah exactly right so 15 of that base Revenue that we were talking about earlier goes to the optimism Collective the Zora chain no 15 um world coin if that is a thing that lasts 15 I think again do your own research if the 15 is the correct number I will ask Ben and Jesse what that number is when we do the episode with them um but I think that episode that number is public somewhere that was announced way back when with the with the bay stream anyways we will get those details so that's how this works um so that this is why this is the model for op the op stack chains if you want to be a part of the super chain if you want posability if you want the network effects of optimism you gotta pay the tax to the optimism Collective here's a question from kiwidog4 once we have ZK Roll-Ups with permissionless sequencers and trustless bridges we'll ltus have basically the same security guarantees as L1 this also been a Twitter debate recently that I've heard so the question of will later twos have the same security guarantees as their layer one I think the the operative word is Will layer twos have basically the same security guarantees as layer one and yes basically they will there will always be some nuances there will always be some smart contract risks because layer twos are smart contracts but with permissionless sequencers trustless Bridges all the things that decentralize layer 2 Chains also with some time some Lindy layer twos will give you basically the same security guarantees as layer once and that is why we are doing the layer 2 roadmap that's why ethereum is a roll-up Centric roadmap because we have found way days to make scalable chains have the same security guarantees as the layer ones it's always been part of the vision and so I don't even necessarily think ZK Roll-Ups are the only we'll have a monopoly on this it's just they have a little bit faster path there optimistic Roll-Ups will have these also have the same security guarantees but that is the layer 2 Vision the layer one and the layer twos all those lines blur once we get to permissionless sequencers trustless Provisions et cetera et cetera yeah so um a couple thoughts on that or follow-ups attending what you just said it's important to realize none of the chains are there today all right so you can see this on Layer Two beats what I have in front of us a lot of them are at stage zero it doesn't offer that full decentralization or stage one which is kind of training wheels they need to get to stage two um and that's where everything is permissionless every all the sequencers are completely whitelisted upgrades are handled correctly um well there's the caveats and we're certainly not there yet with layer twos the other thing I'd say is there is this dependency on the trustless bridge from ethereum to a layer two on that working so this is some smart contract code there of course and smart contract code can have bugs so there's that dependency as well but for all intents and purposes it's almost the same security guarantees as the layer two once we get to um this stage two level for across across these roll-ups in Layer Two only have layer 2B only had like four or five layer twos on them oh those are the days scroll down oh my God it keeps on going 29 29 29 29 layer twos we just started David after once this once we once ether hits all-time highs how many layer twos are going to be on layer 2B question for you make a prediction is there all-time highest you mean that um The Summit amount what's all-time highs you're talking about this cycle four thousand three or four thousand nine hundred dollars for ether once ether breaks all-time highs how many um elevations yeah how many layer twos will be on Layer Two B ooh uh I'm gonna guess I'm gonna guess 900. history that's sorry that's my Matterhorn number oh that's my Matterhorn okay maybe all-time high I'll I'll say 300. I was gonna go with I was gonna go with a hundred but that seems a little low I'm gonna go can I can I get a range I'm more bullish than you 100 to 150 layer twos on layer 2B when ether breaks all-time high all right it's odd the BET's on David uh some takes this week this one from Vance Spencer what's he saying Brian Spencer says it's important to internalize Blue Chip D5 or anything was a meme last cycle nobody was generating sustainable cash flows and to be honest the industry was a show yeah kind of was launching a successful protocol in 15 VCS funded Forks would come in with tokens and vampire attack you this cycle is different a real sustainable cash flows with paths to scale large markets all competitors now dead or thoroughly discouraged no VC money to fund second third fourth fifth place consolidation blue chippery I think what Vance is saying is we're off of the coin roller coaster and we are focusing on quality and fees that was one of my big takeaways from ECC is like the maturation and verticalization of so many D5 protocols and this is the the take that Kane Warwick gave me ECC 2022 a year ago we are in now a bull market for fees I mean we turned out we were going through a bear Market actually but you know ethereum people were always just like a couple years ahead of the curve and uh and our takes are just a couple years too early um but you know we're in we're witnessing summer protocols that capture uh fees Revenue yeah yeah they don't flow to the governance token yet though right yeah swap doesn't have its fee switch well it has the fee switch this is not on it's not a lot yeah turn that turn it on he uh he continues and Van says we figured out where aggregation points are and who the long-term encumbrance incumbents in defy will be we've figured out some Protocols are features and likely to be rolled into larger incumbents exactly what I was saying if you squint a little bit you can see the Fang of Defy is assembling the Fang of defy which uh Vance is saying is smell s-m-e-l-l I don't actually know if he's actually articulated which ones they are um s is probably what they start with though as the synthetics m is maker I don't know what e is for people is Lido and the other one the second L is I don't know well for people who aren't familiar with Fang though that that these are the tech companies right like we got Facebook apps Amazon Netflix Google does Netflix still belong to be there I don't know if Netflix belongs to be there anymore what is the other a alphabet or is that um apple is the same question anyway it's Up For Debate it's maybe it's uh well who else would this really be it's Apple it's apple and Amazon uh yeah apple Amazon Netflix Google uh we figured it out live look at that look at us David um this is a tweet from my co-host here a take for the week maybe Can you feel it the bull market has started I feel it David I'm hitting like I'm hitting retweet the uh the comments not all not everyone feels it in the comments oh really yeah not everyone feels it but I feel it and I think Asana feels it um no he says the bull market never left Anthony's Anthony's like uh he doesn't it doesn't count when you say you're bullish every single day can you feel it the crab market keeps crabbing that's a reply I mean it's just a crack we there we have double the market cap over the last seven months all right I am I'm claiming the bull market has started is what I'm saying I think you can feel it yeah what do you bullish on this week David uh so well what I was bullish on last week was that hey I'm just bullish which is also what I'm bullish on this week I'm just bullish but I will tell you I'm doing something about it now uh I'm setting up my battle station my bull market battle station and so what does that mean what is it yeah what does that mean that sounds awesome yeah uh well I'm uh I bought a cheap little computer to do all My Signing which is not my work computer so I'm taking my signing and having a cheap little computer that is my crypto signing uh computer I recommend this for anyone who downloads files or works on their computers like me and so I'm getting a dedicated signing computer um and also just setting up all of the websites and infrastructure that I that I once was a scale which got Rusty in the bear Market because you know appetites for tokens are gone in the bear market so this is like you know Dex screener.com for for people that want to stay ahead of the game on dexes uh and just making sure that you have your situation prepped to make moves and make moves quickly during the bull market because if you want to make money in the bull market you need to be pressing buttons you need to be pressing send transaction you need to be approving transactions you need to be doing things and so I think it's would behoove everyone to get their wallets in order make sure that they're I've had problems with my web browser attachments uh my extensions getting those fixed making sure that you are moments away from making a move if you need to make a move and just setting up your setup so you can know know the state of your things perhaps metamask portfolios for you sponsor um but just like setting up your battle station making sure that you're ready to go collecting data and being able to purview the D5 landscape because I'm saying we are in the first out of a nine inning game and here we are that's cool David I'm you know the D5 the crypto battle station is a great idea bull market battle station is a great idea yeah I will also say and just to take that you know the traditional Ryan boring type approach here is you also don't have to do that oh you can do that this is a game that you choose to enter you do not have to yes the game that you can just choose to play if you're kind of like just um tired right now is dollar cost average in yeah and I'll just counter this with the point of like the game that David's playing I know because I know David he's not playing with his entire stack so he's got a portion kind of set aside right he's playing this game right David yeah that is a different game one could play the staking game which is a different game to play yes and I just want to um so that you don't hear from what David just said all right I got my bull market battle station I'm going all in with all of my assets on whatever kind of pumping whatever I'm feeling good about in this this bull psych I'm gonna make it all back this bull cycle I will just say I think that boredom has stolen more money from crypto investors than Sam Pigman freed yeah all right the worst mistakes I've made in crypto have been because I was bored and I wanted to click buttons when I shouldn't have sometimes you have to click those buttons sometimes times you have to be cautious and can just dollar cost averaging so the way to manage this in your mind is just partition things yes you know have your staking game that you're playing your accumulation game you're kind of like your maybe your eth game and then have another game on the side that you play and separate those interests separate those uh those accounts and separate them in your mind too I think it is worth noting that there are different games to play um the game that I'm talking about what I'm sending out by bull market battle station is the game that like there there was two main two yeah two big victories that I had in in terms of financial gain during the hospital Market one was uh yfi at like two thousand dollars and loot to Ether yeah I did so I did sell Lucas I got the perfect top but I definitely made money I mean I definitely made money on Loot and uh Wi-Fi wasn't so fast but it was still pretty fast and you needed to be ready and understand things and and make your move loot was extremely fast and that's the game that I'm talking about is the phenomenon comes and you buy you press Buy early and you just ride it and it's a kind of a gamble loot was absolutely a gamble like it was a  text on a JPEG but this is that's the game that I'm referencing and it did not work out long term it did not work out long term it worked out for the short term for people who sold um there's others there's other games to play there is the self-staking at home optimization game where you know ethereum yield is not homogeneous you like you if you play the game well can increase your yields just by staking and so you're not like perusing Twitter you're not like making gambles you're not you are just refining your system I can't play that game nearly as well because I leave and go away from home uh and so I can't play that game nearly as well but that is a very valid game to play as well so figure out what game you want to play and then set up your battle station for that right another way to say that and this is kind of classic bankless is as you enter crypto choose your character class yes you start like uh your Diablo account and some RPG You're Gonna Play what are you going to be a necromancer Barbarian like what's going to be right um all right also David is doing this hybrid character class of like settler slash Trader but he has like a separation of those things and like uh you have to choose your character class you can't like jump from character class to character class or you'll get beat up in this market right uh there you go yeah all right so I've got my battle station set up Ryan what are you bullish on what's your battle station look like you know what uh well it's not exactly a battle station David but I will tell you what I'm bullish on this week um I am bullish on Founders that stayed uh the founders the the protocol the D5 Founders in particular that did not orphan their projects early I feel like that happened with a lot of D5 projects all right as um they got orphaned kind of the founders left the parents left before they could grow into functional adults but there are a number of Founders who stayed and I'm very bullish on those those Founders and as a result I'm I'm bullish on those projects too uh synthetics Kane is one he kind of left but now he's he's back a little bit he left with good reason to decentralize the protocol and then he came back also with good reason yes um Ave is another stani uniswap Hayden Adams is still there there's a whole list that this Twitter thread pumped out uh defy dad talks about the founder of curve the founder of frax the founder of instadapt the founders of balancer liquidity Nexus all of these Founders stayed and I just want to give a big shout out to uh the founders who stayed they are settlers not tourists and um yeah I think we have the potential to build the fangs of defy as Vance was saying and it's going to be done not over one cycle but over multiple cycles and so big shout out to all of the founders who've just dug deep and had the grit to actually stay through these Cycles um I think the results will show for themselves yeah 100 and also I will also also say that maker doubt uh not just yeah not just room Christensen but there's a number of very early maker Dao G's who are still working on maker Dell and then also have gone off to found other projects and so not to say that like hey you must stick with your first project and your first baby until the end of time just staying in crypto like Bank list was not my first job uh yeah so uh sticking around generally is always the way to wealth and success I totally agree you know what David we just we missed the vitalik take we did we promised that we teased it okay this isn't a tweet this is just what we were talking to vitalik about um privately where he says I feel like cryptoculture might actually be the best that it's ever been in 2023. people's biggest complaints amazingly seems to be that quote there's too much focus on infrastructure from the point of view of almost any other socio-political system in the world today sounds like not a complaint but a success story it's honestly really heartening to hear vitalik say that crypto culture is in the best place that it's been because crypto culture has not always been so great like we just spent some horse episodes we spent some of this episode talking about the bald token and yeah Richard uh Skyler so you know yeah I it feels good when vitalik says it what do you think about this point that it's actually um kind of I'll use the words wouldn't use these words the focus on infrastructure is actually bullish though yeah yeah well I think he's saying this he's comparing this from socioculturally he's saying like yeah this is compared to like governments and like cities and you know City like organization planners like crypto we're complaining that like everyone's building infrastructure where the rest of the world generally has failing infrastructure at least the United States says yeah and so can we get more infrastructure right and so I think if even if we're like over indexing on infrastructure good because crypto is supposed to last for Generations upon Generations like that's a good thing that we're over indexing on infrastructure so bullish you ready for me in the week David I am ready for the end of the week yeah here it is I I think this is you when you came back down from the um okay so this is pseudo Theo's from this role uh Team so this is the uh meme of the guy coming back into the room with pizza boxes and the quote is me taking a day off of crypto this is how I felt because I left to climb the Matterhorn Sunday morning and then I came back and all of this was happening Viper's zero day bug curve exploit Ave Stables the pegging base one-way bridges into ball tokens this all happened into like not even in 24 hours dude this is 12 hours all of that comes back in the apartment with pizza boxes and it's just absolutely chaos yeah that's what it feels like to be in crypto for sure that's why you can't take a day off can I we hope you don't take a week off the weekly roll-up because our job is to absorb all of this chaos and then relay it and signal to you our Mental Health risen disclaimers gotta end with this of course none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
