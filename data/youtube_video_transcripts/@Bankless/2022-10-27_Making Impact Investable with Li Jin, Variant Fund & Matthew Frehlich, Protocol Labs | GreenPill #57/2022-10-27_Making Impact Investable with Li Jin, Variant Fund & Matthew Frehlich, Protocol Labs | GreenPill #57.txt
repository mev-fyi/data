foreign [Music] how's it going Matt how's it going Lee good good hey there thanks for joining me all right so here we are here to talk about what would have to be true for impact to be investable in web 3. Matt maybe let's start with you sure thing I guess before I kick it off um I also want to kind of give a shout out to a few team members who've helped shape the thinking here um Evan miazono who I think you've already had on the green pill podcast and then hulka Brammer who has been kind of instrumental in shaping our thinking here and uh hopefully he has a chance to kind of voice his unique perspective as well um just to answer your question I would start with more or less our high level thinking um on you know what needs to exist we're like what the world needs to look like for us to have sufficient Capital to kind of like create like an investable or like a you know sustainably sustainably fundable um impact market and I think for us it's like breaking it down into okay I think one of the most important things is like you need a pool of value aligned Capital um at one end of the spectrum that is really kind of like funding in multiple ways that create the right incentive systems um to actually like create the useful work that's being done and this pool of capital needs to have you know in the Subway's aligned incentives to be able to kind of like fund this it needs to be sustainable in the sense that we can continue to reinvest and that we actually have like a you know an ability to fund over a long time a lot of these projects that are going to take many years to kind of like become coherent and then also that kind of implies um some measure of kind of value capture or value kind of like replenishment um so that you can kind of you know refill the pots of resources funding money whatever you want to call it in order to continue like funding these things and create that electronic pathway on the other end you need a supply of projects people organizations that are really allocating the resources that are available towards some of these kind of like important you know regen projects that we call you know examples of Open Source software a lot of the great work that's being done in kind of like you know Carbon offsets um you know things like journalism um I think there's a lot of like there's a need for more teams and like more having the smartest people of our time and like the most capable driven teams working on these projects but for that to exist you almost need capital and resources to be allocated from these pool of capitals or the pool Capital pool resources and find the right teams so that is productively allocating these resources to get the work done and for that I think there's this middle piece that in my mind is one of the most interesting Parts which is how do you get resources from A to B and how do you solve like the reason the distribution infrastructure of being able to properly set up how funding gets from these pools of funding to the projects in a basic in a way that actually allows them to kind of like grow test ideas and sustainably fund the ideas they're working on and I think that's a really interesting part to explore especially with some of the latest work that's happening in kind of like the regen space where I think we're starting to develop a lot more of the tools to create that allocation from these pools to Capital all the way to the people who are doing and more and more often seeing the incentives aligned for them to create large-scale impact projects that align kind of like the work and the resources that we have in our economy towards the most important things in people's lives that are maybe underfunded right now so I'll stop there I'm curious about of your perspective here Lee as well and uh and Kevin yeah same question to you Lee uh what would have to be true to connect more money to more more impact yeah for sure um first of all I would just like to say that I'm probably like the most Noob person on this podcast in so far as you know this is not where I spend like my full-time um day job thinking about but this is an area um of inquiry that definitely tremendously interests me and I think is super critically important um I think in terms of the question of like what would what would need to be true to make impact investable I think it's helpful to start with impact investing outside of crypto and examine that market as a whole in the funding landscape around it um so impact investing is this sector of investing where um investors are seeking to generate a positive social or environmental impact in addition to just Financial returns which is you know the classic type of investing that we have and which most capital capital allocators are seeking to maximize and so that idea of having these like dual or three separate mandates um like Beyond just Financial profit maximization but actually seeking to generate impacts outside of that I think that gets to the Crux of like what needs to be the case for impact to be investable um traditionally like in the investing world most capital is seeking to generate profits like that is the motive that is motivating most capital allocators and so I think in order to make impact investing or to make this style of investing more attractive more investable what needs to happen is that that impact needs to be bundled in with the financial impact or like with the primary kpi against which we are assessing companies or projects I think to uh to Matt's point about like the efficient market hypothesis I think one one critical missing piece um in the world today is that there's market failures all around us markets are not efficient there's many instances where supply and demand are not clearing at an optimal point from a societally optimal perspective and those sources of market failure can include externalities that are not internalized disproportionate Market power on the part of you know certain Market participants information is asymmetry Etc there's lots of different reasons why markets would fail and I think like the idea of impact being this separate thing from a financial motive is is the reason why we don't have more impact investing today it's because impact is a separate kpi versus Financial outcomes which is the the very clearly measurable outcome and so if we can somehow tie together impact into the financial metrics and optimize for that one single kpi um then I think that is the world in which we can optimize for these social impacts um as a part of what we do every day Matt did you want to respond to that I agree and I think it's so I think I'd maybe like try and you know pull apart a little a few threads there about you know maybe like one what does being investable mean and then two what do we Define as impact and like start not to be too abstract I think it's it's helpful to frame that in terms of you know like investable can mean different things to different kind of like bodies and I think it's really like you know where do I see a return um by the resources that I'm putting out and I think you can look at that at a few different layers like it's you know from um potentially more of like an investment Focus perspective um and you know leap feel free to challenge me on this but um there's kind of like you know the VC mindset where there's a certain kind of return profile or kind of expectations when you are making an investment in the thesis behind that and then I would maybe draw the corollary to something more so like Government funding where it's you have a value capture umbrella that is essentially kind of like you know is in its perfect State optimizing for kind of like the value or the kind of like continuance of society and like the the generation of kind of like value for that entire kind of like nation state for example and then you can think of other things like Dows or you know other funding entities that might have different kind of return prop profiles um you know think of like nonprofits stuff like that so really when that you know always investing maybe it's good to open it up to like there are different kind of motivations behind investing and like the pool of capital and the projects need to kind of match in this sense of like they need to have the profile of return and value that is appropriate for the funder that is actually funding them and I think that opens up a lot of interesting you know exploration about what type of entities need to exist to be able to fund the types of projects that we think are underfunded the second thing I would say with impact is like maybe one way to think of that is in the term of like um externalities you know positive and negative and whether or not you know something is kind of like internalized like the value that is created is internalized or the value that is created is actually an externality it's not something that's immediately captured by the you know the entity that creates it but is rather kind of externalized so when you think of something like impact investing I would throw a layer on of we're seeing a lot of projects that are actually generating a lot of like positive externalities but don't necessarily capture that in a way that would be returnable in existing funding models so I think it's like it's a helpful friend of like you know impact can mean a lot of different things to different people but right now it's like well we see a lot of externalities that are created but aren't necessarily captured by the existing kind of you know Capital markets capitalist system um and maybe that's something that we can actually kind of change and improve which we have started to see with things like ESG despite you know arguments against it yeah I think those are really really great points I think specifically honing in on this idea of like what do we even mean by impact um like there's lots of different types of impact I think that is a really Salient Point um and I would point to the fact that you know just that in recent decades um there are now so many companies that are voluntarily offsetting their carbon emissions as being you know a type of impact investing that these corporations are doing like they are now um cognizant of this type of impact that they have on the environment in addition to the financial returns that they're delivering and so that that second like um you know source of like that second mandate that goes above and beyond the financial outcomes that they produce is a really interesting shift um and I think there's a lot of we could you know maybe explore like the reasons why that shifted and think about how that could apply to other types of impact as well but I think that is like a really interesting microcosm of how do we move the world in a direction wherein players have um a desire to care about more than just Financial returns yeah I'd be I'd love to like dive into that one a little bit understand your perspective as somebody who's coming from you know dare I say the VC perspective as well I I also am curious because you know I think when you think of this idea and maybe I'll layer on another um you know pitch over over to you is when we think of a lot of kind of public goods funding there's you know one way of saying that is like there's massive government and entities and ngos who represent the big pool of capital that's um you know they do invest in some elements of public goods and we can you know I would make the assertion that there's potentially a need for increased efficiency or productivity of some of like the resources that are allocated or like currently exist in that big pool one of them being that you know some of these big institutions are not you know well suited to invest in Innovation um you know High upside high risk which is typically something that is really well suited to VCS and I you know I would argue that there's a need for in the public goods and impact space the ability to like massively scale and invest and create the you know the environment the ecosystem for these high risk High you know High reward type public goods and impact projects to be able to be funded and scaled um so I guess I'll toss over to you like for the first point like what do you think um has been changing and like how have you seen that on from your perspective in in the VC lens yeah uh I think like an efficient market person would have a slightly like I think there's two possible explanations as to what's going on in the in the carbon markets with regards to carbon offsets and like that that cultural shift in the way that corporations are behaving with voluntary carbon offsets um and so I'll I'll lay them out both here so one explanation could be the one that I alluded to earlier which is that because climate change has now become such a major issue um that everyone uh cares about um and that includes like the leaders of these companies um as a result of that these corporations have just adopted um this Mandate of offsetting carbon emissions and so they've like just kind of voluntarily created uh this mission of eliminating or offsetting a portion of their carbon offsets fully because of you know the desire to do so because they believe that climate change is an important issue and that they want to play a part in it um and so it could just you know that's kind of like the intrinsic desire argument um and that's nice to believe because you know maybe corporations have like other um missions and motives Beyond just Financial maximization of profits and then I think the second explanation um which is more of like an efficient market explanation could be that because climate change has become such a hot button issue on the part of consumers and now impacts the way that consumers direct their dollars and spend their money um it impacts the brands and companies that they choose to buy from perhaps this is just another way of um like that desire for profit maximization to express itself that ultimately by offsetting carbon companies are actually just serving the financial profit maximization motive and they can do so because offset and carbon maximizes their sales I'm not sure which one is the right explanation maybe there's there's probably a bit of both um in play but I I mean I can pause there and I I would love to hear your guys's thoughts as well yeah you've been quiet over there yeah oh you guys are the experts let me know when you're ready to make a meme about this stuff and I'll chime in but uh no it's gonna say uh I think that was the carbon credits Market someone told me that 99 of carbon credits are consumed by people who have mandated yeah versus one percent is voluntary and and you know I'm I'm wondering what would have to be true for more companies to voluntarily consume uh carbon credits because it feels like that's a little bit more scalable but uh but yeah Matt I'm curious what you think of of all this yeah well I think I think it's a balance and I think it's I really likely's point about you know I guess like the you know if I if I put on my kind of like realist or like the efficient market hat um in some ways like it's if if a company is responding to kind of like consumer desire to like direct their funding based off of like a kind of like more environmentally friendly mandate I think it's like I don't think there's anything wrong with that if the end result is that people are investing more and like doing more to kind of offset um like your carbon impact and I think that's in some ways that's a way of consumers actually you know using their buying preference to you know reflect change that they want to see which I think is like super powerful and can like we can point that to a lot of different things that are happening you know with kind of like you know web3 in the way that now web3 is kind of creating Dows and um you know investment pools to actually invest in the way that they actually want to see and like you know propagate their preference for for different like value systems in in their existing cat you know the existing economy I think like with the regulation piece it's like it comes back to you know what what is the root cause of that is it's that could also just be like people you know pushing through via their vote in um you know local politics or like you know various like Representatives that like we want we demand more kind of emphasis on these types of regulations that'll facilitate that so I think like regulation is a powerful tool if it represents the kind of like the intentions of the people there I don't want to go too much into politics but I guess what I'm coming back to is like I think it's super interesting that people are now you know whether assumed or like explicitly actually kind of thinking more about these these values aligned kind of ways of kind of you know spending their dollars and I guess I'd be curious Lee if you think you know one on one one end is like the kind of like the purchase perspective but on like the investing perspective I could see another world where people who have are in a position where they're actually kind of like are able to reinvest their wealth um on a level of like an LP are we seeing a shift in kind of the preferences of kind of like a value attached to Capital that has traditionally been like more so profit profit focused or is it now kind of coming into more of like an ESG or like a you know it has a values aligned um flavor to it now so many thoughts here uh so first I'll respond to um I'll continue the conversation about carbon markets and carbon offsets first before answering the second part of the question which is around like the shift in who gets to participate in investing which I think is a really fascinating topic with lots of implications so on the on the carbon Market side um yeah to your point Kevin um I I had been looking at the carbon offset market and realized that um basically the size of the voluntary carbon offset Market um which is basically one that is as expected one in which companies are like voluntarily offsetting carbon emissions versus having to be mandated by the government the voluntary Market is about one percent of the size of the overall carbon offset Market which is really fascinating um so obviously most companies are offset in carbon because they are regulatory forced to do so but the other way to look at that is you know why do those regulations exist why are why are companies being mandated to offset carbon emissions well you know in democratic governments we have to assume that like those regulations reflect the will of the people of consumers and so that mechanism also does reflect um a way to be consumer oriented and reflects how consumers want these companies to act and behave and so there's lots of different ways for Consumer preferences to evidence themselves and to make their voices heard regulation is maybe like um you know this other path and then directing where their dollars get spent is like a more direct path but both are quite effective in this instance in Shifting the behavior of these companies so I think that's quite interesting um on the second topic about innovation investing Etc this is a topic that I've been thinking a lot about um you know why is it the case that we have the startups that we have why is it the case that we even have the companies that we have in the world if you look at like the biggest companies in the world why are those the biggest companies why why are these startups being funded it goes back to um well lots of things but I think we can look at like the the kind of birth moment of these startups as a very critical moment in which there's a ton of companies that get started and then today what happens at least in the U.S is that a very special class of firms and individuals who are accredited get to select which companies to deploy dollars into for seed investment and so those are the companies that go on to survive the companies that are then able to continue to raise funding or be profitable are the ones that continue to grow and ultimately you know go public or be successful et cetera and so that question of like who gets to decide like which companies even get to exist is steering innovation in certain directions and today that direction of innovation is being steered by people who are in the position of being Capital allocators they have been entrusted as money managers on behalf of large institutional funds or they are individuals who possess a lot of wealth in the U.S you have to be an accredited or qualified purchaser in order to invest in startups that means your net worth has to be over I think over two million or over 5 million dollars which is a higher bar so obviously this is not a representative set of people who are determining um you know which startups get funded and that in turn has Ripple effects on the types of companies that get backed and that get to exist there's been all these memes and stories made about like you know Silicon Valley VC is back yet another whatever bubble tea delivery startup and it's like people make fun of it because it's like you know this is solving such a niche first class problem um why don't we go solve some other problems that apply to more people and specifically problems that maybe like more mass consumers have I I think it all ties back to who is doing the funding who who gets to steer the innovation and so that brings me to web three I think one of the most exciting elements of web3 is that it democratizes the landscape of investing and makes it such that in theory anyone can participate in this investment process they get to vote with their feet um and with their dollars and get to participate in that funding process maybe through pulling together their funds on chain into investment clubs or Dows or they get to get together with friends decide which nfts to purchase and which projects to fund they get to see our treasuries like the nouns Dow treasury which is massive into certain you know different directions and so the broader theme is when you get to change who does the investing I think that has radical implications on the types of Innovations and the types of impact that then gets funded so I think that's that's a very interesting point and I think I agree on that and I wonder so there's this thread of web 3 creating a new you know participation from like different investors that have like you know different value alignments or you know let's say that are more like regen focused and there's a broader question I have about like so what needs to change to get to the point where we have you know more regen investment allocated um to like productive project projects and it's almost like there's the kind of creation of these you know how do we get pools of capital or pools of resources that can be allocated and then how do we allocate them in a way that best fits kind of like this regen thesis and how do we keep on doing that in a long way so it seems part of it is like well there's almost this like wealth generation effect that's happening in web 3 that is giving people with different kind of backgrounds or value sets the ability to now invest and you know have an increasing share of voice on what gets funded not and then there's the you know there's traditional pools of capital that are right now much much more significant is there a way that we can kind of shift and put more of that values alignment in traditional pools of capital to actually get it to be more aligned with this regen thesis you know for example by introducing new incentive systems introducing like secondary purchasers of things that are more impact focused that have like a larger pool of capital that would be able to kind of Leverage The expertise investment in capital allocation expertise of this traditional kind of like a group of investors but do so in a way that aligns them more with kind of the you know the impact thesis or the regen thesis yeah I I think that is the the question of the moment um like I can say that you know from from speaking to hundreds thousands of capital allocators um in my experience most of them are concerned with profit maximization maybe there's a selection effect with the types of capital allocators that are talking to VCS but most capital in the world are chasing they're chasing returns and so if we want to shift more of those pools of capital towards regen projects then I think there needs to be a way for that to be tied in or there needs to be proof that that is ultimately going to drive Financial returns um so for that kind of impact to be internalized somehow Goldfinch is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's Capital to the world's

or thousands of capital allocators through my work on bitcoin which basically is a capital allocation mechanism leverages quadratic funding um and so I have a sample bias that's in a different direction of people who want to fund public goods in the web 3 ecosystem and one of the things that's cool about quadratic funding is that uh basically you have a matching pool that is allocated to a crowdfunding campaign according to the number of people that support each project as opposed to the amount that goes into it and that means that you know like Matt if you raise ten dollars from 10 contributors and I raised ten dollars from one contributor you get way more of the matching pool so um that's that's cool because it gets people off their bums to give a dollar at a time because they can have a hundred dollars worth of impact per investment and um it pushes Capital allocation away from central power Brokers that do Capital allocation into the edges of a network and I think it's like a network model now networks are much better at sensing and responding to conditions on the ground than than top-down hierarchies and I'm wondering if there's anything there uh with respect to how how we allocate Capital um in a web 3 native way that's more democratized and and that helps us get away from the need to be Tethered to only just profitable Ventures and and more towards impact and if so how scalable that is so that's my my empirical experience from from uh get coin and in reality there'll be a plurality of capital allocations that all go to different audiences but um I think the network intelligence thesis is maybe one of the keys here foreign throw another thing into the pot and stir it as well yeah which is so I think this um theme of how do we shift incentives or how do we fund different types of impact or different types of innovation from what the market would perhaps choose of its own accord um is a really interesting one and I think looking at the market for Orphan drugs is potentially Illuminating um so for for those of you who got for those of you guys who aren't familiar um with this particular topic orphan drugs are essentially um drugs that are um developed to treat medical conditions that are so rare that they would basically not be researched or developed without government assistance and so in the U.S as well as I think in Europe um there's different programs that incentivize the r d behind orphan drugs such that you know people who suffer from these really rare conditions could still access drugs that they need and I think there's some thresholds of what classifies as an orphan drug it's something like a condition that afflicts you know something like less than 200 000 people per year so exceedingly rare and so under normal Market circumstances there's no way in which these drug companies would actually go ahead and proactively develop drugs to treat these orphan diseases and so the government intervenes in this case and basically creates all sorts of incentive programs including marketing incentives Financial incentives tax credits to promote the development of these orphan drugs and so I think this is It's really interesting because here there's not you know a sufficient profit motive to get these corporations to act in a certain way and so there's outside intervention by the government to change the incentives to create a new profit motive where previously there wasn't a pre-existing profit motive around this specific type of impact yeah so I can jump in like this I think is like is hitting on something with like the the incentive design problem that's like super compelling and in this case it's like the guy it's a government or a nation state level entity that's like changing the incentive design because I would argue that it is large enough that it has a value capture umbrella to be able to kind of realize the value of some of this you know the creation of like these new products or projects and they have the ability to kind of like subsidize that in some ways by creating you know profit motive through you know tax structures or like went off grants things like that and I guess it's like and Kevin like well let's get your perspective on this one thing that's interesting to me is like you're seeing this thing in web 3 emerge where and and I'll say like I'll scale it down to this thing to an idea of like Network Goods versus public goods um the idea of network Goods being something that is you know not your traditional VC funded um type project that has you know the ability to like go through the traditional Revenue model um it has like you know it has Revenue you know it generates profits um in and of itself because it captures enough the value that it creates however on a network level it's actually like extremely important and is therefore subsidized by the ecosystem itself so when the ecosystem typically in the form of a token has this value capture umbrella it's actually able to invest and incentivize specific types of projects within itself that a typical VC wouldn't be able to do so and I think it's super interesting because now you're seeing a lot of these ecosystems you know creating pledges towards like public goods or network Goods that grow and like the the resource allocation grows as a percentage of the value of the overall ecosystem so it's creating this new ability for us to you know set almost like ecosystem level regulations or ecosystem level incentives to build kind of publicly within those ecosystems and I wonder how we can expand on that concept because that almost has a corollary too or like you know comparable to like things like the nation states um which is you know setting regulation and other incentivizes important problems yeah I mean uh this is I wrote a post on the the get coin governance forums about a scalable modular pluralistic way of funding public goods and I know that's a mouthful but um basically the idea is that if you look at the atomic unit of a whole on which is you know either a a whole it's it's a it's a group of people that is a part of a group of other people and like you can look at like Boulder Colorado as a whole on the state of Colorado as a whole on um you can look at you the United States and then the world as as a whole on and it's kind of hold ons all the way down um and then if you don't want to index on geography you can index on uh digital ecosystems so uh all of Open Source software is a whole on the ethereum ecosystem is a whole on um all of our our bags in the ethereum system ecosystem depend on consensus clients and execution clients which are their own set of Hollands and then you have the L2 and nft and D5 ones and so um these are modules that if you can allocate funding to the public goods and each of those ecosystems they all stack up and down and you know again I'll show quadratic funding here what's really cool is that you can have a 50k uh nft quadratic funding around a 500K ethereum uh quadratic funding round a a 100K ethereum infrastructure quadratic funding round and each of those might provide uh for one dollar of matching five dollars or one dollar of funding five dollars a matching 100 worth of uh matching fifty dollars worth of matching and so like each quadratic funding round at each hold on level is like a fan but all together they're like a jet engine that creates a huge of like a scalable effect of funding public goods and so it's about Gathering all of those ecosystems together and creating a network effect that can accelerate the public goods that we all rely on but you know the hard part is where do you get that funding and how do you build the collective intelligence mechanism of which public goods within those ecosystems people care about and it's it's building that flywheel I think that is the hard part but um you know I guess if you take nothing away from my little rant here it's that a hollonic perspective I think is really key because there is a plural verse of public goods and from the local level to the global level and uh we have to be able to reason about a lot of them and and maybe I'll I'll throw another wrench in here and I'm really curious about these view on this is like I think I would equate a lot of what you mentioned too like there's you know there's different levels of abstraction let's presume that there's like different you know there's increasingly large Capital available at each of those to kind of like put against problems that they think they're important one thing if like and this is kind of a qualitative assessment is that one of the parts that's kind of limiting some of this refire impact um type resource allocation is the fact that it's like it's a very you know it's very inefficient right now there's a lot of difficulty in allocating large amounts of capital towards important impact projects and you know the example I'll give is like you know this is a very crude example but like if you look at Foundation or NGO spending usually donations there's a lot of overheads to actually allocate towards um you know the impact that was created and that impact doesn't necessarily always like get audited or like shown in terms of an Roi so it's hard to create this like feedback loop of like what was the effectiveness or the you know the efficiency of the capital I deployed towards impact um versus like a capital markets perspective where we've had hundreds of years of capital markets development um the methodology the infrastructure now exists to be able to kind of like efficiently allocate Capital through that so it's kind of the you know the old drug person looking under a street lamp for their keys um they'll always look under the light because like it is the most measurable it's the most like tractable so I think one of the thesis we have is just like by increasing the effectiveness or the efficiency um through like the development of infrastructure and tooling some of the things like quadratic voting quadratic funding and these different funding structures we can actually increase the efficiency of capital allocation towards these important impact and like refi Investments and by lowering the transaction costs at each stage it actually enables us to like open up these new markets for impact investing um so I'm curiously about what your perspective on that and and if you've seen you know the parallels you would draw to like the infrastructure the existing kind of like VC landscape it's definitely a really um interesting question I think again uh going back to the carbon markets I think is perhaps Illuminating because I was speaking with a friend who's a founder of a company that helps other companies basically track and offset their carbon emissions and he was remarking to me we were sort of talking about the idea of impact certificates in Impact markets and his reaction was um oh this sounds extremely messy and difficult to implement because even in the world of carbon which should be so straightforward you know you you plant a tree you know you have offset so much carbon or you know like this amount of CO2 um equals like this this much impact on um climate change and temperature even with such a straightforward equation present in the carbon offset Market there has been such a wide variance in the types of solutions that are available for different corporations or people to purchase with different you know corresponding levels of impact offered there's high quality offsets there's lower quality offsets there's you know tons of lack of transparency in that market as I understand it and so even quantifying such a simple type of impact that should be so easily quantifiable has been tremendously challenging in the carbon markets and so then if we take a step further and think about all the different types of impacts and impact markets that we're trying to create for instance if we are trying to alleviate poverty or create new jobs or reduce childhood poverty I don't I don't know what it is um I can imagine that it is tremendously difficult to prove that that impact was had um to trace like every step of that process to figure out what the net impact of certain projects were etc etc to make that clearly investable as an instance of this I think there are so many examples that we can point to from the history of venture and startup fun funding wherein we thought we were having a positive and that we were we thought we were going to have a positive impact on the world and ultimately these Technologies ended up having all sorts of other types of impacts some negative that no one ever anticipated as an example um let's take the dating app market I love to talk about dating apps by the way um dating apps are an instance in which you know conceptually it's great like let's increase Serendipity in the world and make it such that it's easier for people to meet each other to meet their significant other their soulmate that's great however um the end impact that dating apps have had um is you know you can probably talk to all of your friends and learn about this or maybe experience it yourself but it's changed human psychology and human behavior in all of these really complex ways that people never anticipated and so has it increased happiness has it adversely impacted people's happiness with their Partners has it impacted people's like positively you know impacted people's chances of finding true love what is true love it's very difficult to measure um this type of impact um and so these companies get started they get funded um they end up being successful in Market terms and yet the actual impact that they end up having on society it's very complicated and nuanced and maybe even impossible to just describe a specific value to it it's interesting I guess taking both those examples because I think it's like you're right we're never going to know all of the externalities that are created by a project um it's I wonder if there's an imperfect solution argument here of does an imperfect solution relative to Baseline create positive progress and I would be careful in distinguishing that about like you know if we we need to believe that a system can't believe can be implemented and has no theoretical barriers to doing so that can actually be beneficial and achieve the end State we want so I think like for something like you know the carbon credit Market I think like the idea that we can create a system that takes into account you know environmental impact or value um by like kind of measuring the types of environmental impact we have even if it's like we're not going to capture every variable because it's a very non-linear type thing but we can at least capture some of like the terms we can capture kind of like the linear effects and even you know I don't know the exact statistics because I'm not like a carbon credit market so or expert so I won't get into that but from my understanding the the the amount of resources that have been now deployed into the carbon credit markets has significantly increased due to the presence of the infrastructure that allows people to invest and put resources into it how much of that is you know actual kind of like carbon offset for example versus like derivatives built on top um with like an ESG flavor that I'm not sure and somebody will have to fact check me on but I'd be curious to understand if kind of like the net impact understanding the noise the signal noise of like a lot of that is going to be like misallocated probably it was a lot more misallocated at the beginning um than it is now and like we're still getting better is there a path to progress where we can deal with an imperfect system that is making progress relative to Baseline but needs to be kind of refined you know tooling needs to be built infrastructure needs to be developed methodology needs to be refined to get us to the point we need that that's kind of like the comparison or the you know that what I would put out there for for carbon markets is like yes it's imperfect we believe that it can get for can get better and we're working to make it better does that necessitate like a worthwhile investment that resonates yeah I'm I'm very much of the opinion in that we should not let um you know the perfect be the enemy of the good and so um yeah I think I think moving towards developing infrastructure such that different types of impact can be more transparently invested in and capital can be allocated towards those types of projects I think it's a really worthwhile endeavor I think this is some of the most important work happening out there period in the world so I just also want to say that um I had another point but I forgot it well uh let us know if it comes back to you Lee I think we've been diverging for about 45 minutes at this point and we only have 10 minutes left of recording so we'll have to start converging I think that I'll ask two final questions and I'll start with with the first one here um what excites you about this problem space and What Makes You tepid a little bit reserved and um I think at the start we started with Matt so maybe Lee we'll start with you on this one sure uh I am just really fascinated by this question of how do we steer innovation in the world and how do we innovate on problems and solutions that are going to have the most net positive impact on the on the greatest number of people right now I think we live in one version of the world in which like incentives are structured in a certain way and we have profit maximization as this like kpi this North Star goal that we've all collectively decided to orient around but I don't think that that's the only possible instance of the universe that we live in I think there's many other possible worlds that we could live in where we collectively decide that other types of impact and other types of outcomes are really important to us and we steer innovation in those directions um like I I I definitely don't take it as a matter of course that the things that are getting started the things that are getting funded right now are the most societally optimal things out of like the total possible Universe of all the things that humans could be creating um and so yeah this entire problem space really really fascinates me and and so I'm very interested in you know how do we explore what those other universes look like and what other types of incentive structures we can create to guide innovation in other directions Beyond just utilizing the market as its guide thanks Lee uh Matt what is one thing that makes you excited and one thing that makes you tepid I I think what I'm excited about is I think the structure and all these web3 to start I think the structure web 3 has forced us because of the way that I'd like you know it draws light to allocation and resource um you know distribution problems that we're facing on a very small level that have brought more awareness to these incentive design problems to the you know the fundamental questions about like you know what is you know capitalism and like what are markets and that's led to both a willingness and like a you know an open dialogue more so than you know from my understanding has happened before about these types of fundamental problems um which has turned into like Community engagement it's it's led to a lot of willingness of people to explore these ideas and push on it um and I think that has led to but not just discussions we're having right now but a lot of development and experimentation around you know how do we change some of these things that we thought were fixed but can actually now be you know more malleable so you know what if we did resource allocation using a Dao instead of a government or an NGO or a foundation what would that look like how would we more effectively kind of like use get closer to the bottom and get people to like solve for the solution space that is like more kind of like Optimal globally versus like what is more centrally dictated and I think there's a lot of experiments you know quadratic voting and the growth of Bitcoin has been fantastic you know optimism and the work that they're doing um some of the work with various things around impact certificates and like the data layers that will kind of enable the infrastructure here I think is super exciting um and just it's all been brought around by this you know this latest kind of focus on web3 and is bringing in others like you know values aligned investors and and people from all over all over different fields which is fascinating the part that worries me is I think it's like this is this is not going to be solved in that year and we need to kind of maintain momentum and you know through the ups and downs of the market in web 3 let's say but you know more broadly like we need dedicated efforts and like you know support to do so over a long long term and I worry that you know if we don't set up the right structure for people to think about this in the long term and work through these issues um kind of like we won't make the progress we need as fast as possible um and this like you know this this momentum in the web 3 space um in particular might become like ossified before it can really you know reach its full potential um is something that I worry about and like what is the right way of doing it well pushing experimentation while not overreaching and you know creating some like very negative externalities thank you so much uh let's see uh last question where can people find you and your work online Matthew why don't we start with you sure thing um the best way to I think read more about us and our work is uh by going to fund in the Commons um dot IO it's a it's an event that we throw you know with shelling points and a lot of our good collaborators from Bitcoin and you know the VC world but we explore a lot of these topics and there's a lot of good material that can help people get up to speed um I know Bitcoin also has done a really good like intro to public goods so you can find a lot of our you know latest experimentation to find the commons explained in video form great Lee same question to you most of my writing is at lead.substack.com and Twitter is probably my most frequent Channel um I'm Elgin 18 there and if I can just add one more thing um yeah so um Matt's comment sparked this just now in terms of what I'm tepid about um in this uh in this General space I think going back to uh what I was saying earlier about how changing who can be an investor changes what gets invested in um I think one thing that worries me or concern that I have is that you know the people who are able to participate in these new funding systems are not representative at all of people at large of society at large um and the types of goals that they hold may be you know not representative or actually in conflict with many other people um who are not participating right now and so um you know the the democratization of finance of investing in Innovation like I think that works well only when that system is available and accessible to all versus a select View and so that definitely is one of my concerns about the space and then I think another point is that I think we all collectively need to have a level of like self-awareness and almost like a framework for how we determine what is worthwhile and what types of impact we care about in the world to start with like there needs to be that that philosophical grounding and knowledge about what we care about in this world and what we would like it to see in order to even start thinking about allocating capital in that direction this was the topic of a recent post that I wrote about um it's called a theory of justice for web3 and it's inspired by John rawls's book a theory of Justice in which he talks about you know how should we even think about allocating resources in a society like given that we have scarce goods and scarce resources how do we think about um distribution of the of scarcity like what is societally optimal and so that then leads to an examination of the idea of fairness and Justice and what does fair look like and so I think that's that's actually the starting point to this entire conversation and I feel like people are skipping it and moving too quickly and jumping instead to this haphazard um grasping at different types of impacts in a way that doesn't first is not first rooted in that kind of self-reflective process beautifully seated Matt did you want to respond to that before we break no I think it's a great point I would expand even further by no it's even in the systems and like the foundations that we're building right now from like a thought perspective and just like it you know a framework perspective um you know things like the protocols we're designing and the way they were designing staking systems um the more people we can have from more diverse backgrounds the more we can we need to like really solve for that early on to understand like where our blind spots are because like anything that we do introduces bias and the longer we wait to like solve for having the full perspective for everybody that should be involved um the more things get set in stone so you know not not just like the funding but also like the design the conversations like um everything we shouldn't take anything to be like a kind of fundamental truth and everything is like influenced by our bias I will say I feel an intense uh being feeling stretched between the the sort of ipcc's report on climate change saying we have eight years uh to to to get to carbon neutrality or eight years to start really solving the problem in that urgency versus setting up a long-term architecture and there's that I really feel stuck between those things I I'm sure listeners do also but um this is a sign that we're on to something really important I think that we keep diverging and we keep exploring the the space but unfortunately our time has has come to an end so uh Matthew Lee thank you for joining us and we'll put links to your work in the show notes and uh and thank you again for joining thank you so much for having us [Music]
