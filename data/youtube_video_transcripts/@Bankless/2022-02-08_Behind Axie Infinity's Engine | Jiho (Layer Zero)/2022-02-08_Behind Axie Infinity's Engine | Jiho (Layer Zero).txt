some people might get the community rights and some people might get the economy right and some people might get the scaling right some people might get the art and the gameplay right but i think putting it all together is great where the magic happens welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today we are speaking with jiho from axi infinity and axiom infinity might be one of the first organizations that knowingly is calling them a nation and really really fits that model and i really think the axi nation is the right way to understand what axi is trying to do and so that makes jiho one of the first core community leaders of the axi nation a very um has a very interesting vantage point as to how to view communities communities growing around web 3. i think as we all know like all things in web 3 all have communities around them everything that tends to work tends to also have its own community and so we discuss how the axi community has grown the the ways that it has shaped over the years during in its various sizes as axi has progressed to its development we talk a ton about what the metaverse is what it means why people like it and how it will be shaped in the future and also just some other fun facts and tidbits about jiho which i don't think you would get anywhere else so let's go and start talking to jiho right after we get to some of these

david uh yeah doing well thanks for having me yeah yeah of course where are you in the world right now uh i am in uh puerto rico oh yeah where are you do you live there i don't think you don't live there do you i'm staying here for a bit i i got stuck here after mediversa and you know just have a lot of work so i didn't want to want to just stop traveling so well puerto rico rico's not a bad place to get stuck at so that must be a vibe there's a lot of crypto people uh down there anybody from maxie uh yeah there are some actually community members down here for sure uh pl we play basketball go to the gym together uh so hey well i'm sure you have a axi friends all over the world so no matter where you get stuck at you can probably hang find some members of the axi nation wherever you live yeah that's that's one of the best parts of the community um so where did you uh grow up let's go back to your let's go back to just like your formative years where did you grow up in the world so i grew up i was born in new york and i grew up there for the most part um yeah grew up gaming yeah so i yeah i grew up as a gamer as a collector my dad is my dad's an interesting guy he's like he's a polymath man so he has like so many different interests right he owned a gallery as a painter he collects insects and fossils he's really into like moths and butterflies he's actually an attorney as as kind of as for his profession so he's kind of like doing a lot of different stuff my mom is korean she's like a typical tiger mom she was super strict so i was always right like trying to play games she was always trying to get me not to play games uh my cousins are korean i'm half korean um so jiho is actually my name uh my korean name and my cousins would bring over like starcraft diablo world of warcraft it's kind of how i got into gaming a bit uh whatever game i played my my entire school ended up playing um for some reason i was like the curator uh and yes i you know got got really into gaming as a kid i was an only child so i think like i was you know just keeping myself occupied and trying you know kind of right in the early days right like starcraft that was the first thing i ever did on the internet and you could actually kind of socialize from your from your bedroom as as a kid um yeah my mom sent me to boarding school because i was way too into wow vanilla wow um and that's basically why i left new york went to new hampshire yeah these are all blizzard games is that a coincidence or what's up with that those are i think a lot of the games that really defined uh defined me i think happened to be blizzard games um i was also really into uh donkey kong country like during the super nintendo game days um zelda like ocarina of time i think i i played through maybe 20 20 plus times obviously uh pokemon i still have my pokemon collection from when i was a kid i was an early adopter i didn't know at the time right but i have a bunch of like first editions and shadow lists that i was just collecting as a kid because i wanted them like i would sell sharks teeth um and my drawings and stuff like that to scrounge and scrounge up enough um and yeah apparently my my collection's worth quite quite a bit now which is crazy because like that was all yeah you know just collected by me as a kid with without too much capital and you was it to uh play the actual pokemon guard game or was it more about the collection it was more about the flex i think and just i have this collector's instinct right where i just there's some some things that i just need right and i think it's similar to my dad i think i'm i think it's genetic i think i inherited it from my father right where my my dad has cases on cases of butterflies i think he has like around 40 000 our house uh so i think i just have that collector's gene so you know i got really into you know i played the poke i played pokemon on game boy uh but in terms of the card game and i was an only child so i didn't have anyone to play against me so i would just collect them um you know i was always yeah like that wasn't that was right those were in the days of kind of right it's like if you wanted to play with other people they had to like kind of come over to your house or whatever so people would come over to hang out but most of the time i was just by myself like i was one of the kids that bought two game boys so i could trade with myself um my blue my red and blue version so i could get the 150 right you couldn't get one that was one of the genius aspects of pokemon was you needed right like you couldn't get all 150 um in classic right in the classic versions unless you actually like somehow traded with someone who had the other version of the game i guess like the yeah the loophole was that you could just be both people did you ever complete your pokedex i think yeah i think i had 150. yeah which was your uh starter where's your starter pokemon uh i i picked charmander i meant i'm i like reptiles like i i grew up having uh lizards and uh like salamanders are not ripped up like amphibians but yeah like i always had frogs salamanders reptiles um snakes turtles so you so you pick the yeah right got to pick the the fire fire reptile um you said that you uh were like the trend setter for your uh for your school's games i want to unpack that a little bit how'd that happen like why was it a coincidence or was it just you had the energy about the games that you liked and that ended up being enough what was there yeah it's it's it's strange where right like yeah i would you know i want i just wanted people to play with me or like with diablo like i would get people and right i was like you know i i wanted people to trade with on amicable terms or it's gonna you know kind of farm for me i would gear them up and you know say hey get me you know send me some stuff later you know once you're up and running um so yeah i don't know i don't know i don't know i think i i was just really into it and my i think also was like my my uh my cousins were really they're korean they were like really kind of ahead of the curve they would get like the new blizzard game as soon as it came out so for some reason i was always the one uh who would get this stuff first um and also was like also i think my uh my birthday was right around like where like you know games would launch so i would always you know get whatever for my birthday and try to spread it to the rest of school so i had people to play with a winter birthday yeah february early february yeah okay uh that that's pretty good that's pretty cool because like uh actually we'll we'll go and go into that later uh wha was it um perhaps i mean you're kind of a charismatic dude so when you come to come to school with your games that you want to talk about um were were you like a a school socialite like did you like to you just um like to just share stuff with other people and just happen to be games or like what was your role in with your friends in school it varied over time but uh i think like if you ask me it's hard for me to you know comment on that but if you ask my mom my mom will say that you know everyone for some reason all the boys or whatever like wanted uh you know to be my friend for some reason they would try to like impress me by playing games i don't know i don't know what it was about but do you see any of that still being true in your your time at axi now i don't know like i mean i think great like you have an entire continent wanting to play with you at the moment yeah thinking back right it's like it should have been obvious that i think i could be a good you know a person to evangelize a game um to spread a game um it's you know it's come more into focus as things have progressed so yeah it's it's it's been it's been a crazy journey and you know i never i never would have dreamed that i would be you know involved in gaming as a profession um i didn't know what i want to do with my life for most of my life right so it's only within the last four years or so that i've really uh yeah i felt like i've i've found my calling did you ever have like a entrepreneurial spirit as a kid or is that also relatively new i think i was uh so i was you know selling sharks teeth i sold candy in my lunch room shark's teeth like like we're talking about actual sharks fossil sharks teeth like fossil sharks teeth like 10 million because my daddy we would collect fossils on the weekend and he would you know he would let me take you know the ones that weren't perfect and and sell them to the kids um so yeah i was all you know i was kind of artistic as a kid too i was you know selling my drawings i would sell my drawings and paintings to anyone that came into my house like my mom's friends my tutor people who came over to my dad's uh who came over to look at my dad's collection so yeah i think like i i have i think i'm a people pleaser uh so i i think like right like also giving people what they want and having like some kind of beneficial two-way transaction i think makes me makes me happy so it wasn't out of like a like a drive to save up for something that you wanted to purchase it was more about like the transaction itself i think where like there's a social element of it but then obviously yeah like you know i always was saving up for something right my shadowless charizard i saved up you know a while to be able to buy it i think i paid 15 bucks or maybe 15 to 25 bucks i think they're worth like 15k now uh oh my gosh so so i saved up for a while for that um i would create my mom would and i would we would i would actually create my own reward structures as well where it was like oh if i do something good i'll get a marble um and then if i get 10 marbles my mom would give me like 10 or buy me a toy or something like that so i was just interested in that kind of stuff um but yeah i don't know i would say i was relatively entrepreneurial kid i think that there are more entrepreneurs entrepreneurial kids out there um but yeah you know i had a little bit of that in me that sounds a little bit of a incentive gamification that you impose upon yourself by your mom is that is that sound about right yeah i would create the incentive structures that my mom would use to keep me behaved yeah and then of course naturally this just lends itself into game like game economics design later right like is that is that a direct one-to-one comparison or am i reaching for something here yeah i think i think there's some i think there's some parallel there yeah yeah why um why do you feel like you've enjoyed that so much like most kids don't want to impose rules upon themselves i think it was like i wanted i wanted something and i wanted uh yeah i wanted like a clear path towards getting it um so yeah it was kind of like negotiation strategy i think with with my mom as well where um yeah um let's see do you think like do do you like this sense did you like the sense of achievement was that about it like uh you know victory unlocked kind of yeah yeah i think i think i do like transparent reward systems i think um i'm you know tend to think about that a lot with it actually you know not just within the game you know the game economy i have like a you know i would say you know relatively small role with but also you know the creators and the in the community and how every everyone kind of aligns incentives uh with each other for sure i find that i find it fascinating right i think that's actually right like my understanding of web 3 because i come you know i'm not i don't come from a technical background um right i come from a gaming uh background the collector's background right so uh for me right like the well the huge unlock that i see with web3 is you know figuring out how to align incentives um and create these kind of sustainable economic engines to these open source technologies and so that's that's like a lot of you know how i'm looking at the space right now so from for the out the onlooker the people that aren't like diving into axiory infinity every single day and kind of just like knows that it exists and that it's extremely vibrant your role in actually kind of just looks like this great community manager like this great community leader who's just like part of just like injecting vibes and energy into into the community would you a a do you agree with that uh take and then b if you for somebody that would like to actually peer deeper into the scenes what do you actually do sure so i i think i think that's fair uh so i actually come from the community which some people uh might not realize or remember in many cases so right like i discovered actually just like a lot of people just like much earlier right where i was one of the first i don't know a couple hundred people in the discord uh it was very small there were around you know maybe five to ten people there to kind of welcome me and walk me through and you know i was i was super excited about it because right like i i was i wasn't an early cryptokitty community member right and there was always there was this notion like hey like we need to be able to do more with these things so it's not just about breeding and selling them right like there has to be some emotional value there has to be something fun that we can do so it's not just us dumping cats on each other right so we kind of you know there was a little bit of that already uh that the space kind of understood and you know so i i you know i fell in love with the art and the fact that there was a you know this road map towards a playable game um that seemed achievable um you know that really that really resonated with me so i just started you know i just came in and started doing all the things that i i thought i could uh help with right so like you know helped write um the original white paper um i started doing a lot of the announcements and you know yeah community building right where in the early days of doing unscalable things like getting to know everyone in the community sharing the vision repeatedly so people understand like you know what we're building and why um so yeah i think i think like a lot of that is still applicable today where um you know i do a lot of stuff around the community and the economy i think it's very interlinked right because right ultimately what's what creates this sustainable economic engine is uh right that people are spending right for fun or for status within the ecosystem right that's um that's what's kind of subsidizing right the economy and this ability for people to actually earn was it as simple as just understanding axi to be cryptokitties but with a game or was there extra you know magic sauce that that compelled you in addition to that yeah i think that was part of it right like we were just iterating right like we you know i think a lot of it was some people saw axey as a fork of cryptokitties right like the marketplace contract is very similar the breeding contract is very similar uh and right a lot of the early community members right like you know kind of uh gave up on cryptokitties and came over and came over to axi so right there was a little bit of that yeah a lot a lot of people who got it immediately were like hey like we there was three weeks where we could breed cryptokitties and actually make money right like how could this you know potentially last forever um so i think a lot of the people who are thinking through that framework were actually able to understand actually yeah and then uh was it what was it in equal parts of like the fun of the game and or with the token tokenomics the breeding or was it were you actually thinking like oh this is actually a really fun game i i'm excited to play this or was it more about just like oh there's this fun like weird breeding economic system behind it like was it was it both or was it was one really compelling i think it was a combination right like yeah the idea that right like you would actually need to spend time in game to earn the right to breed i think that was like right like one thing that just locked into place and and seemed to make sense right where you could basically right like the problem with cryptokitties was there's this hyperinflation because people could just like you know keep reading uh at will whereas right the idea that okay if you actually sunk human time effort and skill and to earn the right to be able to breed right this would you know act as a uh as a way to basically right back each axi with with real human time and effort so i think that was a lot of it right and then yeah people were part of it was just the community like people were willing to help people understood that this was a community driven thing they were really helpful they were making awesome memes um they were making awesome you know they were has we had some initial early video content creators and stuff like that so um there's awesome art um so yeah i think it's you know it was a combination right of the community and and right the art and what promised to you know what was looking like it would be a pretty fun game so i i i want to unpack there's so many things i want to unpack i want to unpack first off the the community aspect of it because isn't also even though it's axi is like is is more than a community because this hey the size of it is so incredibly large it's like you guys correctly in my mind call it the axi nation especially because you have your own economy but isn't the community at the very very basic level also in competition with each other right like isn't it isn't it isn't actually kind of like a race for resources and so like yes it's very like collaborative and the discord is very like community oriented but also isn't it competitive too there there is a lot of right at its base level too right like the mid uh right there's actually is a right like in terms of the current product is a card battle game where you battle these pets together in pvp battles there's a leaderboard right um but i think there's there's also right this this collaborative spirit which i think is interesting right like how do you turn like what's you know right now a pvp experience in terms of the gameplay and why is it so collaborative right because there is right to space uh ownership right where everyone owns axes right a lot of people own access tokens right um so so yeah it's it's it's uh right there's there's a little bit of competition and it's a friendly competition as well which kind of creates some camaraderie and bonding um but also right there's this pve component the pve component is like everyone in the axi community against the world who doesn't take us seriously who thinks that nft games are never gonna work right we've always had that kind of underdog chip on our shoulder and i think it's really important that we maintain that even as we get larger did you just use pve where the e is not just the game that you're making but the whole entire universe is that what you just did i think right i think degen once talked about that right into like life in terms of like pve p and pve so um yeah it's an interesting like tool to uh rally a community behind because like there's no better like enemies that exist to rally a community than like the faceless ones right and especially the gargantuan faceless ones like oh yeah like we're gonna take on everything uh can you just unpack that a little bit more about the significance is that is that like an idea that you have or is that more like a codified part of the axi culture about how like oh yeah we're going to take on the world or is that is that just kind of the vibe that you get after you read between the lines i think it's maybe half right like we saw in the early days right that the community was kind of rallying against always right they had some kind of something something or some someone to rally against right in the early days we kind of had like this beef with the cryptokitty community where they thought oh like this is just a cryptokitty clone right they're never gonna do anything um right so yeah there's always been i think great like and from the early days we saw that that was like you know a good strategy and i think it's also true that right like people because axi is so cute i think uh they don't take it seriously um and it's like i think it's just been us proving right the doubters and the haters wrong like month after month uh over the over this journey and i think right that's like part yeah it's part you know it's part of the fun i think um and so yeah i think it's part of our culture and i think it's also something that you know the community leaders not just myself right community leaders understand is is is an effective strategy uh for getting everyone on the same page i want to keep going down this route but there's a question i have that i think if i don't ask it now i might lose it and that is um a lot of the games that i play like diablo both two and three included uh borderlands comes to mind a lot of these games and just uh end up all in the same state which is like grinding uh and me personally that's kind of when i like tap out of the game it's like okay i'll go through level zero through like like 99 but once i'm at 99 like i'm out like i'm done with the game like i don't want to grind the same things over and over and over again uh have you have you guys thought about this actually and how have you like keep kept people engaged post grind like once you get to the grinding grinding stage how do you get keep people entertained yeah i mean i i think obviously like the fact that you have ownership of the things that you're grinding for i think uh you know helps right where you can potentially right convert it into into something that's helping you in real life i think that all games with staying power have right like basically had an interesting social elements uh to the ecosystem or right with wow wow guilds right there are people who play wow not because they find wow enjoying but because all their friends that they've met online are playing wow so it's like if they quit wow they're going to lose all their friends right so the the social the social systems are really important and yeah i think like right with axi right it's like people they just want they love being part of the community they love learning about web3 there's always something fun to look forward to right like we're constantly iterating and building new experiences on top of the axis right like we're the the current product is actually our second battle second version of the battle system we're coming out with the third version of the battle system so everyone's like like we have this like 1v3 meme um stuff like that right and then um yeah it's just like we're building out in public so people feel like they're building together that they're collaborating together that everyone you know that there are these connections and it's just far more than a game right it's it's a place to have fun to bond with each other to flex your crypto uh kind of extravagance um so it has it has a it's actually is rewarding right so people ask always ought to come to this topic right it's like is actually fun right and i've actually we've talked to you and i've listened to some of like the thinking from the founder of eve online and right and he talks about it is like right like people talk about fun but actually what games should ultimately strive to be is to be rewarding in the same way that we find our lives rewarding right so if you talk to a any random person right they might they probably right like they might not find their life fun all the time on a day-to-day basis right that might not actually even be good be good right fun is probably a poor thing to optimize for right but ultimately most people find their lives worth living and and rewarding uh through through different uh you know to different forms of kind of i guess value if that makes sense there's right there's there's social there's economic um right there's building a legacy right and i think and and i think the thing about axi is that it's it's actually right like harnessing this kind of like idea of ikigai right where you're you're people feel like they're part of this movement they're building something that's uh substantive and important and yeah they're having fun and making friends while doing it there's a line that i remember joe rogan saying once upon a time where he was recounting the story of this uh person that he met that had this like kind of basic like production behind the scenes drop at some like like live music venue i don't know is irrelevant um but and it's like kind of this normal guy but all but he was like in some like insane top 10 tier world of warcraft player and like the line that this individual left with joe rogan was that i am such a nobody in the real world but in world of warcraft i'm like one of the biggest celebrities uh and like joe rogan was harping on the fact that the guy was talking about how he's nothing in the real world and like the contrast that he was giving was like oh yeah he gave up he gave up his real world identity in form of this like fake world of warcraft identity and he just deposited all of his like you know mental energy and mental motivation into this fake world this like this world of warcraft world but i i think when you uh kind of uh take a context of what you just stated where like no world of warcraft's not supposed to be fun it's supposed to be rewarding and then also we talk about integrating assets into things like ethereum where you know there's usdc on ethereum which is connected to the federal reserve and how can that be fake right and so like you know the game the thing the assets that you find in your game are just one steps away from being the the reserve currency of of the world how can that be fake at all uh and so like the the takeaway that i just got out from what you just said is that you know with games not supposed to be fun they're supposed to be rewarding like we're actually trying to recreate the real world but in the digital world right we're not we're not trying to make we are not trying to make the digital world fun you're trying to make the digital world real is it i think that's also that's also a functioning definition of the metaverse right is totally right right this this idea that our digital identities our digital items our digital experiences and lives are starting to merge and right like become just as important and just as substantive and rewarding as our lives in the physical world yeah i think there's a hopefully a transition happening where like games are no longer just like supposed to just serve you like dopamine on a platter but they're supposed to serve you emotions of all types like responsibility like the the things that you would find out in the real world like loss i think there's a big component of eve online which is loss where like you go and you build your ships and then like you get like hijacked by pirates and you lose all of your stuff like that's that's a real emotion that you're going to feel as a result of that and it's not fun at all but it's very very real yeah the you know the mo right the more the sustainable game economies right are going to mimic uh parts of life that we don't like um in interesting ways and that's also right it's like as someone who works on games right that's something to think about is like right like how close to you know everyday physical life do you want these games to be um and what is there is there right is there some hybrid that is like a nice i think uh middle zone that it might be you know preferable um so yeah it's it's i think that's where a lot of the design space is there's another line that i hear also from also on joe rogan but this one came from elon musk where he was talking about why instagram did bitter but uh has got bigger than twitter and elon musk said it's limbic resonance as in uh instagram resonates with people's like more reptilian brain much better than twitter does twitter makes you think it makes you like actually use your brain instagram doesn't you just you just vibe in instagram makes you feel emotions uh and so maybe the version of the metaverse that delivers reality rather than just dopamine is the one that humans gravitate for because we're striving for that uh uh that same kind of uh feeling right we're striving for that you know responsibility all the things that make us human uh and so maybe it's the successful games of the world are the ones that don't just deliver dopamine on a platter but are the ones that uh allow people to like deep use their deeper parts of their brain yeah especially the ones right the ones where it's where people feel okay i think spending 12 hours a day in right it can't just be right all all pleasure um speaking of joe rogan we were joe rogan axey was actually mentioned on joe rogan really uh last week like he was he was looking into it you know looking at the the website he had it up uh so we were trying to get in touch with him um but that was like that was an amazing moment for the community yeah i think joe rogan's like on the cusp of just like going down a lot of the web 3 rabbit holes but and everyone wants to talk to joe rogan obviously uh but it's just i think it's just going to take one of us to break open the doors so if it's you guys congratulations if that if that's coming your way that'd be pretty cool it's interesting because right i think the the flow of the conversation was hey like you know what do you think about meta and what you know facebook formerly facebook is now doing and then right somehow right it's like right like rather than showing anything that meta was doing they actually showed axe infinity so uh if yeah if we can be right if we can be the poster child of you know this new digital revolution that's happening um i think i think that's going to be awesome for for us for for for ethereum for everyone so how did you go from like one of just the early members inside the discord to an actual team member i just you know i showed up and i saw all these all this work that needed to be done and i started doing it you know in the early days i didn't get paid we didn't even have we didn't have money we didn't have eth uh so you know i was getting paid in axes uh initially ended up you know working out really well like you know some of those axes are super rare right now um so yeah you know just started figuring out you know what needed to be done so a lot of the initial team members they're vietnamese right uh mas mune who's like our artistic genius uh chung who's like our ceo he's an engineer um they're vietnamese so right there's you know there's a little bit of a language barrier right so i thought hey like i could come in and and you know do some communication uh you know try to try to build uh excitement and understanding of how big this could be within the community when you saw the potential behind actually infinity did you what what in what potential did that forum come in it's like oh there could be a lot of people playing this game or like oh these axes could be really really valuable like which one was the one driving you yeah i think i think it's a combination um right like i think also like your the the limbic system thing also like resonates because it's like hey like these are cute like people are gonna like this um this has the chance to really change gaming we understood that they're right like we understood that there are problems with gaming um in those early days i know because we wrote the white paper in about february or march or 2018 and we talked about some of the problems um in gaming right that right it's right like basically right in traditional gaming right now majority of the value is not going to the people that are creating a majority of the value right uh the app stores the game publishers are taking like north of 50 percent um so it's not even the game it's not the money isn't even going to the game developers right uh it's a lot of it is going to these to these middlemen um so that's why i write like crypto is just like right like so textbook just definition right this is not advanced stuff it's like wherever there are huge extractive middlemen right you remove that middleman and you give it to the builders and the community members um so right this is actually is just that principle i think applied to a game and i mean so much of people uh so many people must have come into the axi ecosystem more or less with uh that mindset or something similar to it as opposed to like oh this is going to make me rich mindset because like while actually definitely started off the conversation of like oh crypto gaming is like a financial opportunity it didn't start there like so have you noticed since the mooning of the axs token a difference in the people that come into the axia nation i'm assuming you have alright this is something that i talk to peter pan about a lot right is community building in a bull market and community building in a bear market fundamentally different problems sometimes require fundamentally different people uh but yeah it's something that we we think about a lot right it's like right you get this right like bear markets you'll have a small number of missionaries and then right the entire world finds out about you in a in a bull market and maybe right the the cycle repeats and right you end up with more missionaries than you did at the end of the last cycle or the beginning of the new cycle um so yeah it's like nature right it's like it's like nature's healing but uh yeah definitely as right our audience becomes more mainstream uh you start to run into you know different types of problems right like you know gamers are not super nice as a demographic right so you start to offer it like our you know your your community starts to become closer to like a league of legends community in some cases or some of them are starting to start to become like that uh but i also think that a lot of them are you know able to learn and understand right that this is uh this is a movement and a lot of them are receptive to the education and um and that's also why it's important right like i think a lot of the projects that are trying to copy us they don't have this like older right these veterans who are going to come in and you know basically tell the new kids what's up and what this project is really about yeah is there like a schism between the og's and the new members yeah i would say some of the some of the ogs are a little bit reclusive and hesitant uh to you know engage with the with the newcomers there are others that are there like you know that are you know more public facing and you know think that and prioritize really educating the new faces um but yeah like just like within any society right it's kind of like oh like you know people come in and uh you know there can be like class it's like where it's almost like class rivalry right and generational rivalry yeah how have you guys uh have you guys had to deal with that or is that something that has been like it's a maybe a just a small friction or is it actually something that you guys have had to address intentionally just the differences between the generations yeah i think like i think empowering people to build bonds um i think like the content creators uh like the og content creators too right like they they do a good job because they also are like they see them as their followers and and and stuff like that so um it's something i it's something that i think is a difficult uh it's a difficult kind of phenomenon that's happening but it's also it's a luxury in many cases because a lot of projects they don't they don't have any of that right they just have maybe i don't know a very small community and many of them might just be super new and only focused on the token go up so i would imagine there's some like dynamic tribe dynamic where you have the village elders and then you have like the punk kids and the kids want something that the village elders don't and maybe the village elders know best but you can't only listen to the village elders because like you gotta also include the punk kids right it's politics it's politics right like and it's it's now like i feel like i'm a politician right like i'm i'm a i have right like we have consist constituents right and i think that's what this is yeah it's we're starting to see the rise of these kind of opt-in nations right where it's not like right like the management is still right like uh mostly top down but right like it's opt-in right so i think that's all that's what we're starting to see more so than like fully decentralized co-management structures is right like you get to choose who you're uh who your leaders are which i think right is like that right to choose i think is is a key distinction um yeah well and i think we'll also start to see right like right like more more decentralized contribution creation building um and also maybe yeah potentially kind of like decision making for the for the future the for the you know the future direction of projects but it's i think there's a lot of research and experimentation that's been going uh on going into that kind of stuff and i think like the optimal i think the optimal strategy is also i think vitalik talks about this right is like there are different communities that uh want different levels of um right different trade-offs if that makes sense like the axi discord is the largest discord in the world if i'm getting my numbers right and i would imagine managing that is just an absolute nightmare and if you call this thing a nation and you're calling what you're doing politics how are all these different factions organized like are there is it a representative democracy or do you have like you know the content creators over here and then you have like the players over here but then you have like the casual players over here and the advanced players over here and then you have like the actual builders like how how is this how is this nation organized yeah so our discord is interesting right because our discord is actually an interesting example of how we've attempted at least to tackle this in the short term where we actually have a collab land integration so you basically right collab land will read your wallet see what nfts you have in your ronin wallet and and then assign you a roll right so if you have three axes you at least get to speak in the general chat if you have 10 axes you might be able to speak in the economy chat right if you're a landowner you get the whole you get to speak in the in the land holder chat right um so yeah it's kind of right we have these you know uh parallel forums uh for discourse um and then there are people who float among among them and yeah we have community you know moderators and volunteers that um kind of you know guard dog uh the discord right where you're trying to make sure that people aren't like misleading people people aren't trying to scam the the new players and um and things like that so it's fascinating i've spent a lot of my life in actually discord um and yeah i mean discord as a product changed my life i think i actually yeah so i i'm i know i am still i think the number one um like buy messages in the actually discord with i think like you know a couple hundred thousands my god wow that's that's insane you said you talked about guard dogs in the discord make sure that people aren't scamming people if we're using a nation metaphor that feels like the police yeah it's like more like vigilante maybe justice little bit maybe we're trying right we're trying yeah we're trying to like we're trying to figure out like i think this is a question that we think about a lot in conjunction with the rest of the entire ecosystem is like right like what is the level what is the correct level of like community right like the community driving some some initiative and norms uh within within the ecosystem and you know what needs to be kind of like more of more of a firm you know something closer to a rule or a law right right yeah that's that's nuts um i can't imagine how how much of a how tall of an order that is do you ever fear that like what happens if discord gum goes down like discord has gone down at times like what would it what would the oxy nation do if discord like died for a week yeah so i will i will point out a data point our monthly 30-day volume topped out at the same week that we hit the discord max right so it's like we solved right like we were able to build this you know evm scaling solution to scale our game to millions of players and then what's the thing that might be holding us back right now is like the 800 000 cap on the discord community right because i feel like being a part of the community is such a fundamental part of the experience um that right like you're probably you know you're not getting as engaged community members if you're having a lower activation hard activation rate in terms of like i don't know growth marketing terms right without having people actually able to join that main discord so i'll i will say that it's interesting and yeah like uh we're definitely overexposed and overly reliant on discord i think it you know like there are some web three you know alternatives that are starting to maybe pop up but it's it's still so early but i do think that that is right that is the next wave of innovation i think right around like basically social coordination tooling right so we're starting to see you know i don't know uh these token gated forums um started starting to pop up so which might be like an early iteration of that they're not quite as real time as discord discord right like the server stuff is like you know it's gonna be hard to it's hard to get something to that to that level um quickly and right there's a reason i guess right that and maybe discord is inherently unscalable right like why why don't they why won't they let us uh get to get hit a million in our discord right it's it's that must be a very very very is it must it must take like a lot of like server power right to keep that thing going totally yeah it's like if the breaking of discord while you guys are doing the all-time high in volumes on on ronin is like well we actually got web 3 to scale more than web 2. like web 2 broke that was that was just a paradox yeah that was a paradox i felt i felt like that's those that was interesting i think it shows right that we're facing a lot of the we're facing a lot of the problems that these nft games are gonna face in a year two years um we're facing them first and we're gonna yeah we're gonna have to solve them first for them for everyone else so as the axs price just went absolute bonkers of the one of the resulting downstream impacts of that is like so much angel investment seed investment seed round startups came as a result of that like once you it kind of felt like you know when bitcoin went from zero dollars to a thousand dollars all of a sudden the next thing that happened was that we had like 10 000 bitcoin forks and now we're kind of seeing the same thing like axs went from like a three million dollar market cap which is basically nothing to where it is now in the multi-billions uh and now after as a result of this we have like an infinity number of play-to-earn games being like invested in right now like are you if you had to guess what percentage of those will have any sort of like meaningful adoption like five percent yeah probably like very small number yeah around like two to two to five percent sounds sounds directionally correct i think we'll might have to see a lot of consolidation and this also goes for the guilds right we also saw an explosion of funding rounds for guilds for the games uh so yeah we might need to see consolidation around that and yeah it's going to be hard for all of them to succeed but yeah i think like we will also may see right some of some important projects come out come out of this class right i think that's you know generally how crypto works um right where even ethereum was you know you i think funded you know by uh by bitcoin right like that that's that's how you paid in the ico um i think so yeah it's you know it it's it can be overwhelming um sometimes right and it seems like yeah we everything got comped against us um and i think like people don't understand people are like hey like yeah if you just make a game with better graphics like it should it should be it should have a higher market cap right but they don't they don't understand like the work that's put gone into this in terms of the community building as well and the thinking around you know the economy and um nourish uh kind of yeah nourishing these uh content creators and ever and everything the the relationships and social capital in this network but yeah i think you know we also are you know extremely bullish on and you know these player-owned digital nations uh right this you know it's part of the vision for ronan is to be this scalable place for right some of the next generation of these experiences so of those like 2.5 to five percent of these played earned game startups say say we're on the other side of this and like that five percent exists and we see which ones they are what do you think will be the thing that they needed to have gotten right in order to make it through that filter i think it's a combination honestly a combination of things uh which which i think is what is going to make it so hard because some people might get some people might get the community rights and some people might get the economy right and some people might get the scaling right uh some people might get the art and the gameplay right uh but i think putting it all together is great where the where the magic happens um i think yeah web 3 community building i mean i'm you know maybe i'm biased people everyone tends to think what they do is is important so i think web 3 community building is is you know is a is a difficult journey uh that requires like blood sweat and tears and there are no shortcuts um i think the art uh it has to be like the right type of game i think like like one of the one of the underappreciated reasons for axi's success is that people love their axes people right they feel bad selling their first team of axes their first axis the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i used gemini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my

friction free so jiho we had this uh break and the conversation but we're gonna do our best to pick off uh pick up where we left off um you were talking about how everyone has this like emotional bond to their first team of axes and it makes it uh difficult to sell these axes or emotionally difficult is what you were uh inferring to uh and kind of reminds me of um a conversation i was having with a dc investor where uh nfts when like uh crypto prices go down significantly nfts don't they don't really they're not the first thing that people go to like liquidate when they need to cover their margin positions which many people in d5 have um can you do do you have your own experiences about like your emotional attachments to axes that you might be able to share sure so yeah there are a bunch of axes that i would never that i consider priceless that i would never sell right like my first axi number 707 uh right that was what kind of introduced me to the universe and started my journey right like i bought that thing i thought it was awesome and right just started i felt like okay i'm part of this project now and i have to and i have to start working um so yeah i think great like that emotional utility right i'm not sure if that's a term but let's i think i think it makes sense right there's this emotional utility where right like right nfts don't work if everyone is buying nfts to try to make money right like uh it's just the the the the laws of the universe don't work like that right there has to be right there has to be uh this notion that right you're kind of spending money there are people who are spending money on nfts rather than just every everyone can cannot be an investor right um just like yeah i think we talked about this right like like when you buy a pokemon card right i you you buy a pokemon card because you just need it right like the fact that you there is liquidity for it right like can allow you to justify spending you know a large amount um so i think that's a lot of where the futures and right like what people what people need to understand i think this is also something that we don't do a necessary a good job of communicating as a space to the public right the public sees this you know they see us as uh right these degenerates that are right online right like me and all the headlines about are about people making millions of dollars or whatever and uh we have to do a better job of communicating right the emotional utility the emotional aspect um the pride and joy of showing off these nfts uh i think i think that's super important and um in in the education process and and you know expanding the community and getting more people involved has this at all turned into a more like concrete strategy with the future of the axi ecosystem like you guys are trying to inject emotion into the game yeah i think things like right like collectors badges um right like uh so it was an interesting there was an interesting change that we made where by accident right like when axes were fighting in battle they stopped making facial expressions like grim stopped grimacing or uh when they're attacking or getting attacked and that was like a big issue for our players right so we realized that right like these small little details that make axes more lifelike they're they're really important so um i think uh axes right like for example if you log in and you haven't logged in for two weeks right your axes should be right like treat uh acting like a dog or a puppy when you get home after a long break right that so i watched the documentary like why do we love dogs why do humans love dogs it's not actually because we think that they're cute right because there are actually a lot of people who have dogs that are kind of objectively ugly and they still love them just as much as right dogs that are actually objectively cute right and a lot of the reason that people love dogs is because dogs actually love humans dogs show love and affection to humans they reciprocate it i mean that's actually what makes us love our dogs the most right so basically in order for people to love their axes even more we have to basically create systems where the axes actually can show affection to their owners um so that was a conversation that i had with with like the art team and the animation team and they seemed really receptive to it so as a developer that sounds like a really fun project uh hey make these nfts these animated nfts make them show love towards the people that that own them and like we we could go like we talked about how like the you talked about how the nft industry doesn't really do a very good job of um advertising the emotional bond that people have to their um to their like you know nfts and the external world just kind of thinks that there's these pixels with price tags but also if we really want to optimize for that price tag we would probably be trying to create nfts that are more like stronger uh conduits of love between owner and nft like this probably would be good for the valuations of these things i think so right like ultimately yeah there has to be right like combination of aesthetics utility and scarcity right and that's where i think that's what i wrote this about this and i think like 2018 right it's like the triple threat framework for adding value to nfts um and yeah like you know we we i think people kind of understand the scarcity part they kind of they you know they understand the aesthetics and i think gaming right in general is an answer uh an attempt to answer right like what does what does true utility for these things look like um so that's that can be that can be seen as okay like you're using these things in a game um but i think it's also right like you see these as part of your life um so yeah uh it's it's really important um so they're actually the people the virtual beings industry has started reaching out to me a lot over the last year right what because i think what they see is okay when people think about ai or intelligent yeah basically like uh intelligent characters right a lot of people they think about okay like how do we get a hologram or like a virtual influencer or that right like uh that seems lifelike but i think where even lower hanging fruit is how can you make a virtual pet that is more lifelike because the barrier right the the there's no like turing test right like with a pet right it's it's like it's it's it's a lot easier i think to simulate that that experience of a real pet than it is to ex to simulate the experience of speaking and interacting with a real human being i think um so i think the virtual being space or the virtual life space is actually really really interested in axi so there is definitely some stuff to explore around that as well earlier in the conversation we were talking about how uh good games especially good web 3 games have migrated from just like trying to serve dopamine on a platter to its players to creating much more realism and we talked a little bit about like loss right like when you lose in a game like you should actually have lost something either monetary value or something scarce because you know there's there's there is no joy without loss right you can't there is no such thing as one-sided happiness you have to have sadness to also have happiness uh and i i think and you also talked about how like you know the the uh the working definition for the metaverse is something that is just the digital world but just trying to replicate uh replicate our actual world but in in virtual format and so like my mind is going towards like the version of the metaverse where like i think the way to onboard people into the metaverse is like find ways to optimize for love right because that's at the end of the day that's all what people want like you know we all like some people get trapped in the money game but really people forget that you know money is just you know means to an end and usually everyone's end is the same thing which is love uh and so maybe that's the alpha for any of the you know web 3 game developers here is like yeah you're actually trying to build love into your game i think yeah it's it's right like these these real emotions right it's like uh i don't know what is the what are the hierarchy of needs um what is like ikigai right i think like some people they they say that axi is interesting because yeah it operates right at the intersection of what i want to spend my time doing what i enjoy doing or what i feel super passionate about um so yeah i think yeah replicating these right like we talked about right the people people they say oh like nft games they're not fun enough right which and fun is some kind of like arbitrary ideal but actually all right you know the founder of eve online he says like don't optimize or don't you know chase fun as a as a developer right it's like you actually want to you know create professions within your ecosystem right like you want to create a rewarding experience um and i think right like yeah i think right like what we're seeing is that our digital lives are becoming rewarding in the same ways that our physical lives are hard they're difficult but we ultimately most most of us find them rewarding in some way or or another do you do you think that software there's that meme that software is eating the world right and now with ethereum and smart contracts software is also eating finance for like the first time ever and there's generally been the pattern that anything that software touches it generally improves uh and so now we have this concept of like the metaverse where software is just straight up eating reality uh and outputting like a different one uh that perhaps is improved like we could it could get real dystopian but it could also get real like utopian as well like do you do you think that like do you do you agree with the trajectory that like software is producing a new version of reality that perhaps is better because that's how we can code for that we can code it to be better i wouldn't yeah it's hard to say better um but what i'll what i'll say is right it it i think it's creating this base level of access to ideas relationships and communities right where for most of human history we were forced almost right to basically be a part of the town the community that we're kind of physically born into even the nation-state whereas what we're now seeing are these opt-in nations opt-in digital nations opt-in digital communities that are starting to fulfill a lot of the needs and desires of what it means to be a human being and right like if you're born into a and if you're born in to a very difficult situation i think it provides some opportunity out where right you can meet people from anywhere around the world learn from them right you're not just like you know being limited to the people and ideas and circumstances of where you're you know physically born into so that's that's one one thing that i'm starting to see right and i i think it's interesting that right the first scalable impact that we've started to see is right like you know people going crazy over axi and places like venezuela and the philippines right where there is you know very low access to right like uh yeah uh opportunity ideas um things like that well i think that's a really optimistic version of the future obviously there is the uh tug of war behind like well you know you can't actually go live in the metaverse like you know metaverse will not put food on the table only real real resources in the real world definitely will but it's also hard not to be just extremely optimistic of it's just easier to discover things that you care about on a on an emotional level because of exactly what you talked about like the internet allows you to go take a beeline for the things that you care about where if you were born in some you know small town population of just like 1 000 people in some like flyover state or some you know third world country where like your hobbies that you have can't really be fully expressed um maybe the metaverse allows a more direct route to expressing some of those interests and i think great like one key point that i think just popped up into my head is it allows you access to people in a direct access almost to people in a different socioeconomic class than you right so you could be a right filipino axi player and you can join a guild and you could be right like you know really uh enlightened web three you know people from all over the world that have been in this space for six years and kind of learned from them um and when right like when very rich people spend within these right digital economies there's more it's more of a it's more of a perfect trickle-down system right for example right so if you know someone if someone is rich and you know just wants a bunch of axes they're buying axes from the marketplace that there is right like direct value transfer from someone in a developing world spending for fun and to increase their collection to people in emerging markets that are right uh seeing this as a way of ascending in in in yeah in the in the universe or they're kind of like their socioeconomic status so i think there's more right like this one have been this one been one of the i think like the super controversial things right about i don't know the last 40 to 50 years of you know a global macro policy right is like right like how efficient is this idea of like right trickle-down economics and i think we haven't really seen right truly efficient mechanisms of having those types of trickle-down mechanics actually work right where you know arguably when rich people spend in the physical world a lot of that spending goes to other rich people whereas i think in when rich people spend in the digital world there will be more of that value captured by uh yeah you know i guess people from um people who are you know i guess who don't have that much capital jiho what about the future makes you optimistic i think that the future is going to be scary i think the future is going to be actually more free and there's actually going to be more responsibility in that i think like we're starting to see the technologies that will allow us to be right more autonomous um but there there will also be right like a battle and and i think for me like what i find like i always felt like i wan i was a revolutionary without you know any cause uh to be involved with so i think like right like if you're if you're that type of person right like i think our gender generation has reason to be optimistic because i think we are a lucky generation and that there will be significant causes to take part in um which is right like right like some people might feel jealous of people who live during i don't know the i don't know like very peaceful eras i think we're not going to have a peaceful arrow i think it's going to be full of conflict and schisms and different ideas but i think those are the most interesting times to live in and i think our generation and the people who are involved in this ascension of web3 where we have a chance to be uh yeah looked back on for generations to come so we actually it's almost like a generational opportunity that will come with a lot of yeah it's gonna it's gonna be hard um but i think like at least we have a cause worth fighting for which i think some generations um didn't didn't have the chance to like maybe like the baby boomers or something like that so i think um being adaptable in the 2020s is going to be a very very important property or characteristic for you know making it through this crazy decade because i also think it's going to be one of volatility and chaos um any other characteristics come to mind as to what would be useful properties or characteristics personality traits for people to uh lean into as they navigate in the next decade yeah so i think like yeah open-mindedness uh curiosity yeah just being open to making friends with anyone anywhere in the world and forming like deep social and kind of economic relationships with with people over the internet right i think um yeah i think like and then just like being willing to i don't know waste a lot of time online right trying to click the right combination of buttons to go down these interesting rabbit holes and i think this is you know so i i think like the yeah the willingness to kind of wander and right like some people i don't know are so goal oriented uh but but i think sometimes you just need to kind of absorb um information um so i think having that willingness um is also going to be really important jiho thank you for joining me on this episode of layer 0. thanks for having me it's a lot of fun hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now
