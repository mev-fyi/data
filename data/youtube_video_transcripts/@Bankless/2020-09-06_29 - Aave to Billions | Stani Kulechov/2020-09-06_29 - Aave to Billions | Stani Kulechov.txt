[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing my friend super good ryan just came out of this interview with stani kolachov from ave ryan what did you think of this interview man it was it was so much fun i think it uh it's a perfect next episode from our last episode with vance from framework where vance talked a lot about these unique uh characters in the d5 space these crypto native founders and he actually mentioned stani by name as as one of the archetypes of these types of founders we're doing we're going to be doing a series the next few episodes including this one our series where we actually talk to these crypto native founders the actual builders uh the people that vance was talking about the people who are sort of unique to this um i guess generation of d5 protocol uh building and i think one of my takeaways from this conversation with stani was just how understated that stani and his team at ave are almost i almost used the word uh kind of humble about what they built at one point in our conversation stani says at the beginning of the year they would have been happy with five million locked total locked value inside of the ave protocol and here we are they have about 1.4 billion locked in uh six months later just the the amount of kind of building uh that that's been going on with ave um you know his team style of just constant shipping product never stopping uh partnering with other protocols wherever possible really building for the ecosystem i found frankly refreshing it's not something that you typically see but i think it is one of the patterns you see in successful d5 protocol so if you're looking at like the future trying to front run the next opportunity maybe you'll see some of the patterns in the ave team and what stani and his team have developed uh play out in future protocols maybe those types of characteristics are the investable pieces what did you think david one of the lines that stuck out to me in the vance episode was when he is interviewing or talking to founders of protocols that are looking to like you know eventually turn over the keys to the kingdom to the community he he asked them are you really about that life i thought that was a funny line yeah and stani is absolutely about that life and that life is what he means by this is you know if you are interested in building a protocol on ethereum it's fundamentally different than like building out like an llc or a c corp or you know going public on the stock market it's just a different deal and i think stani is particularly well suited as an exemplar person who is about that life right because you know ave has one of the most insane histories of 2017 and 2018 where they initially tried out this thing called ethlend it was it became clear that it wasn't going to work so they pivoted a protocol like a protocol pivot is a is an interesting thing in in of itself and what one thing i think why we why you think that you know stani and ave is understated is because you know i unlike companies like you know amazon and jeff bezos and and you know steve jobs and apple is like i don't think ave had this grand like you know one three five ten year plan i think in the middle of the bear market they just started working on what was obvious and what was obviously wanted and needed by the community and they just put one foot forward in front of the other and then all of a sudden because because of their relationship with their community and the and the feedback that they got from the community which is a topic that we talk about in this podcast they were just able to create what the community wanted and as a result of that there's like 1.5 billion dollars in obvi yeah it's really an amazing story and i think it'll come through in the conversation and really the the last thing i'll say before we we jump into it is there tend to be two types of uh people that come into crypto you know one type is the tourist and they're here just because they've heard the hype and you know they want to build something because it's hypey and they're all about that glitz and the glamour and there's the other type that's more the crypto native the builder um the one that's going to keep going in the trenches of a a a soul-sucking bear market uh and those are the the teams that and the individuals the crypto natives the people who are there in the bear market that i tend to trust more to carry us for it in the future bull market there is going to be a host of new tourists that come aboard uh and you only can tell whether they're crypto natives or not if they're willing to continue building during the bear market as well yeah making it through the bear market is just the biggest signal of commitment like no one can ever question whether you're here in it for the long term or not and ave as one of the protocols on ethereum one of the biggest protocols on the ethereum i think is pretty clear is in it until the very end uh so big fans of ave let's just go ahead and get right into the interview but before we do that we're going to take a moment to talk about our sponsors one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up block folio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into block folio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zappa reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswop forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available d5 platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed your ethereum address is a bankless bank account but here's the problem it doesn't have a human readable name it's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem it provides a domain name for your ethereum address so instead of telling someone to send you funds to xerox e3ba blah blah blah you can tell them to send funds to yourname.crypto a domain name for your ethereum address at unstoppabledomains.com you can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs you can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your crypto or dot eth or even zil domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names.com.org your bankless bank account on ethereum should have a domain name too so go to unstoppabledomains.com register a domain name for your ethereum address now unstoppabledomains.com all right let's get to the interview bankless nation i am super excited to introduce our next guest this is stani kolachov who is the founder of the ave protocol which is as you know because you are a bankless listener a money lego for lending and borrowing assets in defy it has a phenomenal growth story so right now there are about 1.4 billion in locked assets inside of the ave protocol the price of lend its native token has also increased about three thousand three hundred percent this year so that means if you bought a hundred dollars worth of lend on january first you'd now own three thousand three hundred dollars an absolutely insane growth chart insane year for ave uh stani how's your year been are you doing okay how's the how's the year going so far i'm i'm i'm pretty much dying here with all the uh things that we're building and and also all the traction that is coming and in the whole space and i i i i it's hard for me to keep up with everything what's happening even inside of it's just been amazing amazing year so far you know so david and i are both like full time like we're do this is our job to cover all of these things and to try to keep up and uh we're having a hard time not just keeping up with just things that are going on at d5 but keeping up with all of the things that ave has been shipping lately is this just like are you guys accelerating in your ability to ship things or is this just the symptom of a bull market i think we're more organized in the sense uh i think we're more uh we have more resources than than we used to have and i think we are more somehow uh smarter in the way we build uh just not just code but ship products uh i think it's a combination of multiple things but uh we're super organized and we just when we get a good idea uh a good feature we just want to uh get it uh kind of like to the public and we tend to see that many of interesting things hasn't come up into mainnet because uh i think projects are hesitating too much but i mean it's all about innovation i mean the more you get stuff that helps people removes inefficiencies and brings value i mean there's no reason to waste weight with it well you guys certainly don't wait you've been shipping like demons this year it's been absolutely insane to see i wanna you know start with this we don't usually do this on the podcast uh stani because we we tend to like to skip over the kind of the intro and get sort of into the meat but i think part of the meat actually for you is the intro like we're doing this series on crypto native founders and vance spencer from framework came on last episode and he talked about this how it's his goal and framework's goal to find these unique crypto native founders and they're typically not found in the places that uh traditional silicon valley venture capitalists uh look for them and now you guys started ave in finland right helsinki finland is that right so this is a um you know a country of five million people it's you know for for folks who aren't familiar it's uh very very far north very likely north of where you're listening this yeah to this from why helsinki how did you guys found a major d5 protocol in finland yeah i mean definitely it's kind of like uh i mean it's it's not the the the place where you would expect a big project come from but in terms like finland is a small country but in some way uh there is a lot of uh things that are very good i mean in terms of education innovation and and just we we don't just see uh usually 100 that much i mean we have a very good gaming industry for example if everyone remembers for example angry birds clash of clans these are finnish games actually and it's of course if someone remembers still like nokia like they made the best phones and they went to divorce phones and i mean there is innovation there uh it's just um i don't know i mean i i see it kind of like uh maybe it's because of defy we're able to do this maybe because it's the fact that anyone can build uh permissionlessly not just like use permissionlessly uh defy uh primitives and and the the the protocols but actually you can build and if you allow that i think the next biggest thing might come from i don't know from from from uh uh some in a smaller country and and that's maybe that's the point of of all uh decentralized finance i i totally agree i think that is the point that anyone can get started from anywhere it's permissionless you don't need to ask anyone you don't need to know someone on wall street or know someone in silicon valley to go build something and to go innovate and to go ship something you know another fascinating point i think about you stani is that you've got a master's degree in law right so this is also not necessarily the typical i guess uh motif of the um you know the the the tech founder can you tell us about law and how that intersects with kryptos like just tell us the story how did you get involved in wanting to build something in on ethereum and in d5 to begin with yeah i mean uh before uh going to to law school i i actually i i did uh web development i i did mobile app development uh before that and uh i used to focus quite a lot on financial applications and i i even had a startup where well it wasn't startup was more like a a a small project where i i built an app where uh all the gamers gamers for example or anyone who gets uh income from from app store or google play uh there's this uh waiting period of one month uh in in 15 days or so and and our kind of like product uh application allowed them to get their uh income uh the next day so so we did a bit of uh financing uh in in in that sense and i i loved always development like i i was born always somehow like close to software uh my brother used to used to used to basically tweak linux kernels and and the big thing is it was very big thing in finland because i mean linux actually is from the founders from finland the project started from there so there there is another like thing that uh and it's open source i think linux is the biggest open source thing out there one of the biggest and uh what was interesting is that uh programming it's in mathematics it's very proof like so let's say one plus one one plus one is two but then again uh whenever i encounter it regulation or law which is very common in finance uh i i noticed uh one uh interesting thing is that uh law law is basically opinionated uh in in the sense that uh there is no right or wrong but there's actually a consensus of of uh like different kinds of opinions and that forms the the law and i was i was like i wanted to understand more and i went to study law and that was pretty pretty pretty funny so like it was it was intellectual curiosity that drew you to law school is that the case yeah i never intended to work as a lawyer uh i i mean somehow it was as a professional it could be fun in terms of like you you're able to if especially if you're like a commercial lawyer you could actually see uh how companies do transactions and and and help them start ups uh scale ups and and also kind of like a a a bigger blue chips as well but uh in in middle of the law school i started to get more involved in ethereum i guess i was researching something about uh automatizing uh legal agreements and someone somehow i ended up into a post about smart contracts and started to read more and ended up in uh ethereum reddit and started to think like what is this thing and and just researched like weeks and weeks and tried to understand and grasp like what you could actually do with this technology and that was like when i understood like smart contracts and and the power especially like the the power of of having immutable code and then it kind of suddenly clicked to me like actually we're building a something that kind of didn't exist before in this efficient way and that was mind-blowing the interesting part for me was that uh when when i was designing and and building the the financial applications uh like programming itself uh it's kind of like failed and mathematics it feels like it's it's very rules uh based so uh what it basically means that let's say you have a a equation of one plus one it's two but in in law when it comes to regulation it's not like that it's very opinionated so if you think about uh law it's it's kind of like uh different kinds of opinions based on in interpretation and then you kind of like have a consensus on what what is the the right interpretation of let's say law or or what is right or or wrong in that sense and and that uh part of uh fascinated me quite a lot uh because it was very uncommon to to to me and i wanted to feed this this uh in intellectual uh and part but what's interesting is that uh i started somehow uh get more involved in ethereum because i was researching at some point in my studies about automatizing agreements or efficient way of making legal agreements and somehow i ended up reading something about smart contracts and then was one thing led to another i was in the uh in the ethereum reddit community and reading all this stuff and and people doing transactions and and reading kind of different kinds of use cases potential and once i realized the the potential of of of smart contracts in terms of immutability uh i was pretty much sold because uh it was mind-blowing because once once you you deploy the code and and and in a way that uh it's immutable you kind of don't need the trust and you can even get rid of the lawyers and in one way and and simplify uh transactions and and make it more efficient and that is was something that was very mind-blowing to me so it sounds like it was almost like this confluence for you of of things like so uh intellectual curiosity i'm sure you probably saw that in ethereum and in crypto and this idea of smart contracts as law as immutable law and also harkening back to you know kind of the the linux experience with uh with open source it's all of those things combined is is that why you kind of fell in love with d5 in the space and at what point did you decide to actually build something here yeah i mean uh the the open source part was what's really fascinating because you you have people around the world and contributing like i always understood the open source because i i usually tend to use open source software uh when i was younger and develop software and and during college i didn't want to pay because i didn't afford to pay uh different different kinds of software so i tended to try to always find open source versions and and and uh not much contribute i i i wasn't that uh kind of like a talented in the sense or skillful but but but definitely like i i uh i always understood what what it means and i i think even more uh in ethereum it became quite clear because you had a community which is very uh open source centric but actually you could build a lot of proprietary technology on top of uh on chain ecosystems and and indeed as well but many tend not to because uh you kind of lose the the edge of having a community and the contribution of community and uh when i saw that happen in in in in the uh dream space that was pretty fascinating there was one incident that kind of like was weird to me because i came a bit before the the the dao hack and and and i i things were very unclear to me like i haven't grasped everything what's going on in ethereum and the dow hack happened a lot of people kind of turned their backs and thought it the the experiment was a bit of failure and to some extent but for me it wasn't ever like an uh issue i mean like i wanted to still build something and somehow i realized that i want to build something related to finance and and then i kind of started to think what that could be okay stani so you like you discovered ethereum you're intellectually curious you liked smart contracts uh but why did that end up you creating eathland and as a piece of trivia for those that aren't familiar before there was ave there was eathland and so ethan is actually the precursor to to ave which which you know stanley and the ethan team started before ave ever was a thing so stani how come uh eathland as a as a protocol or as a project how come that interested you yeah i i guess i i wanted to do some sort of a proof of concept of a loan transaction uh where where we we connect a lender and a borrower and they can they can basically do a a long transaction uh in in a truck distrust just an environment uh and and especially like addresses are basically anonymous and still in a way that the uh borrower has an incentive to repay the loan so what we came up with is uh interestingly this was the period when we saw the the first kind of like decentralized exchange coming in ethereum in 2016 was the ether delta and there was absolutely no traction no nobody cared about it nobody understood how to use it and it was difficult to use it and it was an order book exchange so it took a bit while uh when when uh this uh tokens erc20 tokens that are in ethereum got a bit of more volume and traction and people started to actually trade them and and we saw like uh actually uh liquidity so uh in that part i was thinking like okay so we have here like uh tokens that could actually be assets representations of anything why not use these assets as a collateral until the uh the and and make a long transaction and and release the collateral when the borrower repays it and that was the the very first concept of over collateralized loans and and we named the project uh etland short for ethereum uh interior landing and it wasn't like the i mean the designs were very crappy those days when you build decentralized applications you didn't give much about user experience uh the the front end it was just all about like deploying smart contracts and having some sort of way to interact and that's fine like if if you can connect to a dap and and and then just initiate the transaction rest was kind of like uh obsolete at that point and i'm glad that we got rid of that and now we are in a state that we have beautiful user interfaces and actually user experience but that moment was there when we we actually started and that was uh i mean fascinating enough uh ethelene model the overclockers loans is basically where half of the dfi is based on you you borrow against a collateral and and uh we didn't understood back then i didn't understand back then how big the space could become i i thought it was a very nice proof of concept and probably i will forget about the project but that didn't happen yeah people people talk about the user experience of uh ethereum and crypto being difficult today and i i i think those people never actually tried to use ether del f delta back in 2016. david did you ever trade on ether delta i'm pretty sure i still have funds inside of ethernet i didn't bother to go get them because it was just such a pain it was just so janky like but it was at at one time the only place where you could get particular tokens um but man it felt like something out of like the early 90s um it was just yeah terrible to use but okay i want to before we get to ave now and kind of finish the story on eathland i want to talk about this because um ethlend was similar to the initial version of of dharma right uh another protocol that was doing peer-to-peer lending in that it was it was peer-to-peer right so it was you know one uh individual with an ether dress matched to one other individual with an eth address and i don't know like how you think about it stani but it feels like peer-to-peer defy contracts haven't taken off in the way that peer to contract defy protocols have in that like a peer to contract is sort of like there's this aggregate pool and you sort of you know match liquidity and you pool liquidity inside of the contract rather than always having to match peers was that a an insight that you developed or what are the kind of insights that you developed when building eathland that led you into what ave eventually became yeah i mean i i i definitely agree that the the peer-to-contract model is is is more uh efficient uh in that sense what's interesting uh back then is that when we started uh there wasn't an ecosystem uh like this we have today so so i mean ether delta where i remember first time uh i i wanted to to actually sell uh tokens or buy tokens i waited a week that that someone bought the tokens and they were quite liquid ones i mean uh i mean it was first blood tokens and and and and it's like it's just fascinating how low liquidity there was you opened a trade so this is like what people don't realize don't remember about ether delta so you would open a trade and there would be no buyers in the other side so you'd have to wait like a week or one week yeah like yeah to get that trade filled right yeah yeah that's how crazy it was i mean and and and then you have the gas cost and then you you wonder like why i'm paying gas well you wonder these days even more but but but it's it's kind of like uh interesting aspect and yeah i mean the liquidity was very low so and we wanted to make this transaction to happen and and this proof of concept and we're thinking like how well what happens if if actually someone needs to liquidate the loan and and resell the collateral and and and uh how we make it work in a way that we don't kind of risk other users so so when the liquidity is very low uh it's way better to not not to pull uh the risk together into a systematic form and that is very typical uh in in uh low risk uh low uh liquidity instruments so so what we wanted to do is kind of like separate the the agreements and and we even technically did it quite separately we we deployed uh for each loan that was created we deployed uh a separate uh smart contract which was very stupid to do because every time you deploy a smart contract you you pay a lot of gas but then the gas price was quite low and we found out like six months later that uh the gas prices like uh went 10x and and then we were in the place that we had to refigure everything everything out again but uh so we had to separate the risk so we we that was like one of the things we didn't want to make a situation where uh someone can come and and and uh somehow use this uh systemic risk in their advantage when they the collateral values are low liquid in markets so so we made the peer-to-peer model where everyone who is funding alone can actually decide upon their risk level and and at that time uh it made a lot of sense and and what was interesting in in this fashion is that uh it was the very first primitive of of on-chain landing and and kind of like we we wanted to look something that already exists in the traditional finance which is peer-to-peer loans even though they are these days also kind of like liquidity providers uh are already like aggregated in in one one way and and and we we started the model uh this way and at some point the d5 started to accelerate in the sense that some of these tokens started to actually have some value like now we have actually [ __ ] coins that are traded and not just [ __ ] coins that that that that aren't like traded anywhere and and and that changed quite a lot so you could pull risk and and we started people to do this and that started to actually inspire us that okay if they if they can do it i mean we can do it and we can improve something and i think that was the the moment that took us forward so before we get to the happy 2020 i want to talk a little bit about the bear market the grueling bear market right so you know back to back to tokens you guys launched the lend token in in happy days right december 2017 when everything was booming even crypto kitties were selling for like you know thousands of dollars uh you launched it then it shot up right so from whatever the launch price was to about you know 39 cents in january 2018 right everything was going crazy there was not a lot of rationality to it not a lot of cash flows or token economics that were thought through people are just buying everything but then we had the 2018 bear market start shortly after and it seems like shortly after you guys launched ethereum lost 95 of its value uh but like tokens like lend lost even more than that it lost 99 of its value um and by by 2019 so like the pit of a the bear market um i think again you know memories are short-lived but uh people don't remember how um despondent uh d5 teams were feeling like um you know ethereum was dead bitcoin is the only uh app for crypto all of these things how are you feeling and to add a little bit more color to that there are plenty of 2017 tokens that did exactly what the lend token did at the start of 2017 and then and then mooned and then in 2018 went to like night lost 99 right and there are plenty of tokens that are still at 99 percent losses whereas has not and and there's also there's also and there's also tokens that that they used to do something completely else and and lost 99 percent of value and now they're doing d5 yeah exactly exactly well okay but but um in in the bear market with you know your your token 99 percent out down everyone's saying like d5 is dead ethereum is dead how are you feeling like it seemed like you guys kept building but how you know did you ever think it's over ben horowitz uh has a book which i love it's called the hard things about hard things and he talks about every every you know protocol every startup has its uh uh wifio movement moment that's wfio where it's like where aft it's over right yeah and they have to go through that to come out on the other side did you have that moment did you think it was like not gonna work out actually never because uh we i mean we didn't raise substantial funds but kind of uh in in terms of like building the the ideas that we always think about at at ave and back in italian like we were always like thinking like like like like when when can we ship this new thing like when we could uh move to the next thing and like we we had so many ideas that we wanted to actually uh get into the mainnet i still have i still have a lot of a lot of uh kind of like a a proof of concepts that we we basically were brainstorming two uh two three years ago and that are very viable products today if we will ship them and it's just kind of like uh we're we have always been a bit un uh resourced in because we are small teams so we have to focus in the very very core and uh but i i can say that uh during that that uh kind of crypto winter period it was it wasn't easy i mean it wasn't like people are losing faith and just because of the the the valuations and the market is is uh going down and and not giving like a much about what people are building that was like sad at least was sad to me like because like i mean we were shipping more stuff all the time we're we're getting more knowledge and and we're building more things than more than ever and and and basically people weren't that excited about it and and and i think the good part is that we we we definitely had very diverse community and uh we had a lot of users from from even today like many users from uh many other users are actually from all from the uh italian era and for them it's fascinating because they have seen our very first products and like which look completely like crap and where we are where we are today for them this is like a like a journey and they have been part of it and that's like fascinating and there's still a lot of people who come all the time that they're saying that been following all the time and haven't been active but but it's just amazing how you guys are uh proceeding and and i i think for us the the the the thesis always been the the innovation we didn't care about on the markets and and to be honest uh when i came to ethereum i never uh came to invest i i bought ethereum for gas and that's all about it i had i needed gas for deploying contracts and and to to pay transactions and that that is why i needed ethereum i never need it for as an investment uh i i like to build financial products uh but i don't want to kind of like focus too much on investing i love to build things i'm a builder i think so let's talk a little bit more about the ave community during the bear market uh you said that there were people that that stuck around and people that you know paid attention but that couldn't have been the same throughout 2017 and then into 2018 and 19. so how did the avi community kind of fill their niche around ave because from from what i understand now the ave community is one of the probably the the gold standard in crypto right in terms of like having a strong relationship with the team using the team using the ave community to iterate on their products tell us tell us about the transition from 2017 to 2018-19 with the ave community well i think what was important that we when we we we were building it land we basically uh finished all the features that we wanted to deliver uh to the community and then we started to build uh the next thing but for us what was important uh that actually like our communities were about uh what what could be built next and and uh compared to that uh uh too much uh giving giving kind of like too much sticking or something very touristic and i really love that because it gives space to ship and it's interesting now like uh i mean we're shifting towards decent class governance where the token holders make all the decisions and i'm really uh curious to see like how it will play out in the future because uh of as a team will will build things like i hate the idea when when uh you know you you basically give you build the protocol you build the product and give it to the community and then you you basically say okay i'm out of here and i i just don't believe in that i believe that you are still like a stakeholder in what you're building and if you look at for example uh uh linus torvalds in in as a kind of like member of the linux community he's still very active and same for for example vitalik in ethereum and i i it's a kind of like a people where actually like i like the the idea of like kind of like being uh present in the in the uh ecosystem uh and uh i i think it will be interesting to see because there will be other uh teams also building on top of ave and also making pull requests into the core of the protocol and curious to see like what direction it will take and i the good thing about we're always listening to community in in that sense so so so uh there there usually haven't been like difficult times i i guess more when there's difficult times we have got a lot of respect in the sense that we build things and we we we don't disappear if if we fail with one thing or something doesn't work we just try to find a solution and i think people just trust us in in that sense that they want to give us support and and uh pushes forward and i i think uh end of the day like your your uh product is as strong as your uh community and your your in including users in within the community so so uh yeah i mean that's that's that's vital part of it did the community ever take a more like active role in in product development like how how did the communication between team and community go like while you guys were making this pivot from ethan to ave like what what um impact did the community have in actually making like design decisions or or you know meaningful and impactful choices did any of that happen yeah i remember like kind of like we we showed some designs and and we i mean when they were crappy we got like a lot of a lot of uh uh like negative feedback and we realized okay now we really need to like make some some better you act like and we understood like the importance of it because uh many of the community members they're not like always this kind of like a super defy super user type we do have them in our community and and and and uh but we also have uh community members who are just uh they might deposit once and and forget for a long time or they might just basically they support d5 but for some reason they don't want to use it at the moment and just want to follow that the action that is happening and and might be like a token holder but the holdings still in centralized exchange so the the feedback has been very very uh i mean community is is somehow you have this feedback loop and go back and forth and having this for many years is is amazing the feeling is just super nice because you know there's there's certain people there like if you if you publish uh some designs or like product updates you know you know there's there's there are people who have followed you and are like actively participating and that feeling is amazing so you you kind of trust that uh you you have you have uh you have audience and uh uh i i think it's it's we we never we try to not take it as a granted and and like appreciate like where we are uh and i i think we wouldn't be here without uh the the the whole uh token sale and and this this this kind of like a path to to roll a course coaster from from bull market to bear and back here uh i think this has kind of bring more strength in in our community hey guys we're gonna pause the interview with stani so we can talk about some of the bankless sponsors that make the bankless nation possible banklessnation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eath address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store ample forth is a new base money experiment on ethereum many people have heard of this new rebasing mechanism and ampliforth was the protocol to first introduce that into the ethereum space ample fourth is very comparable to bitcoin in the sense that it has a non-dilutive supply however there's one thing about it that's inverse with bitcoin whereas bitcoin has a completely inflexible supply meaning any demand for btc the asset is therefore reflected in the price and ample forth is the inverse of that where ample fourth is pegged to 2019 and any demand for the ample force token is reflected in the supply of the asset not the price of the asset so the ample fourth token tracks 2019 dollars slowly over time so it should never be too far away from 2019 and in order to achieve that goal it adds or burns ample forth token supply so that the market generally prices it around the value of a 2019 dollar it is definitely not a stable coin because the volatility of the value that you hold will fluctuate up and down wildly but the token itself is supposed to track a dollar pretty interesting experiment there's been a lot of spin-offs using this rebasing mechanism they also have this liquidity mining program where you can supply ample fourth and ether tokens to the uniswap pool and you'll be able to get an extra dividend of ample fourth tokens from the ample fourth geyser so check them out at ampleforth.org and see if this is an experiment you want to partake in all right guys let's get right back to the interview with stani so you mentioned the token sale uh did you guys have funding before that token sale from like venture capital no i mean it's it's quite difficult in the sense that we were building technology back in days that was very very novel in the sense that uh the ecosystem didn't exist and also uh me coming from finland small country which is like not not a vc playground and and and uh yeah being that age still studying uh i mean i could not see a a vc fund placing a bet on what we were doing back then you will need something more like kind of like a democratic way to raise funds and as we did the token sale i afterwards realized by analyzing that actually like uh if if this way of funding will not exist we will not be here i mean no way uh any like kind of like a i mean in that stage early any vcs will invested us in in those those kind of like uh circumstances i mean i we we knew that we could build things but betting on this kind of technology and ecosystem uh today it's easy i mean it's very easy to go and and and and and find a project and and and which does some solid stuff and just invest because there's a ecosystem there's like market and like cross interactions but i mean back then there's ether delta which wasn't even liquid and i mean not no not an easy scenario in that sense the lend token sale happened in november of 2017 and you guys from what i just looked up just now you guys raised a little bit shy of 18 million dollars which i mean as far as market caps and valuations go that is insanely low for what we know of today and so you're telling me that the 18 million dollars that you guys raised in november of 2017 plus i'm sure there were some ave tokens held by the team all of that raise was done in an ico and all of the funding that you guys took was done from the ico to people that were involved in the community at that time and to me i want to highlight something here because you know the ico is kind of synonymous with like you know the f word it's like a bad it's like a bad word now like the i like we always look back on the ico mania as like this time where a lot of retail got scammed you know people got burned but i think we forget that like the the bad side of the ico mania came out of like a very very good side of the ico mania like the the the most good for example i would say was like ethereum like the most fair ico of all time and then auger came not too long afterward and and ave i think we people should remember that like and and ave is a leading example of an ico that was fundamentally good that did its job in both at like giving funds to the team because they need that fund to build out the protocol but also using the token as a community shelling point a community coordination tool and so i just think as the ico model was done with a complete success with the ave team yeah and i think what's what's funny is that uh like i i see kind of like uh betting on the ava team is is it feels like betting or reliability so so we we kind of went the ups and downs and we're still here so so it's it's more certain in that way but uh yeah i i totally agree i mean uh lots of things happened and i i'm pretty sure that once this whole yield farming craze uh will end uh we will see like a lot of disappointments but also if you look at the venture capital award and and investments in general let's say uh you make 10 bets and nine will fail and one will be the jackpot uh yeah i mean there's even more kind of like uh similarities scenarios and investments in general but i really like the idea like i i still don't understand like why people aren't doing uh this so-called die-cast which is a combination of a dao and an ico uh token sale which which which is something that uh uh vitalik himself uh kind of suggested that that could be a a a model to try in the sense that you actually have a fair launch model where where uh you you basically sell the uh sell sell the governance power to the token holders and and that those funds are going into the dao and and they get instant governance in that sense and there's like incentives are so aligned and and we're now having this kind of like a fair launch model that we call uh when you give everything to the community with this uh farming but uh i think it's very unfair and i can i can later say why so standing to wrap up this this portion of the conversation when we had vance on uh on the podcast from framework he talked about how teams that were handing over the governance of the protocol off to the community were looking uh inherently looking for valuations that were far beyond like the traditional c corp valuations or the court the that you find on the stock market right and because these things because inherently these things are protocols they aren't companies and protocols just are bigger right and so when you guys were in 2017 2018 building out of a uh were you guys thinking along those lines or were you just kind of you know heads down building or what was the and what was the end goal for ave back in 2018 and 2019 yeah i think mostly we were uh heads down building but we we kind of tried to a bit of like uh think of like where the space is going and sometimes there were difficult times in the sense that we didn't see things moving uh in the space kind of like we we had a long narrative i mean there was a long time a narrative where uh like there's uh on a few d5 users and you know like we build a lot of stuff i mean because we were embracing how much there is developers building in d fly and so many cool things and just a couple of users and and this this kind of like a meme and now it's it's insane i mean this this kind of like a narrative was back in uh year and a half ago and now we're in completely different uh situation and it's it's interesting so one of the the the time times on those 2018 uh 19 like we had this kind of like periods that we we're not getting more users and like why why isn't this working as a ecosystem and like and we weren't like disappointed but we were thinking like what in a funny way that what we like didn't build or what what's left to build that we can actually get more people involved and funny like like what's really funny is that it's actually the incentives that drew everyone and the very first incentives were basically uh having stable coins and earning interest on them and that got a lot of attention i mean you saw interest rates from five to seven percent uh annually and then you compare it to the traditional finance where it's close to zero you it makes you wonder like wow uh this this uh this new word could be there could be some potential here i personally absolutely love the fact that the silicon valley vcs of the world and the wall street finance people totally missed ave i just love it because it's just like you know that's the story of of defy that's kind of the bankless story it's it's kind of the underdog right the anyone has access to these tools from anywhere in the world they don't have to be part of these established networks in order to succeed here what they have to do is build something that people want but it it still is i think an incredible story so um not that long ago we're talking six seven months ago uh stani ave had less than um a couple hundred thousand dollars locked inside of it um so it was tiny uh now fast forward to to now we've got like over a billion we've got like something like 1.4 1.6 billion locked in this protocol over the past seven months like that kind of growth is absolutely insane even by like silicon valley standards they don't see this sort of thing can we talk for a bit about why you think that growth has come so you mentioned incentives um is that the reason is it is also that you guys have just been like you know building so much and you're just building faster and innovating faster than every everyone else i guess my question is in the in the two years of the the bear market what the heck did you guys build to account for this seeming overnight success that we've seen in 2020 yeah i mean uh we we definitely didn't expect this kind of growth like our our our idea was very uh um i mean we always had an ambitious goal to to to uh achieve but it wasn't like uh we i wasn't expecting even the d5 space to grow so much honestly uh i i mean we were being happy if we had like five million locked value and that would be that would have been super awesome and then we will be thinking okay what what would be the next features we'll build but i i kind of felt somehow that we we put a lot of effort in the the actual protocol launch i mean we built it for quite a long time i think it took us almost a year to deploy and we put a lot of effort in in what we were building and and trying to perfectly analyze it in in having all these features like the a tokens that that accumulate in in user balances and having native flash loans and all the stuff that we we were uh implementing i mean it kind of paid off and i i guess one of the bigger things is that it's quite developer friendly protocol and it's it's very easy to build on top and we noticed that uh most of the liquidity comes from actually in transactions comes from different kinds of uh products that have been built on top for example we were when we launched in january we we got quite a lot of uh deposits and borrowings but uh no one actually was using flash loans and and and and that was actually interesting part of this kind of underdog story because our flashlight has a uh this kind of like a reward uh fee to the depositors so whenever there's a flashlight on particular block it means that it gives a this kind of like a spike in their yields depositors yields so let's say if there's a die flash lawn uh typically now today there can be even like a 14 million worth of die borrowed in a flash loan that gives a small spike in the um all the the depositors uh uh yields and that's that's pretty uh cool because it's it's arbitrary so so uh and what we noticed that uh kind of like the the silicon valley uh this perception was that actually you don't need to charge in the beginning you don't need fees and uh you know you're looking for market share and and for us it was like a bit of [ __ ] in the sense that i mean if you're building products you can you can you can have fees you can you can because you're building value in in that sense and when you're building value you can you can definitely charge and how we are doing in the in the protocol in in the future is is actually that the the the fees goes to the uh stakers and and and eventually to the token holders and and whatnot but kind of i think people were too shy on breaking things in a good way you know there's so many patterns not just in d5 but but in in product development and those people who are actually going in and breaking those barriers they're succeeding i mean uh that is the the innovation and and how we how how we we get further and we promoted the flash loans and and talked to different developers and showed them like how what kind of cool things you could do i i did a blog post on like seven different eight different use cases of flash loans and uh and then some of the actually developers listened to me and and kind of like they started to implement and i didn't even know about that and then what happened the black thursday came and we see you suddenly see this kind of a needle in the graph you know we have this kind of uh if you go to other watch you have this this uh graph of like the the uh usage and and we had this kind of huge needle that went up and that was basically flash loans and we were like whoa where is it coming from and there was a project called like defy server that allows you to liquidate your cdp before it goes to the liquidators and and you lose your kind of like the incentive uh to them and i mean this kind of things and and once people saw like the the what what kind of things you could do with flash loans it took forward of course there was a couple of flash and unrelated attacks that gave a lot of uh publicity to the the actual function uh but uh i don't know i mean being close to developers and and being part of that with them when you brainstorm adds a lot of value at it and and and helps others to actually use your product as well and for those that aren't aware this this flashlight mechanism that you're describing was uh you're pretty innovative right and i i think ave did you guys i don't know if you came up with the idea of flashlights but you certainly popularized it um and it's this idea and jump in here stani if you know if i don't recap it quite correctly but it's this idea of in a single block so in a just one short ethereum block space of time you can in an instant borrow some funds uh use those funds to accomplish some purpose in you know kind of the defy landscape and then um give give the funds back and you're charged a rate for that but it's a it's a the kind of thing that doesn't really exist in traditional finance um is that how you describe what a flash loan is and like who came up with this idea where'd you guys you know figure this out yeah i think it's it's kind of exactly i mean it's something that isn't in traditional finance in the same form uh and the flashlight itself i mean it it always existed in in the uh in in ethereum because of the atomicity how how the ethereum settles uh transactions but i've seen a lot of flashlight implementations before us i seen like uh i think even like multiple but i never saw like actual uh mainnet implementation utilization uh kind of like before us so i think what happened is that uh we we we just made it fashion and and somehow popularized it but definitely i've seen seen before implementations and i got a lot of code uh i used to go a lot of code more more than i do today but i used to go like representatives and search from different kinds of uh like what kind of projects people are building and and uh and and and i definitely saw a couple of uh uh implementations but didn't mind that much i think one of our developers uh emilio uh basically started to i mean he was very into uh this atomicity and and kind of came up with his own sort of implementation that we eventually uh used and still use and we we are coming with version two where we have again completely a bit different kinds of different kind of a uh flashlight implementation and i mean yeah it's it's it's one of those things that uh kind of like this this uh d fight thing defy existed for a few years nobody cared and now everyone is caring because of the incentive so i mean it's fascinating how how the the network effects work like they they come and when they come they come all together yeah i i guess another i guess way that ave was an underdog is it's actually it you know feels in a way almost like a second mover advantage uh type of product right so you know google certainly wasn't the first search engine ave wasn't the first lending and borrowing protocol to to do something in a kind of a peer-to-contract type way compound seemed to be first compound a silicon valley company you know if coming out of that the ac coming out of that whole zone it seemed like at the beginning of the year that kind of compound had this space covered completely but here you guys are and you've now surpassed compound in terms of total locked value is there something to that second mover advantage that you think accounts for your success yeah i mean it's always difficult to be the the kind of like a top dog i mean we were in in d5 polls uh in like uh for for a week and something as as the most value locked even the the metric is is a bit uh not suitable for for covering all the different kinds of uh financial protocols but uh i mean we felt bad in the sense that like it's not cool to be there i mean it's way cooler to be below and and kind of like uh compete with with the with the innovation and not not not worrying about like what's your kind of rank in in that sense and uh i i think for us like our goal was always to to build a product that everyone uses and i mean everyone that we have certain user base and and we're happy what we're doing and and uh i mean we're always competitive we love what others are doing in the space and and really admire everyone's work i mean the stuff people are building these days it's it's amazing there's some and technical even technical implementations uh there's there's good amount of talent now and i i i hope we get uh ev even more so i i guess like the the being an under dog is way better at least for us because we don't need to worry that much of a pressure but of course you get a bit of pressure when when you're getting closer to to someone that is that is above you and but it i mean i don't know it's it's fun competition and we work quite closely with everyone and and we try to be uh very approachable and and and kind of like be as as as uh collaborative as possible i i still think that the the the ifa ecosystem is like everyone uh works together in some way but we have like difficulties to reach upon coming up with standards best practices and and actually like uh embracing them even even though we have been already a while and i don't know it might be because everyone is is building heads down or or just kind of like we're still like looking too much on on tbl's and and and and kind of like competing a bit uh but i think that we will move forward from this space and interesting times will come so stanley what about the culture differences between a team like ave and a team like compound um where like ryan ryan alluded to compound is the silicon valley-esque a16z backed found startup that is a startup from a founder that has plenty of startup experience and where ave is like this team out of helsinki with a very grassroots organization very grassroots leadership grassroots community funded by an ico that and that that ico seeded that community in a way that compound never really compound earned their community to to not uh to give credit to where credit is due but the the genesis of compound came as a venture capital type of investment right and ave is just not it's just a little bit of the opposite and compound seems to kind of go along with this like very slow very meticulous never ever risk anything type of type of attitude where ave is much more move fast and experiment quickly uh definitely not alluding to move fast and break things if if any of the listeners just had that pop into their head um how do you credit like the culture differences between these two organizations to like the the differences in the resulting product yeah i mean like uh of course like i'm i'm from from finland myself but actually when we look at the the team it's quite uh like quite global and in the sense like i mean uh i mean we our headquarters is is is now uh in in london we have an office in in switzerland uh we have so many national nationalities i think there's like 23 employees in auburn and and most of them are developers that's why we ship ship quickly but uh uh what's what's interesting is that uh i think everyone has somewhat like a uh persona or media like social media presence and and and participates in different kinds of communities and i think that's very important for us i i can't speak much about like how uh compound is doing things of course like they they have their own way of doing stuff but uh we we really want to be uh very open uh and innovative how we do things and definitely like if we see an opportunity we want to take it and we want to take it as fast as we can and and kind of like experiment how things go and even in terms of like building it's very challenging to build uh protocols that are holding a lot of funds because it requires so much uh procedures and and effort in terms of uh security and and the way you develop the architecture and and all the the the after works that you need to do so in in that sense it's not easy but i guess it's also about how you build and and structure and architecture your your your offerings because you could always build products on top and i think that we have done done pretty well but i think important stuff for us is that we we don't want to be associated into one particular place i don't think uh we want to be european or we we we want to be like a a seeing more preferred in u.s we want to be this kind of like a global uh thing in a way that uh we have brand exposure in u.s europe and asia and and we we try to get like as wide demographic as possible and that is the key when you build something that is very decentralized and like autonomous protocols because you succeed if actually that protocol is used globally in different parts of the words and not just like used but like you have contributions that that people are like contributing and building and and helping out in in the community so so when we achieve that thing uh that's pretty important and i i personally like i i think this is coming into the the the space and it was a couple of years ago and it was like a this institutions are coming moment for for defy when we saw like vcs taking uh investments i think in one way that was really good because we a lot of good projects were were built uh now it's difficult to say when we are in this uh like a fair launch model uh give it straight to the community and and how this vc uh vc part will play but i i see like benefits in both of them and i i think uh the the the community members at least have decisions to make what kind of community they want to belong uh but definitely like uh our goal is to be as open community as possible and and and yeah i think maybe that's the the difference we want to be global so i wanted uh just to harp on this a little bit more the so ave has had their token out for since 2017 right since the ico since november and the ave like number of addresses that hold the ave token is over over a hundred thousand whereas comp and their brand new token has only been out for a few months and it did this fantastic job with kicking off this whole like concept of yield farming and liquidity mining as a fair distribution mechanism but as a coordination tool comp is just behind they just they are very recent they're very new and whereas ave's token as a coordination mechanism both as a coordination mechanism between the community and the team has been going on for years now do you attribute any success of to to ave's protocol as to this the establishment of the token much earlier than compounds yeah i think uh honestly mostly i think it just takes time to to to to actually like build uh this reliability of of of success and i i think like it boils down to the discussion like that we we we saw the ops we saw the down and we're still here we're building we're shipping so uh i think our community and and and uh in general uh people understand somehow that uh like we are we're serious on what we're doing and and we we keep building and and like that there there isn't like a this isn't like a trial or the this isn't something that we are uh trying to to to figure out like whether this works or not if we don't succeed in the first time we will we'll we'll kind of like we'll pivot and do something uh differently if it doesn't succeed that again we will just redo i mean we're not leaving anywhere on the opposite side like we we want to expand and we want to uh grow the the product offerings and improve our protocol and and and kind of like get get community involved as much as possible and i definitely agree that it takes time to to to to build things and uh and i i don't have like anything like uh bad to say about compound because i i really respect what they're doing and i i kind of i like to have them as a competitor or like a kind of like one part market participant in space because they're doing good job so it keeps me uh even more active to do even better job and and try at least try to do a better job and in in that sense uh and but in terms of like fair distribution models uh i i don't know like if you look at the yield farmings i don't see them that fair because like um this isn't ready to compound itself but it actually like what we see today for example where where we have this liquidity mining purely in the sense that uh you you you you generate the you print this token to the governance uh today to the liquidity providers who are were basically putting liquidity into whatever you're doing and then farming farming the token and and what happens is that uh it's kind of like a free money in in that sense so so liquidity providers come and the more you have uh money the more you're farming right so you're getting more tokens and then if you are smaller uh you have a smaller amount of funds and and you want to talk and you actually by farming it the same way you are not getting as much as governance power so you are kind of like forced to uh buy the token so you see other people are printing with large amounts of money and selling it to the uh to the smaller audience and i see it actually uh the opposite as unfair distribution model and i think it will will will not end well i mean uh i definitely like i've seen like very good models of of this liquidity mining or in in inflation incentives rewards uh whatever you name it for example synthetics which which was one of the earliest models and their system seems to work uh quite well but the stuff i see today is a bit uh bit kind of crazy yeah things are certainly getting a little crazy that's for sure and so you know one of the things i think is super underrated is actually going through a bear market um that's you know part of what distributes your token to the community and particularly to the holders the the true believers of that community bitcoiners have been saying this for a long time actually uh and i i think they're right you know bitcoin is the probably the most widely distributed probably ether after that both going through bear markets going through a bear market can be the best thing you can actually do counter-intuitively to build up uh build better distribution of your token and to build your community um i want to talk about me one last area of i think success or something that's unique about ave before we talk about road map and avonomics and everything cool you guys have in the pipeline and that's this it feels like you have an uncanny ability um your team navi protocol of building up these unique partnerships like these protocol partnerships like bringing other d5 tools and and d5 protocols together to build something cool so you know partner partnership with open law to create this unsecured lending almost like a credit primitive uh partnership with with realty you've got real world assets coming into ave um even maybe i want to talk about this the most because andre is uh somewhat from the wi-fi project we had in the podcast a few episodes ago uh wire and that is he is a becoming kind of a defy celebrity if you will and i feel like you know it's the case that you guys were working with or you were working with andre um you know many months ago on some of these projects like you saw the potential of the sorts of yield farming that he was doing and building and uh it feels like there's there's a partnership there as well can you can you talk about some of those partnerships and maybe focus on your partnership with some of these developers like andre yeah i mean in terms of like the different projects and like kind of like i i think one of the interesting success usually is that we we're trying to find a simple way to make things happen like when we when we discuss with different projects and we're trying to find something that we could do in common like to solve some efficiencies or provide value at it like uh they tend to become complex like that that was my like previous experience but now i i see that we are very good at like finding something very uh very easy and simple way of of uh executing and that's that is what has happened like with with the different projects and we're doing really cool stuff with with realty and and open law and and just like showing the potential like the the credit delegation uh i mean many missed kind of uh actually the the bigger value proposition so so definitely like the the open law uh and kind of like uh delegating your credit to someone you trust or or or uh someone you make a legal agreement that that just shows like how you can unlock liquidity from d5 but actually like what's what's the cool part is that uh for me who who kind of uh is is is very like a crypto native is that and and smart contract native is that you could delegate your credit into a smart contract and if you know the predefined functions that what that smart contract can and can't do uh you can assess the credit risk and say okay there is not much risk here because it just can uh borrow the funds uh deposit them into somewhere else and and and farm some token and and sell it and then after a period of time uh return the funds and if it's not returned i can myself call the function and the fonts will be returned and i get whatever proceeds there are and this is like credit delegation uh the actual potential like from one smart con from from the protocol from the depositors to to smart contracts and andre is an interesting individual i mean we have worked for for quite a while and and uh uh like we we always brainstorming things and and like what i like about andre is that uh uh we we build the things for abe and we build i mean uh common stuff and and also uh we help each other in terms of brainstorming uh i ideas and i mean it's also kind of like a a uh like a mental support for each other in terms of like things are going quite hectic in d5 and it's not not easy especially for andre because i mean uh he started to develop by himself now people are helping which is amazing uh but there's a lot of stress when you're building stuff on d5 the the i mean he made a post once about like how dumbing on d5 sucks and it really sucks in sense that uh people want to blame and point point fingers and and it's it's kind of like uh not always right but uh yeah i mean the the coolest part is about this relationship is that andre has bigger things like when you when you talk about ideas with someone like maybe this and that could be built like normally it never happens or you find only kind of like uh reasons not to build but usually with andre is kind of like uh he built it and i mean that's uh that's a cool thing to do and and there's like many of this kind of like developers that are shipping and some are like doing it in a different way and but uh i i really like what's happening in in in the whole ecosystem and i really love how like andre was using uh ave already in a way that was uh uh pretty cool before this this whole uh wi-fi uh phenomena and that was that was like really really amazing and i am really happy uh that he he he continued uh back in the days i mean has continued to build and yeah and i mean part of this relationship stuff with everyone it also requires that your team is very active in the sense that uh your developers are happy to help other developers who are not not in in let's say ave but are building something else helping them contributing to their projects for me it's very important that i can actually uh help someone to to to build a better product and whether they utilize avi or not because they're in the ecosystem and it's important especially security wise that everyone like kind of like gets the resources that they need because you can build the whole reputation and lose it quite quickly something goes wrong you know you almost get the sense with with uh you know teams like ave and uh developers like andre that they're not just building for their own products um they're building for the entire d5 ecosystem is that right yeah yeah yeah and i think we all are in the sense that uh and the the d5 is just one step like it's the step one you know and it's funny we started with with with d5 because uh talking about the the whole ethereum ecosystem because like it's just like finance makes sense to have financial backbone but then there's going to be cooler stuff there's going to be nfts collectibles uh tokenized different kinds of value and and and e-commerce on chain there's plenty of stuff once we realized that actually those barriers that we had in our in our minds actually are just uh restrictions for imagination when we get that on the side we we will unlock the real capital you know i mean if you can custody uh and and you can you can uh token as a dollar why can't you tokenize a a a a tv or or a uh playstation and or or a game and you know there's so many things you could actually do in the future and i'm bullish on on that side and default will be this backbone that will will help help fuel more fire in these different spaces that we will see in uh uh in ethereum so stani i want to turn to avenomics and i want to read a little expert excerpt from the avonomics introduction just a very first sentence the goal of the ave tokenomics through its incentives and policies is to create a shelling point where the protocol's growth sustainability and safety take priority over individual stakeholder objectives donnie can you kind of give us the too long didn't read on the i'm gonna redo that stanley can you give us a summary of avonomics and its uh ethos and role and importance of the future of the ave protocol totally totally and that that basically part of actually was was was uh uh jordan from our team uh who basically led the bit the the uh the the avonomics project in in abe uh uh came up with and i really like the the the quote and what's what's interesting about avenomics like we once we shipped the protocol in back in january like that was like the very second thing we started to focus on the very next day though so we we continued straight away uh to work with evernote we didn't rest at all and our goal was just to figure out like how like how we could actually uh benefit our token holders so we never thought about like token itself like it's just a commodity like a a token for for actually the how the the uh community can voice out but how they could actually like benefit from the protocol but also like uh contribute into it and we were thinking like what is the most important thing for a financial protocol like what's the most important thing and we're thinking that uh like if something goes down let's say if if there is some sort of like a shortfall event fair liquidation or security breach or whatnot uh that will be very devastating not not just for ave but the whole space uh and at some s to some extent we understood that the these protocols will scale especially if there's adoption i never knew that it will come more faster than i expected but we know that like what we're what we need to build in terms of like token economics has to also like underst uh taking into consideration the the stale scale that we can uh scale at some point but uh we started to think that we really need to somehow get people to contribute to securing the the protocol and in essence what the the um token it's it's basically migrated token from the land to ave uh uh that we have the migration coming up actually quite soon and the the idea is that uh when the token holders are making decisions they actually are making decisions on risk parameters and risk-based decisions so so what kind of collaterals could be added into the protocol what kind of markets could be created and risk parameters and on the return they're taking uh the risk transfer so so they're they're taking the risk of what they're deciding and because they're doing that they basically get uh rewards so so uh there's passive and active risk taking so the the active risk taking is when you are uh uh staking into the protocol uh you're staking your tokens and and uh what it means is that if there's some sort of like a shortfall event let's say failed equation or uh a buck or smarco jack hack what happens there is that uh 30 of the the staked amounts that you're risking and getting rewards so you're basically earning abe uh could be slash which basically means that they could be sold and the passive one is the version where uh if that stake doesn't cover uh and the loss is is more substantial then there is this maker style minting facility and then we added uh one additional function here is this built-in backstop module of stable coins that are placing auction bits and and buying that uh uh that uh those uh uh slashed or minted tokens and all of the reasoning why we came up besides like the the safety like why this type of uh mechanism there were certain events during this year like the the black thursday the the flashlight attacks the d-force uh hack and bcx hacks as well and what was interesting for us is actually to monitor like how was the aftermath handled and it proved some interesting parts like the maker model worked uh in in one way i mean they were able to to use their their token economics to to cover uh a deficit uh then there was the uh for that as well there was there was this group of uh individuals and and entities that went to this uh die backstop syndicate and that kind of like mimics our backstop module that is built in and yeah i mean the the idea is is kind of like focus on the safety but we we have uh liquidity uh provider rewards but they're not that substantial and the idea is that when you get those rewards by providing liquidity uh you're incentivized to bridge them into this taking facility and then uh your governance is kind of like in line towards making secure protocols so you don't want to have this kind of governance war where you have on on the on the one side you have you have uh people who want safety and other side you have people who want like higher yields and just for providing liquidity so it's actually like even there's a lot of functions the the in simplicity uh we just want to use uh the market capitalization of uh ave to to recapitalize the protocol when needed that simple that simple explanation of of my complex explanation so when i look at the ecosystem overview and for the listeners this will be in the show notes it's docs.avey.com avonomics where there's this fantastic just well a explanation just document of explanation but some also some really nice graphics which are really helpful to understanding how this ecosystem works and and stani when i look at this i see a lot of different protocols having their influence in these graphics right like i see components of synthetics and i see components of maker i see like the compound governance module in here can you talk about the influences that have helped guide the architecture of the avenomic system yeah i mean i i think for for in in terms of like uh the the kind of like uh having the the token as a way to to secure the protocol like we looked quite a lot into uh the the maker model when it comes to the the main thing uh the staking is more of like what we have in synthetics and this kind of like inflation we were balancing between actually inflation and and and and the the uh uh reserve model and and we we have active had active discussion in our uh community forums and and and it's actually quite interesting in terms of like even more what influenced us is is the ethereum itself so if you think about it like uh people in ethereum like they're not actually paying for transactions like you're not paying that your transaction is uh like saved you're actually paying uh for security in in in the sense that uh you're basically paying that the the transaction doesn't uh get somehow manipulated in in one sense and and in ethereum as well it has a flame inflation model and so we tend to kind of like look what's happening in d5 but a lot of good stuff has been built already on on the blockchain network level and and and ethereum was a very big inspiration and and then we had as snx uh synthetics very influential and and the maker model and and like we and we looked kind of like almost every major uh protocol how how their token economics were built and we tried to find like what's suitable for us uh for our community and what was the uh narrative and and also like we we look at compound when when combat came with uh also with the liquidity uh mining and we we just were following like how that develops and and uh yeah i mean it's a combination of uh everything that's out there and picking like the pieces that fits well in what we're trying to achieve and and uh somehow i think we we did uh quite a good job but also i noticed that we we spent six months like uh every day a lot of time in designing and uh like uh it's it's kind of uh funny that how long it takes to design token economics like it's not uh it's not that easy that that that i usually have been thinking about but it took a lot of time to design so i want to get into the backstop module a little bit more because i think that's one of the newest innovations that avonomics brings and so to add some context if you decide to purchase mkr for maker dow you are taking the risk of the en of the maker dow system because if a maker ever becomes under collateralized it needs to mint mkr to uh fulfill that need to fulfill that capital and so as an mkr holder you are therefore being diluted so by buying mkr you are buying access to the you brought you're buying exposure to the upside and you're also buying exposure to the risk now with the ave safety module in the backstop module there is a more explicit way to have more upside and more risk to ave separate from just holding the ave token in your wallet can you explain that differentiation and maybe just elaborate on the backstop module and how it distills risk away from one parts of the system and compartmentalizes it into another yeah definitely and actually uh big thanks to you as well uh david because i i read one of your post works explain it very well the uh the the maker model and and also uh some of the posts on on uh uh kind of like what what ethereum is in in uh i mean eater and i well what's uh what's interesting about this model is definitely like uh we want to uh make token holders to to feel that they're participating so many if you if you buy a token if it's bearing just passive risk uh it's it's it's less direct where whereas you actually uh take take that value and lock that value and and actually you are uh subscribing to a uh another risk level and that that also like is a risk transfer from from the passive holders to to the the uh to the active ones and also they get rewarded uh in in that sense so uh i i think like the it's a kind of like an interesting uh combination and uh of course like if the if this short bar is substantial that it doesn't cover the the state doesn't cover the the full amount then there is the the passive uh uh kind of like subscribing to the risk so uh definitely i i think like uh as a model this is more uh it has more ladders and i really like it because then you can decide to what kind of risk levels you want to uh subscribe into and uh it's interesting to see how it will play out i don't know if there is any similar economics actively being been for for a while but uh uh yeah i mean i i feel this is the right thing to do and and uh uh it's really i mean the good thing is that it's basically up to the governance to decide uh how to continue in the future and how to change uh token economics and that's the that's the cool part about decentralized protocols but uh so far so good feedback well one thing i'm particularly bullish on is the ability to give users choice right and that is definitely i think what one of the goals of avenomics is is giving the user the ability to choose their level of risk and that's definitely one thing that smart contracts really allow you to do if you harness their power correctly is to be able to you could there's no such thing as eliminating risk there's always risk but if you can control and harness that risk in a particular way that just means that the ave protocol is going to be able to scale to more and more users more and more capital more and more entities using ave and so a line from ryan is that safety makes d5 real world ready uh so when you were building the safety module in this backstop module were you thinking in the lines of just like scale and growth or were you just thinking in the lines of of doing what you need to do to lock down ave to be as secure as possible what was going through your head as you guys delivered the the backstop module yeah i mean for for us uh uh uh for us what was interesting in in the uh so so the backstop module is the actual uh kind of like a backstop for the uh slashed or minted uh of a tokens that that you you put stable coins and you can buy it but the actual like uh safety module is is the so there's two things but uh it's it's uh they kind of like uh compensate each other but in terms of like what we were uh thinking uh is that we we somehow need to uh provide some some sort of a value uh in case something happens and the the the problem that we were facing is that let's say if you have uh one or one billion locked value in in the protocol or or or more uh how what kind of ways we can have like to somehow insure this this amount and the token economics is a interesting way because uh you could incentivize people to to stake and and kind of like uh and use your market capitalization of of your uh community uh to who are actually making those risk decisions and putting skin on the game and and adjust the incentives in a way that uh if the protocol uh grows the incentives should actually grow as well to incentivize more staking and you get this kind of like a uh value loop and and the more the protocol grows uh the more actually uh you can adjust the incentives to uh more staking and i think that is something we we hope to achieve in a way i mean whether it will work or not it really uh is is something we need to see in practice but uh at least we know that we are able to incentivize uh our community to to provide this uh safety and and time will tell like how how it will play out so stani this safety module and many things we've been talking about that i mean that's just one piece of what you guys are releasing with what i think you're calling ave v2 like a whole version upgrade um i get when is ave v2 actually coming and is there any other additional thing you'd highlight i know it's shipping with so much and we're going to include a note to the roadmap in our show notes but when is it shipping and is there anything else that you'd want to highlight for folks yeah i mean version 2 we we started to work uh quite a while ago i mean uh it's it's it's based on the version one uh in in terms of like as a base layer but what we what what we worked quite a lot is on on the uh gas optimization and to get rid of uh all this like uh excess cost and we were able to reduce like uh uh how over half of the gas costs uh even more and it like we have a bunch of cool features but like this is so important to mention because like uh you can actually you can optimize quite a lot and and by uh designing things uh in a in a right way and organizing so so uh that is something that i think is important because it allows uh smaller deposits to be uh utilized and and and that is like because if you think about the gas uh high gas price is actually a barrier to finance so if you if you're spending in gas costs so similar amounts that you're you're earning interest it doesn't make sense to deposit and take the uh the the risk but uh besides that i think what's what's important that we deploy with a lot of interesting features so we're trying to help uh users to to switch their positions uh for example uh what you can do in in the ava version two you can swap your collateral so you can you can if you're deposited for example uh eat and you you want to and you borrow die and you want to for example to get exposure to land you can swap your collateral in in one click without returning your loan so you change your loan position and and it enables actually collateral trading so you can trade uh collateral at the same time that you have borrowed and we also have uh depth swap so you can swap uh your depth position so if you borrowed let's say die at five percent and you already spent that die or converted to to usd and and you and let's say usdc is is a few percent cheaper uh for some reason uh you could actually uh with one click uh swap your depth uh to to usdc so actually you're making depth uh currency swap and you're making also uh interest rate flop in the same uh transaction and you could perform all the other three even like the uh collateral swap as well and we're also having more trading functionality uh there's going to be ability to trade on margin um uh we improved uh the the the a tokens uh and and then uh i mean there's a lot of features i i just i think it's a long list that that's coming up but also like we improved quite a lot of debate structure as well and there's going to be some stuff that we haven't announced but also like we we are going to deploy as well which will be pretty cool things but uh something to leave a bit of in terms of excitement stani you had me hooked on the 50 gas reduction sir everything like that is definitely in these 400 way times that is definitely something we are looking forward to when sir when are we going to see some of this stuff quite soon actually quite soon [Laughter] excellent the sooner the better and at the pace you guys are shipping i think that um i'm interpreting soon to mean actually soon absolutely so very exciting i think for the bankless community um can we talk about that though really quick i mean we're talking about um 50 reduction right so in gas fees that's great that's fantastic it feels like all protocols are trying to do that sort of thing right now in this high eth gas price world you also talked about earlier about like you know there's some some competition sometimes between protocols but sometimes there's not as much coordination as you'd like to see we were talking to kane from synthetics recently about this um why isn't there a court or maybe there's something i'm we're not aware of but is there a coordinated effort from d5 protocols to work on some kind of a layer two solution it seems like optimistic roll ups are uh sort of the the preferred solution um if everything we're hearing and reading about them are are true is there some kind of a defy roll-up that defy protocols can coordinate on and to start building together any initiatives like that that could help solve this problem yeah i mean uh i definitely agree that the there there is like collaborations but there isn't like actual like wider collaboration like uh and and and somehow if there will be like i i feel that there's like a bit of like clicking in the sense uh you might have projects in in silicon valley that are close together and and and then you have uh other projects and that are somehow inconnected together uh and and and somehow like what i saw in previously indeed like happen is that like some some projects were working very closely together and and uh like and and trying to take the ownership of dfi and that's something you can't do i mean it belongs to everyone every project that is in the space and and uh every user and and so forth so so uh maybe that is one of the kind of like issues that we we we are a bit selfish in that sense and need to coordinate a bit more and of course everyone has like uh are busy and focusing on their own communities and also like uh trying to build stuff and but i i think we'll see some effort i i think like i i truly believe optimism is quite interesting uh star queries is some some quite quite cool and matic as well matic has some gaming activity and abigachi a uh ave ecosystem project that that is uh launching this kind of like uh funky cool uh nft project uh where you unlock uh this avogadro nfts by by uh saving on on ave so that's that's pretty pretty fun and so they're they're looking into matic and i am seeing a lot of effort and coordination it usually happens in a way that if if the default community sees some success then everyone else follows and these multiple reasons i i guess it's it's it's a bit of like also on coordination like what could be uh the perfect solution and also like many of them for example i have a issue in the sense that i'm very good friends with with many of these layer two solutions and and and it's very hard to promise to everyone like uh we would deploy here and there and like and you know like you're trying to please everyone at the same time and be very very like friendly and uh i don't know i would say like when we see more tools that are able allows you to let's say to uh transfer your fonts from one layer to to another layer two like we we come more closer together even this this this layer two solutions themselves but i but i think now i've seen couple of initiatives where uh projects have come together and and tried to make an ecosystem and i think this will grow and once there's just you just just couple of projects or a few projects doing this like rest will follow indeed you know that some of the d5 talk uh founders that we've talked to recently like antonio from dydx they're developing something on starkwear which you mentioned a cane had an interesting approach from from synthetics where we kind of talked about ethereum mainnet being like manhattan and it's overcrowded and busy and it's expensive and he said you know what i'm going to go do and synthetics is going to go do is go build a brooklyn go build an uh you know an ovm roll up and make that really nice get kind of the tooling set up for d5 and then hopefully other d5 protocols will will come move to brooklyn is that kind of the approach that that you're thinking will happen it'll be a few pioneering d5 projects to kind of build it out for everyone else and once they find some success then everyone will sort of you know move over and coordinate that way yeah definitely and i kind of like find similarities like uh we have a like in in london uh all the like financial action and all the traffic and everything is is in in the city you know that's the financial center all the jobs are there but then we have uh we have shortage which is basically where the tech industry is and it used to be rough area but now you see more and more startups there and it's getting like better in the ecosystem and grown there and even facebook and google have offices there so i definitely like this is exactly what like uh i feel that actually you don't need to be in the very busiest place and that the most busiest place might have certain type of transactions which requires a lot of security but then when you want to innovate and and and you you could actually go uh uh you know a couple of steps uh on the side and build there and and have this kind of like a clusters so i definitely love what uh kane is is visioning so you guys just announced that you guys got a electronic money institution license from the uk financial conduct authority uh so i don't know personally as a member of a citizen of the us what that means can you kind of explain the significance of this license yeah i mean the the the other protocol itself it's it's decentralized uh autonomously running in in the uh on ethereum network uh but one thing we noticed that actually like many people don't have access to this network and and how like the steps to take and access uh into to our protocol on or our like our ecosystem or define general uh there's still many steps they're not that many as as there used to be but still like i think it's not as much as available as it should be so what we decided to do and we actually started this work couple of years ago in 2018 uh when when when everyone else were fleeing out of the the the the space uh is is that we we wanted to actually uh kind of ensure that once we built this this protocols that actually there's access points and and one of the access points we we wanted to have actually uh was was uh our user interface as well like you can access uh the other protocol from uh i think there's like uh uh 50 different ways in wallets i mean my eat your wallet you can access and deposit and borrow and so forth and and there's a bunch of cool uh ways to access and we wanted to ensure that uh we could widen the demographic that that is using using the device so we so we went and applied uh last year uh we we put our application in and and we got our electronic money license uh uh last month and and the idea there is what it means that this entity that we have in uk that is practically responsible of integrations and and so forth uh can actually uh build a a gateway uh for users to to have a a payments account where they can convert uh national currencies into two stable coins and then they can decide what to do with those uh stable coins and for us the most important thing is that they could actually then dive into this defy word so it's kind of like this idea of that protocols are the ocean like uh they're self-regulated and so forth but then we have this kind of like a ports that where we're dealing with uh the local currencies and and so forth uh we we have their regulation and that is something that uh we want to test out how it will work will it bring new users uh and will bring a new ad option and and i'm really eager to see how things will move on that front yeah it's super exciting i mean it's something we talk about where there's like this bridge from the traditional old fi system right the fiat world and this new defy system and generally the uh like the the the groups that have kind of bridged that gap between these two worlds have been crypto banks have been exchanges like the coin bases or the binances of the world the gemini's of the world and god bless them but wouldn't it be great to have a direct point of entry and port of entry and a direct bridge uh from the fiat traditional banking system into a d5 protocol that seems to be essentially what this new license is unlocking for ave yeah it's super exciting particularly when we get into like you know layer two stuff too and we can operate with the the speed of of centralized crypto exchanges as well yeah and i mean it's it's the very same license that coinbase is operating in in europe so i'm it's really exciting like uh how how it will uh help like adoption in the future i i'm really like i want new users like i i want people who never use d5 to actually use and and that is that is something that is close to my heart all right so uh you know we usually at this stage we're the bull markets donnie so we usually ask about you know bull market price predictions because price predictions are always fun but you know what i'm going to ask is actually number of user predictions uh and maybe amount of capital predictions locked up so how soon we've got d5's got about maybe 200 000 users right now for being generous how soon until we hit 10 million how soon until we hit 100 million and how soon this is something that uh vance from framework said uh he he thinks that there's the potential that we could get 500 billion in total locked value and defy uh in the next uh you know in this cycle um do you think that is possible so give me user estimates uh and then give me um total locked value and d5 estimates if you will yeah i i think we could easily have by end of the year they could be definitely like a a a a uh it's hard to estimate i i usually get them wrong [Laughter] yeah everyone gets them wrong so so so let's be let's be optimistic i think we'll have 1 million d5 users by end of this year and we will have um let's let's think of something very realistic we have 100 uh billion locked value by end of this year so yeah either of them i might be writer or both wrong i mean i'm really bad at predictions well in the past uh it sounds like when you were hoping you know to the end of 2020 you'd have 5 million locked and now you've got 1.6 billion locked uh if anything you've been underestimating it so far so we will see those are bullish predictions but um you know yeah if you can go ahead and be as incorrect by an equal order of magnitude i'll i'll be down [Laughter] it's definitely very exciting uh stani thanks thanks so much i guess last question for you is what can the bankless nation do to to help ave today i think the most easiest way is to experience like uh how how i mean just experience the the the possibility of having uh permission the permission less permission permissionless global savings account uh by just holding a tokens so getting bunch of a tokens let's say a die ausdc and and holding in the wallet and seeing that balance grow uh without any any transactions to to see it update uh that is that is fascinating and what i really love and and hope to see is that uh everyone spreads forward on what what dfi is someone who you you might know might not know i mean tell about your tell to your friends family uh and and and and what is the fly and like why you what what do you see the value in and that is something which brings more people here and and the adoption it's it's it comes in a way that we we kind of share it to others and and and use a a tokens a die as an example show how how the thing works and and and get people excited i mean that is something that you could help the whole ecosystem and and and also help ava fantastic well you heard stani bankless nation he wants you to tell your friends about bank list tell your friends about d5 tell your friends about ave this this a token which is essentially a programmable savings account uh that you could just hold without a bank all banklessly fantastic stuff stani thank you so much for joining us today on the podcast it's been a pleasure awesome awesome to ha to be here and uh thank you so much uh david and ryan cheers all right guys action items a few things for you today the first is we've written up a delegated credit explainer you heard stani reference it during our conversation we've written that up at bankless we'll include that in the show notes also second action item is read about avonomics in the ave roadmap we will include some links in the show notes stani also mentioned an article that uh someone inspired their tokenomics that david wrote will include that in the show notes as well lastly david did you see we passed 100 stars sir on apple itunes i just i just noticed that in the past week or two so we hit our goal what's our next goal next next goal is 500. uh we i think you ryan told me you got an email saying that we broke the top 100 podcasts in the investing and finance category and again it's just at the beginning of the bull market and i i think it's with well within reason that as this bull market continues you can see bankless in the top 10 of the investing and finance podcast space that's my personal goal i want to do my best to get uh to get bank list there and so i've gone and given my uh my own podcast a five star review and you should too so by the time 2021 rolls around by the time there's 500 billion locked in defy bankless is the top of the itunes charts and we are on boarding people into the bankless world as fast as possible and you can help in that effort by giving us a five star review wherever you listen to podcasts all right let's do it guys uh finally risks and disclaimers of course we always end with this eath is risky ave protocol is risky crypto is risky in general this is not financial advice you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music] you
