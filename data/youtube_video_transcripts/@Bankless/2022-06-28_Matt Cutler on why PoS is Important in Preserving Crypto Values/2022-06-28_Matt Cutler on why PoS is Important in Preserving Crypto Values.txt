why is proof of stake an important component in preserving the values that we want to preserve in the crypto ecosystem fundamentally the basis of ethereum is a decentralized smart contract platform and so this core theme of decentralization where basically anyone can participate in securing the network is really quite critical however as you embrace smart contracts all sorts of additional overhead comes into play it's harder to reach consensus it's harder to do execution there's a lot of computation requirements there's a lot of data storage requirements and sort of the shortcut here is just say well you need a larger and larger computers to be part of the network this has a fundamentally centralizing force because it pretty quickly gets out of the domain of your average consumer with the average laptop and so what the transition of proof-of-stake does is its preservation of decentralization through modularity and the net result is a much more capable network that still has a very low threshold for participation where basically any consumer with any consumer-grade laptop can participate
