sign in with ethereum it was this like I go to an app and instead of just connecting my wallet I actually sign in with ethereum then the app gets some sort of data about me the sign with ethereum Center first how do you prevent big log how do you go away from large login providers where if you were using a Google account to sign in with things and Google ever decided to pull the rug on you you wouldn't just lose access to Google services you'd also lose access to everything you signed in with Google too so every time you hit that sign with Google button even if it's a total third-party service you lose access to that Google account you just lost your identifier the thing you're using to tell that app who you are and the sign with ethereum case these are Keys you control and these neogram accounts only you control to get into these apps and services
