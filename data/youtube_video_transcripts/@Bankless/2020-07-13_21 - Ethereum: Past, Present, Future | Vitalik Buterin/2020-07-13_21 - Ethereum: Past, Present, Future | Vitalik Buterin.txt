[Music] welcome to banquets where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we've been waiting a long time for this episode it seems like well 20 episodes i suppose we've been waiting because this is episode 21. we have vitalik buterin on the show what did you think about this so banklessness is a journey right so it's a journey that we're all going on together and i i feel like the last 20 episodes were really our collective prep work for what we wanted to ask vitalik uh and so we kind of bucketed this conversation into a couple different camps we talked about ethereum past present future ether the assets and then and then we had a pretty fun uh rollups round at the very end but really what collectively we were trying to get at uh and we asked him directly this question which i enjoyed his answer and i'll leave that teaser there but really what we're trying to get at is like what are these systems uh collectively like what when we have like the bankless nation and we have the ethereum blockchain and we have defy and then we have the community we ask questions around all these different topics and so it's really a conversation that hits the different points of what these systems are from different angles and so that's what i really enjoyed about this conversation with vitalik you know he asked a question at the very beginning and we didn't get a chance to uh answer his question in the podcast but i i'd love your answer now david so his question was would ethereum be okay now if i left it wasn't the case probably you know four years ago but would it be okay now if i left i being vitalik what's your take on that yeah so ethereum's still in like beta right that i think that's the right way to view ethereum1.x even though we are doing just a massive amount of economic activity and people's lives are being changed uh with ethereum one we're still in beta and you know i people criticize me whenever i say this on like pov crypto pod or elsewhere but like i trust vitalik like i trust him he seems like a trustworthy guy and so while these systems are supposed to be leaderless in this current ethereum 1x uh version the beta version of ethereum where we have this guy who is is obviously intelligent and obviously has the best interest of ethereum at heart and is pragmatic in the way that it is both good and bad for the world i'm glad that vitalik is here and so while if if vitalik left now i think ethereum would carry itself into the future perpetually it would be slower and it and having that leader that where we can rally behind i i think is still valuable in the present version of ethereum now i also hope that changes uh and and i and i think vitalik hopes to that it has already changed but i hope it changes and complete kind of completely finalizes a an independence from any one uh single person when ethereum 2.0 is rolled around and completely matured you know what it reminds me of is maybe this is because i just watch hamilton but it reminds me of like george washington right kind of the the general that led the early republic in the beginning uh and took a first term as president but then uh stepped away and some people wanted to make him a king but he stepped away and let the republic govern himself i think that's what vitalik is doing in a way is he's gradually been sort of stepping aside and letting other leaders letting the community kind of fill the gaps of his leadership and that's been on a steady trend since you know 2015. eventually i think he'll just step away from this entire thing like you i think he's he's sort of a george washington character and that he's not here to set himself up as king of anything uh he wants to see the success of the ethereum nation uh and the republic uh essentially um and you know i think it would be in a much better place if he stepped away now than it would have been previously but it's his leadership is still uh super useful now as george washington's was in in the early days of the united states of america yeah and he also has other interests too right like he doesn't only work on ethereum and i think there's there's been a more and more emphasis that vitalik has started to to expand his interest into other realms we didn't really get into that that on this episode but if you follow vitalik he's an avid member of the radical markets movement uh and there is obvious intersection there between ethereum and the radical markets community but it's also separate uh and so yeah i think when ethereum 2.0 rolls around like he'll still be present but i i think he would largely his interests have largely would have moved on to perhaps building something on top of ethereum but not ethereum itself yeah absolutely and i think this was a key time to get vitalik on the bankless podcast too because it's going to be ethereum's fifth birthday on july 30th so this is five years so you talked about ethereum being in beta you know in human years ethereum is just a toddler like it's just learned to walk and now it's getting ready for some preschool but it doesn't know a lot and it certainly hasn't grown into what it is going to be as an adult so you know i think you'll find in this conversation that vitalik realizes that and a lot of his conversations were about a lot of the conversation was about how ethereum grew up what its values are what the future looks like it's really a fantastic mind that we're speaking to and it was a fantastic conversation so we hope you enjoy it now before we begin we want to talk about our sponsors as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent-seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on-ramp directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today so the biggest thing that's holding crypto back is actually getting fiat into the system moving from that old world to the new crypto world what you have to do is create an account with an exchange you have to wire funds that's also holding your app back if you are a d5 developer and are building something on a network like ethereum what that means is in the fiat process your users drop off when they're signing up and you're limiting your market to the hardcore crypto people but what if you could make it super easy to on ramp to your application using a fiat on-ramp ramp is that it is a delightfully easy a fiat on-ramp it lets first-time crypto users get eath and die usdc whatever asset they want in five minutes or less so this reduces the dropout rate and lets you build products for the real world xerion is using it ethereum is using it taurus is using it d5 apps that you probably know and use today are using it what you need to do is check this out and visit ramp.network to see how easy it is you can get set up in 10 minutes or less and 100x your addressable market size as a develop this is like the ultimate growth hack and when you mention bankless they'll on ramp the first 100k in us dollars for free so go to ramp dot network mention bankless and get started all right let's go ahead and get right into the episode with vitalik buterin we are incredibly excited to have our next guest who needs no introduction we've got vitalik on the bankless podcast today vitalik it's almost ethereum's fifth birthday how are you feeling about things how are you feeling about ethereum i feel like it's come really far and i feel like uh the ethereum of uh 2020 is much more mature and kind of much bigger and very different um in just so many ways from ethereum as it was even two years from now let alone what it was back in 2015 when the project first launched like uh what ethereum was just uh first starting and the project is maybe less than one year old and you know there was the ethereum core team there were the ethereum developers um ethereum research was largely myself of vlad and gav wood and there were things happening but and there were fewer things happening and and you could tell there were fewer things happening uh just by looking at the kinds of things that we would get excited about like uh just microsoft announcing that they were doing things relating to the ethereum ecosystem was just so amazing to hear for the first time and now that's the sort of thing that we just hear every single month um from the technology point of view i think just a huge number of things have come uh so far uh so like for example on the research side um you know maybe five years ago uh research felt like a very open field in a lot of ways where we just didn't really know where a lot of the paths that we were taking would lead and what other paths exist but uh in 2020 like it's definitely not close to complete but it feels like a lot of the territory has been explored and it feels like we kind of have the map roughly laid down um so one example of this is in proof of stake for example like we figured out how to combine together the benefits of chain-based proof-of-stake with uh and more traditional proof of stake based on pbft like algorithms with the two-thirds thresholds uh we figured out how us how to do a cpc casper we've figured out a lot of the economics around like things like weak subjectivity things like how to optimize a lot of the economic incentives um results in terms of what we can and what we can't do on the layer two side we kind of understand how state channels work we understand how plasma works and we understand how roll-ups work and we kind of have an understanding that those are basically the only three categories that can exist um which is kind of amazing um and we have an understanding of you know what are the precise properties of each category what are the limits of each category um on the development side and you know eth 2.0 is no longer just a kind of thoughts that keep on getting renewed every three months it's a code that's been implemented and that has an active test net at least for the proof of stake side that i actually think is the bulk of the complexity um on the layer 2 side you know it's not just ideas we actually have loop ring and we actually have zk sync and we have omg plasma that's i think on a test that and going to go live very soon could be could be wrong i forget the details but definitely kind of uh done it did an excellent job of rising from the grief after it seems like a lot of people are going to forgot about it for some time um there's uh on the optimistic roll-up side things coming out soon privacy is much better zeke's darker research has just come forward with leaps and bounds um and the ethereum community has done i think a great job of uh kind of cooperating with the and zero knowledge proof and academic cryptography space on that regard and you know now we have the pre-compiles that we've had since byzantium for the last couple of years we have actual running privacy preserving applications like tornado cache for example and things like aztec um just uh the theory around how to make uh snarks and starks i had just made a huge kind of hockey stick like leap forward some somewhere in the fall of last year when things like blank and polynomial commitments uh kind of base systems started to come out so feels like technologically it's been making huge progress on every point in terms of the community and i feel like uh is far more kind of independent of myself for example than it was five years ago like i mean i'd be interested to hear kind of your opinion of like you know how much would ethereum have suffered had i disappeared five years ago versus like if i were to disappear today um or even two years ago also the ethiopian ecosystem has gotten much more independent of even the ethereum foundation so now we have a lot of these other kind of very established companies that are building clients building applications uh just building and doing a lot of things uh there's a lot more kind of independent voices in the community and even like projects like ether one good example of this so lots of progress on all fronts like i i feel no longer worried that ethereum is no longer going to be around a year from now you know you also vitalik sound uh pretty bullish pretty optimistic about things in your answer uh we and has that always been the case have you always been just as optimistic as you are right now i i feel like uh there's definitely been times historically when i was much more worried um i was much more worried in um definitely the first half of 2014 when it was not even clear when the sale would happen i was much more worried um pretty much uh through the first half of 2015 when the test nets were taking a really long time and uh you know i was i remember through april may and the first part of june i was kind of sitting in china and visiting the chinese community for quite quite some time and people were just wondering you know hey okay ethereum's cool but when's the thing actually going to be released once the thing actually going to be released and then of course it got released um but then through the second half of 2015 and i was really worried because uh i was uh just concerned the ethereum foundation would run out of money before it wouldn't be able to actually finish anything uh interesting uh throughout 2016 and um the dow fork definitely scared me a lot uh so end of 2016 the dos wars um scared me a lot uh i mean the price kind of dropping down to like six or seven dollars briefly uh scared me to some extent as well and there was definitely a time there when it felt like ethereum you know might just get forgotten um so i've definitely felt scared a lot but i feel considerably more confident than i did at pretty much any point in ethereum's history so vitalik that was an insanely holistic sit rep of the ethereum ecosystem uh at now and we kind of want to go in this past present future path in this podcast so starting with uh you know the past back to 2014 2015 how has the current state of ethereum lined up with what you uh could imagine it to be back then like when you were writing the white paper before the genesis block was mined what did you think ethereum would produce for the world and how much or how little has that lined up with reality well it depends on when right because uh at the beginning of 2014 and end of 2013 the vision for ethereum was definitely kind of very broad and there wasn't like a very specific set of things that i definitely wanted to have happen and it was jumping around a lot and you know at the end of 2013 i was talking about dios and i wrote that three-part series about dios in the bitcoin magazine then the idea for ethereum itself kind of originally evolved from basically a set of patches to mastercoin which was a protocol for the thing that in 2020 the cool kids called defy so it was the focuses definitely ended up changing and there was also some time when i was really excited about like decentralized dropbox type protocols um and then you know naming systems stable coins and so the visions definitely are kind of jumped around a lot but it feels like most or all of the things that i was excited about happening on ethereum six or seven years ago actually ended up happening or at least being tried to some extent so vitalik there's this meme about um ethereum being kind of a world computer and um critics of ethereum will say look it's not a world computer it doesn't do storage it doesn't you know it's not fast enough to be a world computer can you talk about the world computer narrative like uh was that the right narrative for ethereum you know or like what's your take on that so i think a lot of people misinterpreted what the phrase world computer was supposed to mean like the intended meaning was not a computer powerful enough for the world's needs the meaning was a computer that the entire world has immediate access to um and the intention was that uh you know for applications where the entire world needs to see the process and see the outcome you would do it on the world computer but there would be lots of things that do not have that requirement and so you would do them on all of the other computers that exist today now obviously a lot of people didn't interpret it that way and i think it's very reasonable to argue that if you create a meme and that meme gets misinterpreted to hell by everyone then that meme was a bad meme so that's totally fair criticism do you think there's something do you think there's something to the meme of ethereum being a world settlement computer at least or some kind of a you know world coordination system or you know a public good for property rights maybe so one of my uh kind of causes for a bit of a hesitation around uh some of those kind of finance oriented terms whether it's like settlements or even property rights is that there's a lot of non-financial use cases of the ethereum blockchain um so and even ens for example and you could argue that you know the transfer of an ens name is technically a kind of settlement but generally people in the domain name space don't really use that term like that term is more specifically a finance thing uh and there's applications around you know account management and like a reputation and like certificate registries and all of those things that don't even have to to do with property rights at all and i want to kind of preserve you know the idea that ethereum is a platform for all of those things too so i feel like kind of designing the narrative of like what ethereum fundamentally is as being like entirely around finance good kind of risks marginalizing those other use cases and world computer and one of the reasons why a lot of us liked it is definitely that it's kind of much more accommodating of those things but then i guess you could argue that it kind of runs into the opposite flaw which is that it underemphasizes the financial use cases and it's not clear how you know a computer is uh relevant to kind of creating the next world economy so i don't know i did i think uh you know ethereum's narrative is ultimately parolus and there's no single slogan that does an excellent job of capturing what it's about so i would like to make the argument that while there are plenty of non-financial use cases of ethereum those non-financial use cases still are like financial adjacent right so like in ens the in the name name space system on ethereum really is just allowing or could just be viewed as a system that allows for finance to just go better right like send me die to davidhoffman.eth right that's just way easier and any ethereum that uses a system as like a land registry still using ethereum as like a value settlement systems right and so i i would still present the argument that the l1 chain is still going to be like the financial layer and perhaps the the the less dense the less weighty economic transactions are are kind of pushed off to the l2 uh does that resonate with you or do you see it differently [Music] i guess there's definitely a lot of use cases that are financial adjacent and then i would say there's legitimate use cases that are kind of far enough from finance that it's more reasonable to call them not finance than it is to call them finance um i mean even just one example of this that i sometimes talk about is like i talk about a lot about like accounts with social recovery for example right and how i think that a lot more people should be using like smart contract wallets with social recovery as a way of storing their crypto and i actually think that this is a use case that could apply not just to holding cryptocurrency but also potential even as your kind of primary identity that you use to sign into websites right like i want people to have smart contract wallets that they use to log into like even the centralized web platforms that are going to continue to exist and i've been kind of increasingly bullish on this use case recently just because i've kind of learned more and more that the existing centralized and of access control and access recovery mechanisms are actually surprisingly terrible like you know you think that oh there's a company in charge and so there's people that can help you kind of solve your problems if anything a bad ends up happening but i just know so many people that have problems with you know google accounts or twitter accounts or whatever else and the process of getting those accounts back is just a nightmare and sometimes they end up not succeeding at all and so if instead of having a single company control your identity then you know your identity would be a smart contract and that smart contract would have rules that say you know here are the five people that can uh kind of recover your account and then you use whatever cryptographic key that is stored in a smart contract to sign into things that you have the ability to change your cryptographic key inside the smart contract um so that's a kind of use case which seems pretty far from finance if you think about it that way um now i definitely do think that especially now those use cases are in the minority um and in the short term future those use cases are going to continue being in the minority and a big part of that is basically just uh because uh the transaction fees are high and when transaction fees are high finance is the only thing that's still willing to pay them but in the long run you know especially after we have things like roll ups or sharding that or roll ups and sharding even that equation could change so we'll see on the topic of identity do you think ethereum will make progress on that or crypto writ large on getting good even decentralized identity into these cryptosystems so what people call identity i tends to try to split up into three separate problems right so the first problem is account access control so basically if i right now declare that you know i am vitalik um and i create some a kind of ethereum account or name or whatever that represents this identity then i just want to have the ability that i in the future will continue to be identified by a theory whatever systems i interact with as b and metallic right and if i choose to call myself red then i'll keep being identified as fred if i uh identify as a three-legged toad then you know the system would still kind of continue to say that i'm a three-legged toad right so the point is not about uh kind of who you are in some real world sense it's about kind of persistence of identity basically that the the actor that performs one action is the same as the actor that performed these other actions and that's basically the something i'm very bullish about smart contract while it's really improving on the second identity problem is what i call the unique human problem right so basically just proving that some particular account represents a unique human so it represents a human and not a robot and one human can get only one of them um or at least it's hard for a human to get a lot of these identities and this sort of thing is really important in applications like bitcoin quadratic voting for example it's important in like basically any voting system it could also be useful as a form of you know anti-sybil and spam prevention and there's a bunch of projects that are doing this and i think bright id is interesting for example and then i know there's also all the centralized alternatives so it feels like a bitcoin is turning into a platform that will just be forced to experiment with a lot of these things which is really interesting and then the third aspect of identity is basically proving or attesting to claims about other identities and them being able to prove that some attestation has been made right so i wants to prove that i am recognized by the government of canada as being a citizen i want to prove that according to this entity i have some particular age or that according to this um university i graduated from them and things like that right and those use cases are inherently centralized to some extent so there's a limit to how much you can decentralize them but you definitely can use blockchains as a kind of base layer for basically kind of managing these identities and figuring out what all the different cryptographic keys are and creating infrastructure to do things like zero knowledge attestations for example so i think there's definitely room for blockchains to help in a lot of those areas too it'll take time so when the hopefully the ethereum blockchain but some blockchain solves this the problem of identity right and we start to have like a social recovery system or simply contracts that represent people it really that just seems like the basal layer right like the the very first building block for what hopefully becomes a larger social graph right so you know the way the way society works the way we work as members of a community is that we have like we are nodes and then we have our connections to our family members our friends our business partners like people that we trust and then that as a web spans out and and ultimately reaches the whole world right except it's not really defined it's very loosely defined it's it's it's not really uh instantiated anywhere and so it's uh what i'm what i'm i think you are trying to to illustrate is that perhaps one day this the actual relationships of people is somewhat like codified or instantiated in the ethereum blockchain and me and me and ryan here we talk a lot about like the bankless nation like an online digital uh nation digital civilization that is independent from any nation state and it seems like solving the identity on on a blockchain system will allow us to have these social representations inside of this digital nation this one single global platform is that is that is that kind of where we are going with this whole identity thing on ethereum that's definitely kind of one of the worlds i'm looking forward to trying to see if we can create and then how much how much progress do we need to make to get there how far off is this problem i mean quite a bit i think it is something that has to be kind of approached incrementally and the challenge is that it has to be approached kind of incrementally in this way where every individual step that we take is in itself useful so that people are willing to take the step like people aren't gonna be willing to you know just sign up for ideas because they're excited about getting ideas and people aren't going to be willing to provide information about some social graph because they're excited about webs of trust like you'll get a few people but you're not going to get enough of a network effect whereas if you're tying the whole thing into even just something like bitcoin grants being one example or into some other system where you can get concrete benefits for participating then you know that could actually be used to bootstrap the ecosystem and once the ecosystem has been bootstrapped you can try to kind of take it further into doing other things with it so vitalik we we talked about the past and that sort of bled into an interesting conversation about uh identity um i want to talk about the the present of ethereum right now so five years old it's 2020. um one of the big use cases of course is this defy thing that's always been present uh since kind of the the beginning the white paper there were d5 type use cases that we didn't call it d5 back then then now we have a meme what's your take on defy do you like it do you hate it um some of both and i think uh there's definitely a lot of d5 applications that are just really valuable and essential like i would consider stable coins and especially if crypto economic stable coins so things like die and now there's ryan some other ones coming up um as being like d5 and being really valuable um i would say decentralized exchanges una swap has also been extremely valuable um and i hope that we can see synthetic assets representing things other than dollars um you know major stock indices a couple of other fiat currencies would be really nice to have prediction markets are technically defined and it would be really nice to see prediction markets get more widely used and there's definitely also a side to d5 that feels like it sometimes kind of gets into more speculation than than value and more kind of short-term than long-term uh so like for example the recent uh yield farming craze right where as i understand the yields reached uh over a hundred percent uh annualized for some amount of time like what what happened there is basically that uh compound created a promotion where they were basically just gifts to compound tokens to people who would kind of put their liquidity into the platform and the result of this is basically that people kind of ran and threw their toe all of their assets into the platform and started kind of collecting these fairly high interest rates but the reality is that those interest rates are not reflective any of anything that's remotely sustainable right it's just a temporary promotion that was created by printing a bunch of compound tokens and they can't just keep printing compound tokens forever uh so if uh like in the long term i definitely don't think that defy is going to give like flashy double digit interest rates of any kind right in the long run i expect the dfi interest rates to converge to being something uh much closer to just a via the traditional financial system so i yeah i mean i do think there is a kind of an element of trying to kind of rush for these things that seem like they're uh very lucrative but actually they're just short-term opportunities and they're not actually going to scale into something that's really meaningful for tens of millions of people but you know i guess people wants to do weird things with money and so that side of the space is just going to keep existing uh but yeah yeah so so the the common thread it sounds like and the things about d5 that you like are they're more crypto economic and they're more long-term oriented building and less sort of speculative less mania oriented let's call it now there is a argument about the liquidity mining side of things and the yield farming side of things that though there is a speculation aspect to it of course um and it could easily and maybe already has already turned into some kind of a mania it's different than the ico mania because in the ico mania what we had were tokens that were really sort of you know they called them futility tokens right they didn't have a value accrual mechanism but it could be argued that some of these tokens like uh comp uh like like balancer are going to add value accrual mechanisms in the same way that maker has a value accrual mechanism do you think that's healthy that the assets at least are healthier from a value accrual perspective i love how you uh and it referred to utility tokens as a futility tokens by the way that's great um and the economic model is definitely like it's unsustainable but it has less downside risk from an economic point of view i think the main downside risk i'm concerned about with defy is smart contract risk so either smart contract bug risk or oracle risk of some uh type um basically you know if you have like 600 billion dollars or whatever it is inside of these systems before they've been really well audited and they're ready to accept those values and either it turns out there is a bug in the contract or it turns out that you know the oracle gets attacked somehow then that could be a really big problem for people and i do think that people should kind of keep some of these risks in mind right like i remember people saying things like oh you know if you have your dollars in a bank account you get two percent and if you have your dollars and die you get four percent what gets double the interest rates and it's amazing but the reality is that that extra uh you know that four percent is only a good deal if you assume that the risk of maker dao was a system breaking is less than two percent a year right and if you're a risk neutral i mean if you're risk averse then you would want to be even more cons even more conservative you'd want the risk to maybe be less than one percent a euro less than half a percent a year or something like that so the question is you know do you actually think that the risk of maker towel breaking um over the course of the next 12 months is less than two percent makerdale's done an excellent job of uh surviving these uh last two and a half years with uh basically no losses to die holders right it's uh survived a 93 percent loss and and the price of eth it even survived a uh i think it was 55 or 60 loss of the in the price of youth over the course of a single day which is uh just really amazing so it's definitely showing some sturdiness but has it shown an expected lifetime of more than 50 years um so it's less clear so i i definitely think that that's something that people kind of should be careful about and people should just remember that uh you know these kind of background risks of systems just breaking for weird unknown reasons is something that does continue to exist you know even though yes maker and these other projects have done a lot of work and formally verifying their stuff and they've done vastly more due diligence than the dow did in 2016 but you know even still like claiming that a system is uh expected to break less than once in half a century after that system has only been in operation for two and a half years is something that requires a lot of confidence and it's not clear that we can justify that high level of confidence yet so i guess i continue advising caution in that regard so so vitalik you talked about how the the very strong apr of compound with this liquidity mining thing like worried you right and it perhaps it illustrated some sort of mania going on especially as the comp token rose to where or where it is now which is almost a two billion dollar dollar market cap you know right out of the gate however i would like to uh pitch an equal and opposite view where this excitement over the comp token is a great tool for decentralizing the the compound system right so the comp token is now the thing that represents ownership over the compound protocol and this excitement about comp and the liquidity mining around comp is all about people like this nebulous set of stakeholders who are adding liquidity to compound they just really really want to get the comp token which is why the comp token price is so high because of all the excitement that the comp token has generated because people are really excited to get their hands on the governance token which is the way that the compound protocol moves from a protocol controlled and operated by compound labs to controlled and operated by this nebulous set of people that own the comp token um and so is is that a fair take to have about like the the mania the the goodness of the mania surrounding the liquidity mining and then the comp token yeah no liquidity mining is definitely just economically a really interesting concept so like in general one question to ask is like if someone is being paid in one token and they wants to have another token right then a spherical cow economic model generally says well they'll just sell that token and they'll buy the other token right a spherical economic model would say it doesn't matter in which currency you pay someone for a service because they will just immediately go ahead and trade that into like having the portfolio allocation that they wanted to have anyway which is completely independent of your choice of like what thing you want you want to give them um and and even if you lock the tokens then you know they could still just like cancel that out uh by buying a like shorting it and some other finance fund like d5 financial derivatives platform and in reality of course that often doesn't end up happening right and defaults often end up being sticky um and it turns out that if you just like throw a token into people's hands then people often do actually end up keeping it um and if you just uh throw a token into people's hands as a byproduct then you do end up kind of putting it into more people's hands than you would if uh people had to actually proactively go on unit swap and kind of buy that token themselves so just as a kind of default based system it's kind of really interesting and i do think that there's a limit to kind of how much humanity mining is sustainable like i think that if your liquidity mining system is one that basically makes the kind of de facto fee of using the system negative uh so it gives you more than you're paying in fees then that easily turns into something that gets exploitable like basically the equilibrium there is just you would have people that have lots and lots of money just put all of their money into your system uh and then they collect their their rewards and they just immediately sell all of those tokens because they don't actually care about the application they're just a kind of amoral um you know money or make uh making yield farmer uh and so you don't actually kind of get the community kind of the default benefits beyond a certain point but i think that you know if you create a more modest version and you say you know yes this d5 protocol has a fee of 0.3 percent but you get the you know 0.2 or even the entire 0.3 back but just denominated in this protocol token and yes if you want you can go sell it on uniswap but you know by default you're just going to keep it and you're just going to slowly turn into a kind of citizen of the protocol then you know that's actually a a really interesting community dynamic and also i definitely kind of feel like you have to have some sympathy for protocol creators because like protocol creators want i think to have decentralized token distributions and making a decentralized token distribution is hard like before you had sales and now it's illegally risky to have a sale unless you have the sale in a way that's fairly centralized i mean before you had air drops but but air drops and they're giving a lot of kind of money away for free and it's not necessarily clear how effective they are i do think they can be very effective in some cases but they do have to be designed fairly well uh so and then there's obviously distributing coins that kind of per person but that just gets back to the whole discussion about identity systems you know i don't know i think uh like if there's a lot of kind of challenges that people that are trying to make these new projects face and so i do think that we have to kind of have a bit of mercy toward them and a bit of forgiveness toward models that aren't perfectly optimal but and so i guess liquidity mining is definitely interesting but it's also not the end and i kind of look forward to seeing what other things people come up with yeah will said and intent certainly does matter i think there have been times when scammers with ill intent just use these sorts of things to scam people uh and um you know it remains to be seen i guess what the the intent is of these d5 protocols but um i i think it's promising but one thing you mentioned earlier vitalik was advising caution both about smart contract risk and interest rates and kind of the speculative mania that's that's growing about these tokens um you advise caution in 2017 too i'm not sure people listen to you um or maybe some people did but i i guess my question is like humans are bad with risk and they're going to speculate no matter what there's always going to be another speculation dave and i tend to think that we are on the edge perhaps the very beginnings of another speculative bubble that might be coming down the pike you know maybe maybe soon maybe the next uh you know months or a year or so is there an upside to all of this speculation no there's definitely an upside to speculation like i think the usual line is that bubbles tends to be bad for the participants but they are or tech bubbles tend to be bad for the participants but they're good for a society because well they basically fund public goods right so though you know with public goods the line is that kind of rational self-interested agents end up under investing in public goods because they only get part of a small part of the benefit from their contributions but if you take crazy agents who overrate the effect of uh the of things that they're participating in that that kind of ironically ends up canceling out for the other economic bias and so you get something that's kind of strangely enough closer to being socially optimal so that's an interesting argument and i do think that's one of those kind of dangerous arguments because if that's something that you tell yourself to make yourself feel better then you could end up creating a creating or contributing to kind of bubbles that end up really hurting a lot of people and just making you some insiders rich in the process and you kind of still think that you're being virtuous all the way through because like hey it's somehow funding a bit of protocol development in the back end so like you definitely have to be you know careful about the moral justifications that you tell yourself in that regard but and there's definitely a kind of real positive benefit right like you can't deny the fact that just the crypto mania up until now has uh funded important things like if the eth2 client development zero knowledge proof research uh ethereum one and one point x client development and all of these other things that the ethereum foundation and a lot of other groups in the crypto ecosystem have ended up you know spending their money on um also a lot of kind of non-crypto charities that ended up benefiting from donations uh from uh just people who got kind of crypto rich in 2017 again i made it i made a few myself but then there was pine of the pineapple funds that threw around to kind of even more uh even more money and that's probably something that that's led to a lot of good so like you definitely can't deny that those positive uh consequences have happened but yeah at the same time like you you have to be careful and uh kind of avoid that uh turning into a this kind of self-justification story that you keep uh telling yourself and you keep on telling yourself more and more until at the end that you don't even realize it but you're no better than tron so yeah we definitely want to be better than tron here in the bankless nation vitalik and uh you know i i i hope we're doing a good job of that um one more to here yeah one more case on for speculation though is is is also this um doesn't it bring users into the space new people into the space we're going to have a global um financial or settlement or you know computer system for the world we need more people and just about everyone i know that is maybe not a developer came to the space because of some price run up right like just it you know it captured headlines that's how they found out about it that's how the information was disseminated that's where they initially came to the space now the people who really understood what it was trying to achieve tended to stay after the bubble popped but it it tends to bring people in in these waves is that an upside too well that's definitely an upside and i think the money aspect of crypto is definitely a big uh kind of part of the reason why it has been so successful at getting users where a lot of the previous efforts that decentralization have failed and also i think that just the fact that it's risen in price is something that just gives it all gives krypto a lot of status like i think a lot of people uh kind of underestimate especially in uh kind of acro across the entire range of cultures that exist in a global context just kind of the extents to which that financial success kind of brings a kind of legitimacy that would otherwise not not exist in a space um and so you know we've been seeing just crypto as a thing become really successful in a lot of regions around the world you know there's kind of the us and europe and there's india there's like china and korea and other places in asia there's uh you know south america and africa and in a lot of those places kind of kind of the memes that uh that attract a lot of many us people to a cr to crypto were are definitely not as prevalent by default and so the kind of the legitimization function that comes from the facts that crypto is uh you know financially successful has definitely been important in uh and of that that more global context as well so yeah and there's definitely benefits though at the same time there's a lot of risks right and the risks basically come because uh you know not every member that joins your community is a net positive contributor right and a lot of the time people that are there for just the money unless uh kind of you can manage their presence well can easily end up being net negative contributors uh and i mean i feel like in a lot of crypto communities we end up seeing that right in the crypto communities that kind of really strongly emphasize the money aspects like the the community just ends up being about speculation and people come in about you know hey the coins going to go up and the coins gonna uh uh gonna go up play even more and this is the reason i'm excited about participating and those kinds of communities tend to be short-term they tend to just not create much value for the world and it could easily kind of slide down a dark path toward being an even worse mlm sort of thing so i think that it is also important for us as a community to just uh kind of keep kind of talking and keep signaling about how we're not just about that um and you know like a lot of people do i kind of do sometimes i kind of think of virtue signaling as though it's something kind of dishonest and it's it's a bad thing but there's a lot of times where virtue signaling is good right there's a lot of time where you really want to just kind of publicly state you know these are the virtues that our community is about and uh these are the uh and if the kinds of uh traits that we want to that we want uh kind of this cluster of social space to be a magnet for and these are the things that we want uh our kind of social cluster to end up repelling right and if you end up dealing with things that are double-edged swords and you there's often a cases where uh you know you can try to uh kind of build the community in such a way that it kind of attracts the positive end of the sword and it repels the negative end of the sword and of course there are ultimately two ends of the same sword and so they're not going to be further apart from each other than the length of the sword okay crap now i'm mixing sword metaphors and magnet metaphors you know what i'm talking about but like there's a lot that you can do right so i think there is kind of there's definitely these kind of complicated factors that interplay with each other and this kind of complicated task of just this collective effort of uh kind of steering the culture and continuing to make sure that it goes in good directions and that it uh kind of continues to stay true to to its original intentions and i feel like in a lot of those cases we have been doing fairly well and yes we just have to keep on making that effort hey guys we're gonna pause the interview real quick to talk about some of our fantastic sponsors ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum so what that means is that you can deposit your assets into ave and then take out a collateralized loan or simply deposit just to earn an interest rate so you pay an interest rate for borrowing you earn an interest rate for supplying but what the magic of ave offers you is stable interest rate loans which is a really important money lego for building out a bankless revolution having an interest rate that doesn't change under your fee is really important for long-term thinking and being able to plan out your own personal finance futures but also make strong business decisions based on an interest rate that you can depend on in addition to their stable interest rates there's also flash loans and flash loans are where you can borrow any amount of any asset for without any collateral so long as you are also paying it back in the same transaction the use cases for this are absolutely endless and i'm really optimistic that some creative developers are going to make some really cool tools using the ave money lego system we have been watching ave climb the d5 pulse leaderboard just growing and growing and growing in the assets deposited into their application which just shows how strong of a system they have created so you can go and check them out at auve.com deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing any ethereum while it works so check it out i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5x6x 8x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this that will include in the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off all right let's dive back into the interview so vitalik in 2017 maybe it was very early 2018. you wrote a pretty famous tweet about how the valuations of these cryptocurrencies crypto networks crypto applications were just far beyond the value that they were actually providing to the world and you posed the question of that you know the the cryptocurrency blockchain ethereum bitcoin world hadn't actually provided all that hasn't really achieved all that much and the valuations that are currently going on in the crypto world uh we're not reflective of the value that that they deserve now that we're three plus years later three and a half years later from from that mania have we gotten to the point where you would have hoped that um we might actually deserve some sort of uh you know pat i'm not gonna i'm not gonna ask you to um make some sort of prescriptive statement as to what the values of these networks should be but uh the value that you see ethereum providing to the world is that kind of what you were hoping uh we would have been able to um achieve back in in 2017 it's two and a half years uh not not three and a half years yet by the way uh but uh that pardon me i think so and i think like the price of uh bitcoin is down by a factor of two and the price of if is uh down by about a factor of five but i think you know the resilience of uh the ethereum network and the amount of progress that the ethereum ecosystem has made is easily up by a factor of five uh since uh two and a half years ago as and as i mentioned you know at the beginning of uh or a conversation you can see this by looking at the technology you can you can see this by looking at the research we can see this by looking at what's actually been deployed you can see this by looking at just what kinds of things are being built on top of ethereum as we speak and the amount of progress is huge uh and also i feel like just the presence of ethereum and crypto in general as being just kind of a thing that cemented itself as a durable part of a kind of the collective cultural conscience i guess kind of even just of the broader world is something that's come much further lately and like i regularly talk to kind of fairly mainstream economists kind of increasingly mainstream political thinkers uh kind of tech business people and um all of these groups and you know they see crypto as being a kind of significant and uh durable piece of the puzzle so i think from a lot of angles that's just made a lot of progress and it's much less of this kind of pie in the sky speculative thing that it was even two and a half years ago okay vitalik so that that was uh present we talked about past and present we want to flip forward to future so ethereum future um we begin the conversation you talked about uh some optimism you had a lot of the worries that you'd previously had were not present anymore we were making progress in many areas but you probably still have some worries about where this whole thing could go wrong what worries you the most what big problems do you still see in front of us uh like preventing us from being the system that we all want it to be i would say the bigger problem problems at this point are less technological and more cultural um so like one of the things that so worried me around the past one and a half years right so if we look at this kind of rise of east maximalism that we've seen right like on the one hand i totally understand you know why that trend uh kind of became uh became a thing and started to exist um you know before that there was definitely this kind of culture of just not being able to talk about things like the value of youth as a as an asset or you know even just being optim i'm optimistic about ethereum specifically as a thing and there are a lot of projects that were kind of walking all over us in some sense and just kind of pretending to be the ethereum community's friends and then kind of talking at our conferences and then going kind of behind the ethereum community's backs and talking to vcs about how terrible with your emails and how they're going to be better uh and there is this kind of reaction to that um that happened but at the same time there's definitely a lot of downsides um and there's a lot of risks so like in a lot of ways right many aspects of ethereum culture and kind of the influences that i've tried to make to ethereum culture are and a reaction to what i perceive as being failures in bitcoin land um so i feel like we've always been trying to be multi-chain friendly just because of how multi-chain hostile what kind of the bitcoin maximalist mentality has been ever since 2014 um we have the multi-client road map because uh as a reaction to the negative consequences of the dominance of bitcoin core um we have uh you know miners voting on the gas limit as a reaction to the flaws of having a totally fixed block size and you know proof of stake as a reaction to the flaws of proof of work and all of these different things but um and ethereum we're kind of that culture and that aspect of it is definitely kind of becoming more like some of those things um and there's benefits some of those things like there's benefits uh that come from even just being honest about the idea that you know eath the asset is um is a great asset um to to have and that's uh one that can because uh a value can you kind of sustain itself going into the future um but uh at the same time you know there's risks that come out of uh just being unfriendly to independent blockchain ecosystems uh and just saying that you know if it's not on ethereum it's worthless uh there's risks that come out of uh just having a culture that has even the slightest risk of being perceived as the outside as not being about improving the world but being about making itself richer um you know there was that comic that uh is kind of fame uh fairly famous and kind of prop kind of propagated around and of some parts of that bitcoin land where you know and if you like the guy's holding a balloon and uh the other guy saying you know oh this is just a bubble and then the balloon turns into a big hot air balloon um and uh the other person says it oh that's just a bubble and then uh the guy ends up standing inside of this kind of protective dome and on the outside you know i have total civilization devastation and the guy on the outside is still saying oh it's just a bubble um and like there's a seductive appeal to that mentality but of course you know that mental there's also a very deep kind of darkness to that mentality because it's basically saying we're not about improving the world we're about uh being part of the process of uh the world collapsing and only if you basically buy your coin will you be able to pretty much have salvation and be kind of on the right side of the new apartheid instead of being on the wrong side and i would rather be a part of a community that's about making sure the world doesn't blow up in the first place um and so like i definitely worry about kind of losing those aspects of um kind of ourselves and who we are as a byproduct of kind of some of those trends but i feel like the ethereum community does have kind of a lot of uh people that are willing to provide a lot of pushback against uh some of the more negative aspects of those mentalities so i think you know there's definitely things to be optimistic about like i i i feel like uh there's definitely like just a lot of people that do understand why it's important to not overdo some of those things and and so uh i feel like there's a very very strong chance that we'll be we'll be able to kind of successfully avoid most of those traps um so that's one cultural thing another cultural thing that worries me is um so from a kind of just global you know mega-political uh to use uh kind of that word from a sovereign individual a kind of narrative around you know what kind of cryptocurrencies are and a kind of the way that that narrative interacts with kind of what the blockchain as it is and what people use it for right so this is actually a place where i think bitcoin does it well right so bitcoin kind of the ideology is basically that uh oh you know the central banks are just totally being incredibly irresponsible with all this money printing and the us is going to collapse and the eu is going to collapse and a bunch of places are going to collapse and things will be terrible and the thing that you're supposed to do is huddle and if you huddle you're being part of kind of the money of the future um and you will benefit right and so kind of this broader ideology and this kind of set of facts that those people believe about the world and the people believe about what the world is going to be actually meshes together with the messaging about what you're actually concretely supposed to do with with the blockchain and why that's good for you right which is basically huddling because if you huddle you're gonna huddle the coin that's going up instead of huddling the coin that's going to zero um and in ethereum's case there's a less of this kind of nice meshing right like there's and definitely a lot more diversity of political views like definitely a lot less of this common belief that you know the world is going to go to hell um in that same financial way like there's definitely some people who believe that and then there's other people that don't believe that um there's a lot of kind of diversity of political perspectives uh there's a lot of diversity of kind of economic perspectives about perspectives about around like what decentralized social media should look like for example and the things that people do with the ethereum blockchain today a lot of the time feel kind of a little bit disjoint from that right so even taking yield farming for example right like there's no real way in which like your ability to get um you know 135 interest from yield farming today uh kind of meshes together nicely with a belief that people in the ethiopian community have about you know what the future of uh like economics and geopolitics and finance is going to look like um like it feels like those two spheres are kind of less kind of merged together with each other and i think there are cases where this is not true so like i think quadratic funding is one of those examples right like ethereum people are in many cases passionate about creating new and better social systems that solve the problems of the 21st century and quadratic funding is one of the things that potentially stands to be an actually credible solution to and of the question of how to allocate money for public goods funding and quadratic funding is something people actually participate in in this case specifically as a way of helping to make the ethereum community better today because people care about the ethereum community today right and so that's one example where a kind of your belief about the world and your like the thing that you do today as a member of the ethereum ecosystem actually do uh kind of like work together really nicely but like in the case of decentralized finance for example i mean stable coins may be a good example like and maybe i mean even just international cryptocurrency payments potentially a good example and like there are some there are some kind of good examples of this but there's also kind of some cases where there is this kind of disjointness and like a lot of this disjointness is kind of hard for me to kind of unders kind of really fully kind of entirely kind of explain what exactly makes me uncomfortable about it it's more of this kind of instinctive thing but it is something that i think we as a community could i guess uh do better at um so yeah i guess the kind of so one just the concerns about ethereum maximalism and just kind of turning into something that makes ethereum a less inclusive and welcoming community is one risk and then the other risk of being this uh disconnect between macro narratives and uh kind of the k what people are supposed to do with the with the ethereum blockchain today um those are kind of two of the cultural issues that concern me and then there's a bunch of other other ones but they're kind of much smaller and and on the technological side i would say the thing that concerns me the most is basically that you know we are going to have a big bubble of adoption and interest and that this bubble will come before ethereum scaling technology is ready for it uh so i guess i hope that the people uh developing ethereum scaling technology will continue um you know adding oil and uh keep continuing to just build it out and and shipping it and rolling it out into the hands of people who need it so i'm fairly optimistic but we'll see on that last one vitalik we're we're close though right with rollups i mean we're close to being able to offload some of the main net traffic aren't we uh yeah so i think uh zk roll ups uh there's uh loopering at zk sync that exists already optimistic roll-ups seem like they're about half a year away so we're definitely close i think the main concern at at this point is less the tech side and more the adoption side like how do we actually get the people that are using ethereum today using rollups instead of using the main chain right how do we get the people that are sending all of those erc20s around sending them inside of loopering or sending them inside of zk sync instead of continuing to just send them on the ethereum network and paying high transaction fees for them and that's a question that'll be resolved by i think talking to wallets kind of talking to a applications and getting a whole bunch of these different ecosystem players together and getting a kind of common a road map which is definitely a coordination challenge but it is one that we'll have to figure out vitalik you talked a lot about um how the ethereum community is a little bit more nebulous than than the bitcoin community and how you know the the bitcoin community has this rallying cry about exactly how you participate which is you buy btc and you huddle and then you create the superior money system whereas ethereum doesn't really have something such a strong totem to rally around and i'm always reminded by a metaphor that amin solomoni put out forever ago which was uh the 300 spartans versus the athenians where the athenians are kind of this hodgepodge group of of people like one's a carpenter one's a blacksmith one's a farmer and then when you put them all together you have this kind of hodgepodge army which compared to the to the 300 are the 300 is very strong like phalanx of just people that is a hard not nut to crack however and we we see and me and ryan always like to talk about how like the code or values of a blockchain actually impacts the community that runs around it right and so bitcoin is not expressive and as a result of that it's pushed complexity out to the fringes right and i was listening to a podcast with press switch and hazu and um from uncommon core last night where they talked about the absolute lack of complexity at the base layer has pushed so much complexity into lightning network that it's actually been relatively restricted in itself because of how much complexity is there whereas ethereum has this expressiveness at the base layer which seems to be reflected in an expressive community of a number of different people and so while the ethereum is more expressive i'm optimistic that that that code that values baked into the ethereum uh system the ethereum blockchain does actually allow for a more scalable social community a social community around the ethereum blockchain simply because the expressiveness is baked into the l1 um am i onto something here or do you see a problem with this that's definitely true and i think like in kind of the moral of the story in 300 of course was that uh the hyper-dedicated and focused uh kind of militaristic spartans end up being more valuable in uh saving greece than uh uh kind of the motley athenian crew and you know in real life the spartans end up eventually winning the peloponnesian war and uh uh and um all of those things um so i think but like the real life is uh not exactly like that like i think the challenge in real in our real life is basically that you know in real life there's more than two teams right like our motto of war tends to be that there's two teams uh and so your objective in war is to kind of create maximum cohesion and strength within your team and so that it can beat the other team but in real life there's much more than two teams right and uh when you have more than two teams then the winning strategy is based is basically to gang up with um the majority of the other teams and kind of win against uh the the rest of the teams that are not part of part of your alliance right and and so if you have more than two teams then a skill that becomes as important as broad military power is your ability to convince other people and appear sympathetic and appear as the sort of team that other people would want to be allies with right and i feel like that's one of the ethereum communities big strengths right you know the fact that we have all of these large corporations building on ethereum that we have kind of a lot of friends and allies in academic communities that we have a lot of just different people all around the world that are interested in building ethereum related things so i think that's an advantage in a lot of ways um and i definitely think that if the ethereum community is a kind of model of like what crypto is all about is less one of uh kind of we're going to war and more about kind of this is a complex world with you know lots of bad forces and lots of good forces and it's a pretty kind of complicated challenge but let's kind of make friends and see if we can figure out a way to succeed and in a way that maximally tries to make everyone happy and if you're optimizing for that kind of world then you know you do want your your blacksmiths and yeah and your poets and um and all of these other characters uh so yeah and yay athens i guess [Laughter] so so one common theme on on the bankless pod and what me and ryan are always trying to define is what is ethereum like or bitcoin too um like it's not just a blockchain right it's not just a database it's not just a protocol for updating that database it's also a community it's a so like how do we define these things on like the grand scale when you take all of the interconnected uh components and you look at them holistically what is it is it a religion is it a nation a technology like when you compose everything together what do we actually have no this is an interesting question because the answer ends up being different uh depending on kind of how you think about it um you know is it ju do we focus on ether the asset do we focus on the ethereum blockchain uh do we focus on just blockchains using the ethereum technology um you know is ethereum classic a province of the ethereum nation um or is it just uh something completely split off and different um is um is enterprise ethereum part of ethereum uh as um are some of these other kind of newer blockchains that are basically forks of it of ethereum but then go off and do a bunch of their own things are kind of part of this great great ethereum bubble or at what point uh do they kind of go sufficiently far that they that they're outside of it it depends and i think it's uh you know the real world ha i think uh is one where there's a lot of these kind of complicated venn diagrams where depending on what you care about you end up kind of including and excluding different things like i don't know if you've seen this but there's this kind of fairly famous kind of diagram that attempts to describe what britain is and you know you have a circle around england you have a circle around britain you have a circle around the british isles and then you have a circle around a couple of other terms where to someone who's kind of pretty far away from kind of all of that you know hey england britain aren't those kind of synonyms of each other yeah you know no it's actually this kind of really complicated thing and there's a bunch of people they're kind of different ideas about what gets included and what gets excluded and are you focusing on political things that are focusing on kind of geographic other things um so i don't think there is one clear answer i think the answer does ultimately depends on what you would care about so vitalik you mentioned uh the asset in that being sort of a stakeholder group and it certainly is our take has been that eth the asset has been under appreciated in the past and bypassed it probably mean recent past you know the last two years let's call it under appreciated as a source of collateral for all of the d5 that's built on top of it under-appreciated uh as a as security essentially for the entire network and we put out this idea like the triple point asset thesis idea which is that ethan's kind of three super asset super classes at once it acts as sort of a commodity when you buy youth transactions with it and use it to pay for gas that sort of thing uh it in staking it will act as a capital asset and that it returns use some eth almost like a bond or like a t-bill in exchange for depositing and bonding it and it also acts as a store of value in some ways so a collateral for the entirety of the the d5 space do you buy into that and uh what's your take on what eth actually is no that definitely makes sense and thanks for explaining and when i saw the term like triple point asset i i think it was yesterday on twitter at first i thought it had something to do with you know those uh that particular kind of temperature and pressure where ethan's somehow a solid a liquid and a gas at the same time that's exactly right well okay that's exactly right okay oh i see it that's that is the exact metaphor oh i okay now okay now we actually get it yeah it is gas and storm value and medium of um exchange okay no that's and all of those things at once right because heath is very you know composable it could be all of those things okay that's really cool then um i definitely agree with that and i think uh there's definitely multiple ways of thinking about uh ether uh the nice thing is that i think these functions they don't interfere with each other and they even kind of complement each other right so like especially you know once eap 1559 comes out and you get some espn burns then uh the more ether that gets uh you used to pay for transaction fees the better store value ether becomes and if it gets used as a store of value then that also kind of you know might push up its price and ends up leading to a more secure network and then if people more people send transactions some of that also ends up going to the stakers so there's definitely a lot of kind of virtual cycles and kind of positive feedback loops between those three use cases uh so no it's definitely a good way of thinking about it you know our other take is that the value of eth is super important uh for the security of the network but but also if you want uh you were talking earlier about some of your favorite defy use cases you mentioned stable coins that your favorites were among the like more um crypto economic stable coins uh and for those types of stable coins having a protocol uh relatively like risk-free source of value source of collateral tends to be pretty important um like what's your take i mean how important is the value of eth to the success of ethereum you know the stablecoin case is definitely a good example because ultimately you know the total amount of value that can be stored in east-backed crypto economic stable coins is bounded above by the value of all the eve right and so if there's no value in eth that it becomes much harder to have a lot of value in uh in a crypto economic stable coins so that's definitely we have another metaphor for that by the way vitalik which is uh economic bandwidth you know eth acts as sort of a sort of a value bandwidth at the base layer for these other assets that can be built on top of it right okay so what's uh so what's the metaphor for eth being a plasma and what's the metaphor for east being a bose einstein condensate i don't know maybe you can help us with that one yeah we'll say that for the future you know that's that's uh 2025 type of uh you know memeing i think we're we're still in 2020 okay yep that's fair no 2020 you know the hindsight year it's a good year let's finish it yeah um vitalik one other question on ethy asset and that's um eth's monetary policy so that's been a criticism historically uh of ethereum that it doesn't have a fully defined monetary policy we've talked about minimum necessary issuance as being sort of the social contract of ethereum yet the truth is it's not something minimum necessary issuance isn't something that can be really hard coded into ethereum so it's decided by kind of the social contract you know should we readjust gas downward for instance that's kind of or should we decrease issuance uh that that's kind of decided by the social contract is that sustainable or do you think we need to kind of codify its monetary policy as part of eth2 and what would that even look well the trouble is that you can't like permanently codify monetary policy right because ultimately it is just backed by the social contract and if the social contract changes in ethereum or in bitcoin then the total supply ends up being different from what people expected it to be now of course you can have social contracts that value immutability more more than others and you can even have a social contract that values uh kind of greater and greater ossification over time which seems like uh roughly the social contract that ethereum has already so i don't think is much kind of too special that we need to worry about in that regard it definitely is something that i think we should avoid ossifying kind of at the beginning because proof of stake and ethereum's variety especially is still an untested experiment and we have no idea how sustainable it'll be but kind of over time moving toward freezing values in place and moving toward adding stronger guarantees i think is definitely something that's reasonable to think about but you do think that the issuance rate of ether should be something that is uh calcified in ethereum in the future at some point is that is that right uh i mean i don't think i'm a proponent of calcifying the issuance rate in the sense of guaranteeing a hard number like you know a hard cap or even a hard like zero point one percent a year or something like that i mean improv in the proof-of-stake design that we have right and there is already a planned kind of upper bound of two percent here um and if we want we could obviously try to reduce that upper bound but and even that upper bound is still kind of ultimately changeable by uh changes to the protocol uh so and that's something that we're just going to be kind of more and more comfortable with over time um the reason why i'm not comfortable with a hard cap is basically because like i do believe that we should take this trade off of like if we have to make a choice between certainty of issuance and certainty of the level of ethereum platform security then we should choose a certainty of the level of ethereum platform security do you also agree vitalik that um since the the platform security is backed by the asset itself there can be kind of a value if you have a neutral monetary policy that that um groups of people you know value more um that therefore increases the price of of the asset increases your security is there kind of a balance there i mean bitcoin has achieved uh some pretty tremendous security based on the mean value of of bitcoin let's call it of this fixed cap um you know can we benefit from that in ethereum that's true though i feel like there is other ways to benefit from that mean value like even for example if you look at just the amount of transaction fees now and like if those transaction fees end up like even 80 getting burns then that's already higher than greater price expected proof of stake issuance so i think if we're just a little bit patient and we start seeing you know four or five years from now there being like entire long periods of time where if ether issuance goes negative then that's something that could turn out to be an insanely powerful mean by itself like even if it's not technically guaranteed and even if you know usage stops it goes back to being positive for some time and just even not something that could end up attracting a lot of people so i don't think we shouldn't even be kind of trying to freeze things now i think we should be willing to be you know a bit more patient than just seeing what proof of stake ends up looking like economically speaking and as we enter proof of stake as it's defined now in the protocol how would you sort of describe issuance so you mentioned sort of a two percent upper limit uh do you have some other details of how you might describe what issuance policy will be in proof of stake yeah and it's basically got an increasing function and how many people validate so if very a little east is validating it could be as little as like 100 200 000 ether here and then if literally everyone validates it ends up going up to 2 million ether here and then you subtract from that transaction fee burn so that's basically what it is right and i mean that does feel kind of very abstract and weird and like you know i'm just like somebody who wants to figure out whether how uh whether or not to huddle a cryptocurrency you are you're throwing weird math formulas and involving square roots at me but i think that people kind of overrate uh the cost of that and the reason again the mental cost of that and the reason why people overrate the mental cost of that is because it's a formula today but when eth2 is running and when people see what uh the formulas actually lead to and kind of what results they create in practice i think uh people will and just see okay yeah fine these are the numbers that it looks like it is in practice and those are numbers that i'm uh if you're really comfortable with and solo participate like i think uh the like average people and especially people that are not so much super analytical i think like us analytical people underestimate the extents to which kind of those like less analytical people are willing to just like kind of intuitively reason by looking at past experience and and he extends to wish that actually works pretty well for most people yeah any guesses on how much time uh satoshi thought about the 21 million hard cap like how much time you put into that like my guess is probably very little it was kind of a guess right that's my guess too and that issuance rate that you were talking about that's going to be hard-coded in ethereum the same way the 21 million is uh of course maintained by social contract but also hard-coded right yeah very good all right vitalik we're going to finish this up with a quick uh lightning round sir so just uh you know sentence or two answer on these if you can uh if if not then uh we can we could discuss it some more the first question i have the lightning round is are gas fees so gas fees are too high and that leads to inequality do you think that statement is fair or overblown by the way it's not a lightning round it's a roll-up round um i definitely think that gas fee is being being high is bad for ethereum's goal to be an egalitarian system and that's a big part of the reason why i'm so focused on scalability ether flipping bitcoin is that going to happen we'll see no comment fair enough what's the low hanging fruit that you'd like to see built on ethereum vitalik um i mean i keep yelling about smart contract wallets so can i keep saying smart contract wallets absolutely why why smart contract wallets oh just because like wallet security is i think just a boring but continually underrated problem and we need to have like just solutions to that that have good user experience um another thing i'd probably also say is that a in addition to having like stable coins for the dollar i think it'll be nice to have synthetic assets that represent other kinds of assets so like other major fiat currencies and major stock indices would be the thing that i would go for i i get to take this one david what's your favorite eath killer metallic um i mean i like some of the war or some of the work that these um optimistic roll-up teams like you know fuel and optimism and arbitrary doing yeah i'm curious how you stay so unflappable in the face of all of the the twitter trolling do you have like a like a secret for that how can we emulate you i guess eventually you just kind of get used to it and i don't know it just kind of take life less you're less seriously understanding and i guess it comes naturally so in ethereum we tend to rotate what our focus is from time to time uh right now it seems to be there's this uh boom of l2 networks coming online there's also the the d5 movement uh perhaps there's also prediction markets on the horizon what what do you think the ethereum uh world is going to focus on next hmm i think continued work on d5 i think there is going to be a lot of focus around like actually finalizing and uh rolling out the scaling solutions and that will end up occupying a lot of people's attention um hopefully more privacy solutions too i in prediction markets i uh hope that we'll see more interest in actually using those and i know omen is out and the auger version 2 is coming out soon next one is is crypto on a collision course with nation states um [Music] that's an interesting one and krypto was definitely in a very interesting position kind of with respect to the current kind of geopolitical and info political landscape right because you know the geopolitical landscape seems to be one where at least centralized systems are finding it harder and harder to escape the reality of them being being inside the nation states that they happen to be based inside of um and people trying to kind of create more and more of these kind of nation-state level barriers um so you know obviously the kind of the chinese firewall has been around for a long time and yesterday uh uh pompeo made a bit of a bluster about kind of wanting to ban tiktok um in europe uh there's been a lot of this kind of unfriendliness toward u.s tech tech companies for some time um and then of course some people obviously say oh no that's just anti-trust and data protection and then the cynics kind of say that well actually kind of a lot of these kind of moves seem very targeted toward like basically kicking us companies out so there is this kind of balkanization of the centralized internet uh and then the other one a lot is of course um india banning all of those chinese applications um and this uh desire of uh kind of building these kind of tech uh kind of techno-centralized civilization states um essentially and crypto is kind of standing strong as one of the few remaining things that's genuinely really international and that's a kind of position that we should be very kind of happy that we've managed to kind of maintain and stay inside um and i mean i do think that kind of the the cryptocurrency part of crypto is a big part of why it managed to do this and why it actually managed to kind of get some of this global appeal right like you know the ideology is the ideology but uh you know number go up is a kind of one of the closest things that we that humanity actually has to uh universal values and of like it or not um and that's something that puts it into a position where it has the ability to kind of continue to exist as a bridging layer between uh kind of all of these different ecosystems but at the same time you know that means that crypto can do things that kind of other actors increasingly can't do and that also kind of puts a target on the back of its head and will crypto be able to kind of weather the storm in terms of having that target on the back of its head i don't know we'll see and this is uh definitely one of the big challenges that we're going to have to navigate in what ways is crypto going to be bad for the world um i mean the speculation bubbles have definitely had uh kind of negative consequences i mean in oh in a lot of cases um some of the kind of ponzis and especially the ones targeting third world countries some have had negative consequences and i think we've def we as a community have definitely not come close to exhausting our options for trying to deal with and mitigate some of some of that damage and there's a lot considerably more that we could be doing um and even like fully in the context of uh crypto being a an ethereum being a fully permissionless and decentralized system where we can't just like kick off applications we don't like like even um i would given that constraint there's still a lot a lot more that we could do um i i mean ransomware also a negative consequence so in general right like there's it is definitely kind of one of the just the facts of sense of uh censorship resistance uh that you're also going to end up taking on applications that base kind of people would have wanted to wanted to censor for for reasons that you sometimes like and that's kind of one of the costs that you have to end up paying i mean i do think that kind of some of the reputation that uh kind of crypto gets um as a result of those things does end up being undeserved like basically the kind of effect is the right that a lot of those kind of undesirable use cases ultimately like they're going to exist anyway and they're going but of course they're going to move on to the platform that's kind of most convenient for them and so the marginal benefit of that crypto provides to these applications is much less than a kind of the volume of activity of activity that's uh have of those applications that's happening inside of crypto right because if crypto did not exist then those applications would probably still exist it would just exist on other platforms and yes often those platforms would be less efficient for those use cases but kind of that delta of the increase of efficiency that crypto provides is much less than just the total volume of those applications that ends up happening on crypto so i do think that and the extent to which kryptos uh and responsible for those things happening and ends up being uh kind of overstated in a lot of cases but there are real issues and there are real things that we could be doing more to mitigate in that regard and there's a lot of things that ethereum have in the ethereum community have been doing to mitigate right especially if you just look at the ethereum community versus some of the more unscrupulous crypto communities in the space like there's definitely a night and day difference but there's still much more that we could do do you believe immortality is possible uh yes i do um well it depends what you mean is it going to be good oh that absolutely um like the way that i think about it is like imagine if you know we were elves and we were actually immortal and then someone came along with the bright idea of like hey how about we ins um unleash a virus into the world that makes everyone die after 100 years and we're going to do this because um you know old people deserve to die because they have bad opinions or you know whatever uh other one of these really horrible reasons is that people comes up with like people will just reject completely reject that and if if someone tries to do that by force they'll be like basically just hang for genocide pretty much immediately right so if you flip that around like yes of course i think kind of humans being uh immortal is a vast improvement over this over the status quo um and i actually think that uh we are going to see a bit of a kind of sea change in favor of those things like one of the things i've noticed as a result of covet 19 is that people are realizing that you know bad things don't just happen because of technology bad things can happen because of lack of technology like if we had a vaccine for the virus then we would have much fewer problems like if we had better ways of just understanding what the heck is going on in terms of the virus and who it's in fact who it's infecting and how and if we had better statistics then there would be much fewer problems but on the other hand if we had a kind of back to the land caveman society well guess what we would still have the virus and it would kill considerably more people so there's definitely this kind of pro technology trends that i'm seeing coming out of this and i think pro using technology to get rid of biological mortality entirely is going to be one of the positive kind of results of uh of that trend but of course biological mortality can only get to about a few kind of trillion or quadrillion years before the entropy of the universe starts running out and then there's a question of like can we kind of create new universes and keep on putting ourselves into your universes to survive even beyond then and i don't know and i hope we can i mean infinity is definitely better than a quadrillion years but we'll see vitalik uh one last question for our roll-up round and it's been an absolute pleasure to have you sir and we'll close it out with this question how are you going to be celebrating ethereum's fifth birthday on july 30th um i don't know maybe maybe running a 2.0 staking note we'll see all right that's it maybe uh birthday cake and candles involved or just the steaks we'll have to do a could do a birthday cake too um five is a milestone um vitalik it's been a pleasure to have you on bankless thanks for taking the time to answer our questions and speak with the bankless nation we certainly appreciated it and we are looking forward to new developments on ethereum thank you this has been great all right everyone actions from that conversation we've included in the show notes a timeline to some of the key ethereum achievements so take a look at that reflect back on where we've come in the last five years we've also included a link to some of the previous ethereum focused episodes on bankless so make sure you catch up on some of those past ethereum episodes as we start to celebrate ethereum's fifth birthday the third thing you could do is give us five stars david why do we need those stars we need those five stars because we are trying to grow the bankless nation and the way that we do that is we get the bankless gospel into as many ears as possible climbing up the crypto podcast charts is difficult because of how many people downloaded podcasts in 2017 and we're still fighting against that tide today so we're we're gonna get there eventually but it would be awesome if we had your help in getting those five stars and those good reviews so that we can climb the ranks when you type in bitcoin when you type in ethereum when you type in crypto into the apple or spotify podcast charts into the apple or spotify podcast search that bankless shows up first all right let's do it so risks and disclaimers as well we talked about some of those in the episode with vitalik but just a reminder eath is risky all of crypto is risky so is defy you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey
