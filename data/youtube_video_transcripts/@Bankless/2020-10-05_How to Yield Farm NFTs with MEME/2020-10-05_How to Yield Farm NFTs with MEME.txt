[Music] hi everyone this is d5 dad today i'm going to walk you through how to use don't buy meme.com and this is where you can farm limited edition nfts or digital pieces of art so you'll notice there's a few different options here and i'm going to show you how to mint from one of the genesis pools so if i click on genesis there's all these different pieces of art available and you'll notice that some of them are all sold out so this vitalik buterin one is all sold out but then this one here is worth 10 pineapples and the way you earn pineapples is by staking meme meme is the uh the native token for the don't by meme platform and you're able to stake up to five meme each one of these tokens entitles you to earning one pineapple a day so a pineapple is like a credit and so you'll notice below that by participating in this and staking one to five meme i can earn one to five pineapples a day and i can use those to mint these like digital cards that are i think really creative pieces of art some of them are worth one pineapple there are others here that were worth a lot more these are all sold out now this one here is worth 10 pineapples for this meme of hayden from uniswap so part of the reason meme is an interesting project is that while one is staking a token and then earning credits to mint these digital pieces of art these digital pieces of art do have a secondary value to them they can be sold on openc or wearable or any market that sells nfts so if i click on this we can go here to see that listings start at .087 ether so when i stake meme and then i earn credits and i mint or claim the right to uh limited edition nfts i know that there is a value associated with these and so i could go here to look through who else is selling this and you can see the prices here on the right they start from the lowest at the top and go higher as you go lower and you can see that some people are selling these for you know much higher prices there are nfts that have been minted on don't buy meme.com that have sold for over you know 50 to 70 ether here's a few of those that went for much higher prices but there was a lot more risk involved these were nfts that were being created at the start of don't buy meme just a few months ago one had to provide liquidity on uniswap for the ether meme pool and there's a lot of impermanent loss that was taking place there just because the price was going up and down very rapidly so so these different pieces of art have sold on open c for quite a lot of money if we go and check this out for the vitalik legendary meme listings start at 34 ether and you can see that there's now some listed for 62. anyways it's definitely a different vibe than other d5 applications where we're replicating what are traditional finance mechanisms like lending and borrowing before i walk you through any steps please be aware that in order to participate in meme one needs to buy a meme token and that alone i would say is risky just because it's a newer illiquid token there's lots of price discovery going on which means the price is volatile and so i'm not recommending that someone buy this meme token but the truth of it is in order to participate in the meme platform you do have to have a meme token so if i want to get started with meme the first thing i have to do even though the meme is to say don't buy meme is i actually do have to acquire some meme so if i click on don't buy this will take me to the uniswap listing for meme and if i was going to buy some meme uh you know i could put in like whatever one ether will get me so if i was gonna swap for this i could do that on uniswap then once i've got my meme that erc20 token can be staked in one of a few different pools currently there is an event series this is related to the la blockchain summit that is going to be happening october 6th and 7th so there's some memes here so here's some of the memes that are available and you can see that both of these are actually sold out and then there's more here available there's 333 left on the one on the far left for one pineapple but the way staking works is when i stake meme in one pool i'm earning these pineapples to mint these pieces of art in just that pool the pineapples are not transferable which is great because it means that a whale cannot take advantage of having multiple wallets accumulating all this pineapple and then transferring it all to one wallet and being able to uh mint all of the rare art that's available here at the end of the day it is a game of patience here's another pool called the artist series this is the first of the artist series there will be many more of these coming in the future as far as i as far as i know so there were four pieces of art here all of them have been minted as well so you can see that there's actually a community here that's using this and uh excited to mint these pieces of art there was 500 of this one 250 of this one 100 of this and then only 10 of this and you can see on the openc listings that the more scarce the supply in most cases the price is a lot higher the third and fourth pool are the two original pools for genesis which was just staking meme and the other one i was showing you just just before where you had to be a liquidity provider in the meme eath pool so i'm going to click here and now i can see all the different memes that are available many of these are only one pineapple which is great it makes it really it makes it possible for anyone to really participate and they could stake as little as one meme and then within a day they'd have enough pineapples to mint one of these however there's others here that are worth more pineapples this one is worth 10 pineapples so if i had one meme staked it would take me 10 days before i'd have enough pineapples if i have five memes steak it takes two days and i would have enough pineapples to redeem this so let's go ahead and mint one of these i'm actually just going to go for this one here i already have 62 pineapples i've been staking this for a while there's a chance i could be saving these pineapples up to mint something near the bottom so you can see this one is worth 150 pineapples i'm quite a ways off from this but but that shows you there are different strategies for one to think about here for me i just think the art is fun i'm not really selling at any of it i do have one piece of art listed on openc so if we go back to my account i've got my vitalik buterin common card listed and so if i click on this i can see the different listings below and you can see that i'm selling mine for 1.5 ether but the average selling price right now or where it starts at least is 0.07 ether so i doubt anyone's going to be buying mine anytime soon one step i'm gonna skip here is if i were to not have staked already in order to earn pineapple i would have come here to one of the the four pools that we've shown you and i would stake a maximum of five meme now i've already got five staked so i can't stake anymore i can also unstake it at any point in time if you are coming here for the first time you will have to give approval so there will be two transactions approving spending meme and then the second one is to actually stake it once you do that your meme will continually earn these pineapple credits and since i already have enough i'm going to go ahead and mint this for one pineapple all right so the gas price recommended here is 87 gway i'm looking at ether scans gas tracker and it says that if i put this through at about 87 gway it'll go through in two minutes so this looks good let's go ahead and confirm it okay i'm back about 30 seconds later my transactions gone through and if we wanted to check out that piece of art which is an erc721 token if i go to openc dot io account this is a really nice place to visualize all my nfts so here's the one i just minted and according to open c uh this last sold around .02 ether 0.02 ether at about 350 ether today is about seven dollars so you know this is worth supposedly seven dollars again for me i just think the arts really cool and personally i'm enjoying collecting these so far i've minted uh one two three and then i got this one airdropped from the meme team to everyone that was staking i think a few weeks ago all right let's quickly talk through some of the risks involved in using don't buy meme.com first off i'm using the smart contracts deployed on this website so by staking my tokens obviously i've got exposure to those smart contracts and my worst fear is there being a bug in those smart contracts i'd say the second risk to call out is just exposure to a really volatile asset meme has gone from six dollars all the way up to nineteen hundred dollars and now it's back down to three hundred to four hundred dollars a third risk i think about is admin rights i'm not aware of what admin controls the team has i would assume there's quite a bit there still just because it's a newer platform so i'm definitely not using this and trusting that it is as decentralized as something like uniswap or tornado cash all right that's all i've got for you today just a quick recap of what we covered uh i went to don't buy meme.com i had to purchase some meme which is really the the token that's required to participate in all of these pools there is talk of allowing staking other tokens in the future which would be great because then one doesn't have to gain exposure to the meme token just to participate for now though as of october 5th 2020 i do have to hold the meme token and then the four pools were one under the event series one under the artist series which there's more of those coming i think in the near future and then the genesis cards had two different pools one of them was an lp genesis pool this wasn't a pool that i covered today but if you wanted to participate in this uh lp genesis pool and become a liquidity provider in the meme ether pool you can go to zapper.fi invest search meme and then here's the zap where you can add liquidity after you add that liquidity you know let's say i add one ether to the pool then i would come back to don't buy meme.com i could go here and i can actually stake that lp token so this is probably the most complicated pool to participate in but no surprise the prizes are worth a lot more in terms of what folks are paying for these nfts on the open market like openc if you have any questions please let us know you can comment in the bankless discord group or
