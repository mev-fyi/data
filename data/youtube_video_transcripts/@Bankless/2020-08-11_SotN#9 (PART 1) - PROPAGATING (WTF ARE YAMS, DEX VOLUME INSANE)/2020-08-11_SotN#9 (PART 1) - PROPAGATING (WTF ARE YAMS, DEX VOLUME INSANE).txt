hello everyone welcome to state of the nation episode 9. david and i are super excited about the state of the nation today we're going to talk about what's happening like we usually do related to big picture stuff drop some insights and action items and right after we talk about our sponsor he's gonna mention a few other updates today as well as the schedule but david why don't we start with our sponsors you wanna you wanna kick it off yeah yeah so i was playing with one of our sponsors games uh last friday and a little bit this weekend gods unchained for those of you that played magic the gathering for those of you that played hearthstone yu-gi-oh this is a game just like that but instead the cards that you own in the game are uh erc 721 tokens on ethereum and so the the big problem with magic the gathering was that it was physical so you had to be across from a person with other physical cards to play them so that kind of sucked and then there's hearthstone that came around so you could play over their computer but then you never owned your actual cards because blizzard just owned them on a centralized database what hart what gods unchained does is they have the best of both worlds right where you own your cards because they're digital assets on ethereum but you can play on the online medium that the world is now turning to so it's a really fantastic game uh and with a really fantastic dev team that is kind of leading the chart with when it when it comes to erc 721 standards and also gas on ethereum check them out at godsunchained.com download the game you can start without having to buy any tokens without having to buy any cards they give you the the basic starter pack that you need to get started it's it's a really elegant ui really elegant uh the whole experience uh and it's just a ton of fun i played i played it all weekend absolutely all right so the second sponsor we want to tell tell you about is ave ave is a long-term time favorite of the bank list community so it is a lending and borrowing protocol at its core so it's all defy it's all bankless what you can do is deposit an asset into ave you do that by going to ave.com so an asset could be any erc20 token like a die for instance or an eth and what it will do is it will provide you a yield on top of that so you're effectively lending your assets to the protocol that's one side of the market the other side of the market is where you actually borrow against the protocol and the unique thing about ave is they don't just offer variable rate loans they offer fixed rate loans so with most d5 protocol lendings what happens is the interest rate could change on a day-to-day basis uh with ave you can sort of lock in that interest if you're if you're borrowing something from the account so um they are just crushing it in terms of uh popping up the d5 leaderboard in terms of total value locked so um there's a lot more going on inside of that protocol also they released avonomics which is super exciting that is some token economics to their protocol one of the big things there's lots to highlight about it but one of the big things is they're actually going to be putting a percentage of um of tokens of reserve assets into sort of a an insurance type of um of protocol so if something happens savvy in the future that can be paid out so that's going to be included in avonomics we will include some links where you can check out avonomics and you can check out ave but if you're looking to get started and just try a small amount today you can do that at ave.com check the show notes david what are we doing today sarah you know i didn't ask you how you're doing but how are you doing i'm doing fantastic we've had we just released a uh just killer episode with andre cronier who was the the creator of the y urn and the yiffy protocol token that just went out on the podcast stream on monday if you haven't listened to that give that a listen uh there was there was some fud going around from this decrypt article about how andre is close to quitting and then andre also also came out on twitter saying that that article was not accurate and so i feel like people uh really turn to to listen to this episode to really get a glimpse as to what the hell that that decrypt fund article was even talking about because it wasn't entirely wrong andre did say that he was like fed up and really tired um with what he's been building but he did not at all allude to how he is bailing or quitting so for more details listen to the podcast absolutely it's a fantastic podcast one of our most downloaded actually all right so um it's just crushing it and it's super interesting it was called dense i think on twitter um so so take a look at it maybe listen to it a couple of times if you need to the other thing is bankless nation is growing like crazy so we hit a really cool milestone yesterday which is um 10 000 subscribers to the newsletter where it all started so we just want to thank everyone for um hanging with us and and being a part of this this community um it's just been really rewarding to see and bankless is not even a year old right and we are population 10k right now okay yeah it's a big city absolutely um so we're growing we want to grow this into a metropolis and then eventually a a full-size bankless nation right um david we should talk about the eatscape shirts as well so what's the latest on those we introduced those last state of the nation yeah yeah so that you the east cape shirt it's the it's the rare rare apparel uh platform that we're kind of building out and it's the first one uh season zero we're calling it this is going to be a regular rolling out seasons of new awesome scarce merch and the way what we did was we made 50 shirts and we also made 50 tokens and if you want the shirt you buy the token from uniswap and you burn it and then you get the shirt sent to you and so somebody's already redeemed one so their shirt is in the mail on the way looking forward to hopefully uh getting it seeing a tweet come out on twitter from some guy wearing uh the escape shirt uh and so we had this set up into two phases right so we had like this initial phase where the the buying demand on unit swap would uh would suck up some of the tokens and then we would start to uh uh re release the tokens as well so like that what we did is we supplied all tokens to unit swap every single one you know each one ease per token uh and then the purchasing power would increase the price of the token and then we would in uh we the plan was to withdraw liquidity and sell as the price uh went up to keep that price dampened and and shallow until we ran out of tokens and so the first phase of that happened and then we realized that with uniswap as a distribution method it kind of runs up against a wall in that second phase right and so at the price the price got too high and we couldn't sell them because people weren't pushing that they weren't um there wasn't enough supply and also and then the demand wouldn't reach that certain threshold and so there wasn't really a good way to like offload these and so we're working with a balancer team to try out this new mechanism that they that they've always discussed and always like kind of promote it as a potential use case of a balancer pool and it's basically a dutch auction um and so what we're going to do is as we build out the system with balancer we're not ready to do that yet we're just kind of talking about our plans um what we're going to do is we're going to withdraw the remaining liquidity from unit swap and then put it all into a balancer pool and so there's going to be like the remaining tokens that we have it's going to be like 40 38 tokens something in that ballpark and we're going to supply them all all of them into balancer with um a very low supply of either die or ether or something and then these these supplies cross over time and the the price of the tokens will tick downwards at a rate over time and time and time and so uh when prices will go down and then there will be only so many shirts only so many tokens that you can purchase and as you purchase them the supply runs out as the price lowers and so the price will get closer to zero over time but before it gets to zero it's likely that all the shirts will have been purchased because people will buy them for more than zero dollars and so at some point between where we initially set the parameters at we're gonna set it really high something like three thousand dollars a shirt and then it's going to trend towards zero dollars over time and somewhere between those two ends all the shirts will be bought and it kind of does work like uniswap like when you purchase a shirt the price goes up but the price will go up and then continue to tick back down over time until either all tokens are sold or the price is zero and so this is just a much better way to distribute these things uniswap isn't really a distribution mechanism this this dutch auction from the balancer system i i think is going to distribute these things because we don't we don't want these tokens like we want you guys to have these tokens and so this is a way for it for us to get um to get the tokens out into the ecosystem so that people can actually redeem these shirts i don't want to just sit on a box of really awesome shirts for for for months on end um so that's the update with that absolutely that's gonna be super cool i mean so the the summary is basically um phase one was successful the the market found a price for these shirts on uniswap it's still active now phase two we've sort of changed plans to move phase two to a dutch auction type model where all of the liquidity um is essentially off of our books and into uh into the market um i think that'll be great very exciting we don't have an eta on that though uh but keep stay tuned here uh for that and uh and you'll be first know yeah there's a reason why we labeled this season zero not season one we're we're still trying this thing out yeah absolutely um and the market is definitely having fun with uh figuring out what the price of these eatscape shirts are i mean they've they've moved quite high and now they're sort of back to mid um to your last i looked it was like you know seven hundred dollars or something for it got all the way up to eighteen hundred dollars and then and then people started to well that's a lot yeah that is a lot i love the shirts i'm not sure i'd do 1800 for one shirt of course um all right so um what else are we doing so this state of the nation is going to be a little bit different um this week so we're actually going to release this in two episodes there's going to be a part one which you are listening to right now and we've recorded a little bit you know first we're going to stitch these videos together and then there's going to be a part two the part two is actually going to be on each supply with vitalik we think that that deserves its own dedicated episode and we wanted to get this episode out to you today because we've got some super interesting time sensitive topics one in particular that we're talking about um a little something called yam which has kind of hit the the bankless community so that's what we're going to start with today and that's how it's going to be divided so expect two state of the nation episodes this week it's a bonus week this is just part one stay tuned for part two on a wednesday thursday sometime this week we'll we will release part two with vitalik where we are actually talking about the east supply gate as you call it right david yeah that's what that's what bitcoiners call it that's that's that's what's going around in their circles um absolutely well let me ask the question i guess we're gonna do this question twice i'm not sure maybe maybe there's just one state of the nation but david what is the state of the nation this week sir what's the what are we using the state of the nation is propagating oh it's such a perfect word so bankless just hit 10k bankless nation 10k large fantastic uh there's people flooding into the discord if you guys aren't in the discord join it it's where a lot of the awesome conversation happens um meanwhile in d5 there's this new thing called yam which is the yam farming revolution it's a new a new cycle of the season so that that has now propagated uh the defy ecosystem like the unit the first first users of uniswap that number has gone through the roof so user user swap users are propagating uh the texts about defy continue to flow in everything is propagating everything is propagating yep and we are recording this intro um actually post yam launch and we recorded the yam section of this uh pre-em launch so it's just like an hour an hour and a half before the the launch of em it has launched and um you can you know find out more about it in real time uh all right david we should get right to it then sir right let's first before we talk about yams we got to get into our uh second round as the sponsors and then it will be clear skies after that awesome all right david let's take a minute to talk about two more of our fantastic sponsors the first is poly market poly market is a prediction market with a very simple and understandable user experience you can use it to express an opinion as to the likelihood of future events we've written a tactic about this we will include it in the show notes it is fantastic to use you can you can bet on future events using eth you can bet on it using dye uh it's very much like a wisdom of the crowd sort of phenomenon so you can go there not to gamble but also to gain a glimpse into what the market's actually predicting about things things like the total locked value in d5 things like coronavirus metrics things like the the us government and election outcomes all sorts of things go to paulie.market and check out the markets that are available you can tweet about it and tag poly.market when you do and if you do that you can email hello at poly.market with bankless as the subject line and they will cover all of your gas fees so make sure you're using poly market email hello poly dot market with bank list in the subject line they will cover your gas fees which are not insubstantial at this point in time so check it out check the show notes out and get into the prediction market landscape all right our second sponsor is ample fourth ample fourth is a pretty interesting experiment going on in ethereum right now ample fourth is a base money asset right so it's an it's trying to be an m0 and it has this clever little mechanism built into it so it tracks 2019 and but it's not a stable coin and so it has this very interesting mechanism where as the price of ample force goes up and down it will rebase and so if the price is above a dollar it will rebase by minting everyone new apples to bring that price down and if it's below a dollar it will do the opposite and it'll burn apples from people's wallets to bring that price back up right and so it has similar values to bitcoin in that it's non-dilutive and so if you own one percent of ample fourth tokens you will always own all one percent of all ample worth tokens no matter how many there are no matter how many no matter what the rebases do and it's meant to be a a non-correlative asset to crypto right it's supposed to be collateral for d5 that doesn't act like the collect the rest of the collateral for defy so you can check them out at amplefourth.org you can take part in the amplifor's liquidity mining by going to geyser.ampleforth.org and submitting ample and eth to the unit swap pool to get a little bit of extra rewards speaking of ample fourth and this crazy rebase mechanism that drives this thing uh we are going to talk about something brand new to the to the crypto space as of today and i'm going to share my screen here and it's called yams all right wait wait wait wait yams so like yams as in like the vegetable yeah ams as in the vegetable apparently okay and apparently there's an emoji for yams i didn't realize that i did not know i knew there was a zucchini yeah but we have an emoji for yams yeah so yam is this thing it got released today actually this this post went out 10 a.m uh august 11th which for me that was an hour and 10 minutes ago uh and so some people have been teasing this a little bit a little bit earlier which is why we know to cover it but i've just been reading it and i want to share it now i'm calling it yample because it's very much ample forth but it's it's an experiment in fair farming governance and elasticity and so take ample and take the wi-fi the yiffy the urine distribution mechanism and combine them together and that's more or less what you get with yam all right hold on for a second so you said take ample i i hope people were paying attention when you were talking about uh ample fourth as a as kind of a a sponsor for bankless and you had this great meet the nation where you actually interviewed one of the co-founders of ample and went in depth on what apple is but should we maybe start david with a recap of what ample actually is yeah people miss what you just said in the sponsorship the sponsor of the sponsor yeah so ample forth goes up and down in price as all tokens do right because when there is a specific number of units out there for a given period that unit doesn't go um is it there isn't any more or less of that that unit for that one time period so like bitcoin or like other assets the price fluctuates the only thing that ample fourth does differently is that it tracks using an oracle it tracks the price of the amplifor token on secondary markets like uniswap and then it rebases which means it adds more to the supply or removes from the supply an appropriate amount to keep that price roughly targeting dollars so it's not it's not a stable coin it's just as volatile as bitcoin but the unit of account stay like tracks a dollar over time and so the yam token does that too but it also does some other things as well right and so okay real quick though why is that useful david so obviously um it's really exciting when like we have tokens that are scarce supply because it creates sort of a a scarcity game i don't always call this people hate the word ponzi right but so like there's ponzi schemes that are ripping you off and then there's transparent ponzi's which are like games and i would say bitcoin is like a transparent ponzi game everyone's bitcoiners in their hearts would admit this too everyone is trying to collect um their portion of the 21 million bitcoins that's the game right so this is like a game it's a scarcity game but the difference one difference at least it doesn't have bitcoins longevity doesn't have all sorts of things doesn't have its own blockchain it's all based on ethereum but one of the key differences as well is this it's trying to rebase itself as close as possible to a dollar every day why is that even useful yeah so the the jury is kind of actually still out on why this is useful my answer for this is that it acts as trustless uh collateral for defy that you are going to be comfortable paying back in the future like no matter what right so like the market cap of ample fourth could go from something really really small to really really big but if you owe 10 ample fourth tokens and 10 amples like you're only going to be paying back 10 dollars plus or minus a couple percentage fluctuation you're doesn't matter what the the market cap of the network did you always will pay back roughly the same purchasing power in order to pay back your debts and so it's a trustless way to denominate debts over the long term and so this really differentiates itself from dye or a stable coin especially uscc because it's relatively trusted and then die as people criticize die more and more and more for onboarding centralized assets ample force gets more and more relevant because it's there's no dye isn't an m0 dies in m1 which means it's created by a collateral ampliforth is itself collateral that's the mean yeah right exactly and some people would say it's uh it's not a good m0 at all and i totally agree what makes it m0 good is is basically liquidity the most saleable asset is what makes an m0 good um but there is something to what you said i think again this is a a totally an experiment but when people define even economists define what money is they usually look at three attributes but there's actually four attributes so they always talk about store value medium of exchange and unit of account but other economists add a fourth and that's unit of deferred settlement unit of deferred settlement so that's like unit of account but unit of account specific to loans right and the reason the u.s dollar reigns supreme basically as the world's reserve currency is because most debt most loans are denominated in u.s dollars so this fourth attribute unit of deferred settlement is actually pretty important that's the experiment it seems like ample forth is iterating on but a lot of people david don't like ample fourth and i think when you boil it all down it kind of is because of one thing it's not that they don't appreciate like understand the mechanism of it um i think at least the smart folks that i've talked to it's that they don't like the initial distribution of ample forth a large portion of amps were distributed to investors to kind of fund the team from the original idea right and that's the aspect that folks don't like it's not as organic vcs are actually involved the team has bags quote unquote um and a lot of people when when you boil it all down seem to be up in arms about that specific aspect of it would you agree yes they're they're just distrustful of people's whose incentive is to like shield their back and ample forth is kind of caught in this rock and the hard place where the project is about the token where like things like ave or compound or maker it's they're not centered around the token they're centered around a product or service whereas amplifier is centered around this token which kind of puts the team in this hard difficult spot of like yeah we're trying to grow our product and service and our product and service is this token so that that's difficult and so yeah so i i know i derailed you david but i wanted to get that out there uh so tell us what yams are yeah no it's good context yeah so yams are something similar and also something completely different right so you can kind of think this as a competitor to ample fourth but you would also be missing a very large component of what makes yams work and also ample fourth strictly has in its values that it's a trustless government governance minimized system and amp and yams are not that they are welcoming governance uh and um and that that's a very key differentiator because trustless m0s need to be without governance and this has uh something else it has a governance function and something else as well that amplifor doesn't have but first of all the thing they did first is as i understand it and again we're just like kind of learning about this now because it's totally fresh the first thing they did was they forked ample forth right so this is a fork of ample forth uh is it not maybe fork is the wrong uh forking takes means that you're taking that code and then you're changing it and then you're redeploying it what they're really doing is they're taking the code of ample forth and they're taking the code of compounds governance mechanism and they're taking the not the code but like the pattern of yfi iffy distribution and they're combining that all into one thing right there and so it's it's taking a bunch of different features and combining it into this one project so they're not forking the code per se they're more like focus forking the meme right they're more forking the issuance policy and the entire idea here right right yes we're we're working ideas more than we are code um interesting the ampliforth code might be an actual fork but again if you compare this ample forth you're missing you're missing out on what this really is okay so the yam token very much like ample fourth tracks a dollar right so that that's the same that's that's very very much the same there's a governable treasury force for promoting the yam system right and that's very very different there's a treasury of funds that aren't denominated in yams that is governed by the yam token holders very much like wi-fi very much like yiffi and and then also there's this distribution mechanism that incentivizes community members and and to to take control over yams and have this fair launch right okay the key difference here is that i'm going to scroll down real quick um the key difference here is that when a rebase happens for yam just like a year renault rebase happens in ample fourth tokens are minted and added to the total supply uh that's shared throughout everyone right so if 10 if you own a thousand yams and then they meant 10 to the rebase mechanism mints 10 more you will have a thousand 100 yams the only the only difference is that when a rebase happens 10 of the newly issued yams goes to purchasing the y curve token and the y curve token for you those that don't know is like a very high yielding stable coin asset right so it's it's the y curve is um the y die y tether y usdc yb usd all the all the y stable coins which are stable coins to submitted to liquidity in the curve protocol when you combine all those together they create the y curve token so it is so y curve is like a super stable it's like a meta stable coin right right why can't it's a stable coin meta made it okay so y curve the token itself is like a stable coin that an portion is die a portion is uh busd a portion is usdc all the other popular simple coins on ethereum and i b does y curve as well uh entitle um you to curves transaction fees yes and so so why die receives uh this is really stretching my capacity of understanding the these systems my die receives yield from people using curve and dye right and so does why tether so does y uscc and then when you combine all those together you get y crv right okay but it's it's going to track the dollar it's just like a super meta stable coin that's kind of almost diversified it's risk across multiple you know stable coins but also adds the risk of of curve right exactly and but then and then there's also yield right and so it's purchasing so when 10 of the rebase for yams happens 10 goes to purchasing y curve and adds that to the treasury so what's happening is a little bit of money printer a money printer's going on where they're printing money to purchase other money to add it to the treasury which the yam token governs over right okay so that's kind of the big value prop of yam is that over time uh the treasury of yam gets larger because of the rebase and the rebase right so this is how ample fourth basically works the same a similar way is there's a there's a rebase so what will happen is when lots of people are bullish on amples just in general for whatever reason then apples float above a dollar so they'll start trading at two dollars or they'll start trading at three dollars i've even seen it close to four dollars trading and then what happens is more supply is printed essentially during that rebase to dr in an attempt algorithmically to drop the price of ample closer to one dollar so that's how it's packing and this works the same way except that a portion of that rebase on the upside so say yams were trading at three dollars for instance 10 of the rebase amount would be taken and parked into a uh the you know a governance fund a treasury of some sorts yeah and that that treasury would essentially be sort of the almost like the the base utility value that's backing all of the yams in existence is that right right right so kind of it kind of turns the y curve as like the deposits of the system and then the yam as the credit of the system and you can buy the yams on the secondary market as credits to access the deposits of the y curve right um and so now we have to get into the distribution right so there's eight different pools of yams that will send out yam tokens to those that supply the tokens to them and so let's go we can go to the yam website right and so this is what you'll see when you go to the yam website you depending on what tribe you consider yourself or if you're like a link marine if you're if you're a spartan if you're a maker whatever i i like how they turn every single one of these is an emoji of source um so you can take your asset of choice and deposit it and that deposit deposits it into the into the quote-unquote farm for that particular yam and this is just a distribution mechanism your assets aren't doing anything in here they're just being there no one is no one's on the other side of this this is just proof of locked up capital so that you can receive the yam token right you just it's not at risk except for the fact that it's out of your wallet it's not out yes because it's not being borrowed against nothing's happening you're just locking up capital right and to to be clear david none of the yam initial supply was uh awarded to a team pre-mined venture capital funded none of it right well yeah let's go to the ether scan page and we can see where all the m tokens are right so with the holders there are eight addresses each holding a quarter million yam tokens and then there's one two three four five six seven eight uh pools for depositing assets to get uh the m token so we can assume that these eight pools each with a little bit over seven percent of the supply uh correlates to one of these pools that we see on the yam website by the way this goes live in 30 minutes uh from this time of recording so by the time the viewers are watching this this is uh this is already live just live for the first day right yeah and then so but this says 3.5 million and there's i thought there's five million yeah so on this uh on the medium page which is like the announcement it says um there's 202 million distributed 250 000 yen per pool over seven days launching in 30 minutes uh but there is a total supply of five million yeah i don't know where that comes i don't know where those are i don't know well is that a pre-mine i don't know but he's getting the two million i don't know yeah but they actually don't according to etherscan they don't exist so are they deciding to award those later that's interesting so so here's one here's one thing that is happening um in in another pool i think somebody has there must be a multi-sig that controls the yam printing you know minting but it sounds like in after this phase is done there's gonna be a second phase where three million more yam get distributed through the yam y curve unit swap uh v2 uh liquidity right so yam is supposed to track a dollar and so it's going to be paired against y curve to give yam the liquidity this is like this is like the ample fourth geyser program yeah i got it yeah so that you're gonna there's gonna be liquidity incentives for depositing y curve and yam tokens into unit swap so it feels like phase one is they're trying to exceed some distribution almost in a wi-fi type way if people are familiar with wi-fi like go listen to our andre podcast came out this week like get familiar with that and then so they're distributing it not to vcs and and and you know kind of investors and that sort of thing they're distributed to liquidity providers and then phase two is they're trying to um incentivize liquidity and by the way incentivizing liquidity has been incredibly um uh it's worked really well for ample forth like they were you know number number two something like number one number one number one long shot on unison on unit swap right okay and and so liquidity uh incentivization does work and has seemed to work with uniswap so this is like the playbook almost but with a different distribution we need to find out where that other like the 3.5 million right we've got 3.5 million tokens this is 5 million i'm wondering about where's that other 1.5 yeah wait so 2 million into the pools yeah 250 000 yen per pool yeah and so you know here's here they are um but yeah so this is weird so when you add up eight times 250 you get to oh man quick math you get to 2 million and then there's but there's 350 million yams here so there's some unaccounted for that it hasn't popped up on ether scan yet and that's just a mechanism of a per specific contract in erc20 tokens that sometimes people don't include for whatever reason are they are we sure they're not like doing anything else they're not printing some for their i don't know where well so this is this is according to this um post they're very specifically trying to make a non vc printed uh token right so they're trying what are they saying what do they say explicitly anywhere that the em team doesn't get anything and no one gets anything aside from these liquidity yeah i don't think there is a yam team right there's just the people that made this thing and i don't think they they would call themselves the team right and so a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance um i guess that doesn't you know no one is saying in this post explicitly that um aside from these you know nobility mechanisms no one else is getting it well it does say that yeah right right here right here all right well the post says it yeah i'm just getting distributed in the spirit of wi-fi no premium no founder shares no vc interest simple equal opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision to line community to steward the future of the protocol in tokyo all right so i'm assuming that's true and assuming that is true um i don't know brock trent or clinton but i do know dan and i do know will will and i like those guys so so what's that so if we were to kind of summarize the difference here um the difference it seems to me make sure i capture this between ample fourth and yams are obviously length of time alive but um like one is uh yams has a reserve they set aside ample fourth has no reserve so basically there's no underlying value besides the value of ample forts amps are the reserve right and so this has a 10 or so it's going to set aside in some sort of a treasury and you would assume that the market would value like th that the price of yams would not drop below the value of that treasury you know you might make that assumption because it's sort of it's a treasury that backs the value of yams right so that's one difference there's some base backing reserve almost like central banks have like you know a reserve of other assets like gold and that sort of thing um and the second difference is governance right right so huge difference that's a huge difference okay so govern governances yam token holders they get to vote on what can be done with that treasury and they vote on other aspects of governing the protocol in a similar way of wi-fi whereas ample fourth is a bit more governance minimizing when you right right and i don't even think that it's right to compare these things because they're achieving totally separate goals they have similar mechanisms but they have totally different like success uh success scenarios right and so like um yam is really a hybrid platypus between uh yiffia and yearn and ampliforth right but it's they're not competitors like nine and i i would maybe even say that yam and yiffi are more competitors than yam and you think so so i so it seems to me what yam is trying to do is compete as a base uh money zero and m zero just like ample fourth whereas iffy is is trying to it's a capital asset right very clearly yes yes i think that is an uh uh do you think it's the value of vm there's no fees associated with it what do you mean oh did i did you hear me what i said so um yeah so i think that i think we were um we got like a little disconnected there for a second um so i think that it seems to me that ample is competing in the same way that yams are as a m0 because like there's no underlying transaction fees like with yiffi wi-fi there's wifey we keep saying iffy yeah that's my bad um so with wifey there is like the transaction fees from the protocol ultimately you know it's kind of a cash flow this has no cash flows aside from the reserve it's set aside as that 10 reserve but everything above that 10 reserve of the value of y curve tokens that's all like monetary premium territory right wouldn't you say yeah yeah so it's a little bit of both it it splits it really actually does split wiring yearn yiffy wiffy wifey whatever it really splits that and ampliforth right down the middle uh and constructs its own thing so um i i think when you say that you think that yam competes with ample forth i think that that will be up to the yam token holders as to how they perceive yams role in ethereum because you know these four these five they're calling themselves the horticulturists horticulturalists brock trent clinton dan will they they are spinning up this system but they don't own the system yeah the whole idea is that day one is in the hands of the community so if the community will decide like what what role does the yam token fulfill in ethereum no way that's interesting so but it is a double-edged sword to add governance right so like with ample um no amount of ample the token at least entitles you to govern governance correct right and people would say look it's still centralized because there's a central team absolutely i understand right you can change the code that sort of thing but with this governance of token holders like they can vote like so yes um 51 of yam token holders could say we want to print all future supply of vm directly to like this specific set of addresses right right whereas in ample fourth there's no protocol mechanism for governance to do that right nope that's a double-edged sword though because that could be bad for a base money system yep yep base money system and governance are kind of like oil and water but again we will see what happens the cool thing about this is um the wi-fi distribution i think yes and this is also yield farming for beginners because all you do is like you probably if you're listening to this you probably have one of these assets right you probably have ave or link or synthetics or a maker or comp or wi-fi you probably oh at the very least you have w eth you have wrapped either you have something here and all you have to do is you deposit it that's that's all you do and this is the point where we say um don't deposit anything that you're not willing to lose yeah right because there's no audits no audits no audits big audits none while the initial creators of the yam protocol have made reasonable efforts to attempt to ensure the security of the contracts including forking much of the code base from existing well-audited projects and soliciting review from friends nothing approaching the rigor of a formal audit has been conducted at this time we strongly urge the contra the caution to anyone who chooses to engage with these contracts and think a proper professional audit would be highly advisable if the project gets any meaningful use this was a 10-day project from start to launch they started this 10 days ago this is completely like right out the gate so this is this is your own risk this is andre's i test in prod this is what's happened here they're testing and prod this whole thing could get hacked in a heartbeat in a second in fact as soon as it received some attention you can bet there are some smart people looking at how they can exploit the vulnerabilities of this thing right so if you choose to do this um and we don't recommend that anyone we're there's not financial advice we don't recommend anyone chooses to use these d5 protocols but this is like on the spectrum of risk this is like like code red super risky you know you could lose anything you put into this thing yeah if you guys watched my settlement assurances and protocol sync thesis talk at ethereal i talked about the time value locked metric for evaluating d5 protocols right so like maker dow has a really high time value locked it's had a lot of value locked in its contracts for a lot of time this has had zero dollars locked for zero seconds it is literally the worst time locked value score you could have and the only unaudited plus on audit unaudited so the only way that you get time value locked is more value flows into the contract um so it's kind of like a a chicken and egg debate but and when it comes to lindy this has zero zero lindy yeah i don't know how much more we can say about how risky this is it's just super freaking risky i mean i did i had a tweet last week where i just i feel like some people aren't appreciating the risks of d5 david like it's just like or they aren't appreciating that other people are talking about the risk of d5 this whole place the whole defy bankless thing we talk about like that should be wrapped in police caution tape like do not cross unless you know look at a chunk of a building could fall on your head and wipe you out right like this is like dangerous stuff defy is not safe so keep that into context other things are safer than others but like some things are safer than others but if you're entering all of this stuff none of it is risk-free all of it's risky could lose everything this is the most extreme like one of the most extreme sorts of things that we see it does not appear to be a scam right um does that does not appear to be a scam these are some legitimate names but that doesn't mean you know that doesn't mean much in terms of the risk it means a little bit i guess but um very risky anyway anything else nothing for me nothing about yams it's called we're calling it yample it's the apple it's ample now stacking amps all right uh what else should we talk about my friend um what's going on huh dexes okay dexter's are blowing up right in a good way yes in the way that we like like in a good way right it's finally hitting product market fit i'm gonna pull up um a tweet from hayden about dex volume well you may be intro us to uh into what's happening in the dex world because it's uh it's getting really excited yeah so this is this is one of those metrics that really indicates that all of the action is happening inside of defy right and that epicenter right now is uniswap and we know this because units for tokens new newly issued tokens are getting on list listed on uniswap first before any other exchange finance just listed wi-fi effie token uh two day yesterday a full two weeks after it's genesis so like still pretty fast but also two weeks behind unitop because uniswap is permissionless like the unit swap didn't need to wait for andre to whitelist it on unit swap that's not how it works uh still yet to be on coinbase uh and so like the epicenter of this whole uh boom that's going on in is unit swap right like all the volume is on unit swap it's dwarfing centralized exchanges um i don't know off the top of my head how much volume there is on a coin based exchange on a daily or weekly or monthly basis but i bet you if we saw a comparison of various centralized exchanges and then you you would have unit swap b up there in those numbers look at this seven day volume if you extrapolate that 34 billion dollars in volume and uh annualized yeah that that's insane i mean that's a very large ex exchange at this point i mean that is that has got to be um eeking up to even you know the krakens of the world let's say that tier of exchange yep that's crazy i'm trying to find a tweet real quick so i can send it to you but uh basically it is uh yeah here i'm gonna send this to you uh ryan in uh zoom uh notes so you can display this one uh this one just came out today um if unit swap was an l1 blockchain it would be third what in fees i'm pulling it up in fees and and this was actually a little bit late i there were there was an earlier uh image that uh that showed like uniswap was at like point seven um holy crap point seven million in one day fees and bitcoin was at like uh point nine and so like unit swap is almost as big as bitcoin and how many fees it's it's the volume what fees are these are these gas fees uh no exchange fees knock knock ass fees exchange fees right and so this is the 3.3 percent on every single uniswap trade that is what this is talking about right so just uniswap is taking um a comparable amount of fees as the entire bitcoin blockchain and we said taking but the interesting thing about uniswap is they are these fees are going directly to liquidity providers right so like it's not it's not going to the you know swap team it's not going anywhere it's going to a nebulous set of liquidity providers whoever they are this is a an incentive liquidity incentivization mechanism now something else that i've been you know watching with unit swap is just last week they announced 11 million in funding which is interesting right and i wonder how that like they've been a funded team before they were obviously um you know the story of uniswap is uh hayden who developed it received a like a hundred thousand dollar something grant from the ethereum foundation built the whole thing his first programming project launched it and it you know it was it was it was pretty popular from day one um but now they're starting to get funding which leads me to wonder as to what they're actually going to do like is a token going to be next right are they going to go the way of cop or balancer which we've seen and create sort of a capital asset out of these fees and will a portion of this that capital asset be like re rewarded or awarded to vcs which is interesting what do you think about that yeah um while i talk about what i think about that go ahead and go to that link that i just sent you because that would be fun too um so for every fully governed governance minimized governance reduced protocol like uniswap for every uh protocol that is entirely trustless entirely like hands-off there is also the governable hands-on version of that right so balancer has both of these right the cool thing about bouncer is it launched with both of these at once where you can have your own native balancer uh pool that doesn't answer to the balancer token or you can and so and so uniswap is the non-governance application and there's probably a version of unit swap that can be governed that would then justify the unit swap token and so that is perhaps my idea as to what's going on we will see that graphic is so cool all right this is it's called this pacman yeah yeah all the this is a graphic of all the um uh transactions going on over at a specific period or active addresses that have that are really like heavy defy users right these are the users and each of these by the way each of these users some people think they're individuals we've talked about before on bankless state of the nation david that it's not so much don't think of that as one-to-one mapping of individuals it's one-to-one mapping to a bank account an ethereum address is like a bank account and a bank account is a capital pool that can represent one individual or many individuals could represent hundreds of thousands of individuals right right anyway yeah and this graphic just shows exactly how where unit swap is in relation to the rest of the d5 ecosystem which is at the epicenter right so there's all this economic activity between you know synthetics kyber ddx um you know bancor auger compound maker but then there's uniswap that is like basically connected to everything so like whenever there's a transaction going on on compound or aggro or something there's it's always seemingly one transaction away from you to swap right so like no matter whatever people are doing they're going through uniswap to go through other protocols and so unit swap is just like this this volume uh pac-man that's just munching on all the liquidity in the space right what is oh okay so all that redness center it that's um usage accounts etherdresses that are shared by three or more protocols so there's a whole bunch of accounts it looks like that are just using uniswap right that's what that means if it's just um on its own so if it's yellow then it means um it's being shared by one or more particles but all of this kind of pink color unisop color some people are just going to d5 just to use uniswap it looks like yeah like one way to view this all these pink dots all these uh these are all ethereum accounts that are just using uniswap and there's a lot of them there's more than there's ever been before to me this is uh a bunch of new entrants into d5 because uniswap is the easiest protocol to use uh it's the ui is is super elegant and it's the place where you go to buy all these defy tokens that are mooning and so this massive array of pink dots that are people who are just using one protocol are the new entrances into d5 and eventually over time i predict that they will migrate into being becoming yellow and then also orange red dots which are you know turning into d5 super users right they're using multiple protocols but right now unit swap is like the first stop just a story just you know evidence of this empirically i had a text from a friend a couple weeks ago he said he's just a coinbase user and he's like hey i want to do some stuff with defy tokens and he listed a few that he's interested in and he's like how do i do it and i can't get those in coinbase right so we traded a text message back and forth and he was motivated because of the speculation of defy tokens and he'd never been motivated before but within 45 minutes he you know set up a metamask account had his first uniswap transaction completed and was one of those pink dots basically um it's it's difficult but at this point in time it's not that difficult i mean two or three years ago like none of these dots existed there was maybe maker there's maker on this just maker um very far left very far left yeah it's just maker and all of these dots are just that's in the past you know year and a half two years right crazy crazy stuff yep um it looks like we are moving forward pretty fast maybe at an accelerated pace uh should we wrap up with this i think that i think that's it that is the state of the nation all right state of the nation today action items we will include a few in the show notes one of course is to verify each supply yourself we talked about that at first don't trust what you read necessarily on twitter um dig a little deeper i think bank listeners generally do we'll include some links to yam and yam farming again appreciate the risks before you do anything with that but it is another fascinating monetary experiment and lastly we'll include some links to check out some of the the dex usage uh in in as well so you can see how that is growing too um guys none of this was financial advice eth bitcoin all the d5 protocols we always discuss are very risky you could lose what you put in this has been bankless state of the nation episode nine thanks a lot
