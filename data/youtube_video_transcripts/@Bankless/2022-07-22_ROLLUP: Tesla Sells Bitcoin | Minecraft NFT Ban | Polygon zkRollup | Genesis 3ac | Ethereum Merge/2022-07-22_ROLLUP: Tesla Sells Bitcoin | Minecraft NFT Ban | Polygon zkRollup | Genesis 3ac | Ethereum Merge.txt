is the bear market over happy third week of july bankless nation are you ready for it i hope you are it's another weekly roll up where david and i download the week and david today you are coming in from paris france right yeah yeah so at ecc now where it all began meaning uh a year ago ecc a year ago was like the first conference that really kicked off conference season and then just like a mania of conferences after that uh but now it's a year later and it's crazy that it's only been one year since like the last ecc which really really it kicked off in real life crypto for so many people all the conferences and conference goers of the world uh so much has happened in the last year um vitalik had his talk about um uh non-financial use cases of blockchains a year ago and then like about six months later we have things like lens protocol gets shipped uh and then like soulbound tokens captures like everyone's attention and we have like uh verifiable credentials and so he just had a talk today i actually didn't listen to it because um i had to come do this um but i was talking to him in my quick little interview which we'll talk more about later i was like vitalik what's what are you going to talk about this year what are we going to be focusing on in about six months as a result of this talk you're about to give uh and so i asked that question in a little interview imagine the power of to speak things into existence you're just like i think it'd be cool if we did this and then boom this stuff starts happening but i know you brought a lot of content home with you from eat cc and the great thing about it is um guys you know bakeless i uh i don't get out as much as david of course you guys know this right so david hits all of the conferences for me and for all of us collectively because we can't go to everything and i think you've brought home like two hours of content or something like this a whole bunch of interviews i haven't even seen some of this stuff but you're gonna have to wait in line like everyone else ryan are you gonna are you gonna tell us about that now are you gonna tease that and we'll talk about it toward the end of this episode i'll just say i interviewed eight people from across the ecosystem we'll talk a little bit more uh about some okay here here's one here's uh here's a little bit um i asked kane about his fight with suzu so that was pretty fun and then i also asked the stark ray team if they if they would ever um move starkware the layer two into sharkware at the layer one um so yeah things just have a little bit more spiciness in real life uh and so i enjoyed that angle i love that uh thanks for being spicy man these are the questions people want answered but guys we have some of the topics that i think you're going to want to hear about because the roll-up the purpose of this show that we do every single friday and i hope you're enjoying your morning coffee people are like why coffee why not herbal tea whatever your hot beverage of choice is i hope you are if it's only black coffee it's coffee if you add anything to it it's a beverage see like more of this uh carbs minimalism coming out of david i don't know but uh we've got some topics to cover we're gonna get through them in just a minute the first is the question on everyone's mind i think is is the merch being priced in okay eath prices are way up from the bottom but what's that the bottom the question is was this the shortest bear market ever what else we gonna talk about this week you know uh not too long ago ryan there was the phone wars week where like solana launched its phone and then we had like three more like phone things get released all in the same week like weird that happened the same week well this week it's zk evm week uh so polygon just announced their zk evm evm equivalent um so did so did zk sync and then also scroll uh also another zk evm also announced their z key zk evm uh announcement uh so i guess this week is just cke vm week and so we'll talk about why everyone's so excited about the zkm there's also we get to actually get super detailed uh report as to what actually backs a usdc so we'll talk about that and of course it's never ending ryan the three arrow saga continues um as it i probably will next week and the week after and the week after i bet guys quick psa for you as well did you know if you're listening to bankless on spotify you can also see bank list on spotify this is a new feature that they just launched they pick bank list as a podcast that they're co-launching this with where inside of the spotify app you actually get video so go check that out on spotify i uh watch some of the podcasts i enjoy this way as well it's kind of a cool format and it gets some distribution outside of youtube so we've got a few different ways we are distributing bankless visual content uh and we do have some visuals in the show so it can be useful to go check that out uh david did you know ryan that on the on the road uh people that listen to the podcast often think i'm ryan because they don't know what we look like no way yeah they say they're very frequently like oh ryan from bangladesh i'm like no the other one because they've never seen your face yeah they don't know what we like yeah guys if you don't know what david or myself look like you're missing out you've got some pretty faces you're missing out on at least one of us okay [Laughter] but go check out spotify just catch a glimpse if you see if it's us in person you'll know who's david and who's ryan um we have nice cameras guys yeah we have okay cameras that's right uh david we got to also talk about our friends and sponsors rhinofi this is the company that used to be called diversify this originally was a fantastic decentralized exchange doing it the right way completely non-custodial completely bankless built on starkware technology so built on a layer two just like dydx now they are expanding so they're rebranding they're going like i guess it's grab d5 by the horns is that a slogan they're using if not they should yeah okay appreciate it isn't it it's rhinophy and it's no longer just trading we've got some other money verbs in there that you can do david i'm gonna pop this open so people can see what's happening in rhinophy and uh tell us what else you can do in the rhinophy app right now ratify is just obfuscating or abstracting a lot of the complexity of the multi-chain universe uh we all know that that's where we're going whether you believe is a multi-layer one or multi-layer two or both uh rhino5 just abstracts so many of the layers so you can do your d5 things regardless of what chain it's on because honestly sometimes you just don't really care what chain it's on you just want to do the thing and rhinophyte lets you do the thing without having to think about the chain that's behind the thing and so you can invest and get yield as we all do and know and love you can put money into lps you can just do you know the basic trades and swaps um so you can check it out uh there is a link in the show notes to go there yeah i really feel like this is worth bookmarking because it's gonna be an app that's gonna get better and better and of course because you're on layer two you get to save on all of the transaction fees you can also sign up to hear about randify's mystery airdrop that's going to be coming they're dropping some cash with that uh 5 000 something to this effect so go click the link in the show notes sign up for that so you won't miss out on another airdrop david let's get to markets man bitcoin we got the happy music playing we should play some happy music in the background because uh we're up a little bit on the week let me share the bitcoin charts and you tell us what's going on yeah bitcoin up about 11 this week it started about 20 dollars and we are up to twenty two thousand six hundred dollars eleven percent double digit percent you you can't be sad about that that is a good week i'm not sad about that i'm very happy about that actually and uh tells a similar story what are we looking at here uh more more than 11 ryan uh ethan is up 31 uh going up from about 1150 to where it is now at 1500 it hit uh 1 650 at the peak which is pretty crazy that's pretty crazy that is a good week there's not very many weeks that you see 30 in a blue chip like eth no that's huge right and so let's get into it because the question on everyone's mind i think is two-fold right so we have the first question of is the bear market over and everyone always asks this right question but but the truth is ethan's up 73 from lowe's at least it went up that high uh eth lows if you recall look at this david 8.97 was the low we got into triple digits we got like that makes my 904 dollar buy feel really good yeah we just wow you got one of those i got a 904 yeah i hope it was a big one you may have time but that was only a month ago guys right all right and now of course because price drives narrative as we all know price drives sentiment as we all know a bunch of people are asking is the bear market over crypto's up it must be over um crypto market cap is over a trillion dollars so that's one question the other question is well um it seems like eth went up a whole lot more than bitcoin this week is news of the merge finally getting priced in let's take those questions one at a time so first bullish david is the bear market over what what's the case for that what's the case whatever whatever you say i'll make the case for the opposite case so why why why you tell us about the bear market i think it's actually worth going back and to the 2022 predictions uh post that we made at bankless um i said um one of my predictions uh was that the the merge would happen in 2022 and that ether will not be in a bear market about three to six months post-merge as in like the the effects of the merge would cause not necessarily a bull market but like we would be out of the bear market as a result of the merge and you're starting to see that being priced in like right now like this is clearly and unequivocally absolutely the merge having a price impact on ether the asset today uh we go for you like not very even in a bull market even in the mania it is not it takes a lot for something to go up 30 in one week it takes a lot more for something to go 30 up 30 in a bear market going on but that's okay granted we bottomed at 900 and things generally bounce off of the bottom no matter what so if that was the bottom then you definitely get a bounce but like a bounce up to like 1100 1200 is a good trade what is that like 30 off the bottom but we went 30 more up off the bottom up to where we are now at 1500 um is the bear market over bear market is like it's kind of a sentiment like you're only in a bear market if you feel like you're in a bear market but i will say for me ryan fifteen hundred dollars does not feel like a bear market like that in the grand scheme of things like 500 is actually pretty expensive like that's that's that's four digits there's four digits in there so i think what people are asking are when we're in the bear market is is this just a temporary blip up before we take another plunge down to new lows that's really the big question are we gonna are we gonna hit new lows and so you know first of all i'll kind of address you your question your your thought about the merge being the eth effect the eth price jump is because of the merge i i completely agree with that actually and i i don't think i've ever seen the market price in some fundamentals in the way that i saw that happen this week like the market is kind of uh to be honest a short short term dumb like it doesn't uh i guess because in this case the merge as a fundamental is also a narrative the market only kind of prices narratives and so um now we see look at this difference down from all-time high we were at like 83 or something for eth and set you know low 70 percentages for bitcoin ethan's just caught right back up it's only 68 down from all-time high number and bitcoin is 67 down from all-time high and you can also see i mean look at this jump on the east bitcoin ratio uh we're up like 22 percent on the ratio so relative to bitcoin eth has gone up 22 and that has to be the merge so i'm with you on that i think the merge is starting to get priced in and it's just starting to get priced in all right so like maybe there's more to that to come but let me give kind of the bear case of like why we may not have hit the bottom yet david and i think when i heard it no you got to hear this okay and like i think some of the reasons that that um you stated you you make the argument for the for the bull case but what scares me most probably is uh macro the macro setup right we had luke gromin on the episode last week he's the worst he's ever seen in his career um we had travis kling on earlier this week and he talked about the macro setup and what happens if something breaks in the broader macro environment the fed raises rates too quickly bond markets break what's happening with the euro what's happening with the yen now like everything in macro is feeling kind of shaky and merge or not if something breaks or something gets really shaky in macro like we're going down and we ain't seen the bottom yet in my opinion i don't think the the merge can save us if that is the setup and if that's what we go to and i would also say recall 2018 all right we go go down 80 percent something like this and we would pop back up and everyone be like oh it's over that was the dip i hope you bought the dip did you buy the dip and then back down again and the plunge was even lower than the previous so this is also the nature of a recovery it's like a staggered recovery where you go up and you go down and you go up and you go down and it's like a staggered uh plunge as well on the way down we still might be in that staggered plunge area and um if if you were to ask me i'd still probably i'm probably 50 50 on it david that's probably where i am it's like both both are kind of equal probabilities one that we're done that we've hit the bottoms and the other that we've still got a ways to go what do you think about this yeah i think that's all a bunch of bs i think we had the body [Laughter] you ready to call it you're buying in now um i mean okay so like this falls into the same category that i see a lot of people doing it's like oh let's let's like retrofit 2018 and apply it to 2022. and yeah i mean to some degree like manias and bubbles and when when prices get out over their ski tips it's all going back to the same pattern which is like the human psyche so like yeah of course it's gonna repeat it's the human psyche that is making like bubbles happen um but that's actually different this is quote unquote is different this time because of the actual merge like the merge is the most it's the biggest catalyst in crypto ever like you would expect it to be different and the whole point of it is that it is different uh proof of ethereum moving to proof-of-stake is unlike any other proof-of-stake network the fundamentals behind ether the asset are unlike any other fundamentals and like so like this is this is not just some like narrative this actually this is supposed to show up in the charts let me ask though do you think it could overcome catastrophic or very bad macro news macro no i don't i don't think i don't think that it will however also on our show with grauman we also painted the picture of like okay macro could break and everything could go to zero and that'd be bad things one zero would be bad um but also there's the inverse side where like there's like a needle to thread where like the fred could turn on the money printer at the same time of the merge and that's uber bullish yeah and so those things cancel each other out and so i think you just like don't consider that at all and just like take it for what it is and and i what i see is the merge being priced in you know i actually think arthur hayes of bitmex made the best case for that um this week we're gonna get into that in a little bit but uh so guys stay tuned anyway this is the debate and the market is absolutely having this debate uh bear market or bull market not too sure but we do know that the merge is a positive catalyst i rattled off the market cap numbers but we're above a trillion now aren't we that's good news oh hooray i feel like that's a pretty safe bull bear market line is one trillion dollar market cap yeah it's uh it's definitely it's definitely a good meme line for sure uh jumping to uh this chart for a second this was interesting i saw this on twitter this week this is uh macro elf 200 years of inflation-adjusted returns for different asset classes we're all dead in 200 years but still quite interesting and showing a chart of assets over time here dave and this goes all the way back to the 1800s right so you kind of want to answer that question of everyone's asking what is the best asset class to hold for the long run even though you know things go down things go up if you're a long-term investor you want to know and you look at this annualized return over 200 years stocks 6.6 percent bonds 3.6 t bills 2.7 gold 0.1 percent u.s dollar negative 1.4 and i thought this was very interesting i have a caveat to this and a very important caveat but i want to get your reaction first what do you think this is telling us well my first thought is that if crypto is on this chart it's line would be like way higher than like 45 degrees it would be like 50 or 60 degrees yeah it's invisible on this chart it's yeah 10 years we don't we don't yeah we did not have crypto in 1802 so you know but uh like the annualized return of the crypto industry is it's something like 50 year-over-year which is absolutely insane and it's been like that ever since uh you know bitcoin started in 2009. uh that's really the only thing that i thought about when i saw this trade do you know i think the takeaways for many people in the traditional finance space are like oh this is why you should always hold stocks forever and gold is such a scam like gold is right but but here here's the problem with that and by the way everyone will agree holding fiat is a bad bad idea right do you remember the ray dalio book um that uh we just read um changing world orders changing world orders okay yeah this is just titles close enough this is just u.s assets all of these are u.s assets and the us has massive survivorship bias in that it basically became the world empire in the last 200 years and survived wars all sorts of like macro events this is like an example of a successful economy an empire go look at germany or how many times did they like reset their currency how many times did their stock market like go to zero basically go look at russia go look even at the uk and you have a vastly different picture so i think it's a a complete mistake for people to look at this especially when we're we're dealing with a changing world order right um to look at this and to say oh i should always hold all of my assets in u.s stocks this assumes a lot about the us's position of dominance in the future and you might not want to make that assumption and anyway it's just a fallacy i see when people throw up these charts because like if you were in germany for example you had no access to stocks germany during like during one of the uh intervening periods where the currency dropped to zero and you know stocks went to zero et cetera then gold was like the best option for you and so massive survivorship bias in this chart that's what i see yeah uh for the viewer you can just like imagine more or less like a wave uh and this is how ray dalio illustrates these things it's like we are stocks bonds bills gold knuckled um are riding the wave of the us economy and empires come and go uh and so this can be like in theory could be like the peak of a of a wave right and now we're on the decline um you just have to broaden your horizons and sometimes realize that things in the global order like they'd only change every like few hundred years uh and so you have to yeah you have to take care of what you want now yeah we're kind of in that in that phase um speaking of which let's talk about the dollar so the dixie is still uh crushing it super high dxy is up um i know we asked the question of what is it composed of the dxy composed of we've got a table of what it's composed of so what's in the dxy index why is it a measure of dollar strength and what is it measuring dollar strength against yeah 57 euros 13.6 percent japanese yen 11.9 british pound percent canadian dollar and we got tiny little bits of the the swedish corona okay uh and then switch frank uh and so yeah this is what the dxy measures against it's the strength of dollar against all of these things but it's basically the euro 60 the euro yeah absolutely so no wonder it is rising and i think that paints the picture and tees us up for arthur hayes take this week um did you read this article david i haven't read this one so you have to walk me through it oh it's so good okay so it's titled uh a samurai a night in a yankee um can you guess who those characters are uh i'm gonna go ahead and guess that is japan um uh british britain and the united states yeah nice so the you know the sammery uh samurai is the japanese central uh bank authority of the knight is the euros uh christine lagarde and the yankee is jerome powell anyway he he kind of walks through uh them all kind of meeting in this um in this in and talking anyway that's his that's his narrative tia but the summary of this article uh i'll read a quote from it um arthur hayes says i will argue that the only solution left for any governments of countries that are not productive is to pay back their debt loads by inflating them away any country that is not productive has to pay off its debt load by inflating it away all right and he goes through the reasons why the u.s is not nearly as productive as it once was uh for every dollar the government spends neither is europe neither is japan and so they're they're stuck in this position of having to inflate their debt away those similar themes we talked about lynn allen similar themes of lou grauman all of our macro podcasts uh and of course uh ray dalio but then he goes into the the setup right now the macro setup right now uh and so his first piece is europe and japan all right from an energy perspective they're in a bad place because they basically import all of their energy from other countries they don't have much internal energy production the us is in a different place from an energy perspective in that the u.s has a lot of its own natural resources it's a net exporter particularly natural gas is a strength and he goes through the problem with uh what the eu and japan are doing is they're inflating their currency they're effectively going into like yield curve control mode and they're inflating it against energy so they're issuing more of it and this is causing massive inflation for their people this is like a weimar republic type of play and i know luke graham had talked about this but they can't get cheap energy from russia because the war in ukraine the us doesn't want them to and so they're stuck in this rock and a hard place between their population is clamoring for like lower prices on all of their consumer products specifically energy and food and some others and yet they can't release the pressure due to like geopol geopolitics the us doesn't want them to maybe to some degree uh they don't want to as well so what's going to happen is the dxy is going to continue to rise the dollar is going to continue to get get stronger relative to those currencies we just talked about that basket of currencies and inflation in europe and japan will continue to rise until there's a breaking point and the population says enough is enough but the problem for japan and for europe is do they go back to russia and try to get some cheaper energy right and like the us doesn't want them to do that and so maybe the u.s says no there's some political tensions but they can't stay in their current state of continuing to inflate their currencies uh against energy and against the dollar so what do they do they have to go to the yankee they have to go to jerome powell the us government they have to go to treasury and they have to say hey you guys have to help us if you want us to continue sanction this hard you guys have to help us out and so what powell what treasury is going to have to end up doing is going and buying bonds buying japanese bonds buying euro bonds and effectively devaluing the dollar relative to these currencies making these currencies stronger okay what that's going to do is massively inflate the balance sheet of the fed now not only with you know u.s debt uh and u.s uh bond debt but also other sovereign countries dead particularly its allies that is kind of the way out and so what arthur predicts is going to happen is on the one hand powell is going to say yeah we're we're trying to crush inflation we're you know uh going hawkish on this we're increasing interest rates by like 0.75 percent yet again we'll continue doing it we're going to break the back of inflation i am paul voelker reincarnated watched me do this and the other hand he expects behind the scenes like treasury and us government to actually be being issuing more currency in order to buy the bonds of its allies okay that's the backdrop here if you play this out that's what arthur is is predicting but what this means david net net is probably very bullish for cryptocurrency particularly ether particularly bitcoin because whenever the money printer turns on that's when these assets climb that is the correlation that's been preserved from the beginning and right now we're in this phase of money printer is off right now temporarily there's some quantitative tightening going on but arthur predicts that it's going to have to be turned back on in order to bail out u.s allies and once that happens crypto will resume its ascent and take off so that's the thesis and to me it kind of um it's kind of an aggregation and consolidation of much of the macro discussion we've been having on bankless and i think it's a pretty reasonable prediction yeah and that maps onto it just like the general thesis that a lot of just uh i would say bitcoiners have about the state of fiat currencies in nation states is that you end up in debt and sure there's volatility sure you have bear markets but the long-term conclusion of the us dollar is to like inflate away to zero and all fiat currencies inflate away to zero and in that world it's just like bullish for like all assets absolutely uh let's talk about another uh blue chip or another question that we have which is um is d5 back all right so so some d5 blue chips i'm ready to be heard again are you ready to be heard again d5 blue chips have been climbing so particularly ave looking good uni looking good mkr also looking good uh and they've been climbing even relative to eth lately i know we have a chart up here what are we looking at david yeah that's the east dpi chart uh since genesis back in october of 2020 uh and in east terms it's like down only uh but it's been up since may um what is what is dpi david yeah dpi is a d5 pulse index it's just an index of a lot of d5 tokens uh and so i think of a unit swap is like the biggest one but there's of course there's maker ave uh sushi swaps in there a few other ones it's the blue just like all the d5 blue chips right uh and we've talked about the dpi before uh but we stopped re-including it in the weekly up because like every single week it was like sad and yeah there was no news it was just like yeah it's just down all the time um but not not in the last month or so ever since may uh it's been a little bit up uh so the er to dpi ratio was about four uh we are currently at point zero six two which is a healthy in uh percentage increase uh it topped out in the local high at the beginning of january at around point zero seven five but ryan we are still down very bigly versus east because it started like in 2021 at about 0.26 uh so one quarter of an eth was one dpi but now it's just .06 of an each is one dpi but we know that d5 protocols are super bullish because they keep on earning all the fees uh and so you can see on crypto fees just like there are meaningful days where uh synthetics and unit swap are beating bitcoin in daily fees uh and and so uh this in this particular day with this screenshot synthetics was behind bitcoin but synthetics is from uh if i'm recalling correctly earning more fees than bitcoin most of the time uh and that is a lot of fees unit swap just sweeping the floor of absolutely everything getting more protocol fees than ethereum is which is nuts uh and so like yeah like d5 tokens are down bad but they're all just like one fee swap fee switch away from just like earning a ton of money yeah i totally agree and david i know we've got some content coming on bank list on how to fix the economics and the governance of these d5 tokens because i feel like we've got product market fit we've got like successful protocols generating millions of in cash now we just got to figure out that fee switch component and then we're off to the races with defy tokens and i expect like much more of a recovery unit swap made 4.6 million dollars in one day on the protocol that is nuts yep one 4.6 million dollars a day pretty much all profit too it's like yeah not a lot of operations shut up that's fine tell them to tune into the roll up tomorrow and they'll understand why you're yelling i saw this chart this week on twitter so i thought about including it it's a an analysis on an ethereum address what do they do first on ethereum do they do a dex trade or do they buy an nft uh and the dex trade used to be in the lead uh for the majority of 2021 but it looks pretty clear that the recent trend is your first activity is more likely to be buying an nft than it is interacting with a decentralized exchange um i mean we kind of know this nfts are for everyone there's always an nfc out there for you no matter what uh if you haven't found if you don't like nfcs you just haven't found that one yet um and defy exchange stuff not necessarily for everyone you know nft is about the culture and then d5 is about finance do you think we can just extrapolate this and like nft is going to continue to lead defy as the way people access the space for the first time do you think that's true yeah i think that's right i mean um andrew steinwald said it right like erc20 tokens or currencies are meant to value stuff they're a measurement of stuff but nfts are the stuff so yeah there's going to be a bajillion nfts and only a handful of erc20 tokens that are like sustainable i guess in the real world there is much more non-fungible property than there is fungible property so that kind of maps to the the bits map to the atoms in this case uh and i have noticed david by the way that um you know the blue chip nfts seem to be doing okay like they seem to be holding up relative to to eth i think the crypto punk uh floor is like 80 right now 80 something feels good it's not too bad relative to eve um relatively fiat it's down pretty bad and like the ape floor is holding it's like in the 90s something like this so the blue chip nfts you would i think some people would have expected them to like really get crushed in each terms and they just haven't well yeah because you can't well first you can't take leverage on nfts so they're immune from that but also like if you're in a pinch you can't really sell an nft in a pinch so you people don't like people are kind of like buy it and hold it for life that's a really interesting take yeah i guess i guess they're not uh they're not selling maybe they're not for sellers too maybe it's a different type of uh individual holder what do we got covered you will be you will be able to leverage up on nfts later that is a fun yeah that is definitely coming and that's going to unlock some absolute degeneracy in this industry guys coming up next we're going to talk about merge dates has the merge date been announced maybe kind of not really but it's getting close maybe we're going to talk about that also uh it seems clear that it's zk roll up season but the big question is who's going to be first to market with the first zk evm roll up that is ethereum equivalency and also we're going to talk about the three era's capital uh again the saga continues more important documents released we're going to dive into what all of that means but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and

generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync the merge is coming the merge is coming ryan the merge is coming we kind of have a date maybe question mark um it is it is a actual date but also with the question mark it's a maybe date uh we are thinking about the 19th of september for the merge and so here is super fizz who pays attention to these things his tentative timeline uh this is also tim coming out of the all-code devs call okay so the uh gourley test net gets merged on the 11th of august uh and we are live streaming that on bank list so tune in for that uh and if that goes well uh the all-court debts call after that i believe on the 18th we'll plan the next merge uh and uh that will uh trigger like the bellatrix and uh that other name of that test that i can't remember uh that whole client will get released all those the client software that i don't really know the name i can't really remember go watch the episode with tim baker if you want those details uh that will happen two weeks after the august scorely merge and then we will merge two weeks after that so august 18th is the all-core devs call to pay attention to uh but it is tentatively looking like possibly september 19th two weeks after that call again this is not official this is speculation but the the dates are becoming more and more clear um everyone is super hungry for this including the developers so merge date question mark yeah that's it and so you'll find out more we'll know more after the august 18th uh whether the gourley test net was successful or failed the previous dress rehearsals have been successes right you kind of expect this one to be and if it is successful i've heard people the hell presses of the world talk about the merge probability as as high as 95 in september september yeah so this is the next key event and we'll know much more in the next two to three weeks about this so so obviously the whole entire industry has their eyes on the east price because of the merge but like if you really want to lean into this like there's plenty of derivative tokens that are going to have plenty of merge exposure um lido and rocket pool being the obvious ones but there are also some extremely undervalued staking as a service tokens that are out there uh we are actually going to be doing an article on this on bankless but if you want to do your own research and get ahead of the game there's your alpha you're welcome yeah and by the way alpha go subscribe to bankless newsletter if you're just a podcast listener so you get the stuff in your inbox um all right also let's talk about the second thing which is it feels like zk roll up season feels like all of the roll-ups are competing for us as ethereum users and i gotta tell you that feels good the big question i think is who gets to claim the release of the first zk evm that is a fully ethereum compatible evm chain in a zk roll up and uh before we read out this tweet david can you just give people some context on why are zk roll ups so cool what's neat about them and like i know people have probably heard us talk about roll ups a lot and layer two in the scalability strategy but let let's get beyond that roll ups all the way ethereum scales we know that why are zk roll ups special specifically and why within that are zk evm roll up special okay quick quick uh roll up uh tldr or speedrun uh we got optimistic roll-ups and optimistic roll-ups are secured by like there is potentially say say that there's an imposter in the building uh and if you find the imposter you can go and you find them and then kick them out and then you have this like assurance that you can kick them out uh of the building that you don't want the imposter in but the imposter can't get in the building in the first place and you have to go and like do the thing to kick them out a zk roll up is secured by like no you can't even an imposter can't even enter the building uh which is kind of an interesting metaphor another way to describe this is optimistic roll-ups uh you know there are blockchain that bundle up a bunch of transactions and settle it down to the the layer one zk roll ups uh are another layer of compression so it's basically uh compressing everything by putting into one bundle but then the zk side of things is like another cryptographic compression on top of that so we're aggregating a bunch of transactions compressing that and that gets put down to the ethereum layer one so the combination of uh the security model of zk roll ups which uh means that like you don't have to wait uh like for example like the outbound bridge out of our patreon optimism takes seven days for your for your ether or other tokens to clear because they want to make sure that the security guards can go find the bad guys these buildings right exactly uh and so that has some cost to it uh and then there's dk roll ups which because of that security model all transactions are instantly have instant finality and so that makes them faster and cheaper but they also makes them less expressive so this is why we have had starkx's which is like more proprietary app player chains like dydx which is now moving over to cosmos but still in the starkx ecosystem there's also immutable x which is a stark x train these are all proprietary like custom built zk chains for this these specific use cases which brings us into the concept of zk evms which is a generalizable zk roll up which is so like we have optimism and arbitrary which are super generalizable they're just like ethereum they can do solidity how they have the virtual machine you can write an arbitrary code you can build whatever with zk's up to this point you haven't been able to do that you would have to custom build your own chain and it would be a zk roll-up uh and with the zk evm we are bringing customizability and expressivity to the power of zero knowledge cryptography zero knowledge ups and we generally conclude everyone says even vitalik especially vitalik he's the one that says this actually is that we long term conclude in a world of zk rollups it doesn't even matter if we're talking about ethereum like cosmos will eventually be a zk ecosystem avalanche if they get it right they'll do be a zk ecosystem even the optimistic roll-ups will probably even optimize will eventually become zk roll-ups and that is an explicit strategy stated out of optimism themselves so everyone's going zk at the end of the day and so this is why the fight for the first zk evm is such a big deal uh because you have the best sort of scaling compression technology in the world mixed with the evm the biggest uh you know uh tech stack of smart contracting languages uh and so the zke evm is a huge fight and so that's this is where we'll get into this tweet that we're showing on screen where john adler says congrats to scroll polygon and z casing for each announcing the first zkm zk evm because it all happened this week um i do think that i i could be wrong on this but i might i'm pretty sure i'm right uh i do think the credit goes to zk sync i think they had like this stuff out like a year ago um yeah i will say that yeah but the the twitter army can fact-check me on that one i i don't even you know i don't even know who's first what i love to see though is like um them competing to be first right it's so good to see because they are all so nerdy it's so nerdy but they're competing for ethereum users and they're all competing to scale ethereum this goes back to like the strategy of ethereum which is kind of genius retrospectively which is to like basically outsource um its scalability to a massive number of teams and companies and so they can expand all at once in like multiple directions right it's almost like reminds me of kind of like some kind of a um an organism like you know a fungus or something or some kind of a spore that's just like simultaneously expanding in this decentralized way in all of these different directions and you can really see the genius of it because it's brought competitors to play and so let's go through each of these one by one david because i think it's worth talking about so polygon uh released this week is it's zk evm solution so of course polygon has its proof of stake chain but they also acquired a technology called hermes they did that about a year ago if i'm recalling correctly and hermes had a whole bunch of zk evm tech already built and now they are taking that repackaging that under polygon getting kind of the polygon business development effect and roll out marketing around it and launching that and apparently what they're launching is something that they say is evm equivalent which we could talk about that um it's open source it fully uses ethereum of course that's this layer one and it's an implement implementation only so they got the github they have the code it's an implementation not testnet yet okay they didn't announce a test net they said that that is going to be next but they're not at the test net phase but this i think is pretty big news because it's polygon and polygon i mean we've been talking about the last few rollups has onboarded so many different uh like companies and solutions like their business development arm is absolutely humming so that is the first uh solution is polygon zk evm uh maybe evm equivalent i'm not actually sure like how equivalent it is versus compatible these are two terms that we're going to talk about what is the difference between evm equivalent and compatible david or is this something that we have to just do more research on to to figure the differences out uh i i understand it actually pretty well at a conceptual level it's the the nuance of the the more detailed stuff that i don't understand basically the evm isn't one thing like it's not like something that you can point to it's like a set of standards and so like there is an evm tech stack that includes many many different things and at some point in that tech stack you can fork away from the evm and then do something different on all parts all things above the stack that you've forked away from so like think of it as like a multi-layered cake and like you can fork away from the evm standard at the top and be mostly evm equivalent but not completely or you can fork away something at the very very like bottom and be very very divergent from the evm but only be a little bit like the vvd why does it even matter right and so there is an entire ecosystem of like dev tooling is is the big one um uh and this is this is where i'll start to get stressed uh in my knowledge but like dev tooling it's like solidity like compilers like technical speak technical speak technical speak but there's a bunch of just like peripheral infrastructure that is all built around the evm and so being completely evm equivalent rather than just mere evm compatibility also unlocks the complete suite of infrastructure and compatibility of all the dev tooling and surrounding like again infrastructure that has been built around this evm standard uh and so if you are evm equivalent you will like ride in the tailwinds of all of this open source development uh and so if you are if you fork off of the evm uh standard too soon you like are going solo and you have to build your way where like you use like think about like a peloton right like a bicycle line of bikes super efficient if the bigger group it is but if you fork away you're kind of going on your own you it's like it's more headwinds although you can like do it for very good reason uh the evm is by no means like a perfect set of technology it's just the set that we have uh and so you can you know go solo and do it for the right reasons and like you know just build super like a highly optimized thing um but then you also just lose the drafting speed of completion and this is this is the point equivalence of equivalence and also compatibilities you take all the stuff that's been built on the evm and you have the ability to support it port it with minimal work in some cases zero work you could take all the unit swap code all the ave code everything in d5 everything in nfts and it just works out of the box that is the point of all of this evm compatibility and equivalency um talk about the second one zk sync so they've just also announced something this week and their take on a zk sync zk evm what uh what did they say yeah they're doing the same thing that polygon uh did they say today we're happy to announce the zk sync 2.0 the first dkevm roll up we'll be live on maina in 100 days that is about the same roadmap as polygon and so um i was actually i had uh in my very many uh set of interviews i've done at ecc mihallo was one of them where we talked about this uh and from mahalo from polygon i also also talked to alex from zk sync uh yesterday as well uh we were talking about some of this stuff um everyone's like again the timing of this is just so funny everyone's about on the same timeline with like they're rushing it's a it's a rollup race basically right yeah big time now one difference though is this is gonna unlock some some cool stuff zk sync i believe they've had a test net for a while i mean to your the point you made earlier and i don't think polygon uh zk evm has had a test net yet and they don't as yet correct yeah and they're throwing down dates david 100 days to r to mainnet i don't think i don't think scroll that is a specific number that's a specific number where would we count this down um but yeah that would be great and it's a similar solution right i mean what are the i mean we should probably do a whole episode on yeah we're getting differences between these things all the all these zk evm competitors let's just put them all in the same zoom and see what happens seriously though we'll just ask questions of them and let's kind of see what happens okay now here's who's going to be first guys yeah here's the third that announced so this is um the third is scroll uh this is i'll read the tweet after over a year of building our zk evm based zk roll up in close collaboration with the privacy scaling group at the ethereum foundation a little flex there we are releasing the pre-alpha version of scroll for external testers okay so they have something that sounds similar to polygon and that but they're calling it a pre-alpha version it seems like there needs to be a test net still before we get to mainnet but again you know order of magnitude around the same timeline as these two other zk roll up solutions yeah like ryan watching arbitrage optimism like have their like competition that's been fun uh the zk evm competition is gonna be so fun yeah and as a media person i'm just gonna sit back with my popcorn it's gonna be great yeah it's it's gonna be great and like as dave and i have said before like we want we love all of our children equally like we we are very excited about this uh all of these technologies are maximally decentralized technologies right that are prioritizing security and decentralization if they are designing a zqm zk roll up correctly that's what they're doing so they're scaling the values that we care about most which are decentralized bankless values and so we're cheering all of you guys on well done uh you know keep keep running in this race uh i hope you each win exactly um all right david let's get to the three hours capital more c5 drama on the way this time i think the leading news is um there was an affidavit that was released remember we talked about so much all of this would be settled in court documents this is like a thousand page court document that like that does not scream efficiency to me ryan no it does not i mean this is not written on chain anywhere it's 1 157 pages of legal docs imagine how much who's going to read that how much money did it cost like ignore kind of the court system and all of the infrastructure but like just to create a document like this and gather all these facts anyway we've learned some things from it one of the things we learned is that the crypto lender genesis which is an absolutely massive crypto otc firm they lent three euros capital 2.36 billion dollars that's a lot david if somebody if you have a bajillion dollars and when somebody comes knocking at your door and says hey can i borrow 2.3 billion dollars i don't think there's i'm not in this business so what do i know but you i don't feel like you say yes to that question you don't lend two points to 2.3 billion dollars well it's no one who needs who needs 2.3 billion dollars is in a good spot well it's collateralized right so there's a portion of risk that's removed because it's collateralized um its loans the genesis loans 3o's capital had a margin requirement of over 80 percent and it did sell from the collateral when three errors capital failed to maintain that but you definitely get the sense that there's a delta and i'm not sure if the the numbers are named here of how much three hours capital actually owns genesis i pretty sure genesis is going to be fine um they're absolutely massive i think they had better risk management certainly than the celsiuses of the world but uh i'm sure this also still hurts and that is why they they're they're more junior to the d5 protocols let me say that throughout his capital had to pay back all of its as did celsius acid block all the d5 protocols but uh looks like they're still out some money here david so it's kind of a yeah so i just did the math uh 80 of 2.36 billion is 472 million dollars they probably got less than that so they're probably at least 400 million in the hole that's more money than i have that's painful right i think all of c5 is learning about um risk management again and i think they'll be much more cautious moving forward at least you you hope so but we don't know we don't know for sure um this is another one three hours capital total they uh they owe their creditors at least 3.5 billion dollars i would love to see a leaderboard a high score board of who got hurt by three years capital the most like i think this is number one i'm pretty sure dashboard oh wait uh voyager oh well this is everybody the 3.5 billion yeah this is everybody right and so like um they they like uh voyagers up there pretty high up there at 660 million uh i think this comes in at number two like roughly 400 450 million i would just love to see that list of just like you know the the all the the contagion list celsius is on there 75 million of course celsius now defunct and coinless services a lot of this is right man a lot of this is retail money uh is is the tragedy of it um i always i always forget that and i'm like oh yeah wait and this is sad yeah it is sad it is sad um we'll talk about celsius in a little bit but like the audacity of this here's another headline for you david suzu three hours capital the co-founder he just filed a five million dollar claim against his own firm while he's on the run okay i feel like uh they should just like yeah sure you can have your money come get it inside the united states of america we'll give it to you we'll give it to you over here that's waiting for you here inside the u.s here's the quote i've just seen uh the list of creditors to three hours capital and notice that su zoo has filed a claim for five million dollars well being on the run he has somehow found the time to diligently and ruthlessly fill out forms to pursue a claim against his own fund well you find time for that suzu but uh yeah not to not to tell us what's going on with uh three or his capitals come on the podcast what would we even say oh i've got some thoughts celsius this is going back to celsius and some of that retail money but we have some new news as to what the gap might be looks like celsius has a 1.2 billion dollar balance sheet hole okay that's the size of the bullet wound it's just a 1.2 billion dollar fund uh a whole lot and that they have um let's see celsius has 5.5 billion in liabilities that's the bad stuff and 4.3 billion dollars in assets so you can see where we get the delta of 1.2 billion dollars um yeah yeah kind of painful and again retail will be one of the the uh debtors essentially that bankruptcy has to pay back but it just matters in order of operation where they fall right so like more senior debt holders to celsius could be far above them and get their 1.2 billion dollars back before retail does so i don't know david what the status of my celsius account is am i uh 100 down or only only like 50 down and uh i guess we'll see in the court documents i think you'll get like i think you get like 70 to 80 back yeah we'll see i mean in like a year what's so interesting is like again enough to like but defy has not had this problem uh whatsoever like we're gonna watch this play out over weeks and months and years as we have in the roll-ups i'm i'm i'm already almost sick of talking about it it's just all right oh we're talking about it next week all right like but like defy just happens so quickly and everything's on chain like all of the pain is over basically instantly 24 hours i have to go to courts you have to have thousand page documents that in itself is a beautiful thing and certainly much more time efficient uh what else we got in the roll up david what do we talk about all right coming up next in the second half of the show the ens markets continue to be super hot uh somebody accidentally uh bought something for a hundred eath and they didn't mean to an ems name jesus died we'll go in that's a fun little story also what exactly backs a usdc now we know now we know and also there's a new token coming it's a bridge token but i'm not going to say which because i'm going to tell you as soon as we get back from some of these fantastic sponsors that make the

as a part of our commitment to increasing transparency and disclosure around uscc today we are publishing our first monthly breakdown of the uscc treasury reserve assets by each and every treasury bond and list of cash reserve custodians they even have something ryan called the c-u-s-i-p which sounds like a serial number for a particular treasury or something so they down to the serial numbers of their assets and the vile and the value so like this is the most amount of disclosure that i've ever seen any any bank or any financial institution nice job circle well done yeah it's great and so so what is backing your usdc well it's almost all us treasuries so 42 million of the 55 is treasuries and the other 13 million is cash in the bank in actual bank accounts that's what's backing it so mostly treasuries and then some dollars in a bank account so that's pretty much digital bank account dollars it's pretty much your wells fargo dollars subtreasury except tokenized is that's what a usdc is aren't treasuries bullish in high interest rates so isn't interest rates going up good for the uscc business model treasuries well i don't know well i mean the interest rate is really the treasury yield right so what's the interest rate like 1.75 something like this right so it's a little bit it provides a slightly higher return than pure cash right but i mean i guess that could go up they could i mean it's pretty much a dollar though it's just like when you put you know your funds in a uh wells fargo account right or as you know um it's called a certificate of a deposit or something like that that's ultimately on the other side going to treasuries generating some nominal yield kind of like that it's a savings account it's a it's a bank account it's a bank dollar what about ave david they're doing something with balancer a token swap what is this yeah they did a dow token swap alve bouncer token swap proposal was passed and now also has been executed so about 1.1 million dollars worth of ave was swapped for about 1.5 million dollars worth of balancer i don't know why they had a discrepancy maybe just a liquidity premium so now ave owned some pal and bal owns some ave we did a show with them forever ago about how a balancer would use ave in the back end to increase the yield for a lot of the assets deposited into bouncer lps uh and that goes into ave and so this partnership has been long and strong and now there's a formal token swap why do they do this just to cement their friendship yeah yeah it's a dow handshake yeah we're just we're now more aligned than we were previous to this token swap yep that's interesting um curve is also announcing or there's rumor that curve is going to be releasing a stable coin crv us dollar do you know anything about this rumor i saw this tweet it was worth talking about but i haven't seen and i don't i don't know much about this rumor but uh we had we had the phone releases then we had the zk evm releases and then ave released a stablecoin at decentralized save coin then curve released a decentralized stablecoin uh some really cool developments coming out i would love to cover this when the details are out let's get into the nft scene right now um first some bad news openc lays off roughly 20 of its staff and this is uh devin finzer uh he cites unprecedented combination of crypto winter and bra broad macro economic instability have you heard anything about this david i know a lot of crypto companies are laying people off coinbase block obviously block five but many of them is this just another yeah it's just like the the big entrenched people uh i guess i wouldn't call openc2 and trench but like the bigger players seem to be laying people off and the smaller people the smaller players seem to be scooping people up um so i'm sure these people are just hopping into another drop another crypto job also in nft news kevin rose his proof project has just acquired an ethereum nft team called divergence looks like this is kind of an aqua hire engineering aqua hire but kevin and proof definitely have big plans to expand moon bird's ecosystem the proof ecosystem into a social universe and david we had uh kevin on the podcast a couple of months ago and he basically dropped the game plan to us of how to actually do this how every any creator can kind of with a little bit of this and a little bit of that create a nft community membership driven community for their um for their fans and so he he already gave us the blueprint now it looks like he's going a few more steps down it i'm really excited about um what he's doing because i think it's paving the way for many others to follow yeah yeah um yeah he he said he was very committed into seeing this thing uh it was fully committed to this whole thing and like it definitely has shown up in in stuff like this um the proof ecosystem like you said uh kind of just giving people a blueprint to do similar things i hope they do i think i think we are learning some lessons from it as well um in bad nft news though uh did you see david minecraft just issued a ban on nfts in its game and of course minecraft is a infinitely moddable type of ecosystem and probably the biggest and most well-known virtual worlds out there but i want to give you the reason why because i was very curious as to like why would minecraft do this like what are their stated reasons and i think this is a reason i haven't um heard quite articulated this way but let me read it from there notice where they where they said my nfts are now banned from minecraft each of these uses of nfts and other blockchain technologies creates digital ownership based on scarcity and exclusion scarcity and exclusion which does not align with minecraft values of creative inclusion and playing together nfts are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have's nots the speculative pricing the investment mentality around nfts takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages encourages profiteering which we think is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players i gotta admit when you read that it is a reasonable take right at the high level in that it's like valley devices it's not just it's not just like nfts are like bad and they never work and they're just a bunch of scams and they're always stupid it's it doesn't align with our values we want our economy to be basically completely free purely open source we don't want digital property rights in the minecraft universe we want everything to be copy and paste we don't want digital scarcity like at the very bottom found so what do you think of this argument because i think it's an interesting like philosophical argument for games when you do inject private ownership of digital property it does change the dynamics of a virtual world certainly and it definitely is reflective of the last like two years of nfts but we have to remember that nfts are just a token standard it's the people that are like choose to manifest those nfts in a particular way so it's the people that are creating scarcity and exclusion and that is a definitely a downstream byproduct of a bull market mania where prices go up nfts do not have scarcity and inclusion built into them at the protocol level like yeah like only one person can own a token but we can still mint infinite nfts and so there are plenty of ways where nfts can be consistent with the values of minecraft we you would just have to build it that way and right now like nfts have this branding of scarcity and exclusion so it's really just going to take some more open-minded game to really have success with integrating nfts to really change the minds of people because people are just scarred like the external world the world is just scarred of like the mania of the nfc media of 2021. i'm kind of interested in digging into this deeper philosophy of like is digital scarcity a good thing right like i i think there could be some people who say no this is contrary to open source values and technology where everything is free and everything is shareable and we want a world in in our digital landscape where everything is kind of equal we don't have the haves and the have nots you can just give nfts out to everyone you you can build it you can do whatever you want at first but then it converges in you know into basically people who are really good at the property game they add to their to their their virtual property they become kind of entrepreneurs you know they trade up they leverage like they it's through their maybe meritocratic efforts they actually become better at the whole game of capitalism and there does to what uh minecraft is just like communism in a game no one owns anything everyone is for everything yes yes this is kind of what i'm giving it getting at and i do think that there's going to be this dichotomy between people who start saying no um private property ownership or the concept of ownership is not a good thing on the internet and maybe minecraft is taking that stance anyway deeper philosophical conversation we don't have time to get into but um this this person makes the point minecraft completely rejecting nfts and what they represent is a big deal minecraft is is the most successful video game in virtual world in history and was a big target for nft racketeering minecraft has decided nfts have no place in its future here's another tweet somebody who built like nft worlds i think on top of minecraft like kind of an nft mod extension on minecraft and um you know rest in peace it's no longer no longer going to work they're banning that completely so it does set the precedent for the entire virtual world gaming community if minecraft is taking the stance of now we don't want private property in our games right well i mean eventually they will come around because that's where incentives lie yeah it's just up to us to not be degenerates with our nfts uh why don't you breeze over this david but notice yeah top five on openc yeah so a while ago i got very emotional about the nickelodeon nfcs that were coming out because they're gonna eventually release a spongebob nft and i'm going to buy it and none of you will because i'm going to buy it uh no matter the price no matter the price take all of david's eat yeah take it all every single one um uh but they uh that spongebob manatee is not out but the rugrats and hey arnold nfts are out uh and so there was 342 each worth of volume in 24 hours on these nickelodeon nfts these are actual real nickelodeon ip nfcs issued by nickelodeon uh so cool cool brings out the 90s trial to me all right so 90s child like what spongebob character is your thing like would you buy actual spongebob well you got to think hard about this man yeah i could get a gary gary i could get it gary yeah there we go david's buying the gary don't front run him yeah um all right what's happening here in dot ethworld amazon.eth has a 1 million usdc bid for it uh it has not been accepted that bit expired so no no deal no deal but some other nfts are going strong god.eth what's this well yeah so well this also was i don't think was accepted but uh somebody put 700 eth bid on god.eth i don't know if that was accepted or not uh jesus.eth was put up for sale for 1000 eth i would not value it that much i think that that's what i started sorry dot eats are getting a little silly right now is that what it feels like to you a little bit a little bit but i mean what's the story i mean god dawn heath like that's that's a that's a gem that's a gem yeah how can you hate that yeah there's a fun quick little story people are like also minting like sentences as their like ens name not no they're they're probably not using it it's more of like a meme so somebody minted stop doing fake bids it's honestly lame myguy.eth and because people were putting a fake bids onto their nft uh and then that person uh put a 100 eath offer on it or somebody put a 100 eth offer on it as a fake bid right um but then that person sold their their nft for one point eight eighth for which was a real bid uh but then they forgot to cancel the hundred eighth bid that they they offer that they that they put on and so the new buyer bought it for 1.8 eth and then accepted the 108th bid and so the person got there got their original ens name back uh but then they lost 100 eth because they forgot to cancel their 100th offer wow that's a that's a big oof yeah that's a 98 uh loss there for just fooling around with the titties and being funny um do you know uh one of the stories this week as well was the tesla balance sheet it basically discarded a whole bunch of the bitcoin that they'd been holding do you remember when this started happening right when there was big news in the crypto community that elon and tesla were buying bitcoin well apparently they sold 75 of their bitcoin at an average price of 28k almost 29k which is nearly a nine percent discount from their average entry of 31k they did not have the conviction to hold the dip david look they just bought like it went down 10 from their um from their purchase price and they were like oh panic gotta sell and they still we want off no more yeah we want to offer this ride um but what's crazy about that so of course like uh one narrative is do you remember when the popular narrative is probably a year ago is like all of the companies all the fortune 500s were gonna you know start uh buying bitcoin for their balance sheet right that really didn't happen not really and it was just sailor yeah it was just pretty much just sailor a few others and even tesla when they got in they just sold and so there's that piece of it but there's also this point david that kalio makes right so that calio says on twitter also elon basically liquidated three airs capital because this happened a while ago this wasn't this wasn't like in the last week or so the news of this was came out because of like a quarterly filings or something from tesla um but the point the price at which they sold their bitcoin at 28.8 thousand dollars was like right before the big leg down for bitcoin between like 29 000 and where it bottomed out at like 1800 and so like the meme is that tesla sold about 75 percent of bitcoin causing the price to go down which caused thrio's capital to get liquidated that's crazy uh i don't know ironic very very strange i mean i'll never cease to be surprised and crypt of what's going on coming up next we got a new token here's that bridge token that i promise across across protocol uh they tweet out when alpha now is the alpha the first stage of the across token launch is live today they're launching an across referral link program uh and there is a bunch of it's like a referral program like you you get your own link and then you send people and if they send people there and if they use your link to grow go across the across bridge uh you get acx tokens as a function of how much er fees that you paid for the protocol i think if you pay like one dollar in fees you get like 80 cents worth of a token seems a little gameable ryan so i'm a little bit concerned about that uh but i'm sure that they know this um i just saw hart hart lambert of of uh uma which is uh the the team behind across uh earlier earlier yesterday uh so here here are the tiers um you could you i don't know what this rate is maybe 40 of the fees i think we got copper bronze silver gold premium copper you get a 40 rate by just like creating the link bronze 50 rate if three unique referral transfers or fifty thousand dollars in volume then that scales up to platinum at the very top eighty percent uh return rate 20 unique referral transfers or or 500k in volume damn we should have our link i'll refer a link we've got to create that good opportunity there and innovative ways to earn tokens i think this cycle this is kind of the way air drops are moving is you have to do some things to earn your air drops in the future um only race this week is this one nft fraud fighters optic they raised at 11 million seed funding round okay this seems to be a way to um authenticate the basically the authenticity of an nft um copyments apparently are an ongoing problem in the nft space in the community and so using some ai technology to identify the copycats and i guess you know authenticate and whiteless the uh the good nfts and the pure ones so interesting raise there that seems straightforward yeah uh getting into jobs david crypto is still hiring as you say it's specifically the smaller companies this time around should i read out a few yeah let's do it this is your reminder to get a job in crypto now's opportunity fair market can be completely ignored because the job market is hopping streams is hiring a financial analyst stake fish is a smart contract software engineer steak fish again a back uh end full stack software engineer also a blockchain marketer it's non-technical front end software engineer a devops engineer ethereum foundation here hiring a front end engineer uniswap labs is hiring are you generous is hiring chain link labs a whole bunch of companies and projects hiring right now you can go check out that list at thebankless.palette.com board and also sign up for that uh david the worst dancing that i've ever done what's going on you're in paris it's like in the 90s you're tired you've been going all day yeah oh yeah uh uh 6 30. i saw the rave on your calendar too are you still gonna hit that tonight oh yeah yeah i'm uh after this taking a nap going and getting dinner and going to the rave yeah make that a long nap man because you gotta catch up you gotta catch up a little bit what's coming up next though questions of the week uh we got a couple questions of the week two of them we'll talk about it i believe it's a question about rocketpool and then also uh frog proofs uh and uh the uh asics that are eventually going to come with fraud proof we're gonna talk about that and also some hot spicy takes uh right i'm fighting with this bitcoiner i'm gonna i'm trying to fight him and get him on the show and then fight him there well uh i don't think that's gonna be a take of the week so i guess i'll just say that uh but that's all coming up next right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you can now bridge straight into arbitrary for more than 10 different exchanges including binance ftx kuobi and crypto.com once on arbitrary you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe new to arbitron for a limited time you can get arbitrary nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrary odyssey the odyssey is an

arbitrarium at bridge.arbitrum.io and access all of arbitrary's apps at portal.arbitrum.one in order to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only syncing provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 heat to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there all right guys we are back starting with the questions for david and myself and the weekly roll up just a reminder if you have a question go follow banklesshq on twitter and we are tweeting out uh a we're asking you for questions once a week and you can respond to that tweet thread and get your question in this is the first one from top in the past you have mentioned that bankless spun up x amount of mini pools via rockapool that's true we are staking via rocketpool right now what are the benefits of having multi-mini pools versus a full node i think people are asking these questions because they're getting excited about staking david but what are the benefits of a multi-mini pool versus a full node in the rocket pool ecosystem oh i love this question uh this is basically the wide rocket pool question okay so why why rocket pool uh so in rocket pool a node operator in the normal node operator is 32 eth on a node that you run and then you just stake your ether and run it and run the node and that's what you do with rocket pool you spin up a rocket pull node uh which basically is a node that is also part of the rocket pool network instead of putting in 32 eth you put in 16 eth and then you allow other people to come and fill up the rest of the node and so you put in 16 as like your half of like the bond and then other people can like somebody puts in one something person puts in three somebody puts in four and then boom you have a 32 eth and you've let other people stake their eath using your node but you put in 16 eth because that's like the bond that you need to have in order to not be malicious uh it's like you're not going to do anything crazy because you have your own ethan there what are the benefits of doing that well first i mean we can just talk about the uh altruist part of it it was like you allow other people to stake their eath which is nice good job good for you but there's also the profit side of it and we all know humans like profit and so in addition to getting the ether yield you as a rocket pull node operator also get 15 of the staking commission of the other half of the yield uh so if there if there's like a seven percent e field which is about expected post merch um you get 15 percent of the east of that of that seven percent of the 16 16 ether is in the other half of the of your occupal note so you get a boost in your eth apy you also don't need 32 e if you only need 16 eth to get that started um but in addition to that you also get rpl issuance and so if you run a rocketpool node you get rpl distributions uh because you also need rpl uh as a bond to also bond that to your rocketpool node to make sure this thing is super secure so you get more e field by writing your node with rocketpool you also get rpl token emissions as well yeah exactly right david uh well so that's why we're running some nodes and um it's going pretty well so far very exciting yeah we i think we've uh tested three blocks so far we're up to three three blocks that's not bad for like three weeks four weeks we've been yes so if anyone pays attention to the graffiti in uh the on the beacon chain you'll know it you'll know it when you get a block because we are graffiti as bankless was here um next question this is a question from uh incognito are zk roll ups just like proof of work especially in terms of energy consumption good question we've been talking about zk roll-ups the entire time i mean from here and he includes a link it says off-chain transactions are being bundled and generate cryptographic proofs not really sure but isn't this just like proof-of-work and needs much energy so the question of you know um all of st some sequencers are record some some a tech stack is required uh and asics are essentially required to run zk roll ups right the question is are these going to be as energy intensive as proof of work and so have we just shifted the problem to rollups and now it's a zk problem what's your answer to that question yeah the very simple answer is that proof of work is a race and so there you are incentivized to consume as much electricity as possible because you need to be first with zk roll ups like in dk roll-ups also can benefit from asics to make their proof generation faster just like a proof of work uh runs on asics but it's about the economic model where like you with a zk roll up you don't need to be first to generate that proof you just need to generate the proof and you don't really get like there's no there's no there's no reward for doing it you just need to run the proof so like one asic can support an entire zk roll up for example and so we don't need warehouses and warehouses and warehouses of asics to like secure a zk roll up you just need to generate the proof and so because there's only one machine doing that or a few machines like no absolutely not we will definitely not get anywhere near the level of electricity consumption uh like it's basically zero there is there's basically zero energy consumption to to uh generate a proof it's like it's like running running a program on your laptop it's not that hard exactly yeah um proof of work is pretty unique in its energy consumption profile i'd say all right last question of the week uh madge80.eth says polygon is killing it but do develops like the zk evm benefit the east token or do these developments benefit or increase the value of just the magic token do you think there are any merits to seeing polygon as a competitor to ethereum so yeah this is the classic alignment question are roll ups aligned with the layer one and the the answer isn't holistically absolutely yes because it is actually a different blockchain it is not ethereum itself therefore it has a different level of alignment now is that alignment like misaligned or aligned it's a spectrum uh you can be highly highly aligned with with ethereum i would put optimism in this camp they're they're the they were going after evm equivalents very very early and evm equivalence is i would say strong strong ethereum alignment in addition to that they don't use the op token as their own native currency token they use eth so that is strong ethereum alignment so i would say optimism is like highly highly aligned with ethereum uh not just at the protocol level but also in like the the philosophy and values level on the very other side of the spectrum i might put something like this darkware ecosystem and starknet where they had they announced their token as a native payment token uh rather than eth for their for the stock net uh and they also have like layer threes on top of the layer two they also have their own coding language and like culturally i wouldn't i'll compare them to sharing the same values of ethereum at least not as much as i would with optimism so there's a spectrum here of like alignment so polygon killing it but do the benefits benefit or increase the value of ether or drastmatic it's both there is a little bit of a misalignment but that is just the bargain that you make when you produce a different blockchain you have to optimize for something different you are not the ethereum layer one but i would definitely say it absolutely all things on all layer twos that settle on the ethereum layer one always ultimately benefit ethereum uh the mirror the mirror uh concept of just buying block space and using ether to do that and burning ether is like the minimum level of alignment required to have a mutually aligned system uh and so the answer is both yeah i think across that spectrum uh as you said they uh they outsource monetary supremacy differently to ethereum right arbitrary optimism they use eth uh completely um with polygon they're using eth as the gas token and they're using matic for staking and with starkware as you mentioned right no matter the ghat token no it's not uh not from the not not for the uh zk evms oh yeah for the zk yeah sandeep uh just mentioned this and kind of confirmed it because people were asking questions about that and then um starknet as you said that's going to be completely using its own token and this kind of reminds me if you know how we use the i'm just obsessed with this analogy of like federal government versus states i just love this analogy right it's like if you if you look at kind of the early united states you know many many individual states had um their own currencies and that actually stopped when the constitution started being enforced was written and put into law into practice because in article one of the constitution it says congress gets the power to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin and it also says no state gets the ability to coin money right so that was embedded in congress in the in the constitution on ethereum that is not embedded in the ethereum constitution so if you are a roll-up if you're a consumer of ethereum block space there is no protocol mandate that you must use the ether token so it's a different a bit of a different setup on the layer two it does mandate it on the layer one so you do have to use the currency at the layer one that is completely true and so on the layer on the layer one to your point if any blockchain is a rollup and they are paying for ethereum block space they are a net consumer of ethereum block space then they are net accretive to ether and some of these states might want to preserve their own currencies as well so they might use ether plus their own currency there is a world maybe where one of these states become large enough that they decide to fork off from the union entirely right so texas okay they become so large their economy is so great they start to say we're better off without just ethereum and we we want to kind of launch our own chain as a layer one and fork off and um leave ethereum we'll still have treaties with them and alliance but we won't have the monetary union that we and that is possible um so i think we'll see lots of different outcomes and uh i guess the bottom line is none of these roll-ups are positioned in a way that make them a layer one settlement uh for other rollups and for foreign governments we'll have to we'll have in for uh other rollups we'll have to see if how that changes in the future but each of them are taking a different approach anyway certainly uh that's that takes the week david on to the takes let's do it we got one from block five this is ryan sulcus what is he saying yeah so ryan selkis says the paths taken by block fine and celsius leadership teams this past months are as divergent as it gets i don't really know what he meant by that so i asked him if he could elaborate and ryan selkis continues saying celsius fought to the last minute to save themselves and they put user funds at risk blockfi fire sold to a bidder that would protect user funds at all costs thank you blahfi nice job also celsius f off you did a better job it's a better spectrum david there's so many spectrums here right like both careless with risk management but celsius was just far more careless it was just how to generate how terrible they were blockfi they made some mistakes but still you know preserved and then other crypto banks are even healthier and people are talking this week about um the coinbase bankruptcy again right um and like i don't see that at all like that is not in the car surprise that would be a massive surprise coinbase did not loan through his capital any money anyway so different crypto banks played this very differently had different risk management in effect uh ryan ryantron adams tweets out you have to realize that blockchains have two social layers two layers the tech layer the layer one the social layer the layer zero also the name of my podcast on layer zero the code is memes brains are the validators shared belief is the consensus the social layer matters even more than the tech but they interact in a perpetual feedback loop ryan i feel like very few people or very few communities outside of ethereum like understand this i think the bitcoin ecosystem understands this i think it that's so true and i think that is the single um most unappreciated part of the crypto story and blockchain story of like the value of the the social layer right so the social layer does have code it's in narrative form it's in meme form it's articles okay it's podcasts we are forming the social layer now on bank list as we speak this is part of it it's very important brains are the validators so everyone's individual brain their belief their orientation on something has the ability to accept what an article is saying what a meme is saying what a narrative is saying what a podcast host is saying as true or false they're checking it their brain is kind of the the fact finder uh and then shared belief becomes kind of the consensus of the layer zero chain right and ultimately david that's what all of the technology rests on and there's also this feedback loop between like the layer one and the social layer in that some social layers attract um well some tech layers attract different types of social layers due to the choices that they've made made and you can kind of i just i think the anthropology of these systems is probably the most fascinating part it's like 100 the economics is super fascinating the technology's super fascinating but like the culture of these layer zero ecosystems of ethereum versus bitcoin versus solana versus some other chain that's the most fascinating part for me and it shows you that this is a coordination technology and a social technology and i think almost no one is looking at blockchain deeply through this lens people like josh rosenthal are on our podcast a few others are doing it but is the most interesting way to look at um crypto technology and the whole thing that's happening in crypto and the big lessons i like to pull from this is like it was something that was really interesting is uh uh danny sesta from wonderland gets like becomes like super egotistical like uh very like very populous tactics and then like goes after maker dow and says oh we're going to be better than make her down make the next stable coin and then like and then we get in a fight with him because i didn't know who he was i get attacked by his frog community and then danny cessa and his uh icarusing blew up like a month later because of the whole wonderland drama fast forward about two months uh i get in a fight with dokwan on twitter uh i dokwan says buy my hand die the stable coin from maker dow will die uh and then i get in a fight with him and then we become enemies i guess and then he gets like super egotistical and and like self-centered and just like pumping and chilling and telling telling you ryan that you don't know anything about blockchain uh and then like just keep becoming crazy and then you know blows up about a month later so like there's this pattern of like uh when the social layer incentivizes like this like like populist maniacs to like run a protocol and then they also happen to go after maker dao they blow up and that's because the code of the layer one of the layer zero works its way into the tech stack on the layer one or the app chain and so like you have to understand who your leaders are because the culture that these people surround themselves with interact with certain people and create the actual fundamentals of the actual technology themselves yeah and the the other side of that is true too it's like i think less um a lot of people looked at the the terra design itself from the security model on upwards to like the algo staplecoin model and they said oh i'm not touching that i'm going to build on a deep different ecosystem and so the design of the layer one tends to attract a different layer zero people who are just certainly in it for kind of like more temporary not thinking about these things not thinking about the long term in that way i i one of my favorite contrasts though is like bitcoin versus ethereum because we did it in the court these are the two long-standing communities uh what is this clip that we're showing right here uh yeah so this is the end of our luke grauman podcast where uh he basically gives the bitcoiner line that like proof-of-stake represents like fiat systems and this and it's like a fiat system which just makes no sense and and like you know a lot of macro experts they're they're macro they're knowledgeable in macro um i put linold in here as soon as they start talking about like crypto stuff like it kind of breaks down uh and so like just it was just conflating governance with proof of stake like all bitcoiners do and then corey clifton who i've actually had on my other podcast pov crypto ryan i have i talked i hosted him on that show once i don't know him at all yeah uh he go and he tweets out imagine having a show and every time you finally get a smart guest to come on they tell you your life's work is meaningless it's so sad to watch over and over and over they're talking about us they're talking about bank they're talking because because uh because luke is to be clear in this clip he was saying no no i'm not into crypto i'm into bitcoin specifically that is the only crypto like stop talking about other cryptos uh my my focus and the value here is actually bitcoin corey let's fight let's fight what do you want to fight come on the show you want to bring about the show yeah we'll host them on the show and when we'll yell at each other there you go that's uh you know so i i tweeted this out early in the week because i was feeling a lot of like a whole bunch of people piled on and talked about um how dumb we are and all sorts of things right which is pretty typical on twitter um but the weird thing about i think going back to the anthropology and the social layer the layer zero here is you can't apparently in like particularly the bitcoin maximus community we got into this with nick carter a little bit you can't be a bitcoiner who likes ethereum at the same time right right apparently and so i tweeted this out i'm a bitcoiner who likes ethereum more is that allowed and you know some people of course are saying yes that's allowed your tweet was like no you must sacrifice everything kind of tongue-in-cheek here well um take that seriously that is the oh so okay connecting this to the economic model of bitcoin bitcoin is a faith-based blockchain the security budget runs out and so you have to operate on faith that this thing works and the only way that it works is that if bitcoin literally goes to infinity and that's the only way of of the like the sustainability of the ecosystem if bitcoin pumps forever so you have to have faith that that bitcoin price doesn't go so low that that the blockchain becomes unstable uh and so if you you are not allowed to believe in any other crypto asset because you must have the shelling point of you have to believe in bitcoin bitcoin is a faith-based see a faith-secured blockchain as soon as the issuance runs out it's insecure and so you have to have faith that it works and what's interesting is um i mean we've emphasized the the social layer to being so important right like ethereum's social layer is very important to success it would be maybe a little a lot less faith-based i would say but there is some sort of underlying beliefs here but that's exactly what you're saying is like right the religious aspect is the thing that's so interesting and so do you know dennis porter yep i've also yeah we have we've hosted him on the show actually oh yeah i don't think i was there for that show i think it was like you and justin anyway so he answered the question from i think the bitcoin maximalist position i'm like i'm a bitcoiner likes ethereum more is that even allowed dennis porter goes that's like saying i'm a green bay fan but i like the bears more okay football reference right it's like these are mortal enemies okay so i was like so it's not allowed right and he's like some people think owing bitcoin is enough and i wish we all live in that world but we don't you'll never be accepted as a bitcoiner until you sell your eath bags because you've attacked bitcoin so much right and i think they would classify what you just said as running out of attack on bitcoin i just attacked bitcoin yes that's an attack on bitcoin it's an attack waiver yes it's an attack on the faith a heretic basically uh it's monetary warfare and you chose a side that's opposed to bitcoin right that's a little snarky tongue-in-cheek i also own a house do i have to sell that to you dennis um he told me i had to sell all my if in order to be a bitcoiner no ryan here's the key here's it's not just a back and forth part of this is like i'm just so fascinated by the social dynamics here and like i really feel like we are witnessing the birth of not just a social movement but like almost like techno religions here david yeah blockchains blockchains are like omnipotent like gods like every single blockchain every single layer one is a is a god and there's some analysis and that and there are why this crypto is so tribal algos being religion so here's what i said uh i also own a house do i have to sell that too dennis goes no ryan it has nothing to do with your holdings okay distinction you and david specifically go after bitcoin you still have the ultrasound money emojis in your name that's the we like ethereum more part you also challenge the energy use of bitcoin these are both attacks on on bitcoin so no they're fair and valid critiques right but they can't accept that i am bullish on bitcoin i i like bitcoin numbers like i'm a bitcoin i hold a bitcoin i own some bitcoin i just like better for many of the reasons we just said well you've gone the other way but like i'm a bitcoiner if i own bitcoin right no according to dennis because you have attacked the faith and so this is where i think it gets religious i go i think all this would be plain or if you guys put out a statement of faith like the core beliefs of a bitcoin what does it take to be a bitcoin yeah something simple and like uh christians did this in the early days with nicey and uh creed anyway we go back and forth i just think the religious parallels here are are very interesting he goes that's impossible ryan you know that some of the folks who say holding bitcoin is enough could be right i've thought deeply about it but you're making me realize that someone can't attack bitcoin and be a bitcoiner so dennis goes it's impossible to write a statement of faith because that would be like more centralizing um i think it can be solved i think if the bitcoiners wanted to come up with a statement of faith like the maximalist of what it actually takes to be a bitcoin maximum and say things like thou shalt not attack bitcoin right i as a bitcoiner will not attack bitcoin instead i will support it in all of these ways and that makes me a bitcoiner would be much more simple but i'm super interested to see how this evolves over the decades to come because david bitcoin still ain't going anywhere not with this level of unshakable belief that people have even if and when we think it's very likely the flipping happens whereas ethan's larger market cap you're not going to shake this community david look at look at how strongly they've been down with their ship yeah and so cyber for a reason well where does it go right it's like okay you start to create like statements of faith you start to say like you know satoshi being kind of this anonymous person who's faded like in the in the decades to centuries to come like how does this evolve right is satoshi like the god who left earth like i don't even know it gets it gets weird but i literally i think that we are seeing the birth of a religion and uh it's so it's not just an asset class that we're investing in and people don't understand these social dynamics at play but that to me is the lens through which we have to view this space anyway a little bit of trolling with dennis and some back and forth fun but honestly i'm 50 it's just pure fascination that like this is how people see things well this is kind of like why i'm generally bearish on bitcoin in the long term is that the culture around bitcoin is that bitcoin has no flaws its current state is absolutely perfect uh you know immaculate immaculate conception of bitcoin it was perfect from day one and therefore we don't need to improve it and i'm like yeah well bitcoin's got some flaw it's like it's not perfect guys you got to fix some stuff yeah like you can you can secure a blockchain without proof of work and no proof of work is not the most fair consensus mechanism it's actually highly centralizing god damn yep there we go uh back to that um let's see last thing is your take here david hoffman says born too late to explore the globe born too early to venture into space but born at the perfect time to watch become the greatest asset the world has ever seen that's a pure pump tweet david uh i feel like i've read something like that before yeah can you retweet that i'm trying to get more likes than zazzles so uh so i have the canonical most liked version of this copy you already won you already won no no he hasn't okay that's what i said but then he's got he got another one because he likes he's tweeted out three times or whatever that one that has like 900 likes so i need to get 100 more likes hey man these are the tweets that perform all right i'm working that for you yeah right and so like there's always like the the frontier used to be you know in the era of the 1700s 1600s of gold god and glory right uh god themed episode today like getting on the ship and exploring the frontier of earth uh well i mean but it's also too late to explore the final frontier of space but at least we get to ryan explore the crypto economic frontier of ethereum i'm totally with you i i think that's the most exciting uh white space available for people um all right what are you excited about this week tell me we've i've teased it out a little bit but i have done uh eight interviews between 20 and 20 and 30 minutes each all at ecc and i'm just like really leaning into the the in-person interviews i really really like these um but also just like to say to bankless like i feel like we get to ask cooler questions uh and so like i gave you some highlights i i asked the starkware people as to whether they will ever fork off of ethereum and settle on a different chain or whether they will just make their own layer one i am of course not leaking the answer at all um i and then i remember when uh kane warwick and suzu got in a fight on reasonable size houses on crypto twitter well i talk about him with that so like i'm you know asking all the fun stuff and it's kind of cool i heard uh there's something about vitalik as well oh yeah well he's the number one yeah i asked vitalik about like the general morale of the ethereum developers and how that's tracked over time um yeah some questions that i don't really think anyone could really ask so i'll run through it we got vitalik uh we got stani from ave kane from synthetics we got uh kevin owaki and austin griffith as a duo that was fun that was super comical um uh evan mcmullen from disco i'm definitely going to miss some people mahalo from from polygon uh we did sunny from cosmos i'm also getting super interested in cosmos um i actually got super interested in cosmos back in 2018 when i first learned about it and then just got sucked into ethereum um this is like a taste of eat cc though right this is like an ecc experience but also just like sub micro podcasts because like i asked you know i asked sunny about cosmos right i asked evan about decentralized data yeah and so in addition to like all right like house paris it's also like okay let's let's like talk about like what you're up to all right so this is the cc experience episode i guess at least that's what it'll be for me and when does that come out david that's going to premiere 11 a.m pacific time 2 p.m eastern time on tuesday so i just threw all of these very high def 1080p local microphones audio quality should be great uh it's coming out on your youtube this coming tuesday so stay tuned and also a spotify video podcast on spotify awesome video on spotify so go check that out cheers ryan what are you bullish on uh david i gotta say it man i'm so thankful you didn't steal mine because you're at etc i'm bullish on the merge my friend we have a date we're all bullish on the merch that's the entire market section of this podcast ryan all right that's the next like few weeks like the next two months i'm going to be bullish on the merge maybe the rest of the year i'm bullish on the merge okay that's i just don't need to ask you this anymore yeah over and over and over it's it's so it's so exciting i mean this has been such a long time coming but the timing is what strikes me and i tweeted this out ethereum is about to become the world's only deflationary monetary asset at a time of historic monetary inflation what a contrast what a contrast yeah as i'm jealous that you tweeted that out look man that's like uh maybe i stole this from anthony cesano back in the day no i said this first no this is i was the one making this connection the internet bond is the connection to make year right which is like eth as an asset is becoming like a sovereign bond essentially and so you can buy japanese bonds you can buy us treasuries you can buy euro bonds uh but why would you when you know you're going to be the sucker on the other end of that table and it's all going to be inflated away and your real returns on those assets will be negative well guess what your real returns on eath as a bond will not be negative you know how we know this is because it's a deflationary asset as eth is used as block space is used it gets burnt a portion of eth gets burnt so the supply goes down even now in these low gas fee economic times we're still burning like 0.2 percent eat per year as if you go to ultrasound money you can go see that so a deflationary asset that's what's coming i'm i'm really excited about this this is you know we've been talking about ultrasound money for like over a year i think that episode of justin drake came came out uh probably it was july of last year yeah it might have been earlier than 15 or 16 months ago right it's like over a year ago and now we're finally here we're about to get into ultrasound money and i'm very excited about the economic benefits not going to scale eth yet that comes later all the zk stuff we've been talking about that's a scalability strategy but this is a massive economic upgrade not to mention we got all the benefits of proof of work going away and the environmental narrative all of these attacks bitcoin again again at the end apparently i'm not a bitcoiner i do not subscribe it's it's going to be really sad when like there's a couple roll-ups ago i had that tweet is like how to become a millionaire stick around during the bear market well it's going to hit different when like it's because we're all millionaires because the dollar got turned into like you know it got turned into nothing and so one ether is a million dollars because a dollar penny now like not like this but not like this please please god all right meme of the week what do we got this week of the week uh song of day man jonathan mann who i've also had on the podcast i've had goddamn everyone at the podcast at this point uh he did a song with uh with our job section uh so he made a song about getting a job in crypto and that is going to come up right after ryan gives us the regular disclaimers that we usually do guys if that doesn't pump you to get a job in crypto then nothing will enjoy this song from the song of day man of course before we get there though i have to say written disclaimers crypto is risky eth and bitcoin are absolutely risky you could lose what you just said bitcoin's risky that's an attack on bitcoin i just attacked bitcoin there but i also attacked ether in the same sentence but we are headed west yeah well at least ethereum isn't insecure and can take criticism stop stop this this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot i get a job [Music] get a job in crypto you
