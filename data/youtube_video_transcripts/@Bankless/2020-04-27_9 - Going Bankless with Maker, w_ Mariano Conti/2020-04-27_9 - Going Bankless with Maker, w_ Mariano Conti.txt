[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman once again and we're here to help you become more bankless david i am super excited about our guest today and about the topic can you tell us about it mariano conte who i call the king midas of ethereum because everything he touches turns to ether we all know and love mariano conte he is the head of smart contracts at the maker foundation he has been absolutely critical in the rollout of the maker dow system and he's been there from day one back when the maker dao system was what they called proto-sai that's the sigh before the current psy which is the sai before the current die so he's been there all the way in the history of maker dao the really cool thing about mariano conte in my opinion is that he is from argentina which is one one of the many countries in the world that really needs crypto as a as infrastructure for value management and and just for living your life uh so at the same time that mariano is living on crypto using crypto systems to support his personal finances he's also building the platform the maker dow protocol that also will help him live his life even better and so like he's he's a dog fooding crypto and then he's also building the own his own product that he needs at the maker foundation uh so getting into this episode we talk about stability how mariano lived on bitcoin before there was even ethereum or die to to live off of uh the how that helped his life and then the problems that that also created and then how he came to the maker foundation and started living off of dye mariano has done a ton of different uh talks around the space and so we have those linked in the show notes if you guys want to hear more about mariano's story but truly a fantastic individual a really strong representative ambassador of the maker dow system and for crypto at large guys this is going to be part of a three-part series we are doing on the king money protocols and the first of these is maker uh the second is going to be uniswap and the third is compound so we've got three banger episodes uh coming up for you guys i think in addition to hearing mariano's story which is which is fascinating you're going to learn a lot about maker doubt the protocol about dive the stablecoin about accessing credit and how to use this interesting uh this bankless system but before we get into it let's talk a bit about our fantastic sponsors the first is for our u.s listeners rocket dollar if you have an ira or a 401k chances are it's jailed in your brokerage in your schwab account in your fidelity account that means you only get good access to stocks and etfs if you try to buy crypto inside of it you're getting ripped off you don't have access to buy crypto at the spot price so the price of something like an eth inside of your brokerage account is going to be 5x what you'd pay on a coin base don't do it get a self-directed ira you can get a roth ira you can also get a self-directed 401 k use rocket dollar they take care of all of the paperwork all of the administration you can break your retirement account out of jail you could start investing in crypto now is a fantastic time to do that by the way and if you go to rocketdollar.com you can use the code bankless and get fifty dollars off xerion.io is the front page to the defy ecosystem if you are looking to onboard your friends or even yourself into the world of ethereum and d5 i highly recommend going to xerion.io and using their interface to manage all of your crypto assets xerion is specifically designed to make crypto extremely easy and extremely sexy to use and so instead of going to all your individual protocols like going to uniswap.io compound.fine page you can just go to xerion.io and see all of your assets and all of the d5 protocols that you want to interact with all in the same place to me it is the replacement for logging into my wells fargo account and seeing my personal finance situation instead i just go to xerion.io and i see my defy accounts all in the same place and i can swap on uniswap i can borrow and lend in compound i can open a vault and make dow and then you can even invest into uniswap and bancore pools something really cool and new that happened with xerion is that they acquired my defy and they are also building out a set of api tools and so you know the world of money legos is not just confined to ethereum applications on in the traditional web 2.0 world there's also the data legos and so now you can use xerion as your data lego fort data and analytics about the defy ecosystem so if you are building something that needs data about defy xerion is rolling out a api product for you to build on top of check them out at xerion.io all right david before we get into mariano and maker let's talk big picture there's always weird stuff going on in the world outside of crypto and within crypto so something crazy that happened last weekend david was uh a d d force d5 protocol called lend f me got hacked for like 25 million dollars so what happened there man yeah this this story is really interesting and kind of comical uh i think in my opinion uh so d force is this d5 protocol that is very similar to compound in fact it is almost exactly the same as compound and the reason why we know this is because uh there were some pretty clear indications that they copied and pasted compounds code and then used it for their for their own application and the reason why we know this is because there were little identifying tags that literally said compound in the code that they forgot to remove and so that was already a red flag and then they made some tweaks made some changes they implemented a new token standard called erc 777 which compound specifically did not include and then because they allowed for these new this new token standard they allowed for what is called a reentrancy attack uh really simply explained a reentrancy attack is imagine if you uh go to your local bank ask for a withdrawal and then while the teller is opening up the uh the cash register to pull out the money you teleport to another of the same bank and you ask the next teller to make a same the same withdrawal and so you go and do that a thousand times at all the different banks and before all the tellers register that you are withdrawing 200 from your account you've gone to 10 000 different banks and then you withdrawn 200 from all of them and turns out that you uh actually drained the whole entire system before they could account for that uh and so that's what happened with the d-force attack the attacker was able to withdraw 25 million dollars of different crypto assets from the protocol and i think it would might have been pretty obvious to see this coming understanding that we saw them copy and paste compounds code uh it clearly showed that the expertise of these individuals was not up to snuff for you know managing users funds yeah absolutely so it was a it was put together in a sloppy way it was not a default dive d5 protocol that we'd recommend it wasn't properly audited um this the the hack that you mentioned was a sort of a well-known flaw that they kind of disregarded but that aside you know what's really interesting about this story so the hacker goes and steals a 25 million worth of assets so he steals assets like usdc and imbtc and these assets what i think is really interesting about these store this story is these assets are actually like redemption tokens so they don't have strong settlement guarantees in other words if you if you buy if you hack rather steal usdc what you're actually stealing is a redemption coupon for some us dollars that coinbase keeps in a bank somewhere you're not actually stealing uh a bearer asset that you can then settle anywhere you have to settle usdc at coinbase same with imbtc it's it's uh kind of a redemption coupon for getting some btc some bitcoin out of the bank so um weak weaker settlement guarantees these are just redemption coupons these are vouchers for the asset not the actual asset itself so the hacker the thief goes and steals those things and the very first thing he goes and does with those assets is he swaps them and what does he swap them for he goes to a defy exchange called one inch and he swaps them for assets that have much stronger settlement guarantees so more trustless assets like eth like some of the defy bearer asset protocols like mkr and knc and lend these assets have stronger settlement guarantees it doesn't have to redeem them at a bank and so they're they're more liquid and i think that really ties into something that we were talking about in episode six when we talked about the d5 truss spectrum how there's a tendency for high density assets and high density protocols and by density we mean stronger settlement guarantee protocols to become the preferred protocol as the foundation thieves prefer them even because they have stronger settlement guarantees they don't have a trusted intermediary that's required in order to redeem these assets for something of value and i think we'll see that theme emerge in our talk today with mariano where we talk about the difference between die which has a stronger settlement guarantee it's more trustless than a stablecoin asset like usdc which is at the end of the day a voucher a redemption coupon for some us dollars in a bank account i think the metaphor of settlement guarantees doesn't only apply to crypto assets but also to crypto protocols uh d-force comparing the the settlement guarantees of compound versus d-force it's a little bit harder to vet actually it's a lot harder to vet the settlement guarantees of these applications but a really easy and quick way to do it is time compound has been live for at least a year and a half now and dforce had been lied live for a week and a half and so when it comes to trusting these applications time is actually a really good measuring stick to see which of these applications are going to offer stronger settlement guarantees this is called the lindy effect if something has been around for a long time it's likely to be around for a longer amount of time and so i think the compound versus d4 story is actually really interesting and i kind of see it as a west first east story china is famous for stealing uh western code and just using it for their own benefit like reappropriating it and and doing as they see fit with it uh however that you can't really do that in crypto uh because of the settlement guarantees of these networks as a whole you know if you mess up once in the traditional world you can just write a patch and deploy it and you're fine if you mess up in the crypto world uh you lose users funds the the story does end well actually so in the process of exchanging some of his lower settlement guarantee assets for some higher settlement guarantee assets the hacker actually used a d5 exchange called one inch and in the process leaked some metadata about his ip the police were able to use that uh to track him down find him in singapore uh and ultimately the hacker returned the entire 25 million worth of assets so um you know protocols in hacks don't usually get quite so lucky but d force and len if me were quite lucky in this case that it had a happy outcome for some of the folks that put money in these protocols but i think there's there's a number of lessons here uh one one of the final lessons is is probably be very very careful where you deposit your funds we talked so often about uh d5 and bankless being kind of the the wild west and in the in the wild west it's really incumbent on you to do your research and make sure you know the risks of a particular protocol going into it as david talked about the lindy effect the amount of time a protocol has been around the amount of value in that protocol those are both good indicators for how safe or the risk of a given protocol let's talk about something else and this is happening outside of crypto and that's negative oil prices david what what's up with that this has been a really interesting story in the outside world and it's it's also interesting that it's happening during the times of the coronavirus crisis which it's relatively independent from but because you know this is all happening at once the everything is relevant now uh so what happened is that in the futures market uh there comes a time where if you are the holder of a specific contract for a a barrel of oil uh the the clock strikes midnight and that contract uh sets in and you are then committing to actually take physical delivery of oil at a specific place in inside the united states uh and so what happened was the opec countries have been pumping out oil in the last month uh there's been this other like like i said there is this alternative like crisis going on with oil that is independent from coronavirus but it's very much exasperated by coronavirus no one's driving their cars no one is flying in airplanes general demand for oil is just like cut off like 90 down and so there is this massive supply of oil and while there's this massive supply of oil there is increased demand for storage however there is finite storage and so a lot of investors really really don't want to have to take physical delivery of oil these are people in the cme the chicago mercantile exchange who are you know invest their their futures traders they are commodity traders they wear a suit and tie and they go to work and then they drive home they don't they're not truckers they're not delivery people they don't want that oil that's not their job there's this very interesting separation of these two populations uh and all of a sudden a lot of cme traders all of a sudden became oil holders in without really intending to and so there was a rush to sell oil and there's no reason why the the price has to hit zero if you really don't want that asset if you really don't want to take responsibility over owning that asset you can pay someone to not have that responsibility of holding the oil and so oil went all the way down to negative 30 a barrel which means people were paying 30 to not have to take ownership over a barrel of oil because there's so much oil and there's no place to actually put it and so that that's what happened with oil in the in the oil markets so uh ethereum ether had this meme once upon a time that uh eath is oil right we've talked about ethan's not being just a commodity like oil it's a triple point asset but i had so many maximalists bitcoin maximalists troll me on twitter the day this happened and it said haha you know is eath oil now what do you say to that like what's did you get that too yeah yeah it's a funny connection but it really has no grounds in in reality uh ether is digital oil for paying gas for powering the ethereum blockchain but it's just a metaphor and there's nothing actually real there yeah and there is a difference between uh ether and something like oil so you mentioned that the the reason oil prices went to actually negative territories because there's a cost to store the oil itself right the physical costs inventory costs put it in a warehouse that sort of costs you don't really have that with cryptocurrencies because they are purely digital commodities so ether when it's being used as a commodity to pay for gas there's no storage cost associated with that or at least you know the storage costs are a lot smaller because it's it's fairly easy to secure your crypto in a decentralized way you don't need large inventories and you know warehouses and uh barrels and trucks in order to store and transport this stuff right absolutely i don't guarantee many things in the crypto world but i will guarantee that there will never be a negative crypto price you will never be able to have negative bitcoin or negative either that will not happen and that's simply because yeah like you said it doesn't cost anything to store it and that's a really strong advantage and that's actually the same thing that allows you to memorize 24 words in your head hop on a fl hop on a plane travel across the world and then still have access to your funds that that zero storage cost is is why you can store money in your brain and so i think this this really illustrates a very strong difference between like real world physical assets and internet-based assets where you know real world assets like gold storing it also has risk while people generally consider gold as a very risk off asset you know storing it is a part of that risk there is still risk there and so while crypto is considered extremely risky storing it you know the zero cost of storing it is a reduction of risk and if you can get your crypto storage system down that is an insanely awesome feature to have as an asset absolutely keeps it decentralized okay before we get into the episode let's talk about our sponsors the first is ave ave is a lending and borrowing protocol on ethereum so what does that mean we're going to talk about dye today the stable coin you can actually take that dye you can put it in ave it will magically transform that dye into an interest bearing die token that means when you hold the token called adi which is ave's version of an interest-bearing die token it's actually earning you interest as you go you can also borrow from the ave protocol the same way you can borrow from maker one difference though with ave the rate is fixed it's not variable with maker the rate is variable so it can change on a week to week basis with ave you can lock in a rate it remains fixed also if you're a developer you've got to check out their flash loan protocols they can be integrated in all sorts of really interesting money protocol applications to lend or borrow from dave to lend or borrow from ave go to ave.com that's aave.com and check it out in this episode we're going to talk a lot about dye and how mariano conti uses it as a freedom tool to get what he needs out of his personal finances if you also want to use dye as a freedom tool and have it be a useful tool for your personal finances i highly recommend getting the defy card from monolith monolith allows you to get a visa card that you can spend wherever visa is accepted which is like the whole world uh and so you put your your die inside of your monolith account and then that's connected to your d5 visa card monolith is approaching the 1 million dollars topped up in their platform on their visa defy card and so you should definitely be a part of that people that bring that to 10 million dollars so go to monolith.xyz and sign up get your smart contract wallet deployed to ethereum and then get your visa defy card that's connected to your smart contract wallet it puts a little bit of ethereum in your pocket for you to use out and about as you see fit and you can always feel really cool when you swipe your card and it makes a transaction on ethereum so go to monolith.xyz to get started without further ado this is our interview with mariano conte from maker dow alright let's dig in welcome mariano to bankless really excited to have you here you know i think it'd be great marianna if you start and just tell listeners about yourself and a bit about your bankless journey yes of course i'm really happy to be here so uh i'm currently the head of smart contracts at the maker foundation where we build and bootstrap the maker protocol which we'll get into after but my bankless journey began in 2014 when i started um accepting bitcoin as my salary and it took off from there in 2015 i got into ethereum and then i started getting paid in ether and i discovered maker and through a series of coincidences ended up working there and as soon as the first version of the size stablecoin was created an initial private alpha that we call protocy i started getting paid in that and when we really sigh i started getting paid inside and then when we released die i got paid and died so for the past five or something years my salary has been you know nothing but cryptocurrencies i mean the past three years the ones that we've been building so i've been bankless for a long time and when i say bankless um i mean i still have to go into the fiat world right but um i'm trying to do that less and less so mariano let's talk about your very beginnings let's go all the way back to bitcoin and talk about your uh the country you live in argentina and then why bitcoin offered a compelling answer to you and then and then why the next currencies offered a a another compelling answer to the so problems that bitcoin offered in 2014 there were capital controls in argentina so it was uh very difficult to get access to dollars unless you went to the the black market and the exchange rate was so different the official was i don't know maybe eight and um in the black market it was maybe 50 percent more so the government would buy you dollars um at a very low exchange rate and if you worked for a company in the us or you were freelancing if they paid you dollars they would be converted to pesos at a really bad rate right so people started looking for alternatives and they went through the usual ones you know paypal and that got shut down people opened bank accounts in uruguay you know neighboring country they opened bank accounts in the u.s but that still was it wasn't um as simple to do so my boss he mentioned bitcoin and said hey i can pay you in bitcoin and after i did some research i discovered that this was really uh something great for me there were already some websites that would let you pay you know utilities using bitcoin or send it to other people and that was really the the beginning um and i felt that i could take charge of my money you know it was um it was something that the government couldn't touch and and i got souped into the whole ecosystem the problem was i mean looking back i see some of the utility bills that i paid and uh depending on the on the month i either overpaid by hundreds of dollars or uh got really lucky and and you know paid when uh the prices were just right and and that always bothered me you know the volatility um i remember i i did some freelance work and i had set up a rate and then we had problems when i wanted to collect because the person was giving me the rate of bitcoin to dollars at the time that they paid it but i wanted it at the time that i delivered the project and it was really good for them but not for me and that always talk in my head you know how can we make this better and that's why my interest in stable coins you mentioned one thing so i think a lot of our listeners can maybe they haven't experienced hyperinflation for themselves but they can sort of picture it but one thing they might not be able to picture understand as much as uh the kind of capital controls you mentioned so can you describe how the government and the commercial banking sector in argentina sort of you know work together uh on those capital controls like what was it like what did they do um i can give you a better example from right now because now in 2020 we have capital controls again so for example i cannot buy more than 200 a month legally so i can go into a bank i can purchase 200 at the ex official exchange rate which is maybe 65 pesos per dollar and then i'm on a database and i cannot do it again until the next month right and but if i have one dollar and i sell it in the black market i can get over 100 pesos so you see the the disparity there and if you were to send me 10 right now via a bank the bank is legally required to change it into pesos before they give it to me so uh i am losing almost 50 percent of the value of a dollar because you have a country that just either continues to um you know print money that nobody wants or just hangs on to an exchange rate that everybody knows is fake we have almost 20 different exchange rates of the dollar you have the official one you have the one in the black market you have the one that the government purchases uh soy to farmers you know they're not legally allowed to export to anybody they want they have to sell it to the government and the government says okay i will buy it but uh at 30 pesos to the dollar you know things like that it's um it's really complicated but it's also one of the things that gives argentinians an edge it's like we have to think about so many things to protect our money that i feel that that we play in in hard mode trying to escape the crypto bubble uh i would just assume that everyone down in argentina is a crypto person because crypto offers them like you know the solutions the infrastructure to escape from the the coercive government the the government with capital controls uh what has the infrastructure been like down in argentina at both with crypto and out and with other solutions that have allowed people to escape this tyranny of sorts there's there's endless stories so outside crypto people will just take a ferry to uruguay and max out their credit cards um you know taking out dollars from an atm until they they borrowed that people if they get some money for whatever reason they will buy a motorcycle or they'll buy bricks you know things that more or less go along with inflation um i don't know they do so many things uh of course you know buying dollars i read somewhere argentina is one of the countries that has the most amount of cash usd cash in the world you know of course outside the us because people hoard it so much because we have it in our brains to think about dollars uh properties are are sold in dollars and and in the case of crypto we're seeing more and more young people of course try to make this jump because it uh for them is just another tool to access dollars that's that's really what it is and you have the promise of you know unbiased uncensorable transparent transactions and community that is that is really important and the fact that you get to own uh your own money that is big because of course there's been so many instances that the government just freezes everybody's bank accounts and then says okay your money's not yours anymore your money's not yours anymore wow what what a powerful sentence and and this brings us i think right back to the world of crypto and why crypto is has qualities that are really perfectly suited for this especially the the seizure resistant nature of crypto assets and that's why bitcoin as a non-sovereign currency i think offered you a good solution but i think from what you're telling me everyone wants dollars everyone in argentina is doing what they need to access dollars and i think that's a good time to transition into talking about the maker dow protocol and and die and and maybe you're also your personal transition from using bitcoin to using die and how the stability of thigh has has further given you more more crypto tools in your tool belt to be a bankless person can you tell us about that transition um yes so the first time um we launched what we call protocy was around july 2017 there was still of course uh no market for it right but we did get paid in this erc 20 token that we called psy and it was one to one to the dollar and we had to go back to ether to actually do something with it because there was no market nobody would would trade you anything for it but it showed us that it was indeed possible and then um when psy was released in december 2017 and you started seeing an ecosystem grow around it that's when when we actually saw the power because it was all very gradual first you started trading between people that worked with you right at the maker foundation then uh you started trading with people around it and then as a psy got listed in different exchanges we discovered um for example people here in argentina who were crypto traders that would serve us our off-ramps they started accepting this token as well because they they saw it in a decentralized exchange or a centralized exchange maybe and they realized that they could also use it um you know to uh hatch some volatility maybe uh with um from crypto or just have it um as another uh useful token that they can trade against and that happened in early 2018 i opened the cdp and borrowed psy to purchase a car and i ended up doing that transaction via telegram i contacted somebody that i'd never seen in my life i sent him psy and he deposited pesos into the car dealer the car dealer's bank account and i got my car so no paperwork required to do that this is all essentially between no no bank in the middle it's all just you know mariano's etherdress and a smart contract protocol in order to do that transaction now like you know just for folks who maybe aren't as familiar with uh what you were saying what you just just described so we've got die which is a a stable coin you were talking about a precursor to die and that maintains one-to-one stability with the us dollar uh and the way it does that is it's it's collateralized so it's it's backed by um generally crypto as collateral so um ether as as collateral right so you've got the stability mechanism and this credit mechanism so when you were talking about opening up a cdp that was you actually opening up a loan they're also called vaults in the new maker system to actually mint your own die is that correct so this is like stability on one side of things in the maker system and then credit on the other side of things is that right that is correct so um yeah every diet that is in circulation is because somebody put in a valuable asset in this case most likely ether and they over collateralized to uh mint this stable coin die so if if somebody puts 150 worth of ether they can mint a hundred die and the beauty of the system is that you can see and you can verify that there is always a lot more value backing the dye than than what the dye is worth yeah so so you immediately decided to start taking your your paycheck and die and this is not completely uh foreign or strange to you because you previously you were getting paid in bitcoin as a contractor but what is what was the advantage for you uh in die versus bitcoin well the first advantage is that i am now in control of uh what i want to do with it and uh in terms that often when i get uh when i get paid i put back most of it back into the crypto market right i i like uh buying more ether but in this case i don't have to worry if i'm gonna get paid on the fifth of the month and how bitcoin is doing that day or maybe it's a friday and i'm gonna have to get paid on next monday or tuesday and you know what if the price went up or the price went down and and you're wondering so with this you get a a reliable paycheck with a reliable number if you're going to get paid x then it's going to be worth x whenever you get it and then you can do what you want with it and for something like a paycheck i think it is extremely important i there are many people who either cannot save or can save a very small amount and having them get paid in a currency that can go down 20 percent that may mean not being able to pay rent that month or buying less food you know what i'm saying we all remember when we got paid in bitcoin and the price went up 20 right but if uh try to remember when it did the other way and maybe we're in a in a position of privilege where it's like yeah okay i don't need to sell it right now i'm gonna wait until it's back um where i say yeah now it's a good time to sell but so many people don't have that opportunity it's like if i don't sell it today then i'm gonna get evicted and they may be forced to sell at a price that is not convenient to them the the power of die and and stable coins uh just they shield you from that uh from that worry and that's a big deal right like the stability of the value of your assets is really really important this isn't something to just kind of gloss over when you work hard you you know you go to work eight hours a day use blood sweat and tears as you go throughout your week you come back and you get your paycheck and then your paycheck starts you know changing how much it's worth uh that's an extra weight on your mental you know your mental capacity that not everyone really should have to to deal with and so the ability for being able to depend on the value of your paycheck and it's staying where you think it is is really important especially for long-term thinking stability really allows you to think longer than you know the next few weeks like okay so i have this much bitcoin and i have this much tolerance for it to change price before i get into trouble and i need to do something with stability you don't need to do that and so like the the the creation of stability on ethereum is is really really important however there are other ways to gain stability on ethereum today there are things like usdc or other stable coins that offer stability uh but they're not entirely bankless and so mariano you are head of smart contracts perhaps in the top one percent of people that can code on ethereum can you kind of just talk us talk to us about uh the difference between the die code and the usdc code and what that represents for people that are interested in going bankless yes so usdc it is an erc20 token so it is a smart contract that represents this this usdc tokens that are also packed to a us dollar so one one usdc is one us dollar and the only backing is a company that is saying that for every one of these that are in circulation i have that amount in my bank account either as cash or i think maybe notes of credit or something else i don't know something valuable but that it is very difficult for you to audit you cannot really go and knock on coinbase and say hey can you uh let me see your your bank statements maybe they they do have it uh i know that there are other ones like like tether that have been a little bit more shady about it i've read anywhere from yes we have a hundred percent uh cash we have one dollar for every one tether but then it was oh no we have 70 percent and then the other 30 is in other assets in the case of die everything that happens with the protocol happens as smart contracts and if you know how to read them you can go and verify that one dollar one die is backed by over three dollars worth of value whether it's um ether or basic attention tokens which are the main two collaterals and now even uh usdc which is a little bit less than than one percent of the total supply of diet this does mean that the protocol is more complicated but it also means that it is more decentralized it is more audible and that it occurs uh almost a hundred percent on the blockchain and not only that mariano but the in the code between dye and usdc there is a little snippet of code that changes the nature of these tokens one being fully permissionless like cash and one one being not can you kind of explain the difference between the actual code of the token and how that impacts people's trust in the system there is one main thing is that the usdc has a whitelist so or a blacklist depending on how you want to look at it but the company behind the usdc token can decide that one address has done something that they deem not right and they can block access to their tokens they can no longer transfer them and essentially it's just another way of of censorship diet does not have this it's uh it's fully permissionless you can trade it with whomever you want and i think that also gives it an edge we would say die is is basically fully bankless whereas usdc requires the permission of coinbase and it's really interesting you know we saw this in the lend f me hack so blend fme uh the guy stole 25 million dollars from a poorly coded uh smart contract and the very first thing this hacker did with um the usdc he he purchased and the other bank-backed crypto assets was sell them sell them for assets with stronger settlement guarantees like eth and like maker uh and uh knc and a few other tokens because those tokens could not be blacklisted uh those tokens did not require mission um permission from a crypto bank those tokens had stronger settlement guarantees we talked a little bit about that in episode six where we talked about the the density of these more trustless protocols and assets and how their greater density allows them to kind of sink to the bottom and become the foundation for other protocols to build on top of them because the rules do not change you know maybe just to to finish this off as we're talking about dye and how you've used dye so could you contrast dye uh to the you know u.s dollars that might be available to you in a commercial bank in argentina so what can you do with dye that you can't do with us dollars in an argentine in digital dollars in argentinian bank like i said there's only a limited amount of dollars that i can legally purchase um i'm probably required to uh i don't know sign a whole bunch of papers before i can transfer any significant amount i most likely would have a lot of trouble moving it out of the country if i move it into the country then and i'm not even talking about taxes right if i move it into the country then the government expects to to pay me a laughable amount uh for those dollars and other than that i'm just speculating because i honestly haven't done this in in five years i can i can tell you from ex from what other people have told me right and whenever they start doing that that's when uh i bring out the gospel you know so moving deeper into the maker protocol i want to talk about vaults and and credit uh stability is a really important product of the maker dao system and and stability is instantiated in die but at the on on the other side of the maker down system is the instantiation of credit and permissionless access to credit uh so maybe you can talk about uh how die comes to be and the and how anyone in the permissionless way can access a vault to mint die yes so so far we've talked about just one part of the system right the actual uh die token that anybody can buy on an exchange or you can get paid in it you can receive it you can send it that's uh the basic side of it and it requires very very um little you know investment in terms of you know reading what it is and how it works it's it's really very simple the other part for more advanced users is like you say the the credit part and that is for the people who want to create this die and the way they do it is they lock up a valuable asset let's say ether in this case they lock it up in a smart contract and completely permissionless anybody with an ethereum address and some ether in this can lock up this ether and they can borrow against it they can create die so there are a couple of uh of rules that the smart contract enforces so the first one is 150 collateralization um if you if your asset goes below this then it can be liquidated so and this happens instantly this is smart contracts they run 24 7 and have no conscience their code so they do what they're programmed to do so most people keep their vaults collateralized at at least 200 or 250 percent and once they create this die they can do whatever they want with it they can send it to somebody else they can put it on an exchange they can use any of the protocols that support it and as time goes on they there's something called the stability fee that accrues against the amount of dye that was minted so right now the stability fee is very low i think it's uh half a percent per year so if you borrow if you create 100 die and you keep it for a year then at the end of the year you will owe 100.05 die and this is compounded per second so if you only use it for a day you will only have to pay that that that small part um and really the offer and demand of the people either generating this die or paying back their debt is one of the main things that that give the the token stability if um if the system sees well i don't want to get to governance yet but if um if die is trading above a dollar then the idea is that um it should be cheaper to create this die so there can be more on the market and the other way around if die is trading below the pack then you know you make borrowing it more expensive so you have people go into the market and and create more demand for it so people can repay their debt so it is uh it is a balancing game it's very interesting yeah that's a really good point and that's something i want to harp on uh when the maker dow system you know deployed its code it's not simply this input one asset receives stability on the other side and this is a this is a good lesson in economics and finance you can't just remove stability uh you can't just delete it it go you can push it elsewhere and so when we create a stable die what the maker dial protocol does is it takes the volatility that is inherent in all assets and through some clever engineering it takes that volatility and it pushes it elsewhere and so with dye it takes a volatility and pushes it onto ether and onto mkr the token which we'll get into later and then also the stability fee and so the stability fee for the maker dot protocol has range anywhere from 0.05 percent to its highest i think of 20.05 um perhaps about a year ago and so the stability fee is actually relatively volatile but that acts as the equal and opposite counterweight to the stability of die while die is allowed to hover around a dollar the stability fee will fluctuate up and down to counter the market's demand for die and and it's important to note that die is not one dollar right you cannot go anywhere in the world and deposit a die and receive a dollar you can only sell it for a dollar for its value which hovers around a dollar and so it's important to know that uh stability has been pushed elsewhere with dye and that's really what the maker dial system does it is a it's a it's a stability reorganizing system now i want to talk about uh the collateral inside of maker dow that allows for the minting of dye and so multi-collateral dye which got pushed out earlier last year allows for any asset to be deposited into the maker dao protocol after that asset has been accepted by the governance and then that asset can be used to uh be to be collateral for die however uh there's there's only really two assets that are able to be uh collateral for die and really it's just one because the the other asset that's not ether basic attention token doesn't have that much dye backing it uh what about ether as a as a collateral type makes it such good collateral and why it's it's why there hasn't been you know other collateral types to be added to the maker dow system what what what are the qualities of ether that make it such good collateral well uh the maker protocol runs on the ethereum blockchain and ether is the native token to the ethereum blockchain so that will always in my opinion make it the best collateral for the system that is beyond question because there's no more decentralized trustless asset in ethereum than ether so that in and of itself even though the system at the smart contract level doesn't really distinguish one from another um it will still make it uh the best collateral the the system can have yeah so we've talked about the the diet token itself which is instability we've talked about permissionless credit um and we talked about the stability fee which is essentially if you were to equate this to you know a traditional banking system somebody takes out a loan and they pay an interest rate that's what the stability fee is but there's also another component of all of this that makes it super interesting so if you have die you can actually put it into a smart contract called the die savings rate and you can receive some interest for your die too so this almost acts like a a bankless savings account can you tell us a bit about the die savings rate what that is where those fees come from and how it works that was one of the the biggest announcements of multi-collateral die the the dice savings rate the system keeps tabs of surplus and debt so surplus is as you say all of the stability fees that the system accrues plus um the liquidation penalties should any vaults be liquidated and on the other side the system tracks system debt which in this case is mostly when the system creates die let's call it out of thin air so the the die savings rate which can be independent from whatever the system is actually making in surplus it it is really the system minting dye out of thin air but the good thing is that if the system is well governed that die will be cancelled out by the amount of surplus in the system and so really it comes from people opening vaults and paying their stability fees and should there be an imbalance that there is not enough surplus in the system but there continues to be a die savings rate that needs to be paid eventually it can be paid off via mkr inflation but that would probably mean that the system would need some parameters uh reworked in really normal scenario the die savings rate comes from some of the stability fees so die in the dsr receives the part of the interest payments paid by the people that minted to die in the first place and there's actually this really cool team that made this thing called chai which is dye that is inside of the dsr wrapped in a new token and so basically this new token is die plus the interest rate that the dye is receiving which makes it really similar to sea dye from the compound protocol and so like both of these tokens represent a claim on die and a claim on the interest being paid to that die at the time of ownership and so these these really cool tokens are stable plus interest uh but uh chai and c die chai from the dsr and c die from compound they're not exactly the same can you kind of compare and contrast uh the the differences between chai and sedai the main thing i would say is that um chai has no inherent added risk versus something like a sea dye which does have a money market behind it in the case of chai it it is the dsr so as long as you accept the risk of the maker platform you have no added risk because you're not um you don't have a lender and a borrower you only have the maker protocol and and the savings that you earn come from the surplus that the system is making um one other thing is i really like the way that you know i whenever i've bought c die or i've traded there's this weird calculation that i have to make um in the case of chai you can always say uh okay i have one chai and then you can look at the underlying value so the the number of child never changes you um but the underlying value does it uh it always uh it's always increasing so we've got mariana we've got um dye right and there are there are ways to kind of compose it with other protocols and other features and you can create things like chai which is just dye wrapped with the die savings rate so you don't have to do anything and you're always receiving interest like a like a savings account embedded inside of a token right no let's get crazy for for a minute here because this is um this kind of thing the composability of these money legos uh like starts to really blow your mind when you think of what the possibilities are of dye as a building block for all of these other things so what are some more interesting combinations that we can make out of this die so for example um you know the aztec team they are developing a money lego for privacy and i know they've created a token called zkdie so it's dye except completely private so none of the transactions can be tracked so could we take something like that could we wrap it with a chai add the dsr could we then wrap some kind of insurance on top of it so that you're actually you've got an embedded almost fdic insurance in case something were to happen with um with with maker like how crazy could we get with this stability primitive of dye with all of these money legos i think we can get as crazy as our imagination will let us uh of course ckdi was the first one and chai could probably be the second one that aztec does because um it really wouldn't be any different from what they've already done and then you would get all the benefits of um of the i plus the the die savings rate and then as for insurance i'm pretty sure that you can do uh almost the same thing if you look at open um in the end what the system produces is also i believe a set of your erc20 so um i wouldn't see why not um something very similar i'm not an aztec expert maybe they say that that is not possible but from what i've seen it should totally be possible to um to do that and then you would be wrapping a stable coin with automatic savings with uh some kind of insurance protection and the possibility of having it all be private it's it's my blog yeah i mean this is programmable money guys this is like we are installing mods on top of our money system and and making it better so what we just covered mariano is we've got this new bankless stability token called die which is completely backed by crypto doesn't require a bank we've got this credit facility that maker has created so it's permissionless credit no bank once again we've got a bankless savings account too but there's one element of the maker system we we should spend some more time on and that's the governance piece as embodied at some level in another token called mkr the maker token itself can you tell us a little bit about why the maker token is necessary and a little bit about governance of the maker system the mkr token is there mainly for two reasons one is to vote on the different uh parameters that the system will have you know what is going to be the stability fee of ether how much die can you create with that should the system add another collateral things like that and the other one is the the mkr token is the one that gives you lets you enjoy the the benefits of the system when there is surplus and it also acts as a backstop when there is deficit and the mkr token i always say it's a high responsibility token it's it's one that really makes you be involved with the community and you should if you are a holder you should be informed of what is happening because you have a responsibility to govern the system in the best way possible and if you do so and if the community overall chooses same risk parameters and saying collateral and reacts quickly when you know there are market downturns then you can earn money on when the system is doing well and the same thing if the system is not doing well then you can possibly start losing some because of you know the system may need to mint more mkr and you could get diluted so it is a high responsibility token it is a volatile token and it's also where uh when david was mentioning that die uh sort of uh moves the volatility elsewhere it also uh kind of moves it in a way to the mkr token and one of the most interesting things that is happening lately is the addition of the maker improvement proposals or mips just like the eips and ethereum we're finally at a point where the community is now mature enough that it is going through this path of you know gradual decentralization and taking a more active role uh because of course the idea of the foundation is to take a step back and let the community govern itself as it should so the mkr asset the mkr token is this tool that allows for the management of the maker dow protocol to stay on chain and so remember maker dao and dai are entirely on chain infrastructure dai gets its stability from the inside of ethereum which is in contrast to usdc which gets its stability from a centralized bank on the outside of ethereum like the the the reason why usdc is stable is because you can take that usdc outside of ethereum and redeem it for a dollar and that's where it gets its stability maker dial can't do that because it needs to be a fully bankless system and in order to have stability you have to escape the ethereum blockchain some way or another because stability happens outside of ethereum stability is a reference point you need something outside of ethereum to anchor the value of die to the dollar and that requires getting data off the chain onto the chain of ethereum and this is what the mkr token really governs over the the network of smart contracts that is the maker dow system is a network that is a system that takes outside stability and outside reference points and anchors it and die and mkr is the token that allows for that to happen as mariano said mkr is this token that is it's a governance token it's a it's a responsibility token and it is also an upside token and so with dye you're never going to really have upside there's never going to be growth uh going upwards with dye and so that's really what mkr is for and it's it's this thing that if you use it and govern over the system uh correctly then the value of mkr is supposed to go up there is upside potential there but it is also you know a risk token so there's the uh like mariano said the whole idea about maker dao is taking the risk and putting it elsewhere and that's what you then that's where we have placed the risk we've placed the risk in mkr really the cool thing to me mariano about mkr is that it represents a seat at the table for governing the system mkr is this governance token and it allows for anyone to also govern the maker dow protocol just like how die is totally permissionless mkr is totally permissionless and so that means that anyone can take part in the permissionless governance of the maker dow system mariano can you tell us why somebody with mkr would be incentivized to make the right decision quote unquote yes because if they make the right decisions then the value of the mkr token is supposed to go up and um really that is that is at the crux of it if if the way the governance contracts because everything is a smart contract in the blockchain is the more mkr tokens are locked up for voting the more secure the system is because you need more consensus within the mkr community to enact changes and people say i've heard people say well i don't have that much mkr then it is pointless to vote and the answer is no even even a vote for the negative of anything that anybody is voting it's still a net positive for the system so the more mkr is locked up in the system the better and i don't know if you want to get into this yet but one of the core uh i think one of the mips that are coming the improvement proposals is effectively delegated voting which is something that is sorely missing from the system and my only concern is that i wish this had been done before because this being a permissionless system anybody could have done this in the past two or three years i'm a little bit saddened that nobody has done it yet but i'm hoping that people do it soon and this will allow you to delegate your mkr in a completely trustless manner to somebody that will make decisions for you because i can be informed of what is happening because i work at the foundation and i'm deep into this world 24 7 but maybe somebody else who has a smaller position it just doesn't care and cannot vote every day and cannot go to governance meetings but they can delegate their power to somebody they can trust to make good decisions for them and the beauty of this system is that if you stop trusting this person you can instantly remove access and give it to somebody else or start voting yourself it's um like ryan called them the protocol politicians that is going to be a very big deal in the future so this is some combination of like democratic voting slash skin in the game voting where you get more votes the more skin in the game you have but you can also point your votes towards somebody else who you trust that is more informed and more active in governance than you are so it's a really interesting hybrid mechanism and the reason why this gets me so excited is because you know one mkr equals one mkr there's no one that has more say than anyone else in this system based on their skin in the game and that's really been a problem with current democracies uh the united states is as a governance and and we i think we can say this for most countries they're trying to govern in my opinion over too many things too large of a set of governance things and as a result of that you know democracies have been hard to scale and i'm really optimistic about this model of both 1mkr equals one vote and also delegated voting and as a little a side note as little uh a short little story uh on 4th of july i wore my maker dao t-shirt and i tweeted out like why does this feel patriotic like why does this feel like independence and that's really what maker dao is it's independent from like legacy financial institutions and it's this new system that uh you know people need to support people in order for maker doubt to function it needs small grassroots voters to own and have responsibility over the maker dao system and i really am optimistic about the emergence of protocol politicians and the ability to host this grassroots uh bottom-up revolution this bottom-up protocol that is that uh maker dow is you guys see what david do you guys see what david just did there is he he launched his political campaign his maker down political campaign right here on the show i can tell vote david vote trustless [Laughter] i know that i want i know that i want both of you of course as protocol politicians for the system because you you understand it you are like you would be perfect for this and the beauty is is that i can build a smart contract that delegates my voting power to you guys but this of course requires a little bit more knowledge of of the underlying smart contracts but i can say okay you guys cannot vote with my tokens on a tuesday because i want to or once you vote on something you cannot unvote so you cannot flip flop on issues or i can remove 10 of my uh of your voting power that that you have from me but i cannot remove more than that i don't know once a day and this are this is code you can do really anything that you can imagine yeah absolutely and if look if we're getting political politician here uh you know i can be nancy pelosi and you could be donald trump david uh you're gonna rip up my paper yeah maybe so i wanna talk a little bit more about comparing maker governance versus the legacy system uh and so if people want to take part in maker governance there are these weekly meetings that they can go to uh there's the thursday risk calls and then also the tuesday community calls uh and and while the foundation is currently hosting those i do believe that they will exist into the future no matter what even as the foundation dissolves uh and that's in stark contrast to the quarterly uh calls that you get from you know companies on the public stock markets where you know once once a quarter they begrudgingly have to create this report for all their stakeholders they have to hop on a call and appease their stakeholders uh the stakeholders don't really get a say you can listen on to the call you can't really voice an opinion uh most you know most shares on the stock exchange are not voting shares and so you know this is the the maker system the maker governance just like how dye is completely open and permissionless so is maker governance and you know the the maker quarterly reports they don't happen every quarter they happen every block and and also every instead of you know the quarterly meetings there are two weekly meetings that are open zoom calls and so the the contrast between this the old system and the new system couldn't be more salient to me yes correct and those are two weekly calls and there is also you know the forums and the chat which is an asynchronous way of people sharing ideas which of course is the way the the world is moving now not everybody is free on a thursday uh at 1pm eastern time right um so lately so much more has been happening in the forums and then the governance calls yes they're away for synchronously uh coming up with you know some kind of consensus even before getting actual blockchain consensus but they're they're open they happen every thursday i encourage anybody to to join one to see um how decisions are made you know one thing i i uh also realized recently that's kind of special special about maker and um ubagles protocols like this and assets that really embody the upside of those protocols is that uh all of the the cash flows so so maker receives upside because when maker is used uh and stability fees are paid maker is burnt but all of these these cash flows if you will um are all entirely on chain so it's not settlement by legal system it's settlement by the nation state if you will of the ethereum economy and this is much different than other you know crypto bank tokens like bnb or something like that where you literally have to trust the the b and b the binance entity to actually burn tokens maybe they are maybe they aren't uh all of that cash flow transition is off-chain it's not visible it's not transparent to you this is really the birth of assets um crypto protocol assets where all of their cash flows are on chain and i think maker is really pioneering that space which is super interesting to me because there's going to be a lot more to come and we'll talk about some in future episodes but you know maybe we should we should kind of conclude with some of the challenges that you might see maker facing in the future so one is around centralization risks so this question of well with with this added layer of governance you know is maker going or could make her go down the path of becoming a bit more like a crypto bank or could die with the incorporation of uh you know crypto collateral that's settled off chains not like eth not not as trustless as eth but other crypto collateral could die become a bit more like usdc what are your thoughts on that mariano any anything top of mind there the first thing that i believe is that dye can be a decentralized asset even if it is backed by an amount of centralized assets and i hope i i can make the distinction so right now there's less than one percent um of dye backed by usdc which we've already said that it is centralized it has a blacklist so there is for example the possibility that coinbase freezes um the amount of usdc in the dye system and that is a risk just like any other that we've talked about that maker governance has to uh decide and study and say okay if this is a risk then what is the limit of uh dye that can be created uh with usdc because if at any point um they decide to blacklist the system then mkr holders are you know uh liable for x amount of money and you know mkr needs to be minted um same thing goes with any other asset that could be used in the future anything that represents uh real world assets you know like uh realty properties um anything that can have uh the only thing that you need to put something in the maker protocol is um a price fee really after that it is all uh a matter of managing risk and putting that in a uh you know either a representation of a near c20 token or something that the system can understand but i would say that one the system is still decentralized even if it is backed by an amount of centralized assets it's just like i said a manner of risk i do believe that ether is going to continue to be the dominant uh asset that that bags die just because of the wonderful properties that ether has and the fact that it is the main acid on uh on ethereum uh as for governance um i hope that with the the advent of of you know delegated voting and and things like that that we end up seeing maybe if we see less individual participation that it be because people are delegating to power users and i think that in the end could be a net positive because you can have you can have more voting power and and the good thing is that this is not somebody that you're voting for a four-year term you're voting them for as long as you want to and you can automate your contract so that when they vote on something that you specifically do not want that you take away their power in the time that it takes to mine one transaction that i think is real power absolutely and and what to me in my mind maker dow is this risk filtering system the different risk parameters that you can set for a specific collateral is is really taking out whatever risk that collateral has and so to whatever degree that a specific collateral has centralization risk it's the role and responsibility of maker dow and the maker data protocol to filter out the risk however there are um you know there are in theory other ways to design stability right um and while we don't well i don't know exactly what they are because i'm not a technical technical coder i'm i want to pick your brain and see you know is maker dow the final version of stability on ethereum do you think that whatever the design specification of maker dow what that is is is that the last the the best version of stability or do you think that there are actually more algorithmic more code-based less human-based versions of stability for dye out there or a token-like diet is there are there other ways to produce stability that we haven't explored yet i'm pretty sure they are i mean ethereum is five years old die is three years old the there are gonna be new advances and i hope that the maker community can stay nimble and adopt um you know whatever new paradigms that make sense for the protocol um i would say yes i think there is room for uh i believe some people call it uh the purity die you know um what used to be single collateral die a stable compact only by ether it does have its uh it's good qualities it's also probably less resistant to black swan events so as long as you know we can probably communicate the risks of you know using one system or the other there is also the possibility to move certain risk parameters over and give them over to algorithms this is possible in in multicollateral dye as well and the community will be exploring uh some of those because yeah if computers are are smart and are fast and can make better decisions than us then why shouldn't we um the thing is this all in the case of of maker it's everything is a process that um takes a little bit of time to first propose things and discuss them vote on them and eventually putting them on the blockchain it i hope that we continue to be innovative because we're we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with this technology mariano this has been this has been fantastic i want to ask one last question because we we started this by comparing in contrasting argentina and the traditional banking system versus this crypto money system we've talked about it right now crypto has stability it's got a bankless way to receive uh credit it's got a bankless savings account it's got something that the the state of argentina cannot stop cannot impose capital controls on what's it going to take for more adoption in a place like argentina it seems like we have all of these building blocks and the value proposition is clear um why haven't we seen more adoption and what's it going to take to bring in the next million people into a system like dye that is a great question so two weeks ago i saw something that really broke my heart on tv we've been in quarantine for a month and two weeks ago the government started paying people's social security on you know using traditional banks and when they could they would send money to people's debit cards but there are still so many uh people that are bankless but not tech savvy you know i saw lines and lines and lines of uh old people who are the people who are most at risk during this pandemic uh staying up queuing since 4am to cash either a check or or or collect the cash for their pensions and i was thinking this would be the perfect audience but they don't even understand the the technology so how can we make this uh simpler for for people and then i realized for every one of those that i saw i'm on telegram and what's up groups that uh are onboarding new young people every day and i think that is where uh this is gonna be i seriously i'm an optimist but i don't have high expectations of uh you know uh boomers in the country uh adopting this technology but young people that have been born with the internet and they do their finance over the phone this kind of thing really gets them excited it's um like you said in argentina the only goal for people is to get access to dollars that's what's on everybody's minds and this is a great tool set for them to do that and you know you take away trusting a bank trusting an institution which uh a lot of these young people they haven't had a hyper inflation yet they've never lived through one maybe they will live through one this year or the next but it is so ingrained in you know their genetic memory that that they know enough not to trust their money uh to the institutions this technology just uh it checks all the all the right parts for them mariano i want to thank you for coming on to bankless sharing your bankless story and helping our listeners use the maker dow protocol to go more bankless you are a fantastic ambassador both for the maker dial protocol and for crypto at large there are a ton of talks and other podcasts that you've done which we're going to link in the show notes two that come to mind for me was your devcon talk in osaka and then also the essay that you wrote and read on the lore shin podcast if people really want to send something to their friends and family that tugs at their heartstrings as to why we need this bankless revolution those would be the two things i would point you to mariano thanks for coming on bankless and giving us your time thank you so much for an invitation let's get to the action so what we want you to do today is go check out maker the protocol go check out die go check out if you're more ambitious the wrapped protocols on top of dye like chai deposit some funds into the die savings right see what happens you could also if you're more advanced test out the maker vault feature you know it's fine to use test amounts to start and and see what the experience is like also in the show notes you'll see links to all of the the podcasts and videos that david was referring to you can hear more about mariano's story it's inspirational uh highly recommended there as always guys this is the wild west eat this risky crypto is risky d5 protocols like maker have risk to them too you could lose what you put in make sure you understand the risks before you do so we're headed to the frontier this isn't for everybody but we are glad that you are with us on the bankless journey thanks everyone
