david all right what's your favorite man is l2 here is layer 2 here so i i got my loopering wallet up and running last week and i made just some quick east to usdt transfers it's actually the first and only time i've owned usdt is on loopering it was a breeze dude it was it was fantastic it's exactly the experience that i would enjoy and like i actually kind of feel good about paying these like penny fees on loopering because it's not fee it's not free there are fees but uh coming out of that conversation that we had in the rant that we did about robin hood and then the conversations that we had with the winklevoss um the fee the the free model of robin hood is actually toxic and so the the pennies that you pay on the loop ring l2 along with the instant transactions which are of course just an absolute treat it makes me feel good it's like yes i'm i should be paying pennies for this that feels like the right price um and so ring or loopering the l2 is absolutely here uh and i think when the immutable x platform launches with nfts i'll finally dive back into my gaussian chain guards and start playing some games there yeah synthetics is the only one i haven't really tried of course uh immutable x because it hasn't launched yet but um loop ring does seem fantastic and david it just seems like the missing piece here is getting some fiat on ramps directly into loop ring matt had an interesting comment he he said that maybe some of the exchanges might see it as competitive but i don't think they will you know like i think that the exchanges have their secret sauce which is you know they are a bridge between the legacy financial world and this new financial system right and like they've got that locked you know they've have all the regulatory boxes checked they've got a foot in the old world in the foot in the new world they're just gonna go where the economic activity is and if that economic activity lives in ethereum layer twos whether it's loop ring or whether it's you know an optimistic roll-up that's where they're going to drop users off ultimately it's going to be up to uh their users demand their customers demand so like we have to demand and advocate for getting exchanges to support layer 2 directly once we have that david this space is going to absolutely like blow up in terms of use i was amazed that loopering already has 250 million total locked value and that's without a fiat on ramp that's how hungry people are for cheap layer two solutions right now yeah and i think the uh you know the fiat on-ramp into l2 it's it's destined to happen and i think i think i can confidently say that because there's a little bit of a moloch trap going on right where it's in the best interest of exchanges centralized exchanges to not support loopring because it is their native competitor right so why would they want to benefit loopering because it's their loss but if every single centralized exchange is operating under that paradigm then it only takes one centralized exchange to defect and b that one centralized exchange that charges that 15 fee to get your your fiat deposited into loopering it only takes one right um and so and and i don't even think that's why that's happening i don't think centralized exchanges are like no loopering loopering is going to eat mine i don't think they seem as though i don't i don't think they they think that way i think it's just simply a matter of there's just not enough demand there and that's why i've been trying to like on twitter and on the podcast be like looping loopling bloopering bloopering because it is our version of both venmo and robin hood that is the providing the user experience that people like um and so is and the the other real the thing that they still have to fight for the thing that they still haven't solved which is not really something that is solvable by them is liquidity bloopering liquidity is really strong for east usdt it's really strong for eth dpi actually because i think the index co-op actually subsidizes with index rewards for youth dpi liquidity providers on looping um but after that i think the liquidity starts to really drop off um so that's actually something that i've been positioning myself for as soon as as soon as the market continues a little bit i think i might be transferring some eth and some some of my default tokens over the loopering just to provide liquidity there yeah that's that's that's a public good but you also get you also get paid for it as well yeah so i um i mean the best kind of public good is the one that pays me yeah i mean i'm definitely bullish on on what those guys are saying i mean this time it does feel different i mean i we made this comment during the podcast but uh the children of 2017 i think felt like scalability was just around the corner and it never turned out to be the case like state channels kind of evaporated into like not really being practical for the types of defy applications we we needed plasma really never panned out the way but like this feels different this time and i think you don't have to believe the panelists and the people we talked to you don't even have to believe us just go out and start using the applications the thing about loopering you could feel good about too is it's not fake defy there's a lot of like david like fake defy out there right now like i mean to be honest man finance justin sun learned this two years ago when at consensus he branded himself and put himself everywhere with the tagline dare to defy in 2018. like people have been writing a d5 brand forever yeah and now that it's popular the more they're they're obviously going to run on it like um uh cz from binance you know it talked about seedify that that's what the binance chain is essentially but i mean 21 validators uh none of it's really open source all controlled by binance elected entities oh my god dude that's the same that's the same banking cartel system we just came from that's not why i'm going bankless that's not why you're going bankless it's not even an improvement to the existing system we have when insiders can kind of like front run you or reverse transactions or sensor things um i guess you don't have to worry about hacks in those scenarios because you know somebody could just reverse the transaction but the thing about these layer two solutions particularly like the ones that are secured by ethereum is they are bankless so when you're using loop ring you know you are using a trustless system that is secured by ethereum and man that feels good too right yeah and i think one thing that all these uh all these implementers these defy implementers i think we need to get we need to sponsor some like nft where somebody like draws like the deep implementers anyways um the one thing that they all seem to understand pretty well and and all talk about is that it's it's l2 real l2s are an extension of ethereum native security but i think they all started to hint at this as well is when you when you have that box checked and you are an extension of ethereum native security you are also an extended native extension of the ethereum community right when you don't sacrifice values you don't sacrifice the community and there's there's that extension of values is really really important it's not just about the security it's that what comes with the security it's the whole package it's everything and that's what cd5 or sidechains that's what they don't bring along that's what they don't understand did you hear david the passion in which uh in particular all of them but in particular robbie addressed this with robbie from immutablex right so i mean he was just like look uh competing projects competing ethereum killer projects have literally bribed us to leave ethereum and come to their chain like literally we will give you millions of dollars to go do this right um but his point was like it's not worth it for us these projects don't have a soul they don't have a long-term future it's a deal with the devil we are thinking about building immutable x for the for the long term right and so we're not going to take these shortcuts right like 250 million dollar war chest can't buy your project a soul is the bottom line here and so we saw some of that uh loyalty come through and some some people might think oh my god like these are just talkers right like what's left people talking about faith who are these people look man it's not so uh be if you're maximalist be maximalist to a set of ideals right to a set of values like i i would consider myself not an ethereum maximalist but like a decentralization maximalist a bankless maximalist like i care deeply about these things because if we just recreate the system that we just left we haven't we haven't done anything in crypto like we haven't given anything back to the world that's not why i'm here and i don't think that's why any of these projects are here so it wasn't so much that they're like loyal to ethereum but they are loyal to the set of values that are baked into the ethereum protocol and the ethereum social contract and i i just saw that uh you know come through the other thing i saw was something that justin kept going back to and wait wait but before before you turn to justin pause on that thought because i want to riff on that think about how meaningful it is when the c ceo or i think i think uh president co-president that robbie is uh turns down i think what he said was 250 000 or maybe even more uh when he turns that down and he's not doing that because he has like this like political alignment to ethereum he's he's making a rational choice he's just saying that the choice to stay on ethereum is worth more than the bride from other chains yeah right and not not only is ethereum not bribing him ethereum is expensive for him like immutable has spent a ton of money on gas and so like not only is ethereum not bribing him but they're actually costing him money and he still thinks that the benefit of staying on ethereum is worth it right and uh when he said that i was reminded of our conversation with vitalik on his 2020 reflections podcast with us where he said that there are some incentives that aren't money right there are incentives such as meaning and purpose and having a soul right and that's what you find on ethereum ethereum has culture ethereum has soul and if you leave ethereum for binance chain or eos or whatever you're giving up the culture and the soul and the memes and the community and that's the whole point of this whole revolution is all of those things yeah it goes back to naval's statement you know play long-term games with long-term people and this is like these projects are playing a long-term game with a long-term network right like they are they're valuing that higher than any short-term profits or any sort of bribes uh competing chains might offer um the other point i was going to get to a bit about justin is he kept referencing sort of uh the development style that we've seen so much in ethereum and in the development of its protocol but also the development of d5 and layer twos which is kind of this difference um between like the cathedral and the bazaar so this guy wrote a book in uh 1999 called the cathedral and the bazaar and it was really comparing kind of the open source movement versus like the top-down traditional software development uh that that used to happen right so that would be the cathedral like here are the specifications right now the overlords will pass these specifications to you the developers and you will implement it per the requirements well the bazaar is not like that at all it's chaos it's an open market anyone can come it's permissionless but what ends up happening with like a linux versus windows is open source linux wins it wins uh like from a game theoretic perspective and it wins because in the bazaar the like the best vendors kind of rise to the top and all of the experiments are tried and this is really the ethereum communities development ethos when it comes to anything but when it comes to layer twos like all of the things are are being tried i go back to like bitcoin what how is bitcoin going to scale aside from like side chains like binance and coinbase and crypto banks right it's got that but uh lightning like one we have one solution right it's it's like this cathedral-based approach like which is which is so strange to me but ethereum what's it doing well it's trying like everything that's possible and through that is going to converge on on the best solution so it's this bizarre like experimentation that justin kept coming back to that i think is so important in like the organic material of a developer ecosystem like this yeah the the cathedral versus bizarre metaphor is the way i interpret that is order versus chaos and you you said order when you called it the bizarre and like the cathedral is the the hierarchy the the the rules the the constructs these structures that when they are good because they provide order to our lives but as they grow older and older and older they grow more and more rigid and calcified they're brittle yeah brittle and oppressive right because when these gargantuan structures grow too large you can't climb them anymore right you can't climb up the social ladder of social orders and social structures and so therefore we turn to the bazaar which is chaos which is creative destruction which is order out of just this cesspool of ideas where just atoms and atoms and atoms of ideas are colliding against each other and they create these new structures that are no longer oppressive that are no longer and it looks like it shouldn't work it looks like it shouldn't work from the outside you're like oh my god this is pure chaos how is any of this stuff there's no grand unified plan how is any of this stuff going to work out and it turns out to work out better because organic leaves are tried yeah organically all of the things are tried and only the good things stick and that's what gets me so bullish about ethereum is that it's it's what we call chaotic organization it's the organization through chaos it's not top-down organization it's bottom-up organization and only the best things are chosen to survive via chaotic organization yeah yeah exactly so okay so when you sort of zoom out and look at layer two um [Music] it feels like it's here partially but it also feels like it's not complete yet right like um i am waiting for a optimistic roll up for defy to come to fruition right like it's good that synthetics is there and trying it but just synthetics in its own optimistic roll-up is not enough i am really looking forward to seeing what's going to happen with uh uniswap they're kind of the next big mover that's sort of on my radar and last i understood they were going in a optimistic roll-up type direction in the same sort of direction that synthetics is but i have that like uniswap has been a little quiet recently i think they're keeping things under wrapped and they're just going to do a big reveal at some point but that to me is the next major phase of this can we get multiple d5 protocols on the same optimistic rollup and then after that probably the next frontier is how can we get integration and interoperability across the roll-ups themselves how do we build those bridges which seems like it's a whole nother topic of conversation and research is going to come down later but like what were your takeaways how close does this stuff feel to you yeah it feels like everyone is kind of in this sort of like standoff where everyone everyone's in a circle yeah unit swap is looking at compound compound is looking at synthetic synthetics is looking to make her down and they're like which what's what are you gonna do like what roll up are you going on to because if you go onto that one that might change my decision-making right and so like everyone's kind of waiting for everyone else to make moves and like in that scenario it's like when one person makes a move everyone starts to make moves right and so like i kind of think we're in this holding pattern for we're we're all kind of waiting for uniswap like what's uniswap gonna do like what the hell is this compound cash chain what what what's that doing what are we gonna do there um and i think we're all kind of like in this calm before just the mass mass just like exodus on to l2s right we all come where we all kind of figure it out uh and you know while i kind of illustrate that that's going to just happen at the flick of the switch it's actually not going to be like that at all it won't be like that it'll still be confusing it'll still be chaos um it's still going to take some time for that really for that dust to settle um and in the meantime it's actually it's it's going to be painful like there's still going to be gas fees they're going to be gas fees for the next six months we're going to hear about it on twitter on crypto twitter um but i think going along with the bankless narrative of like you can venture out onto the frontier and gain access to new knowledge some people still think that l2 isn't here yet you can trade the liquidity on east to tether on loopering is insane you can if you are just trading eth to tether or eat dollars and you want to do that in a d5 way we already have that that's on loop ring and so some people have already figured that out and if you keep on and the way i've been illustrating this is that scale and l2 is happening at the margins and it's marching inwards right it's marching into the core of ethereum where the rest of us are and it really hasn't that slow march inwards hasn't really met the average user yet because if you really want to find l2 you have to go outwards you have to go to the frontier you have to go to the margins but the margins are expanding right liquidity on loopering is expanding uh synthetics is building out is staking it's expanding these the real estate of l2 is expanding it just hasn't reached the fold yet it hasn't reached the core of ethereum yet yeah you mentioned two things there one is this is going to be painful in the short run right and the second um thing you mentioned you you talked about the like the term narrative and i'm wondering your thoughts on this because i you know i recently tweeted out if you take like just two of the quote unquote ethkillers killers alternative layer ones to ethereum um atoms so cos the cosmos network and um polka dot those two projects alone are 35 billion in terms of market cap right and compare those two the only two projects that are you know there are more than two but two two projects that are kind of large enough to to surface on the top 100 coin market cap are um loopering and matic uh now called polygon and those collectively are about like one billion okay or like 1.5 billion so i think less than one billion i think looping is 500 million and billion or 500 million i was going for i was going fully diluted value okay like somewhere around there that is the smarter way to view things by the way for the listeners yeah um so okay so basically a 30x um these killers are kind of a 30x and so the the question is um narrative because we know that the market in the in the short run uh short to medium run trades completely on narrative not in fundamentals fundamentals are almost like a a bear market thing right so like the best time to invest in fundamentals is like 2018 2019 right yeah from there on out so we're beyond fundamentals my friend it's just narrative it's just we just care about narratives because it's a bull run now if you're a long-term thinker and you're not interested in like trading on narratives which you have to do if you're playing the narrative game then you can do things like we talked about invest neath invest in bitcoin invest the dpi and have a good night's sleep right but anyway the market's going to get completely insane with with narratives especially as gas fees you said short-term pain they're gonna be painful for a while like this isn't a the migration to layer two isn't gonna be like we snap our fingers and suddenly i keep getting these these tweets and people saying like when are the gas fees going down right and i'm like they're never gonna go down on they're never going down they're not they're never they're never going down so in this world where it's painful in the short run layer two is getting built out gas fees aren't going uh down it feels to me like these alternative layer ones have maybe not a lot of fundamental runaway but they have a lot of narrative runways that's a narrative yeah and that's why they are like pumping to the level they are and that might continue david if this continues to be painful in in the short run what are your thoughts on that yeah it's an unfortunate reality and like at the end of the day the this is just kind of i feel like this is just economics right like there's so much demand for ethereum and it has not yet built out its own l2 ecosystem to capture its own demand therefore the demand is overflowing and so for a short while perhaps there will be demand of polka dot right perhaps there will be demand of finance smart chain uh there's this thing on binance smart chain that's like a uniswap fork that is called pancake swap or something like whatever a weird name but so is uniswap i guess um and they actually it's actually doing pretty comparable uh volume i think like i think it's doing like roughly one sixth the volume of unit swap which is pretty good because unit swap is doing insane volume so like there's this app like unit swap like application on binance smart chain that's doing one sixth of volume so like there is overflow and there is now volume there and likely because of ethereum gas fees and so the fundamentals of binding smart chain are improving but at the end of the day it's because it's overflow from ethereum like congratulations pancake swap you have unit swaps sloppy seconds like all the value that uniswap wasn't able to capture because it hasn't built out its own l2 which is working on it's making its way to you know centralized exchanges right that makes sense as soon as ethereum offers the the wells and the new real estate to capture its own value it's staying on ethereum because like we've been saying there's soul on ethereum there's community on ethereum there's purpose on ethereum and you don't find that on binance marketing so people are going to prioritize native ethereum over binding smart chain you know what else is on ethereum david is economic bandwidth particularly trustless economic bandwidth and i could tell that robbie is a bankless consumer because he brought that very term up which was awesome that's something you can't get on the binance chain you can't get a completely crypto economically settled store a value asset like eth on the binance chain there's all sorts of trusted parties whether it's you know the 21 validators that binance elects involved or and there's there's no actual like crypto native store a value on the binance chain so all the transactions that you're talking about and all the volume none of that is trustless economic value it's things like usdt and stable coins that also have tethers and settlement in in the real world too so i i do think uh the way robbie was talking about it and seeing that there are it's scalability is more than just transactions per second right it's like market cap of the the base layer asset it is um the community the ecosystem of uh applications like the social contract all of these things are part of the scalability story of uh of a chain and uh need to be looked at too um anything else any other takeaways from that up yeah there's one one remaining part of that that was my a big takeaway and we we saw this metaphor come out i think from ashley schapp i think is the tweeter behind this but it was like uh but in the early days of the cell phone it was like 12 inches long and cost like four thousand dollars right this is just how technology works it's really really expensive and it's shitty but you don't really have any comparative because it's the first time that technology has ever came around and that's where we are with ethereum right it's really expensive it's still pretty slow we still don't have ethereum 2.0 but that's just how technology works and when robbie was talking about nfts i was thinking about like the nft hype the nft mania that's going on right now is awesome but it's actually not the nfts that immutable x the the l2 for gaussian chained and immutable is really building because the mutable x is building nfts that are small in value yet the nfts that are being uh all the making all the hype and all the splash today are thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars which makes sense because you have to pay the gas fees right like why are people aren't trading these like 25 cent you know two dollar gauss and chain cards because it doesn't make any sense they are they are doing the you know ten thousand dollar plus nfts the people nfts the nba top shot nfcs that are worth you know people made like some some like 0.7 million dollars like those are the nfts that are hot right now and the reason why they're hot is because those are the only feasible nfts and so there's going to be when when immutable x opens up and there's going to be like there's going to be room for you know micro transactions like one of the great promises of this cryptocurrency industry is micro transactions when's the last time you've heard the phrase micro transactions like it's been a while i remember my bitcoiners used to talk about uh money and microtransactions before that came like totally unfeasible in the bitcoin network and it just returned into store value store value story value and one part that we didn't get in the value of creative versus value competitive model uh conversation was that like say say there's all this economic activity with like small units on immutable x like tons of small units like uh tons of volume because they're all they're like cards are flying all over all over the place and then we can also say the same thing with like the the loop ring l2 and the synthetics l2 and there's all this economic activity going on on the l2s that's not going on on ethereum well the l2 is like this reservoir and we talked about this conversation with nick carter when we talked about um the the block space fee cycle where on the l1 the fees go up and that halts economic activity yeah and then and then the the gas fees go down and people start to transact again the reason why it halted was that because there was no alternative place to escape to and so these l2s are actually like these batteries of economic activity and that's i think a really strong argument for why all these l2s are going to be value or creative to ether the asset is because when people are pushed off of the main ethereum l1 because of high gas fees they're going to go on to l2 because they have that option and they're going to have this immense amount of economic activity and it's only going to increase on the l2 yet when the transaction fees on the l1 lower back down it becomes more feasible for people to come back to the l1 and increase the economic activity back on the l1 so there's always this reservoir every single l2 is a reservoir of energy of reservoir of economic activity for the l1 to tap into if it ever needs to if the if the demand for l1 ever goes down because the demand for l1 going down is bad because that's the security for ethereum so all these l2s are like security batteries they're like these security reservoirs for economic activity on ethereum i think that's just off so awesome so yeah that's a good point and that that's again the reason that uh gas fees on ethereum are never going down right because they're never going down they'll they'll move uh so some of the smaller transactions that you said they'll move to to player two but uh anytime gas fees start to go low in manhattan it's like price of real estate price of real estate in manhattan like never drops because people snap it up they'll move from brooklyn brooklyn back to manhattan um so yeah i agree i think that's kind of how it's working out but and also to your point that layer two unleashes a whole new set of use cases that were never going to be possible on layer one right those micro transactions are not happening on layer one and they're not feasible they're not possible it's just yeah exactly it's never going to happen and that was interesting to to hear matt say we were never going to deploy loopering on layer 1 because the type of app we needed was never conducive to the transaction throughput of layer one so we started immediately with with layer two like you can build different types of applications in in layer two and i think that's definitely gonna be a source of demand and innovation like there'll probably be a whole new cycle of cool interesting things that happen on layer two that could never happen on on layer one we're gonna go through those innovation waves as well yep wrap it up there call good let's wrap it up man spin the deep reef we're gonna do more on layer two right absolutely and more on layer two and more on nfts i'm pretty sure that's all that we have in the podcast content if there's now there's a lot to learn here so i'm glad we're doing this david all right man thanks that was a debrief thanks everyone for listening bye
