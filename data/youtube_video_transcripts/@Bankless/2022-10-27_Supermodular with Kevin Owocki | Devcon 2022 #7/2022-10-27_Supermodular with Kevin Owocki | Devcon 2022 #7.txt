foreign [Music] back to the Devcon 6 experience except this one's a little bit different because this one was actually at shelling Point shelling point is the conference that tags along with so many of the other ethereum community conferences there was a shelling point at devconnect uh there's a shelling Point here at Devcon and so this this interview is with Kevin owaki uh of former get coin Fame and now of super modular Fame the CEO of a brand new company which is something that he debuted at shelling point at Defcon super modular is Kevin owaki's centralized software company that is built on top of the decentralized get coin protocol the protocol that he founded and I think this is a theme that we're going to see moving forward it's not the first time we've seen this uniswap for example and Hayden Adams Hayden makes uniswap then the next thing he does is he makes uniswap Labs a centralized software company built on top of the unit swap protocol Now Kevin owaki is doing that with super modular and overall I asked Kevin of course about that building that and also what role shelling Point has in the global conversation that is ethereum so I hope you enjoy this fantastic conversation with Kevin Milwaukee as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible truefy is leading defy into the future of on-chain uncollateralized loans opening up D5 to the 8 trillion dollar Global Credit Market whether you want higher yields on your lending or you're a fund manager who just wants access to global liquidity and the cost Savings of Defy trufi is here for you but if you're going to use trufi use it through the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet view your nfts and keep up to date with your web 3 communities another thing you can use through Brave is of course arbitrum and you all of course have heard about arbitrum but the arbitrim ecosystem is really heating up with a recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrim has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with a recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrum Nitro shipped to last month and has made garbage from faster and cheaper than ever before so make sure that you can experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking fuel Network free from evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security also pushing the frontier of web3 development is the sequence wallet from Horizon sequence is the all-in-one developer platform you need to build web 3 games and applications for users sequence is a smart wallet perhaps the most intuitive wallet in all of web 3 but for developers it's a plug and play platform for all web 3 apps and games check out sequence which is already powering some of the best web3 games out there and lastly diesel is a decentralized social platform built from the ground up to disrupt the social media industry disrupting social media takes a lot of data and dieso's infinite State applications can finally store an index large amounts of content and data fully on chain with multiple crypto native monetization mechanisms for both developers and creators diesel wants to usher in a new relationship with our social applications check them out at diesel.com and now on to the show what's up Kevin how's it going hey Jim how's it going oh yeah just hanging out at Charlie Point once again uh this Australia Point has turned into a beast it's going real big yeah it's a bigger showing point now why the name selling point so shelling point is a game theoretic place where people gather without having to coordinate or to communicate about it it's like a campfire is a is a selling point that at night when we all go camping together we all just go around the campfire without having to communicate around it and shelling point the conference is a shelling point for the regen web 3 movement people are using web free to build a bedroom world and it's gotten so much just like energy really really quickly I was talking to Simona a little bit about this earlier like why do you think Charlene Point has grown so fast so quickly like what what it means she's been serving yeah well I mean I think uh it's Simona's baby and I mean I think you couldn't have planned the SP or some of his initials and shelling point is sp also so there's something in fate here with uh Simona gets all the credit uh if if uh if things are going well but I think that what you're really seeing here is that nascent need to have more purpose in the protocols that we're building in web 3. how do as much as it were so well how do we create recall to be human thriving using the three protocols and the internet of money and so I'm here to support public goods to support local communities and create more human thriving using web3 and I think that you're seeing there's a lot of latent demand for people who want to use web3 to make a better world for everyday humans and that's why Sean Quinn is growing so for the listeners that weren't able to make it what kind of vibe is showing Point here like what are the themes of content what's kind of the purpose what's the overall the real world just a selling point to the listeners that can't make it yeah well I mean I think the uh the vibe is definitely kind of like earthy and greens uh I think that there might actually be some great behind us in the video and I think the what you're seeing is people who are building protocols for impact uh whether whether that's you know Bitcoin and quadratic funding or civil resistance or uh impact certificates it's just kind of a diversity of protocols that are being built around the wheat regen web 3 movement and this is our place for it's a selling point for us to come together and to discover each other and to hopefully collaborate on each other's work and what I would like to see is that the next Market cycle all of these impact entrepreneurs are some of the top growing protocols in the next Market cycle and what would have to be true to rotate capital and talent from the the projects that just have the best policy Dominics into the projects that have the most impact on the world how can we can kind of like align capital and talent to go into those things and that's what we're working on here so at bank this of course you like this Frontier metaphor and I think what you just stated is what traveling point is really on the frontier of is rewiring these posynomic games that have you know from you know more or less plagued or whatever you want to call it played crypto throughout history and now we are trying to re-architect it into being Republicans [Music] how would you describe it if you had your own words I mean I think the you know we can program our values into our money with programmable money and you're gonna see anything from like Ponzi schemes to things that regenerate the world built out of the web 3 movement I mean I think that you know there's a certain number of like growth hacks that have been pioneered in defy that region web 3 will probably leverage and there's uh certain ones like the unethical ones or the fragile ones that I think that they won't and and you know the real the real the real opportunity I think you know since use the frontier metaphor is like I think the web 3 has done a really great job of capturing the minds of of money people people who want to get better yield on their assets um but 99 of humanity their financial lives is not their bank accounts or their Investments it's their jobs and it's their communities and so if we want web3 to be able to enter those communities we've got to have uh we've got to have anti-fragile things that are good for our local communities in order for web 3 to enter those those faces and this is 95 99 of the world and and that's the frontier that I think Sean's going to reach at rep 3 is is pointing towards so I can't wait for the next Market cycle and to see the ecosystem of retail Lab 3 really start to grow I think that's like the third trailing Point that's ever occurred and by far the biggest and it's always super refreshing especially in the middle of the bear Market where like activities just kind of down yeah the shelling point region world of crypto is actually at its all-time high in energy yeah and it's just something that's so like refreshing to see that like the energy here is is not reflective of the depression that you see on crypto Twitter for example uh what's your take on that like what what do you think when you see all these people here yeah well I mean you and I are second cyclers right we kind of know that there's going to be really high highs and like really low lows and you start to ride those out and hopefully have a little bit of fun um and and I think that you know one of the really great things we've seen you know uh as you know I run a podcast it's called the green pill podcast on the bank list Network and you know I was looking at the analytics I think it was with Brian or someone on your team like number go up on like podcast downloads for Greenville actually you should subscribe to the original podcast party but basically number go up and I think it's the reason is that even in the depths of the bear Market people are intrinsically motivated to make their communities better and to make the lives of their friends and family better and I think that um it's it's that that provides a higher floor than a lot of other markets that uh just just sort of like that intrinsic motivation to work on region about three yeah this is kind of how I think about crypto at large is that the crypto you know machinations of the the bubbles right that goes up it goes down because that base goes down it always hits a new floor right there's always a new higher floor and that is true both on prices that's both on on user retention on user activity and it's that floor that I think is supported by the regen public good side of things and that is the floor and that's why I think the Greenville podcast hasn't seen a drop in viewership it's only gone up well actually if you go listen to the bank list it'll look at the bank that's views it tracks crypto prices right it went out with crypto president down with crypto prices but we have things like green pill and like also just the reason why people are here and why crypto never actually ends up getting smaller every single cycle just because the sticky people are here because of the region reasons not the fondling business so yeah well you know one of the things I'm most proud of I mean I think most of your listeners may know me from launching Bitcoin in advance which is one of the top crowdfunding Platforms in the ecosystem I'm really proud that get coin grants is running several million dollar rounds even through the market and and I kind of think of a quadratic funding as this way of allocating Capital when all the other when the VC Capital dries up when you know other people are deploying you hopefully we can build uh get coin grants into this ecosystem that's always kind of uh funding even through the bear markets and you know I meet people from the 2018 and 2019 cycle they say that they just lived off of their Bitcoin grants donations which I think is awesome and you know the fact that with Bitcoin grants was some of the first capital into projects like urine and uniswap and one inch Exchange in the last cycle just makes me wonder what projects were funding this cycle they were going to be the breakouts of the next cycle so it really does make sense to stay through the bear markets and to continue allocating capital and attention to projects because then you're there for for when things turn around and and uh it's just really exciting the energy here is selling point and in the web three ecosystem and I can't wait to see what it culminates in yeah and of course for those years that don't know uh is a great coin alumni and so we can definitely attest to the usefulness of Bitcoin as a funding mechanisms to make it through the bear Market Uh Kevin you recently announced something here at shelling Point can you talk to the listeners who missed the announcement about what you announced yeah so um I I've uh disaffiliated from leadership in Bitcoin and I I believe in Bitcoin in many ways it's my life's work but I felt like because I was the CEO and founder and kind of the outside's personality and the Dao that it made sense to distance myself a little bit from leadership and you know the dowel needs to be governed by the community that it serves that's the that's the loop is the consent of the governed um in these web three communities that we want to maintain that's the legitimacy of the governments and so I've disaffiliated from Bitcoin Dao and I I am now uh the founder and CEO of a a project called super modular.xyz and you can go to the website at supermodular.xyc XYZ and see that we are Adventure studio built on top of bitcoin's protocols so basically like as early consensus was to the ethereum ecosystem building things that ethereum newly enabled for the world super modular.xyz is building things that only get coins protocols in the Civil resistance and quadratic funding they enable uh allow so we're going to be we're going to be I think that we've got some interesting projects coming up and I'll be announcing those hopefully at shelling point in Denver in 2023. so you're building and in the app layer around the get coin protocol that's right yeah also can we just celebrate that there actually is a Bitcoin protocol now I lost it as a centralized platform in a monolith back in 2017 it did a lot of good for people but um but we're kind of naming the new company super modular to repent for our sins and building a centralized monolith modular in the center Protocols are in the future and I've seen the light and it's been a long painful transition but Bitcoin passport is out uh Bitcoin grants Hub and the round manager Protocols are all out in Alpha and I'm hopeful that the next Bitcoin grants run will be on the decentralized protocol so there's actually a protocol to build upon now and I feel like man I I get quite seeing a lot of things but becoming a decentralized modular protocol I think is is uh is a huge reinvention for it and I'm here for it and Karen I hope this is a microcosm for many many top forms moving forward and we've seen this at unit swap too right where uh Hayden Adams and the uniswap team built uniswap and now they're building uniswap Labs as like a software company on top of the protocol and so I think this is a path that many pioneers are carving where their first first they build the protocol and then they like retire into their own app layer that they've established and by retire I mean just another start uh but now in the app player uh and so I I think this is going to be a pattern that many many times follow yeah yeah I mean I think it's really fun like I think the you know I'm I've been in crypto for multiple phases full time and I was even in it part-time before that as a hobbyist dance some of the most interesting projects I think are going to come from entrepreneurs that have been through multiple cycles and have multiple phases to their career it's a super modular is the next phase of of my career and I'm just so lucky that it's built on the fast phase which was which was git coin um and and and and also just all of the things around Bitcoin that have grown up about I just give a shout out to like giveth in CLR fund and proof of humanity thinks they build that are built adjacent to get coin and because they're modular we super modular can build on top of those as well and the sum is greater than the whole of its parts so it's a really great ecosystem for multi-stage entrepreneurs because you just you just get there's just so much to explore and so much to build well Kevin the number of people here is an attest to some much Legacy that you've built with Bitcoin and I'm looking forward to seeing what you're building with uh super modular are you excited to be a builder again or have another startup or like what's what's your emotions about this I think it's pronounced Builder first off um yeah exactly yeah well no I uh so the first thing I'll say is like thank you for the nice things you said about shelling play and get coin but I really really have to emphasize that there are hundreds of people that uh worked on bitcoin dial in the last Marcus cycle and on shelling point and and it's all credit to them and as the founder I will always get more credit than is due and we'll get more blame than is do and so I I think that it's really important that people see that get coin is this ecosystem of people in in not just me but but yes I am excited to be the Builder again and I'm really excited to kind of controller although I transgressive but yeah the cool thing is that because everything is modular now um like I I can kind of build on top of Bitcoin as as being on top of it and it's just it's just fun to be advancing and trying pushing New Frontiers but still be leveraging stuff we built before fiddle it before Kevin thank you so much for your time cheers cheers [Music]
