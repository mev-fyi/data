are they arresting developers now david uh the answer is yes yeah there's an arrested developer yeah arrested that's crazy that's a big step up and the question on the back of that is is ethereum really censorship resistant arrest of suspected developer of tornado cash uh no longer suspected we do know that this is actually the tornado cash developer and this is f i o d dot n l f i o d is this the netherlands investigation of financial services and final financial crime organization and they arrested a tornado cash developer now uh there's it's one thing to arrest open source developers uh that would be egregious uh we're not totally sure if that's what happened and so there's speculation out there that not only was this uh this person happened to be a tornado cash developer but they were actually perhaps also assisting and like aiding people in laundering money um but we don't actually no because fiod released a statement that basically didn't give us any clarity well my take on this is you know first of all it seems very much like possibly they didn't have another reason for arresting this tornado cache developer rather than publishing the code as david you said we're not certain of that that is kind of the base case assumption and if that's the case a man was arrested for writing code that served as a public good for people to maintain their privacy online that means they put a man in jail because people use his open source code and i don't think david that can stand in any free society on earth as you said we still don't know if there are other reasons that this arrest was made but uh i believe on the 16th fiod provided some sort of statement on this but it wasn't really clear this is jake travinsky saying they refuse to say what charges are alleged if any so we still don't know if they think writing code is a crime does fiod think writing code is a crime two outcomes i see here is that there is an ongoing s investigation that they don't want to show their cards for and this is me like trying to retain my grip of bullishness on humanity as in like there's a really good reason i'm trying here it's like there's this guy like aiden embedded like money laundering of criminals and actually committed crimes versus uh they didn't say anything because they know that like they just arrested this guy for building tornado cash which is the outcome i do not want so it's possible that the first outcome the book still be bullish on humanity outcome is uh is still out there right and so we need to remain open to that possibility but i will say a few other things happen congruent with this which is um they deactivated the tornado cache discord right okay they killed the github repos of all devs and these were centralized companies doing this so you could argue this is kind of a chilling effect but still the chilling effect is in effect isn't it right it's legally a legally defined term as you explained last week on on the tornado cache episode uh and then this is the backdrop where ofac actually banned not individuals but they banned some smart contract code so what what does the weight of evidence point us towards for this arrest it is very possible that they made an arrest of an open source developer who just published some open source code bad guys used it and that's why they want to send him to prison and if so that is a big big problem i think not for we'll get to these stakes later not necessarily for ethereum not necessarily for crypto though it is a problem for for the technology more problem for the uh the countries and the citizens that live in those countries who are restricting their first amendment freedoms first amendment of course is a i guess that's a u.s only term but like freedom of speech freedom to write and publish code um some of these things are are very important in any free democratic society and these are the things that are in threat of being breached right now and without evidence that these uh fiod arrested this developer because they actually committed explicit and real crimes then i think as a community we have to assume that the man is innocent and didn't do anything until they tell us then in my mind this guy just got arrested for writing code so what are the legal experts telling us at coin center this is a crypto lobby group that uh investigates this and yeah as lawyers on staff what are they saying david yeah so coin center released a very thorough and detailed statement analysis legal analysis of the ofac ruling of tornado cache being on the sdn list they write if the tornado cash application is not property in which some foreign country or national has an interest then the tornado cash application cannot properly be added to the sdn list or blocked under the specific powers granted by congress to the president in the iepa um i.e epa is what gives ofac power something should be someone should be able to challenge the designation as being made outside the bounds of the statue and therefore invalid basically saying oh coin center saying like someone should be able to challenge this there's like strong legal grounds for somebody challenging this and uh coin center basically lays out the two big claims as to why somebody could challenge this so claim one ofac's designation of certain autonomous contract addresses denies americans their liberty and property without proper procedural due process uh yes cover this and claim two an overbroad interpretation of the iepa substantially chills first amendment protected speech so those are the the main core claims that coin center believes that there are legal precedents there's legal ground for someone to take ofaac to court and coin censor is not the only uh organization focused on freedom to release a statement like this the eff the electronic frontier foundation which is an organization just dedicated to uh promoting the protecting the frontier basically uh and they put out a tweet that says the eff is deeply concerned that the u.s treasury department has conclude included an open source computer project tornado cache on its list of sanctioned individuals tornado cache is an open source software project and website that published a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer and then they go on in their tweet thread and also release an article uh backing this and so now we have our our lobby groups our our protection our like our our frontier protecting agencies uh putting up a flag and say yo ofac uh no back off yeah and i i so important to note that ofac didn't arrest this developer it was the the group in the in the netherlands of course but it's all like it's all part of the same thing isn't it this global kind of financial apparatus trying to enforce these quote unquote financial crimes and is privacy one of those financial crimes this is a great tweet from alex david what are we looking at just if you want to get the scope of other notable money laundering scandals in perspective and let it be known of course tornado cash was used by some bad guys for money laundering i think you pegged the percentage at like 35 according to you to analyst so at least 35 of the funds inside of tornado cash was like north korea and some other like bad actors money launderers but that wasn't the only use case and let's compare it to other money laundering scandals in history what are we looking at here david yeah so we're looking at a graphic of just the previous biggest money laundering scandal so coming in and number one at 390 billion we have the 2010 wachovia wells fargo case uh where which was allowed to allow drug cartels from mexico to launder almost 400 billion dollars during 2004 to 2007. damn coming in at number one coming at number two 265 billion standard chartered british british banking giant 2012 accused by new york department of financial services says of its failure to uh control money laundering then helps the iranian government to circumvent u.s regulations to clear money to the tune of 265 billion damn dunks bank money laundering scandal arose in 2017 to 2018 when it was uh became known that 200 million uh 200 billion euros of suspicious suspicious transactions flowed from estonian russian and latvian sources through the estonian bank branch of denmark bank donk's bank from 2007 to 2015. 228 billion damn and so i'm gonna go back through those again 390 billion from wells fargo what happened was a 160 million dollar fine no arrests uh the standard chartered the number two 265 billion the bank paid a 842 million dollar fine and disciplined 10 employees i wonder what that means um coming in at 228 billion the dance bank uh result 10 employees were arrested so 10 people went to jail okay all right uh no no fine uh maybe not to jail just initially arrested arrested yeah we don't know what the outcomes were coming in at number four eight billion uh hsbc uh uh the result was this a 300 million dollar fine no arrests uh coming in at number five 11 billion westpac bank uh bank paid a 1.3 billion dollar fine no arrest tornado cash coming in at number six uh tornado cash costs markets at its highest point it held 500 to 900 million dollars but while authorities link some of these addresses to north korean hacker groups it's unclear how much of that total was used for illegal purposes ryan earlier you said uh 35 uh was in tornado cash that was in tornado cache at the moment of it getting added to the ofac list and that's after the nomad bridge hike uh heist all of these other recent uh heists when i was using tornado cash as for my own personal use cases like uh in 2021 it was represented pre-sanctioned importantly pre-sanctioned it was really before all of the bridge uh heists that we've seen and so like i bet you back in 2021 it was way below 35 percent i bet you're something and the scope of this we're talking like look 100 million to 300 million dollars all right look at these things insane uh 300 bill 390 billion our friends wells fargo in 2010 did this standard charter 265 billion billion with a b versus like 100 to 300 million dollars right and these are banks these are banks doing this so what david should should we shut down the banks like just shut down banks i'm sorry no bank has ever given me any privacy services like what what have they done for me tornado cash gave me privacy services these banks didn't do for me ryan if the rationale is that smart contract code can be used by money launderers we also know that banks can be used and are used by money launderers and by the way these are just the ones we've caught okay so in that rationale we're trying to sanction the smart contract code should we also sanction all banks right like this is not the way to handle the situation it it appears very egregious to me but david maybe we should talk about the the conversation on twitter and that is part two of our story here because there are a lot of implications uh there's some backlash too but there are a lot of implications of getting smart contract code on the ofac list the golden end game of the zk evm has been the vision of zkc since the beginning and during each cc week they launched their 100 days to mainnet plan which is now already down to 93 days so if you're gonna join the zk evm wars make sure you post about it on lens the first decentralized social networking graph in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto but on lens we say not your keys not your content own your own social media handle choose your own algorithm and mint your profile using the secret code word in the show notes and something that's likely going to be talked about on lens is of course the ethereum merge and the merge is why you should be staking your east with rocket pool it's a decentralized ethereum validator network where you deposit each and get your reth in return and then you can take that r eth into d5 and if you run a node you can let other people deposit their ether into your node and you earn 15 of their staking commission as payment for your node operating services and then maybe you want to take your reth over to arbitrary for all of your defry things harbor trump is where you have to be with over 35 000 contracts deployed and one million unique addresses arbitrage is leading the way into the age of rollups but in order to get your money over to arbitrarily so you can buy your re natively then you should use juno because juno is the fastest bridge from your checking account to an ethereum layer 2. a checking account to an ethereum layer 2 is absolutely crazy and it just takes minutes juno is your crypto checking account for the crypto era but when you're doing all of these things make sure that it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web3 wallet and it puts the user first the web three way there are a lot of implications uh there's some backlash too but there are a lot of implications of getting smart contract code on the ofact list what is the first implication here and what are we looking at yeah this is going back to the chilling effect that has been created as a result of this ofac sdn list of tornado cache so uh michael zoltool he put out a tweet saying adding to the shame list openc dydx and microsoft because microsoft owns github and he says all these companies have gone beyond what the sanctioned laws required they didn't just obey an unjust order they went out of their way to do additional injustice and so there's been this meme created about these the over comply or uh and so like ah i'm over complying did you see the ofac editions today uh modify's no to tensor transactions seven hops from tornado cache fire an aml report there's all these people in the ecosystem that are just like doing these things that was not requested of them not related to the ofac sdn list and is censoring and prohibiting freedoms and users from doing the things that they want well it's true everyone on ethereum with an ether dress is probably two or three hops maybe four hops away we know that we noticed that was an analysis like the 90 of ethereum addresses are two hops away from a tornado cash user 90 and i mean that's probably because of like uh the aggregation of centralized exchanges but whatever sure uh so some of the people doing this ave had a front end block so anthony cesano one of the recipients of uh a two eat from the tornado cache like dusting that happened he got blocked from the ave front end ave has recently has since then pulled back all of this front-end blocking but they it was a third party that they use for the blocking right and they said we got to get more control over the third party and it's just the ui not the specific contrast but still even just the ui i get it right uh dui dx blocking tornado cache user so if you've used tornado cache you get blocked from doi dx and these are things that like are they are not required of them uh and so this triggered a conversation on twitter it's like yo like is aetherium like going to just bend over backwards and become like the censorship chain uh and this triggered a huge conversation inside of the ethereum community well there was a back and forth that that i had over the weekend with uh antonio and i i want to make kind of like because it's important not to get overly like purist about this as well right uh and so i i tweeted out this is around the time of where i was starting to see ui blockages from the osac it's time for d5 to grow some backbone and fight back instead of just blocking youth addresses unelected bureaucrats blacklisting citizens without cause or due process is unconstitutional illegal and incompatible with the free society it does if it doesn't stop here it just gets worse and then antonio who is the uh founder of dydx he was like what am i supposed to do ryan like are you saying you want me to go to jail and if if you're saying that then why don't you spin up a front end of tornado cash like why don't you put some stake in the game and to be clear that that's really not what i'm saying right it's like i replied to him no it's not time to go to jail let's be smart but also on the other hand it's not time for defy david to sit down and die and i really feel like this week has been a wake-up call for defy we have to catch our breath we have to organize we have to develop some strategy around this deploy some resources and execute i'm not saying now is the time to go to jail for like an organization like dydx but we have to find strategic legal ways to push back on this uh to to protest and to move uh crypto and d5 forward and i think this has been a wake-up call for that but it's actually gotten even worse um there it has been a conversation of like this fork of geth which is uh facetiously being called ofac geth which is a version of guest that does not propagate transactions or validate blocks with sanctioned transactions this is stefan from uh flashbots who is actually going to come out on the podcast on monday um but he's being facetious about this i'm not saying he's actually like creating ofac geth but the conversation that it's a to bring bring up the conversation is that like there's this world where like we have these ethereum clients that download a list of ethereal sanction ethereum addresses and just like don't include transactions from those ethereum addresses it's in the base layer software this is a base layer software which creates protocol level censorship which uh in my mind is bad uh but the point is it triggered this conversation which is really really it was a great conversation that the community had on crypto twitter uh and then so we the next part of this conversation i think was really uh triggered by lufteris and he uh left harris uh can't pronounce his last name sorry he goes question for lydo coinbase kraken staked u.s and bitcoin swedes these are all the biggest ethereum stakers and he asked them if a regulator asks you to censor at the ethereum protocol level with your validators what would you do would you a comply and censor at the protocol level or b shut down the staking service in order to preserve network integrity and he's retweeting a tweet that talks about just like if you add all these stakers together you get something like 80 or 90 of all steak uh and so this this conversation really triggered just uh the conversation that flowed and so eric wall uh a man with very sharp edges who's also very pregnant says question for the ethereum community if a majority of stake chooses a in this poll uh and this is the the poll that lufteris put would you one x consider the censorship an attack on ethereum and burn their stake via social consensus and we'll define what social consensus is or why tolerate the censorship and then and then he scrolls down and and actually puts a poll and so the poll is you know x or y x burn the stake y except the censorship and coming in at 61 we have the the people chose x nine percent of people chose y so a very stark difference and then thirty percent of people's uh picked uh show show results and so really this is uh uh this is not really something that you can put into the protocol level that the ethereum community will say we will uh burn your stake if you censor this is something that we need to communicate to each other as a communities like these are our values and we're going to make these values explicit well can can you just walk through that for people because i i'm not sure everyone understands the mechanism of how social like how the like uh a social fork could essentially burn people's stake and and create a fork that is nonsense like uncensored while this censored fork happens could you just walk through a scenario here so let's say those stakers in left risk's tweet uh become evil we call it evil coinbase kraken all of them you know and they decide some of them yeah and maybe it's not evil they just they just say we have to comply with ofact and so we are now going to only validate blocks from uh every other block that is not on an ofac sanction list so essentially they create an ofac sanctionable uh ethereum base layer and because there's so much stake there uh essentially a lot of blocks are not getting they they kind of control it so what happens in the scenario what is eric wall actually teeing up what does the ethereum social layer layer zero do about this right so the scenario here is that if all of those listed entities coinbase lido kraken all the big stakers all followed ofac sanctions list and didn't propagate any blocks that included transactions that came from an o fax ancient list basically if you are an ofac sanctioned list address your block you only get like one like five out of a hundred blocks that will be validated by a staker who's not following the ofx sanctions list so like 5 out of 100 blocks of your transactions only go through so making ethereum just really hard to use and the ethereum community through this poll where like 61 to 9 say that we will not tolerate that and we will send we will uh burn their stake via social consensus what does that mean in ethereum we have this concept called slashing and slashing is this very objective event of you're a proof-of-stake validator with a stake bond and you try to process an invalid block you lie to the blockchain uh you you did some irregular thing and that is completely objective uh objective you publish two blocks and they're conflicting trying to fork the chain basically doing something invalid and you're trying to attack the chain that's what we do with slashing that is objective and built into the protocol and it's going to happen automatically then there's this thing called social slashing which is something is going on with us with a validator maybe it's coinbase maybe it's lido they're censoring an address maybe they're censoring every single transaction and so like imagine like nine like all of these people all these 90 percent of stakers elido coinbase kraken like the the government comes and says hey we want you to shut down ethereum and since you're producing 90 blocks we want your blocks to be completely empty and they then if they had a gun to their head they would probably choose to not die and only publish empty blocks and that would be censoring 90 of blocks that would go through ethereum making the blockchain really really just troublesome and useless and so in the event that this happens you can't actually slash that person at the protocol level because it's more subjective as to what is going on as in coinbase is not processing transactions that interact with uniswap like they're still processing blocks and the blocks are valid they're just choosing to not include transactions that interact with unit swap or interact with tornado cache or do something and so how do we as a community get back our ability to use these defy apps there's this thing called social slashing or a user activated soft fork and so what this means is that because we have this like unique property in ethereum that coinbase crack and lido these blocks are being proposed by specific ethereum addresses so we know these specific ethereum addresses are censoring transactions and these specific ethereum addresses have some amount of ether staked with them and so what we can do is we can fork the chain and we can do something that punishes them we can either freeze their steak the most nuclear option is you can just delete their entire stake that would be pretty pretty damn nuclear we probably wouldn't do that on the first iteration the thing that we probably do first is we would do what is called an inactivity leak we would prevent them from being able to validate the chain and they would be forced to withdraw their ether state from the network and during that time they are no longer able to process blocks and then like you could also slash them some arbitrary amount we would have to decide this as a community but i think the the first step would be like hey we're just gonna kick you out of the validator pool we're not gonna we're not gonna delete your ether we're going to inactivity leak you which means you are losing as much ether as you otherwise would be gaining if you were staking so forcing you to exit and kicking you out of the validator pool and only allowing validators who have not been censoring and this is this is a social slashing event this is a user activated soft fork this is something that the community would have to coordinate around saying hey ofac made coinbase and lido and uh kraken they made them by the powers of the nation-state the monopoly on violence they made them censor transactions and we do not accept that in the base layer and so we are going to coordinate around a fork and when that fork does is that kicks these validators out of the validating pool and they must withdraw their eath or else it's just like in limbo if they don't and so this is what's called a user activated soft fork and it's something that can only be done by social consensus of the ethereum community which is why this pull from eric wall is so important because it's showing that a 61 to 9 ratio of ethereum community members says that we will do this if if our entities uh censor transactions now this is a twitter poll of course right it's like it's not necessarily um reflective of every everyone of course but like what david's describing is basically the game scenario here so a bunch of stakers centralized stakers decide that they are going to censor ethereum via ofac okay the community says we're not running that software we're continuing to run the original non-ofac version of geth will fork you this is the true ethereum and then uh they're trying to run an ofac version or a censored version of ethereum and like it's forked so you have eth on both chains you have every defy app that needs to select which one to uh to spend their resources on the community has to decide a set of validators which which one to essentially run which software to run and it's a four core and may the best fork win and i think david in every single case what will happen is as long as we have a social layer around ethereum that says look censorship resistance is baked into the base layer of the ethereum project this is the true ethereum that the non-sensorable version of ethereum will win in the end and the reason it will win we know this from a game theory perspective is why would china go deploy and trust the ofac version of ethereum that's completely u.s controlled they're not going to so they state will continue to collect to the non-sensible version of ethereum and the community will eventually win like this is what i mean as long as you have a layer 0 a social layer that is upholding these values and willing to run the original version of like ethereum that is non-censored we win and this is what would happen it would be a messy outcome the cool the cool news i think is if you're an eatholder you just get eth on the ofac version of the chain right you could sell that if you want to dump that because it doesn't align with your values dump that it doesn't align your values if you want to or you could keep it you could do whatever you want and then you could um you could run validators on the the real ethereum chain that is uncensored that's that's where you'll find me you're gonna find me on the the non-censored ethereum chain i think a large portion of the community you'll find them there too by the way this same mechanism plays out in bitcoin does it not right yes and this is a great history lesson so we can move forward and one of the reasons why i focus on this yeah this conversation on teenager cache happened on crypto twitter it's really important that this conversation happened because a lot of new people came into ethereum in the last like 12 18 24 months that are still learning concepts like this and so we have to have these conversations out in the public where the ethereum community defines like hey like these are our values like no censorship at the base layer uh and so this conversation continues eric connor retweeted eric wall and says i do agree with eric we should make it known as a community that we stakers will burn the stake of any entity burn at the stake any entity that tries to censure transactions no matter the reason these are the values that we're indoctrinating we're instantiating into our layer one now going back to what you just said about the this this the user activated software has been a mechanism that the crypto world has seen before that we've done this once before so eric wall put out this fantastic twitter thread which i'm going to read here and he goes as the ethereum community gears up to prepare for its user activated software defenses to force any validator to think thrice before bending over to ofac there's going to be a lot of snark from bitcoiners and so we'll talk about the bitcoiner uh relevancy here it's envy user activated soft forking is the single most exciting thing that you can do in crypto bitcoiners had their user activated soft fork moment in 2017 and it is their proudest moment i am a bitcoiner and it is my proudest bitcoin moment the idea that ethereum would even be even close to achieving something similar is the most annoying thing that could ever happen they'll never let you have it the entire bitcoin rhetoric relies on the reason that they were able to pull off their user activated softwork is because users ran full notes this is the basis for the entire design philosophy it is it is true that the ability to run a full node is useful in a user-activated soft fork but annoyingly ethereum can still pull it off annoyingly to to bitcoiners first off ethereum users can run nodes despite what bitcoiners will tell you even if the default is to sync using state commitments that doesn't mean you can't enforce a user activated software you of course can secondly the outcome of a user activated software is much more of a market phenomenon anyways you still win a user activated software just by demonstrating superior pricing power so meaning that if if you're not a person who doesn't know how to run a node or doesn't want to you can still dump all of your ofac eth and buy all of your censorships this is the true ethereum is the eth class it's the one that has a higher price right and so uh eric wall continues and goes all of these things should be narrative violations for bitcoiners ethereans should not be able to user activated soft fork is a core bitcoin thesis and i'll say this bitcoiners are better at user activating software than ethereums they are but they weren't born without ability they were taught that they had this power but what what is that word ryan i shall no idea i don't know ethereans can be taught the same basically saying that bitcoiners don't have a monopoly on the concept of a user-activated soft fork what most people don't know is that if ethereum's master user activated software under proof of stake they gain access to a weapon that is more powerful than the user-activated soft fork of bitcoiners this is because a user-activated software in proof-of-state can selectively punish censoring validators i talked about this earlier bitcoin you can't selectively punish a minor in proof of work if a majority of hash rate centering you have to build a build more hash rate than the attacker which is possible it just is hard and takes time the non-censoring miners also in transaction fees that the censoring miners do not i i wanted to mention this earlier if you have like ofac guest and you have 90 blocks that block stakers that are not processing ofac non-compliant transactions the remaining 10 of stakers actually make more money because they do get to process those transactions right so you're actually rationally like incentivized to process the illicit transactions uh if you can't over a power the attacker and proof of work the only option is the nuclear one you change the proof of work function and vaporize the entire billion dollar mining industry in one shot but you also kill the honest miners uh in proof of stake there is currently 25 billion dollars of east securing the chain if 10 billion of that is involved in censoring you can surgically vaporize the bad part and you keep the 15 billion dollars of remaining honest acres on your side and you vaporize it you vaporize it on your fork the non your non-censored fork right so it's like punitive actions like hey you're gonna pay for this guys because your fork's not gonna be successful ours is and on the successful ethereum fork you won't have any of your eath that is like the the stick that uh social fork can yield it's brilliant brilliantly elegant because you reward the honest people and you punish the negative people now ryan like i've always been curious about this like because you and i could take our crypto twitter conversations into this weekly rollup quite a lot and i'm actually cognizant that i think maybe like 25 33 of listeners are actually on crypto twitter and so i i've always been kind of curious like damn like from the perspective of the listeners like damn ryan and david are always concerned about like the bitcoiners and like the bitcoin maxies and like the tribes i want to i want to go to the quote tweets from eric wall's first tweet and so this this is the set of quote tweets people that retweeted eric wall's tweet and you're gonna get two classes of people here uh one is ethereans retweeting the tweet saying i vote x i vote to slash and the other is you have bitcoiners trying to uh brigand brigade brigand the the poll and saying bitcoiners vote why because it makes the ethereum look bad can i just say whenever you're saying bitcoiners i want to make sure that you are talking about like not everyone who owns bitcoin but a specific subset of bitcoiner which is a bitcoin maximalist who wants all other chains to fail and only bitcoin to succeed that's what you're talking about when you're shorthanding bitcoiners when eric cole is doing that as well if you're not on crypto twitter you're not like exposed to these like tribes that are for war and these zero-sum games that are being played we're overexposed and we are overexposed to these people so yeah if you want to like scroll down ryan and uh uh just see some of these conversations because like if uh the quote tweets the list of quotes let's keep scrolling just go through all of them there's so many the list of quote tweets again it's like here's stats sex and snacks uh at it's time for bitcoin imagine what it would feel like to know the integrity of your favorite  coin depends entirely on both stable coin custodians in a status mole rat that lives in a 100 million ala mansion to do the right thing even though it could sink them cry harder i don't know like these bitcoins are insane dude these are insane and so like again like there's two types of quote tweeters here people that are etherean saying i vote x and then people that are bitcoin maxis trying to like manipulate and attack the ethereum community because of exactly what eric wall was saying it's envy he says the user activated software incorporates the most single exciting thing you can do in crypto and bitcoiners don't want ethereums to have this power because right now it's the only thing that the bitcoiners have max maxis maxis yeah i i think that's what's going on what are we looking at here david this is a meme like again the ethereum community's taking this opportunity to meme into existence like this is the prex x to doubt i mean but it's press x to slash so everybody the entire ethereum community is like yo we will absolutely slash anyone who invalidates our balance and look so here's the thing a lot of this is talk conversation on twitter blah blah blah i mean at the end of the day if this ever happened by the way this is such i just want to emphasize this is still incredibly remote there's a conversation on crypto twitter but there is no talk of ofac or like the coinbases of the world or any of the validators running uh you know sanctioned code or running running uh censored a code here and and complying with ofac sanctions and nofak is not even asking about so this is just a remote probability that i feel like uh the crypto space went and ran with this week as a thought exercise but it's a useful thought exercise but it's still incredibly remote and this is uh by the way we have the stick but we also have like the um kind of the carrot i think for people who are decentralized staking providers so brian armstrong actually replied to lefteris's tweet when he asked uh if regulators ask you to censor do you comply and censor or do you shut down your staking service if you're a coinbase brian armstrong the ceo of coinbase says it's a hypothetical important to to note we hopefully won't actually face but if we did i pick option b i would exit we would yes coinbase would stop staking it would not censor transactions it would not run the ofac sanctioned uh validator code it would worth to note that the coinbase staking is extremely profitable they make a ton of money and brian is saying instead of censoring the chain and compromising the integrity of ethereum we will shut down that business just we won't do it and what will happen if they shut down more people will have to kind of run their own nodes obviously so i think we've got a lot of defenses against this level of state the state level of censorship resistance uh and i think more uh defenses in a proof of stake world and it's definitely worth noting that these large entities takers like lydo coinbase etc they're highly incentivized to not censor the chain because they don't want to piss off the community like they they will we'll punish you we have that power and so like the the fact that this conversation is happening and the ethereum community is planting a flag saying hey if you censor our transactions we're going to kick you out we'll fork yeah and so like and we'll burn your steak and so they have to pick b because the community is forcing them to do that they have a fiduciary responsibility to pick b because they could get screwed imagine if they got slashed and they lost all of their depositors money right what are the costs of that so even just the prospect of us being able to do this and this rhetoric on twitter of like you do this and we'll fork and we'll slash right that reigns them in it's about having this user-activated soft fork as a threat yeah without actually using it the fact that it's an option nucleus us from having necessary mutually assured destruction baby exactly exactly yeah don't do it though don't please don't do it this will be fine we don't have to fight yes uh there's some bad takes though on i think on this takes and uh love ryan sulcus previous guest and bankrupt let's respect a lot of his ideas i do not have the best take this week no but i think it's a summation of a lot of people who were saying like bitcoin was looking great and ethereum was looking very censored what was his take here yeah ryan celca says ethereum is amazing but i don't get the sense most in the ethereum have the stomach to full decentral for to push full decentralizing without compromises uh uscc of course and oh fact imparting that and then he follows up bitcoin remains metal af both are important for the decades ahead but let's be honest eth is fintech 3 not web 3. absolutely terrible take ryan come on love you though love you ryan and so i follow up and i say tornado cash is banned in the united states yet tornado cash is up and running ethereum is fulfilling its promise on unstoppable applications metal af like subtweeting ryan selkis here and so like you don't get points if you don't even have privacy at the base layer okay so like people are just obsessed with giving bitcoin so much credit it's like well you didn't see bitcoin get banned you don't get credit for not having any useful applications show up it's on the bench okay like bitcoin is just like this neutered app chain like you all you can only get like coin mixing at the centralized level which has also been banned before bitcoin because besides uh you know transfers bitcoin uses basically it's it's banking layer it's privacy layer doesn't have one it doesn't have a privacy layer but if you did want to use quote-unquote privacy it would be through centralized exchanges which are really ofac compliant yeah you're not in the game guys i love you i love bitcoin it's really important but you're not in the privacy game that's why ofac is not bothering you nation states aren't bothering you is because you don't have a tornado cash on chain that does not make you bitcoin stronger okay that just makes them not participating in the game that ethereum's playing another take here an equally bad take i think this is from uh kevin o'leary another previous bankless guest we love you kevin you've got a lot of great takes this was not one of them this is a hell no kevin o'leary says essentially i'm glad the tornado cash developer was arrested now we get to move on we get to be more regulated i'll read some of the direct quotes i think we're getting to that stage now kevin says maybe we're in the third or fourth inning towards that but i'm tired of this crypto cowboy crap he's talking about privacy here in tornado i want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work i want that too i don't uh i don't need to be a crypto cowboy and i don't want to be one because i work in the regulated world okay understand that but this is the take that really gets me at the end of the day it's okay to arrest that guy oof the tornado cash developer why he's messing with the primal forces of regulation what do you think we're doing here kevin if you have to if we have to sacrifice him that's okay because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital it is not okay to sacrifice an open source developer who is working on the public good i know why i'm here and it's not for that he says we are messing with the primal forces of regulation that's why i'm here right that's what i'm here to do well it's just there's different kind of cohorts and reasons like so we get some you know like we get different tribes crypto tribes certainly warring it out but we also get people who are just here for the money and that's okay but you gotta rest on top of the base principles of why the social layer is here another bad take but the question of all of this is david what can we do about this right all right so what is this jw uh verit person doing who is a um i believe he's a a legal professor yeah and a lawyer what is he doing right writes very eloquently he tweets out i bite ofac in the nose over their vague sanction of tornado cash i applied to ofac for a license in a way that would either obviate the harm that they did or give my non-profit the crypto freedom lab standing to sue them if they deny my license i think he's basically saying i've put ofac in a corner either answer that they that they give me uh opens back up tornado cache and he wrote this very eloquent like concise blog post about the for the choice rule that he's forced ofac into uh and basically saying like either way like i'm taking like either they do they take option a and oh like tornado cash becomes freely accessible to everyone again or option b and then they give me grounds to sue them and i will sue them so we have this individual going after ofac it's great jw uh verit we applaud you um they might just ophak might just take option uh c which is don't reply to these things which they often do yeah but this is which he also stated that he will sue them for as well nice good job jw has all his bases covered we applaud efforts like this also uh coin center is doing some fantastic things so just you know three of what they're doing first of all they're seeking to engage ofac so let's not let's in all of this let's not attribute to malice which may just be incompetence they may not know what a smart contract is they may not know the importance of privacy let's make some uh space for that president coincider is going to help ofac with some of these things maybe second there are some innocent americans who have funds deposited in tornado cash and they don't know whether they can take the funds out or not my guess is probably not none of this is legal advice don't know but coin center is helping those citizens and then finally they said they are going they're beginning to explore with council a court challenge to this action stay tuned all right so that's what our crypto lobbyist friends are doing we applaud coin center for doing that i think david there are a few long-term things we could work on all right the very first politician who comes out with a recognition and a need that we all have for a digital bill of rights i am supportful of that platform because david we need a digital bill of rights that protects our privacy that protects our cryptography that gives us the right to own our own private keys that gives us the right to run our own software that recognizes that code is speech for all citizens some of these rights are implied in the constitution with freedom of speech i think it's now time as we transition to the digital era to make this more explicit i would support laws on the books towards this that needs to happen but it's going to be a slow process the other thing we can do of course is start to form form prototypical crypto nation states network states as bilaji calls them so imagine a crypto native country this is a decades-long project it'll take years to get to this but imagine if we set up such a constitution for digital freedom where we enshrined property rights and ethereum and other smart uh contract chains we made sort of you code is law for from financial perspective we backed our currency by ethan bitcoin we had a citizen level ids that are maybe verified credentials or sold-bound nfts we use defi as our banking system we use dows for capital formation and that idea from belgium burned in my head of like let's start to work on this project we can eventually get u.n recognition maybe years down the road even if we fail this could be a prototype that other countries look at and they're like huh you guys had some good ideas here like maybe we should incorporate some of that because it's been successful so that's another thing we can do and then lastly david what is git coin up to and how can we help uh actually donate as individuals well there's plenty of privacy forward and also open source software freedom projects on git coin and so bitcoin is like four grant rounds a year i believe the next one coming up on september 6th uh seventh there is a three million dollar matching fund as in there's three million dollars out there to be matched for other donations uh so ryan you put out this uh bundle uh or this request for bundling of the top three to ten projects fighting for free speech and privacy and give them money because you know what moves the needle the most money yeah and so uh there's go in the git coin there's going to be uh this privacy bundle which you can just like donate to in net uh and like all of your money will be matched by this three million dollar matching fund uh coin center i'm sure will be in there um there are other efforts as well uh but money money moves needles save your money for september 7th we're going to kick this off we're going to promote it on uh bankless and uh yeah we're going to we're going to fund where our values are in the future wow that was a lot but i think that was it was a lot but it was very significant it was by far the most significant thing that i totally agree hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto
