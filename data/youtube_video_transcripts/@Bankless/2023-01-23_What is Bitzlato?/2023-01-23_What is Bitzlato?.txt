so rumors got circulated that the doj was going after an exchange that started with the letter B I don't know how that letter B rumor got out there but it definitely did all right so what was it what did it end up being crypto exchange bit Lazo the founder was arrested do you even know what this exchange is dude that was the Big B so this showed up in the chart so this is what caused ether to go from sixteen hundred dollars down to like 1490 and then this news came out and it just like pumped right back up to like 1550. the bitslotto news does it change anything I mean what even is it this isn't even a thing so nothing's changing I think what we might see is more of the trend if more agencies coming out with kind of these theatrical performances of who they're going to kind of go after next
