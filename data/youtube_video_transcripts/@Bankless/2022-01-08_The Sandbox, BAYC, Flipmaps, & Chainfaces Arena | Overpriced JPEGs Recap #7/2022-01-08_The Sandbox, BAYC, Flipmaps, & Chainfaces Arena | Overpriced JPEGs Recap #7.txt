[Music] hello everyone good morning it is 2022 and we are back with another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley thank you all so much for being here with me for another year we launched late last year and i think 2022 therefore is going to be the best year overpriced jpegs yet i can't wait for everything that we have in store on that note i wanted to say a couple things about where i want to go with this show for this year and i've really tried to think i don't know i guess i'd call it thematically about what i want to explore on this show for call it 2022 maybe it'll be for q1 of 2022 and we'll mix it up in a couple of months but this phrase has continued to sort of bounce around my head and it's nfts beyond pfps and really what that means for me is i feel like there are these verticals within the nft space that are really promising and really interesting and i want to go deeper and wider on those verticals in the interviews we do and in the areas of study that i sort of undertake so some of you may have heard me mention these before but i i really think we're looking at art and generative art and digital art and the way that the traditionally only physical art world is starting to get disrupted by the digital art world thanks to blockchain technology and nfts i think that's really interesting so like how do we understand the art market in the web 2 world to maybe give us more context into what's happening or what we should be looking for in the web 3 world gaming obviously this is a huge huge huge one that personally i do not understand well enough i do not understand the gaming industry and infrastructure and just world in general the consumer tastes well enough to really understand it properly in web 3 so that's something i want to dive more into intellectual property at the end of the day every project including pfps and by the way pfps overlap with all these other things they overlap with art they overlap with gaming so it's not to be dismissive of pfps when i say nfts beyond pfps but intellectual property every project at this point claims that what they're building is intellectual property but what does that mean right really and how do you monetize intellectual property traditionally speaking how is that maybe changing in the world of nfts so intellectual property is something i'm going to focus a lot on for the next month um i'm talking to a couple of honestly i guess you could call them like ip experts and i will definitely air a couple of those conversations or at least one of those conversations if i think it's interesting and worth everybody hearing but i think starting to understand some of these industries will be really helpful in terms of then evaluating specific projects and evaluating what's happening in the space of course i will continue to interview founders for big projects and founders of teams and all of that is is stuff i love so we'll keep doing that but i also want to go a little wide and a little deep on some of these general industry areas so that's some of what we have in store for this year i hope that's interesting to all of you and of course we'll continue to do these weekly recaps i do have some special recap announcements but i may wait and make it sort of next week in terms of recurring guests where we're going to start having as part of these recap episodes and uh i'm super excited about that but we'll wait i think i'm not going to announce that right just yet okay so speaking of recap episodes this is today's or this is this week's recap i suppose you could say but because i really haven't been on the mic solo like this in a in a while since like i think before christmas uh there's a lot to catch up on so want to dive in i want to give you some heads up of what's coming down the pike around sandbox want to talk about what's been happening with the apes because it feels like there's always something happening with apes of course we're going to talk about some interesting projects i want to highlight flip maps if you haven't heard about them you should definitely they should definitely be on your radar because i think they're a really interesting case study that touches a number of themes that are super relevant and interesting here in nft blockchain world uh i want to talk about chain faces arena if you haven't heard about that project also want to put that on your radar and i'm going to close with something a little philosophical and something sort of a a thought experiment if you will and i'll be curious to see who agrees what the thoughts are please tweet at me and let's let's get a little bit of a philosophical conversation going polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maidan nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto dot x or dot nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log in to web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com okay starting with the sandbox so i'm sure everyone knows what the sandbox is one of the decentralized metaverses essentially that is very prominent decentraland the sandbox cryptovoxels those are your big three i interviewed marcus who the recurring joke on this show as i don't know how to pronounce his last name so i never say it who's like the cmo of the sandbox so if you're looking to learn more about the sandbox what it is go check out that interview that episode with him the sandbox has announced that there will be another land sale on january 13th so by the time this is airing it'll be thursday of the the upcoming week this is a big deal because sandbox land is hot hot hot there is a finite amount of sandbox land that will ever be sold so it is a scarce resource and uh 70 i believe it is of sandbox land has already been claimed and sold so there's not that much new land to be released in the first place details about this land sale are essentially they're selling land around mega city which is it's like a series of estates by like hong kong investors specifically sort of tapping into the asian market as my understanding of it wanted to highlight one of the estates that is going to be a part of this mega city and you can buy land around mega city adrian chang who is a hong kong-based entrepreneur and well-established strategic investor is bringing his vision of the future to the sandbox that's that was part of this essentially press release that the sandbox put out his xl estate which means it's 24 by 24 lands will be the innovation hub of mega city one of its main landmarks will be the gba pavilion a vibrant place of creativity and tech wonders showcasing the successes and achievements of the greater bay area startups around this pulsating center gba companies associated with adrian chang seaventure and eureka nova will be featured and provide entertainment exclusive nfts and immersive experiences making it the place to be for innovators and dreamers of the future and i have to say i know this is this is literally a press release this is a marketing plug and i don't know i know the nft industry in general can be a little sensitive to rightfully so to vcs and companies and muddied interests coming in and making this space corporate when what it is right now is so grassroots so i don't know some people may be having a reaction to that that's like oh that sounds so like corporate and money in vcs and blah blah my reaction was like oh my gosh this sounds lovely like i i had to remind myself that we're talking about a virtual space uh but it really does reinforce i guess to me that eventually we're all just gonna be living in the metaphors hanging out at these pulsating centers of innovation and imagination and you know it just it's so ready player one in terms of oh we're gonna have this beautiful pavilion and we're all gonna hang out there as our avatars with our vr goggles and it's gonna feel like real life to some extent so uh anyhow that's that's a little taste of what this mega city will be you can buy land around it starting january 13th it is expensive the the basic lands cost 1011 sand tokens sand tokens as of this morning at least were around five dollars so you're looking at about five thousand dollars per land and that's before you hit gas fees so if i would love to buy land in the sandbox again as always with this show this is not financial advice do your own research i think it's probably a very smart play but and i would probably do it for the for the five thousand dollars i'd probably buy the sand tokens do the whole thing but i think the the gas fees are going to be killer on this it launches at what is 8 a.m my time the sale for them which is i'm in eastern standard time and i you know the the land for the sandbox usually sells out in a matter of seconds and i'm sure the gas wars are going to be crazy so while it may be the equivalent of like five thousand dollars in fiat it's going to you know be be much much more when when the gas fees are all said and done so anyhow if any of you participate buy it get one please let me know i would love to know what the experience of of buying land on the sandbox is like i'll probably maybe i'll attend the sale and i don't know i don't want to put that much money into sand if i'm not going to be able to get land so that's my hesitation anyhow please tell me if you buy if you take part in this land sale offering in the sandbox very cool and the sandbox is a project we will continue to track for sure okay next order of business i want to talk about the apes because lots has happened with the apes as always and some of this is older news but again i haven't been on the mic here for a little while so i wanted to make sure we touched on it um one thing eminem bought a board ape so this made the news of course because eminem is now into nfts and specifically into board apes but what was funny is i'm sort of naive i think and sort of i don't know i guess naive which is i always assume when somebody buys into a project it's because they love the project but i realized and really it was cyber cons my interview with inverted who's the cmo of cyber cons that helped this click for me like a ton of these projects pay for celebrities to buy into their project which i guess should have been obvious because of course that's an obvious marketing scheme but i hadn't really thought about it and i think without naming any names inverted sort of implied that board apes is one such project he described sort of a chevy marketing strategy where certain projects are very loud and very out there and very in your face which certainly applies to board apes no shade on board apes and so i suddenly i read this m m news and then i was thinking back on it and i was like huh like it's totally possible that board apes actually just paid eminem to buy an ape and to make it seem like he was you know a board 8 fan maybe the jimmy fallon deal was that way who really knows you know the question is do i have a problem with projects paying influencers to buy into their project and the answer is i guess no honestly as long as you have fundamentals to back up the project as long as you're not sort of using that as a way to dupe your investors or dupe your your community into thinking that your project is something that it isn't but it does seem like ford apes is becoming a massive brand that will be able to back up its valuation i don't know we'll see so but but it was sort of an aha moment for me which is oh did eminem really buy into this project or is he being incentivized to buy into this project and i think on this this same front of you know different strategies around how you handle your project from a marketing perspective apes actually flipped punks for the first time last month back in december as in the the floor price of an ape rose above the floor price of punks i think it actually flipped them a couple times over the month of december and i think that actually speaks to the fact that the ape community does appear so much more active than the crypto punk community and yuga labs seems just much more engaged with their community than larval labs does larval lab seems to have a very quiet approach of just sort of existing and being larva labs and and uh you know sort of resting on its laurels you could say i guess in is maybe a negative way to put it you know you could argue they're also their projects are what they are and they're so historical that it's it's valid that they just let them be what what it is but i do think it speaks to hugo labs sort of hustle and if they are paying influencers to be a part of their project it seems to be paying off at least in the short term here in terms of prices if that's what you're focused on um i also wanted to highlight an interesting trade uh jim mcneillis who i've talked about on this show co-founder of nft42 has been in this space for a long time founder of the avastars project he made a trade with i can fly 3333 that's their twitter handle where jim gave i can fly eight apes and five mutants in exchange for one golden ape so the golden apes are super valuable so that was the trade that got made and what was the reason i wanted to highlight it and the reason i thought it was interesting was i actually really i i respected i can fly's move on that because what it turned out he did i'm i think it's a he i'm sorry i'm assuming the gender there but um what i think what he did was to sell off a couple of the apes that he got from jimmy from jim mcneilles and i was like oh damn i envy that because i've had a couple of moments specifically i own a couple of v friends that i had minted for like two thousand dollars and then you know they shot up to like seventy thousand dollars a piece at one point and i remember talking to my dad about it and showing him these v friends which are like it's like a shrimp drawing that's love you gary no offense but like pretty ugly and he was like oh my god like is there any way for you to at least take some profits off the table with that like can you at least you know does it have to be all or nothing like i understand you don't want to sell these things out right but like god you know this is like worth 70 000 right now can't you take a little bit of profit and i of course i couldn't unless i wanted to try and fractionalize it or something so i i think it was very clever on the part of i can fly to make this trade and be able to take some profits off the table uh for himself now of course jimmy is doing very well so he doesn't need to take those profits so for him having the golden ape probably works out well but it is something that i lament about this space and i'm sure some of you some of you you out there who are deep in the nft market do too which is it does kind of hurt that it's such a zero-sum game and that you know when you own an nft you have to either ride the wave all the way out or you know or sell it and so uh congratulations i can fly good for you good for jimmy congrats on a cool trade this actually segways well because the next topic i want to talk about actually sort of inadvertently connects to jimmy jim mcmillis i want to talk about flip maps and to give some context here this is i spoke about a project called blit maps in an earlier podcast episode i'll refresh y'all's memory if you didn't listen to that episode or you don't remember what the blit maps project was about um i also spoke on an earlier episode of this podcast about the crypto funk's crypto punks fight debate i'll give a quick refresher on that as well that's where this connects up to jim mcneills and jimmy because he's very outspoken about being very anti-crypto funks but the reason i bring this up is flip maps is basically blitmaps meets the crypto punk crypto funk debate there's a lot more nuance here which we'll we'll dive into but this ties in a lot of themes that are really relevant to the blockchain nft space so i wanted to dive into it so blitmaps for the quick overview for anybody who didn't listen to the episode or doesn't remember is a project that was launched by dom hoffman dom was the founder of vine videos he launched the loot project he was very early into nouns dow so talented entrepreneur very well known very well respected in the blockchain space in general has been a part of a lot of cool projects that have have made a lot of noise and basically he brought like 17 or 18 artists together to design this this like pixel art and i think there was a restriction that the artist could only use like four colors or four specific colors in designing the artwork and the whole project was on is on chain all of the metadata etc so you know if blit maps the website or whatever like exploded you would still have you would still have these nfts they're all on chain and the really revolutionary thing arguably or the really interesting thing that blit maps ultimately did was all of the artists and then ultimately all of the community holders that held sort of offspring of the original pieces voted to put the project put blitmaps into the creative commons they basically forwent any copyright over the project so they said we have no right to enforce any copyrights on bullet maps you can the community the world can do whatever they want with this project it's not ours it's ours right it's ours the general collective sense not ours the artist's collective sense so that felt to a lot of people as very blockchain and web 3 native and and what it is it's an experiment in a community a truly community-run project and it's an experiment in can a collective group of you know can the world make a project more valuable than it would be if it were sort of centrally controlled and of course there are risks to this because any fringe political group like anybody can take this project and do what they want with it so that's the risk you're incurring but it's a really i think worthwhile experiment because i think it's going to be so interesting how this plays out how blit maps and other projects who have opted to do this as well play out over the long term then the other bit of context quickly with the crypto punks crypto funks debate uh crypto funks is a project that launched well after crypto punks and they basically took the crypto punks look and they just flipped it so that the faces are facing the opposite way as they as they face in the crypto punks project anyways it's a complete copy of crypto punks and so there's a lot of debate some people say this is a completely illegitimate illegitimate project because it's not original at all it's not even like a parody or interesting take on crypto punks really and the reason this became quite a big story is because crypto punks actually went after cryptofunks and got them delisted from openc and that made some people very angry and anyway so that's an example of an nft project owner in this case larval labs actually making it very clear no no we do have copyright over our project we do have a certain amount of ownership over this project and if you infringe upon that we will go after you blitmaps has said nope we don't care do whatever you want and they're giving that explicit right so flip maps is a derivative project off of blitmaps started from within the blipmaps community as it turns out the way that blitmaps works there are some number of combinations of like patterns plus colors that never actually got minted or created and so flip maps is like filling in those un uncreated combinations of colors and patterns essentially to create like a complete set to complete the blitmaps set i think is sort of what they're arguing and they're saying hey we're also totally in the creative commons we're also all on chain like blitmaps and there's been a lot of support for the the team that's doing this from within the blitmap community so the founders come from the blitmap world and they're like hey we're also going to do our own things we're going to have our own you know future that we are going to chart that'll be somewhat separate from blitmaps but we also hope that will sort of start to be seen as part of the blitz maps family blit maps cost like five plus eth at this point to buy into so there's sort of a feeling like this is you know an accessible way to suddenly join blitmaps though they are a separate project you don't technically get to be a part of blip maps in terms of being in their specific discord channels etc by buying into this project i bought one i bought one flip map they're like .02 ether 270th or something they're not they're not super expensive even still i was like very hesitant to buy in a bunch because i do well i don't have a problem with derivative projects they don't generally call to me even projects like mutant apes right i was on the cuff i was on the precipice of buying a mutant ape for four eth back when they first launched and ultimately didn't bought two creatures instead because that was around the same price of course mutant apes are like 14 eth now and i want to vomit every time i look at it because i probably made a mistake there no i actually love creatures i think i didn't make a mistake i love creatures but obviously in the short term here i definitely left money on the table by not buying a mutant but i couldn't buy the mutant because i felt i don't know i just even though it was still a yuga labs project it felt like okay it's not the original and i don't know if it's like a weird inner snob in me or a weird inner elitist but i just couldn't do it but i'm by buying the flip map i'm trying to correct course on that version i've tended to have because some of these derivative projects have actually actually do very well it does feel a little bit to me like the marvel franchise world in the movie industry right the fact that the highest grossing movies just seem to continuously be like remakes even i mean spider-man has grossed how many billions of dollars it was like the highest grossing movie for like weeks on end in theaters and literally there have been like eight spider-man movies that have come out in my lifetime so people do like the classics and you know mutant apes proves that again let's make the clear distinction mutant apes was actually a project that came from yugolabs unlike something like this flip map project that comes from community members from of the blitmaps team like flip maps was not created by dom hoffman and his crew but it does feel like as far as derivative projects go it's as it's as close to the founding team as you can get without being the founding team given that this was a community member-led project that had support of the blipmap's community really from day one seemingly so anyhow this is my experiment in actually buying into a derivative project albeit at a very very miniscule level and it's just something to keep tabs on i think as we figure out as a space when decentralized projects work well when centralized projects work well when derivative projects work and i want i wanted to have a little skin in the game to force me to track this on a on a deeper level i suppose so make of that what you will buy into it if you like me want to track it more closely but don't certainly don't take this as financial advice my instinct generally speaking when confronted with the question should i buy into this project is like always no which is so funny given what i do at this point for a living which is work for a blockchain startup that deals heavily in nfts and host a podcast about nfts but i am wired to really really hate losing money and not that other people aren't wired to hate losing money obviously none of us like that but clearly there are people in this space who like thrive off of the risk people who love gambling i hate gambling i go to casinos and i like i'm like no i would just rather keep my money than risk losing my money like i'm really averse to it and so there's only been a couple of times in my life where i felt really strongly about a project v friends was actually one of them and that's done very very well for me and so for the most part i can i can kind of talk both sides of a project right i can talk the pros and i can talk the cons and so i talk myself out of buying it because if there's even like the slightest chance that it's going to lose money i don't want to buy into it which of course is all projects because no projects will ever guarantee you that you're going to make money but i am actually trying to overcome that urge and be a little bit more experimental in my purchases because i want to learn this space and it is helpful to actually be bought into projects if you want to learn about this space so buying a flip map for me was okay let me keep tabs on what's happening here and as i said at the top of this show i really really want to explore this question of intellectual property more deeply and blitmaps is at the heart of that debate because blitmaps has given up ownership over their own intellectual property and they're saying more value is going to be created by having this intellectual property be the property of the world rather than the property of ours and i'm fascinated to see how that plays out in the long run i worry about the freeloader problem right like you have all these nobody has i don't know singular incentive to make this project amazing on the flip side the argument is i don't know the x number of thousands of blit map holders now all have an incentive to make this project amazing and so the odds that one of them emerges to create something truly fantastical with blit maps is high so you know i i again i can argue both sides of it and i think it'll be so so interesting to see how it plays out axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their axes there are and will be many varied gaming experiences for axes many of them having players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources others will have them complete quests defeat bosses and unlock in-depth storylines there are countless unique axes that players can collect with varying body parts and experiences the axi universe is a player-owned economy where the players can truly own buy sell and trade the resources they earn in the game through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem it's a digital nation where people come together globally with their axes to play earn and live join the axi revolution at welcome.skymavis.com everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axe infinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse last project i wanna talk about and i actually hesitated i debated whether or not to include this because i don't think i'm quite as knowledgeable on it as i would fully like to be but i think it's worth putting on folks radars so if there are any of you out there that want to dig deeper yourself you know about it and can do so i want to talk about chain faces arena so for those who don't know chain faces was a project that was launched last january by nate alex also an og in the space he actually co-founded nft 42 with jim mcneilles who we've mentioned in the show and really talented smart person who also has a lot of standing in the nft community in general so basically he announced with like one day's warning that he was launching a secret project and hopped on a twitter spaces to talk about it and uh opened up a white list pretty much immediately and immediately started minting this project and the project was chain faces arena so he launched a project called chain faces this is now chain faces arena and it's a fully on chain game though it's it's really like gambling where you can put your chain faces into an arena and every 15 minutes a round of this again game ends and a certain percent of the the chain faces that are in the arena die and then a certain percent live and those that live accrue something called scars and those scars make your chain face more valuable and and rarer and are a signal of your chain face lasting in the arena and so why that's one reason to put your chain face into an arena is to accrue these scars the other reason is that if you take your train face out of the arena you become entitled to as you as you remove your chain face you're entitled to some percentage of this overall treasury that i think is like 600 or 700 each so you can actually get get eth by playing this game putting your chain face in the arena lasting in the arena and then coming out of the arena and of course the longer you stay in i think the bigger the the part of the pie you get etc so i think this is interesting because it sort of reminded me of wolf game it's it's a much more simplified version of course but it's this world of playing with on-chain gamified really gambling mechanics that i do think are kind of fun that aren't possible without blockchain or are an interesting use case of blockchain the reason i hesitated to talk about this project is because i know nate alex and i know because i have some you know some mutual friends with him that he's very interested in technologically innovating in this space so i imagine there are some really technically innovative components he's worked into this arena game and i can't really speak to what those are so again i'm raising this to say put this on your radar it's an interesting project it's by an interesting player in the space and it's probably worth looking more into if you're if you're interested in the ways that people are innovating technologically speaking in in blockchain in general and in the nft world there there was a little bit of community i think backlash it seems like folks sort of disappointed in the project feeling like it wasn't interactive enough it really is a passive situation you're just putting this chain fate your train face into this thing called the arena and then you know taking a gamble hoping that you survive and eventually can win some money on it um so i think folks were a little bit disappointed on that nate hosted a twitter space i think it was yesterday so that would be thursday this past thursday and and he put it he put some tweets out before the twitter space really saying like hey if you feel disappointed please please raise your concerns i want to have an open dialogue i really want to be transparent this community means so much to me like really awesome saying all the right things plenty of people i think also loved this game and loved the chain faces arena so this isn't everyone but i did not get to listen to the twitter space because i have a job and i actually don't know what time the twitter space was but i missed it and it wasn't recorded and this ties into a rant that i have given before about why twitter spaces is so freaking annoying to me as like the primary way that the nft world communicates to each other because unless you record it it's like this miserable thing that like only people who are available at like 2 p.m on a wednesday which not all of us are get like get all the alpha um but anyhow he went on twitter spaces kind of talk about the project you know uh standard stuff like they have a lot more in store so anyhow interesting worth putting on your radar check it out if you're interested in learning more i will i will dive deeper into this i just unfortunately didn't have time this week to fully dive in but i also like the secret project thing like that's kind of fun again it's sort of an exclusive part of this world and it's why it's hard for newcomers to to get involved in early projects because or cool projects because they don't necessarily know who to follow but it was kind of fun how all of that played out okay last on this week's episode i want to talk it's something a little different for me because i'm not really the girl who talks about bitcoin i'm talking about nfts i'm talking about the metaverse i leave things like bitcoin and anything defye token currency e to the bankless boys to ryan and david but i did happen to tune in this week to an interview with a guy named peter schiff and it was on the greatness the the school of greatness it was a podcast called the school of gate greatness he interviewed peter schiff who is like a big bitcoin fudder like this dude he's an economist he hates bitcoin and i was like i should listen into this and and and it was positioned like oh he hates cryptocurrency so it's like oh i should listen it really felt more like he just hates bitcoin because the arguments he was making many of them don't hold up once you start trying to apply them to ether or other currencies and other chains um so i was like oh this guy doesn't feel like he actually has a really in-depth knowledge of what he's of of what he speaks but uh but anyhow i wanted to listen to it i appreciate getting the contrarian perspectives um but what i found interesting is so his central attack on bitcoin is like it's literally nothing it's it's the same old thing you hear right like it's it's doesn't have any utility it doesn't have any purpose it's not even truly a store of value because it doesn't have utility like at least gold you can make jewelry out of it and so which also has always been a weird argument to me like okay you can make jewelry out of gold but like why does jewelry have value right all of this stuff has value because humans have decided to assign value to it we've decided that jewelry is a way to socially signal like it doesn't actually feel different than being able to socially signal that you own bitcoin to some extent but anyhow that's this whole thing oh it has value and you can make jewelry out of it and therefore it's more legitimate than bitcoin is and then he goes on to acknowledge because the the counter to it is like the dollar means nothing anymore right the dollar's not backed by anything and he acknowledges that he's like and of course the dollar at this point isn't backed by anything it used to be but now it's not blah blah but the dollar matters and the dollar is legitimate because you have to pay your taxes in u.s dollars and you have to your landlord accepts u.s dollars for your apartment etc cetera and so then it's like okay well if the government decided to start accepting bitcoin as legal tender and if your landlord therefore had to accept bitcoin as as for your rent like what's happening in el salvador does bitcoin suddenly magically become legitimate then because i do think there's a world where increasingly vendors and other people start taking cryptocurrency as a method of payment he doesn't address that but it did make me want to share my justification for bitcoin that i've used because i'm actually not unsympathetic to his criticisms and there's a reason that i got really excited about this space once i learned about d5 and nfts i i've known about bitcoin since 2010 and that never really like got me jazzed ethereum got me jazzed because i realized it was a platform a top of which so much else was being built but when i've explained bitcoin to other people people who maybe don't get it and who share peter schiff's hesitations for me it's always been bitcoin is my apocalypse play like an apocalypse scenario not as in like the entire grid goes down because that's obviously that's that presents some challenges but my apocalypse play as in the us government goes down everything just starts like collapsing governments are collapsing left and right you know we know that the winklevosses and biology i don't know mark cuban and probably a bunch of people who are actually working behind the scenes whose names therefore i don't even know are like setting up some crypto based society and i'm grabbing my ledger my ledger nano with my bitcoin on it and i'm high tailing it to wherever they are and honestly i think that society is going to be better than the people setting up the society based on gold and that is like a very legitimate reason in my opinion to buy bitcoin if you're lucky enough to have some disposable income that you can put towards like an apocalypse scenario fund do it and and i think that's a really valid reason and i i would be interested in hearing peter schiff's response to that now this leads me to the philosophical i don't know thought question and i saw this on reddit very shortly after i heard this peter shift podcast and it and it said would you still buy crypto if you couldn't exchange it back to fiat so if once you bought bitcoin or or eth or any of the other currencies you couldn't actually ever extract us dollars for it would you still buy into it and for me the answer is yes like not to the degree that i'm currently doing it because i am i do i do teeter on the edge of too illiquid given you know how much i like buying into these currencies and into nfts and things though as we've learned i'm terrified to buy into nfts because i hate losing money but i would still buy this i would still buy into ethan i would still buy into into bitcoin because i do think that they are apocalypse plays and i think that at this point in time they're only going to grow in prominence in terms of the way they can be used every day with vendors etc and i like what i'm able to do on the ethereum blockchain i find it fun and i need eth as the fuel to make all of that happen so of course i mean it's such a hypothetical if if we if you could never have converted bitcoin or eth back to dollars it would have never gotten off the ground because you know the majority of people would never have put money into it and these vendors wouldn't accept it if they couldn't ever convert it back to fiat but the fact that my answer to that is yes and the fact that i think many other people's answers to would they still buy it even if they couldn't convert it back to fiat is also yes i think is the biggest counter to peter schiff's point here which is this is not a group of people who is exclusively composed of folks who are speculating and trying to make more money plenty of that is going on of course but that is not 100 of what's going on and that's why these projects have utility right that's why these projects have value in the way that gold has value because it can be turned into jewelry so anyhow peter schiff if you hear this what say you to that and with that that's our show today thank you all
