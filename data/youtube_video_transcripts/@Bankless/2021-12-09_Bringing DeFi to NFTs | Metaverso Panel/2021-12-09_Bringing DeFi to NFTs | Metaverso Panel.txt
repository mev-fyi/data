[Music] hey guys welcome to another state of the nation this is an edition where we talk about bringing nfts to d5 this is a special edition as well because it's it's on site on premise at a conference you're going to get the full conference experience in this episode what are we talking about today david yeah this is a live episode that we recorded at the metaverso conference about bringing nfts to d5 bringing d5 to nfts what happens when these worlds collide uh and i started off this uh this panel with just a very quick introduction there's only two types of tokens out in the world there's non-fundable tokens and there's fungible tokens that's the whole entire category uh true in real life too by the way yeah it's also true in real life yeah yeah yeah fungible or non-fungible that's that's the only categories uh but then there's the also there's the intersection of these things where the lines can start to blur uh and cool new things can be built out of that and so this is a 35 minute panel that we recorded uh with four guests from around the crypto sphere and those guests are andy8052 you guys might remember him from a couple nft shows that we've had he is the founder of fractional there's there's a ben lachoff from charge particles uh laura jaramillo from upshot and sam cassatt from neptune dow so those are the panelists and we just talked all about the cool stuff that happens with when you intersect uh erc20 and erc721 guys this is going to be a double level up for you today because it's not only a level up on the nfts it's also a level up on d5 and this new thing including where they both intersect so it's a good opportunity to learn a bit more about liquidity into nfts number one the second is how do you generate nft communities using d5 when you fractionalize nfts what does that look like how does that guide in your investment decisions and also i think you guys are going to get into the one thing that all nfts depend on and that is oracles so a lot to unpack here hey guys before we go too much further want to let you know about metamask metamask is sponsoring this message they want us to let you know that they are working hard on hardware support okay metamask plus ledger that's a combo i often use whenever i am using web3 metamask of course is a fantastic web3 and crypto wallet and they are improving integration with the ledger also metamask on the lattice wallet is uh really been amped up and actually newly released also the keystone wallet if you're using a trezor if you're using a lattice if you're using a ledger this is the way to get into crypto while using protection you need that protection the hardware protection that comes with owning custody of your own key not having private keys inside of a browser so metamask plus hardware wallets a fantastic team up uh and i would just encourage you you probably have metamask if you don't go download metamask if you don't have if you already have metamask then connect your hardware wallet to it and uh try the experience out again there's been some bumps along the way with ledger and metamask support that some of you guys have experienced they are working to improve that and i think the latest firmware updates on the ledger have improved that to a great degree so check that out we'll include a link in the show notes uh david we're gonna talk about the panel itself and the content of the panel but before we do i want just uh a taste of the conference give me the conference experience okay because here i am in my office all the time i never come out of my office right i don't go as possible well we don't know that for sure but like you know one day you and i will meet at a conference in real life one day soon i promise but until that time for people who uh don't have the opportunity the time to go to a conference what was the metaversa conference like yeah the mediversal conference was a one-day conference which i think is the first one-day conference i've been to in a really really long time and i think everyone really really appreciated that because this is also coming out on the heels of art basel which was a very long week in miami which was uh everyone was talking about how draining it was but art basel is something that it happens every single year i'm just learning about this because i didn't know about it big big art um just uh like decentralized convention of sorts there's many many did many different venues and events just doing art stuff in miami uh and this year it was the running joke that it's actually called crypto basel now because all the nfcs have taken over art basel so everyone's in miami yep so there's two conferences right there's one you went to two conferences in the space of like the last seven days or so one was art basel in miami and the other is mediverso in puerto rico the the panel we have upcomings is from mediverso but uh art basil you're saying this was an art conference before nfts right totally okay and the nft people are now like invading it is that what so what was the feeling there yeah so like i said there is the one canonical like art basel at the miami convention center on miami and miami beach and even that had nft stuff in it as well but not too much all the all the other like events just like uh different just uh in installations there was a big installation on a beach that people would go see and there's this one big piece of art uh there and people would hop around with all these different venues and events going to all just checking out all the art and all of them were like nft had some sort of nfts about them somehow somewhere um and the the the industry is in uh the art industry not the nft industry is in some sort of like kind of in a state of uh very much immaturity trying to figure out how to actually display nfts uh there's a lot of just kind of like amateurish nft displays where like you know you had vertical nfts being displayed on horizontal screens so there are big black bars there are tvs just on tv stands on tables rather than like as a frame on a wall um first year though it's gonna get first year first year yeah you can't we can't really can't really uh knock them too hard because this is brand new it's just happened um but there's much to be desired with like in real life nft displays right like how do we actually show these things yeah um somebody that i saw uh do it really really well had nfts projected up on a big big wall so this artist this is uh nate mohler who's the the artist that uh i bought my nfts for from forever go uh he was actually displaying those nfts two big projectors that were synced up so like there it just looked like one big thing and he had it blown up it looks like i think it was like 50 feet wide by 25 feet tall on this massive wall and so those that was really really well done but the art industry is like trying to figure out how to come to terms with appropriately displaying this very new format of like digital art with nfts are they cool with it so you know in our podcast with kevin rose he actually used the term um you know trad art right and i'm gonna continue using that so like what does the trad art world think of this new nft thing is there some resistance or is there a warm embrace like hey welcome to the family this is give injected some new energy into the art scene what's the what's the feeling from our basil i think the art collectors i don't think are too different from the typical distribution of crypto skeptics to non-skeptics they're not really any different like some people like crypto some people don't i don't think the art collectors are any meaningfully different than than the average person that you would get some people again some people are think it's the future some people are totally skeptical the artists love nfts because specifically it's empowering very very much so and and it's a new cohort of artists that are now able to play in art basel because of nfts so it's not really the trad artist it's a new set of artists that have come into into the fold specifically because of nfts and then there are are specifically events being spun up that are just trying to be conducive to that type of art kind of the very very experimental very much on the fringe digital art that wouldn't have really had an opportunity elsewhere do you know what's so wild i feel like this is a um a microcosm of what's happening in every single industry right so you get like trad art and then you have like this nft thing the crypto thing is kind of invading trad art a little bit i mean that in a good way injecting new energy creating this new medium but it's not just art it's like every industry okay this is happening in finance this is happening in like entertainment hollywood the movie industry it's now like nfts this is happening in gaming so i don't know how many conferences and conventions you intend to go to david but like you could go to them every week all year around in all of the different industries and have crypto nfts defy represented in some way or another it's just really invading every single uh aspect of like industry that's going on like we haven't even talked about music right i mean i'm sure there's like music conferences and and and festivals nfts are going to have a huge uh prominent display it was also interesting to see some of the platforms having like uh just uh cubicles or just like sections in these uh in these art venues uh super rare had like just i think they had something like 10 tvs up on a wall and when i say tvs these are actually good like frames that are meant for displaying art uh and so if super rare has this their own little section of this art display the mix mixed with trad art uh and then super rare is also debuting of course they don't make art they host art so they were again hosting art but this time in real life rather than on their website uh so they had actual artists that they were that were also with them in the booths having their art displayed and so it was kind of cool it's like the the real website of super rare just being manifested in this section of the art show in real life i thought that was kind of cool hatch max masks were also there at the same place um and there's a number of there was one uh venue that just looked like in real life open c it was kind of funny it was like oh yeah if open c came and actually just like had a and in real life installation that this is what it would look like all right so tell me a little bit that that was the art basil uh conference experience tell me tell us a little bit about mediversa for people who couldn't attend so how did that contrast how it was different i know this is uh this is hosted by somebody who's on bank list previously uh g money he's on the layer zero podcast so uh what was different about this one yeah this was uh a lot of people here were at art basel uh and they had just hopped over uh from miami to puerto rico but this cohort of people were a lot closer to the core of what i would call crypto uh these are all the people that like get it and know that everyone else around them also the crypto natives the nft there's no trad art scene in the at the metaverso conference then uh yes correct yeah so there were there were it was all digital displays uh showing nfts that you know all the nft collectors love um serotonin and mojito uh which are a marketing and nft advisory company they were they were also helping set this up and that's uh amanda casau and a few other also like crypto natives that have been with consensus for forever and now are doing their own thing so yeah it's just a bunch of crypto natives um and then all the yeah all the sponsors that you would you would expect as well um and again it was just a one day thing and they did a very smart job of starting the conference at 11 rather than something crazy like eight yeah so people could just like warm up their day and then get to the conference yeah it was one stage with about 200 chairs about 400 people there some people were inside outside uh and just just a just a great fantastic list of just topics and and conversations and it was just what i really appreciated about it was how concentrated it was it was like everyone could focus their energies just on one day uh and because all of the good stuff was happening on that one day everyone felt fomo about like not watching a panel uh so the panels were decently well attended so everyone was together people weren't skipping panels and there's only like 400 people or so so it was fairly small and intimate totally yeah that's awesome did a really good job g-money he's uh pseudo anonymous so if you like follow him on twitter he always has his uh ape as his uh like a vr filter but in real life like no you he there's no vr filter in real life but he still comes by g g-money so if you ever meet g-money in real life like he'll shake your hands like oh yeah i'm g-money wait he still doesn't tell you his name um that's hilarious that's great so were there any takeaways from you from the versa conference my takeaways is that puerto rico is really really cool yeah everyone really likes to be in puerto rico it's a great spot to host uh hosts a conference even if it's just a one day or it was very much uh it made a ton of sense uh to host it right in this present moment because it was right after art puzzle half the of the industry was already like only two and a half hours away yeah uh and it was just it was everyone who cares deeply about nfts for for all the right reasons uh there was a charity auction as well so nfts were being auctioned off to go to charity support puerto rico infrastructure um which is still needed in the wake of the hurricanes that happened last year um and it was overall just a fantastic event so tell me this david what do you get out of conferences that you don't get out of like like in-person conferences that you don't get from like all of the zoom meetings and all of the you know youtube and podcasts that people consume that in the twitter back and forth banter and the discord servers what's different make the pitch for going to a conference why is it important yes well first off some people that are really really cool and interesting just aren't there aren't they're not on twitter they're not on the zoo meetings right so it's really just a matter of having surface area to a lot of people all at once you can go and meet five people inside of 30 minutes uh and the probability of one or two of those people having like long-term relationships is pretty pretty damn good uh and and so like if there is no replacing real life as much as we all want to live in the metaverse uh just seeing faces uh and like uh and for those that are on crypto twitter like me and ryan like degenerately all the time uh meeting someone in real life actually does impact like how i read tweets when it's coming from somebody that i know uh and this is true just this is true for for emails and yes you know for a podcast right just once once you meet the person um you know you just get a little bit um deeper like more introspection as to like what they are actually thinking about when they when they write stuff and show stuff so it's important for like community cohesion and like you're actually able to form a different type of connection in person versus versus all of the digital mediums that we use totally totally and ideas can be shared just a lot faster um just communications is a lot more lubricated i don't know if you watched our at the state of the nation i did with robbie in real life at nft nyc but having robbie right next to me the conversation was really fast and it moved really really quickly because i could look at him he could look at me there was body language and like we forget about these things definitely on twitter and even on zoom like you just kind of don't really get that you and i we don't have that problem because we've been on zoom like well i don't know how good could it be if like we're doing this in person what a question i mean yeah maybe we'd be number one of the podcast rather than number four in the apple investing category i don't know yeah it's it's just like everything just happens faster and so for for people like me that really also have just like fantastic enriching social experiments for the experiences from these events just the just more socialization per second uh and so yeah there's just more alpha there's more people can just say things that they're interested in at a higher tick rate more more go for opportunities more alpha better connections guys that that is your pitch and i i feel like that pitch is coming from david to me of why i should attend a conference in 2022 but we're coming up this is why ryan descends to me he's like i get all the benefit because david just does all of this but you know uh yeah absolutely guys so if you're if you're looking at conference 2022 schedule there's a lot of great crypto conferences coming up so um budget some time plan some time to meet the people that you see in the digital world in real life it's definitely definitely worth it and uh david next year is the year you and i will meet in real life so uh at one of these conferences at some point or another but okay let's talk about your panel now because we got to the point we're going to intro this this is really cool so the combo of d5 plus nfts equals magic i guess that's what you're talking about on the panel so what uh why should folks stay tuned to this panel what are you guys talking about yeah there's a number of uh quick conversations that we had and really the format of this is just i proposed a question post a topic and just let the panelists take it down the line each one had their opportunity to share sometimes they built off of each other but sometimes they just gave their thoughts there are really important conversations with for example fidenzas very highly valued art block nfts with relatively low volume like weeks can go by without a fidenza sale and so as collateral and defy or integrating in erc 721s into applications you that are if you want to use the the capital that's locked inside of a fedenza you need to have a secure and accurate price feed that the market can rely on and so like how do you get a price fee for something that has one sale per week and it's perhaps it's a floor how does that even actually right relate to a rare uh fidenza rather than a floor fidenza uh so like solving that problem is is hard uh but definitely possible um i think if you want to skip to the end and just like come to the conclusion the answer is there is no good way to do this you have to do all of them and then combine them which is a problem in of itself um uh the other really important uh thing i think is really really cool about nfc is that we're we're definitely watching it happen right now but we i think it really could supercharge people that really want to lean into this is that a fractionalized nft can make a community and we're already seeing this with pleaser doubt uh please redial they bought the the og doge meme for 2.4 million uh dollars and it's the it's the meme of the internet uh james from pleaser doll likes to say it's the mona lisa of the internet how like it's the doge like it is the internet's meme and so like there's only one of those and pleaser owns it but it's the internet's meme and so they have used fractional to fractionalize it into the dog currency so the dog token is backed by the doge nft and now everyone can have a share of the doge and now there's a fantastic discord and dao spun up around the dog token because it's a part of the dojo nft well what's super interesting about that is just like economically we talk about value creation so they bought the the doge nft for 2.5 millions like we said somewhere in that ballpark right okay then they tokenized it fractionalized it and the dog token is worth i'm just looking at a coin uh gecko 50 million right right so it's like that's a 20 you know 20x in terms of increased value creation right and people might debate is that you know is this a meme token is this value what is this real value definitely a meme token but i mean you can measure the value that was created uh from from the d5 markets so uh i'm i haven't watched this panel david i'm really excited to dig into it because what's cool about nfts is of course when when paired with d5 they inherit all of d5's super powers all right traditional art doesn't get any of this which is why i'm like kind of bearish traditional art relative to nfts in the same way i'm bearish gold relative to like crypto assets like ethan bitcoin right uh because there's so much more you can do with it and uh it's just going to give all of these nfts superpowers david before we get into this is there anything else you want to mention yeah so in kind of in the same vein as fractionalizing the doge nft pleaser dow is also launching free ross dao freerossdow.com so definitely check that out it's the constitution dao but instead of buying the constitution they're buying ross ulbrich's nfts that he's issuing from jail um the the money that is is going to free ross dow to purchase his nfts the money that the purchase will go to is to a combination of actually trying to free ross uh and then also donating to funds that help loved ones visit uh visit their other loved ones in jail and so free route dos.com it's again kind of the same thing as a fractionalized doge but instead of pleaser dow buying this nft and then fractionalizing it they are spinning up the dow and just donating their capital into the dao and so this is again constitution dial for free rossdale.com uh if you're interested in helping ross get free uh maybe you are interested in taking part in the fractionalization of the the ross albrecht nft if free ross dao buys it from frost so the experiments are getting weirder but the experiments are also getting better so stay tuned to this panel guys you will find out what is next with the combination of nfts and d5 from the following experts we want to get right to the content so we're just doing a quick sponsor rundown for you these are the sponsors that made this episode possible go check him out fantastic sponsors on bangladesh all of the time uniswap apply for a grant you can swap dao ave get a loan without a bank the bankless way we also have lydo where you can stake your eath and get st eth in return which accrues more eth because that's how staking works and of course we have gemini which is the exchange that i recently bought the dip on and that buy feels great so buy your dips on gemini thanks to the sponsors that made this episode possible you guys rock all right thanks everyone for being here uh this is actually the first ever live podcast banquet so that's pretty exciting uh and of course we have this is about the intersection of nfts and d-file and to really get that started i just kind of want to put this frame into people's minds as they think about this really there's only two types of tokens on ethereum there's erc20s and then there's the rc721 that's kind of it's more than that that's really just the gist of it and that's what you get there you got erc20s the functional tokens which are defined and then you have the non-functional tokens which are uh nfds and so when you put those things together that's the whole thing and so what happens when we talk about the intersection of those two types of token standards and that is what we will be unpacking today on this panel uh so i want to introduce all of our panelists uh if you guys want to just give your introduction and uh elevator bits as to what you do and your company uh we will start with andy here hi thanks for having me i'm andy uh i co-founded fractional which does nft fractionalization it's very unknown to the name um but yeah i've been working in crypto and d5 for a long time awesome my name is uh laura jaramino i'm the main product designer at upshot we do real-time launching and nft appraisals using peer prediction and machine learning and accurate price prediction once and for all hey guys ben lingard simon bayern uh co-founder and business lead at charged particles so we are in an empty protocol that enables you to get a smart wallet with some uranum teams and linkedin into a whole other house hi uh my name is sam cassid i've been around for a long time a lot of you know me probably is chief strategy officer of consensus where i in a lot of stuff like truffle and fear of adam asked around that since the beginning um fast forward a few years now i'm doing a number of things with founders on the blind uh we uh in concert with the neptune though which i helped create it provides liquidity to dfi applications and sometimes things related to nfts and a bunch of other stuff uh i'll be talking about something uh all right so let's go ahead and dive right into this uh so just let's get really really grounded here uh we have the that thing is pretty damn robust nfgs are still pretty new but also extremely big uh and the cool thing about crypto is it goes in all directions at once and it really seems to be that the intersection of d5 and nfts is kind of like one of the last areas that as an industry we really haven't tapped into yet so when we open up the door and look behind the intersection of d5 nfcs how big is this why does this matter is there something actually here like let's talk about the potential of what happens when we actually combine these things very broad open-ended question and once again andy let's start with you all right yeah i think what's interesting here is there's like there's a lot of real world assets that we do like kind of device stuff in the real world with like digging out a mortgage on your apps or different things like that and you can like map all that really easily to like nfts and deep file with nmts but what's really exciting is it kind of unlocks this world where you can do that with any asset in the entire world and so not to like sound too bullish or anything but it's kind of like the address of the market is every asset in the entire world that's worth doing d5 with uh which i think is really really exciting it's just like unlocking opportunities for a lot of new people and new users and stuff like that the potential to tokenize literally anything in the world is like astonishing for implications of like nmts and d5 the biggest issue right now is like how eloquent these things are the fact that we don't have any accurate price prediction and the fact that like it doesn't matter if i meet my house on open seat if i don't have accurate price connection for that there's no way that i can leverage it against anything so especially like what we're working towards at upshot it kind of marked us as the intersection of nmts and d5 because we're building that foundational element which is that accurate real-time updating every 10 minutes price feed on literally every nft suddenly things like i don't know synthetics become possible take like underwriting and underwriting your debt with energy as becomes possible with accurate prediction high speed so i'm i'm extremely extremely bullish on this new asset class and this new world but that is the foundational element that's missing and it's around the border so yeah so i mean a lot of great points but i i think segmenting these things into this is the nft world and this is the debug world even within nfts themselves like dehyde itself there's so many sub categories in some sections of each of those so eventually all of these things kind of meld into one big crypto space the metaverse is surrounded by the nfts everywhere and those communities will have defiance accent aspects you will have structured products that are containerized within an mft and it just makes sense because that whole thing so we'll we'll continue to see like melding and then the intersection of all of these in new and innovative ways and we're just really beginning to scratch the surface of both of these together both agreed individually yeah i think at a at a conference like this a lot of what we think about is nfts or kind of like punks and apes and profile pictures and things like that but i think to take a step back nfp just means non-functional token right it's a thing it's a thing that's a unique digital object instead of a bunch of objects like like a stock or something it's just a unique thing right and that can represent almost anything you're starting to see experiments in that some people have tried it with like real property it's a little bit hard to link into real property like houses we can imagine how something like the title to a house could be an nft um it can also be linked to access right so unisoft b3 the thing that represents your liquidity that you provided to the united states some poor gentleman accidentally stole it because he thought it was a present that he got from uh from unispot but like if you think about it like that all we know you know we have this object and that object can represent almost anything right you can lock other objects inside of it you can use it like a derivative where other you know a collection of other entities or a collection of other fungible assets is linked to that and that thing can be traded and you can almost imagine the hierarchical structures that exist in normal finance we can do that in times of thousands algorithmically because we have these two structures together it's just something for functional something for non-functional so um there's a ton of intersection to it i think there's a lot farther we have to go in the field because frankly on like ethereum 101 gas is too expensive to move around a thing that costs a dollar or even ten dollars or whatever right so you know i'll i'll stop there yeah you know fractionalization ending et cetera there's a lot of applications over earlier uh so for the next question i actually want andy to go last so sam i'm going to start with you uh uh nfg's and d5 isn't it just the devil's advocate question isn't it just as simple as putting an erc20 token inside of a contract that spits out an erc20 token isn't that the whole story is this really that big of a deal uh or is there more to unpack like what other things are involved with the intersection of d5 of entities why is it more more than just fractionalizing erc721 tokens right um i agree i think there are lots of things that are not just fractionalizing right so there's something yeah for instance using it as collateral right there are there's also kind of gradations right we say 721 and uh 20 but actually there's 1155 right which is sort of somewhere in between or there's a series of cards so i imagine one of the biggest applications of defined entities is engaged in the metaphors right and so the anniversary where we are right now in the metaverse right you can imagine an entire multi-trillion dollar economy as big as the existing economy of things that are like semi-fungible and that you might want to use as representing their underlying financial reality right they want to lend against them to sell them in a series i might want to do lots of things that look like mobile financial activity and so now i don't think it's just um sticking in the rc20 inside of something else it's just they're logically separate in fact there are conditions between yeah so d9 meets energy so financialization fractionalization this could be one using as collateral you can also prevention like a trustless way when you're in teams or empty um versus but yeah the ability to have an nft you hold other assets and use that basket as use that basket as a trust account and transfer it to somebody you have multiple of these baskets kind of in the sub-accounts within your wallet your address this opens up a lot of opportunities and if you take it down to like the most basic thing you could possibly do um you know right now creating synthetics on existing nmts is something that's around the corner as well so suddenly you don't have to necessarily own this entire nft to like benefit from its valuation in the market you'd be able to hold a kind of arbitrary position in any nft that you see value in over time and i'd rather see a ventilator wage on it but access access to all of these different beautiful exotic mechanisms through synthetics is also going to be like a beautiful new sort of new horizon and bring accessibility to the space as well which is one of the biggest the biggest lagging points right now yeah i think to something that is interesting when you think about like using d5 with nfts is not to flood my own bags of my company but like i don't think everyone always wants to fractionalize every nft and use it in d5 but like just because you fractionalize the agility doesn't mean it's immediately liquid it doesn't mean that there's a hundred million dollars if you put in your swap to use that as like a price oracle to do all these other things and so i think that we really need like just new creators and builders in the space thinking about unique and novel ways to kind of support some of the things that we've done in d5 into like an nft world where like lending with nfts and borrowing against your nft probably does not look the same it's not just fractionalize your nft and borrow cash it doesn't really make sense spend a lot of time trying to map that all out but like maybe you borrow against your nft and if you get liquidated then it's fractionalized and you like pay off the liquidation the fractions and you keep some fractions and you can like start to build like more interesting more energy-centric stuff that i think is really where this all has to go to see significantly larger adoption and kind of like meet nft collectors and users and buyers yeah and i think it's important i mean mentioned it a few times but we are really our like poor infrastructural issues like it's very tough to do these things with a very small amount and yeah there's later two it's another chamber uh later ones perhaps but like it is early so it's the early innings there's regulatory uncertainty so it's very difficult to just this is the innovation sandbox and we'll go crazy and build these crazy things that we can dream up because there are more archaic laws and things that we have to play so let's talk about liquidity because if there's one thing that defy is really really good at it's liquidity uh unispot v3 fantastically liquid on just not expanding your capital and then things like compound and obvi are just another forms of liquidity on the other side of things erc721s nfts are inherently liquid that's the unique nature of these things is that the fewer the number of the mars the harder it is to have a market uh so let's talk about how d5 can actually aid the nft side of ethereum and broader crypto in accessing more and more liquidity and what they can really do for bringing out the best of nfts andy why why do we why do nfts need equity so badly how can deep help yeah well so i think like kind of going back to a lot of the d5 stuff like a lot of most d5 primitives to a certain extent require liquidity to price things or put in things and what i'm excited about is thinking about potentially interesting ways to do that with order books and different ways to really be able to gauge interest and demand for any particular nft a lot of different stuff like that and i don't think we totally know what it looks like yet like i don't think that it's as simple as just um unisoft and then but foreign i think like you can do that to a certain symptom like nftx or different tools that are like pulling together like floor level pumps or different things like that um but i think we'll need to see some level of innovation on the quarterback and demand side of the nfts in general and probably like i know uh there's interesting stuff i know the xerox montessori is working on something called that pseudo swap and he's working like an nfta on top of that and there's interesting stuff happening in that space and i'm really excited to see that play out and i think that you can like kind of tie in a lot of things that we're all working on into helping with those types of models yeah i mean we're um it's really interesting you bring up the order book situation something that um we're working on it upshot which is the alphabet the foundation of these appraisals and having these accurate prices that we can all agree on because it's done on chain it is like literally i don't know just decentralized appraisals decent flights and price points i'm disputed suddenly those over books have a price suddenly there's a there is a world where you'd be able to go onto a marketplace onto a platform and sell your nft for whatever the appraised price point is for the specific nft not listed at floor price not listed for local replacement hope that someone fights know know there are people out there that see the potential of these assets and go whatever it is whatever the appraised price for this is i want it and for you to be able to buy that in return as well to be able to see when something is like listed below the appraised price and capture that moment like right now we're just sort of guessing on a market guessing in a bubble hopefully it feels a little like a bubble without that source of truth so i um yeah it's there and this guy's the limit yeah no i i mean i also agree i do agree that like you can't just take these models that work in d5 with fungible tokens all the tokens are interchangeable it doesn't matter if i have this one or that one with non-functional tokens which by definition are very unique so you know like the game said you can't just do the use mod for nfts it doesn't quite work like that so we are and people are experimenting and employment and there are poor structural issues like the rights that are difficult but at the end of the day it is a nascent market there are inefficiencies in all mason early markets and these things just kind of arbitraged away people come in as speculators and stay because there's a lot more going on and that's just kind of part of it yeah i agree i think just to go back again to like the generality here right like erg721 can be anything you need a house it could be my shoe whatever like there's an order word for my shoe it doesn't make sense right there's gonna be different idiosyncratics there are things in productive ways that you might want to sell or provide the company to think depending on what it is right and like different kinds of stuff have different amounts of liquidity apartments in new york um but the interfaces of that the order book of that is a mls system and some people that are very nice and so too you know the um you know the liquidity of the house here is also pretty good now but in some ways it might not be um yeah liquidity or your profile picture nft maybe not so much but like you know for instance we that's something we've talked to a lot of groups about it like i've got a really valuable pump or something like we went against it right so yeah what does it work like for that thing we basically need to recreate the financial system again in a way that's a program with highest and hopefully better and more efficient but it's going to ought to be completely doing socratic depending on what the asset is and how it gets it what about the metaverse right what if i've got there are 5 000 of these shields in this game and there's only you know there's 20 000 people who might want that i can imagine what that order book might look like right so it's about discrimination it's about the idiosyncrasies i just the point of what i'm saying is trying to think about it generally it's like something that can represent any asset and then back into the answer so continuing on this conversation how to value an nft when it doesn't really behave the same way as an erc20 token uh and especially like some art blocks for example for denzins ringers there could be wheats that go by before a sale happens but those sales are still big sales right a potential will still go for hundreds of each and just because a week goes by without a sale happens doesn't mean that there isn't demand for these things uh they can be plenty liquid even with low sales so that brings us to the conversation of how do we appraise these things how do we value these things when there isn't like a union swap market for these things possibly trading uh so laura i want to ask you this question since this has to do with upshot we'll start with you um let's talk about the the oracle the combination of oracles and nfts rather than on train markets with entities how can we use alternative methods to discover the values of these nfts that can be turned into an oracle for the rest of d5 to tap into in a secure manner so the way that we've been going about it at upshot is using its new form of mechanism called peer prediction where you're essentially you ask a bunch of experts something you validate based on their quality right if you're if you want like 100 pounds probably um the process is asking experts a bunch of av questions essentially which nfc is more valuable area therapy um all of those answers go through a correlation like a new type of mechanism that comes out with an honesty score for each appraiser and that pulls the value one way or another so it isn't it isn't it isn't like one person saying that this is worth three hundred eight and that's not a nurse birth it's like hundreds of thousands of people holding that price one way or another and then use machine learning to automatically update that constantly so you have this like this like human element feeding into machine learning getting back to the human element the one piece that's missing and i think that is going to be the game in changer is finding a way to track that community owner and finding a way to track that like like that utility component because right now you can't necessarily spit utility into machine learning and they say that's valuable right but there is a way to look at a community look at the discord server look at who's involved in the project and bring all these factors together and come to a conclusion that yeah this is probably the beginning of something and then using peer prediction machine learning to pull that value to a price point and keep it going relative to each other relative to the collection so that's that's that's the way that we're going about it it's also because it's a hard chain protocol it's something that you you can say can dispute agree with that and try yourself um i think that's one of the another very important aspect of this is that there should not be one governing human that says this is this is truth you should say i think this is true you can figure out anything this is true as well that's way more decentralized way more for winter um but right now we're spitting out price predictions for like the top two hundred and ten collections every ten minutes um and i'm so excited to like bring that to the world one of the things that i'm excited about is like being able to combine that with a lot of other on-chain stuff as well something that they can help a lot for fractional and like ways that we can basically help our users who are buying a particular condenser or something have a significantly more informed position or basically be able to even plug into automated things and say once the like once the appraisal on the shot is 10 percent higher than the current progressive fractional price of this thing not only fire up until five percent higher for different things like that um and we've also been thinking a lot about how fractions can like potentially help a lot more to get prices and there's a lot of challenges because even a relatively rare potential the entire evaluation of it is still a couple million dollars it's not like they're going to get some insanely good market for this one individual piece but what we've been thinking about a lot lately is potentially like having ongoing options for percentages of it and so you can then like kind of imply about the prices and say like okay if we were to auction off one percent ownership and someone willing to pay one ethereum for it this is probably worth around 100 periods and if you like do that on long enough like time rises like based on you say okay over ten days when one percent was auctioned in august they went for between one ethereum and two ethereum so it ends up at that time before one and a half area or something along the clock i'm really excited to start experiencing more end up in that side of things where as a protocol you have a lot more control over the supply and how people are buying the direct kind of price on that getting an in-game item in ftu tv might have a lot more value to me versus a non-game.org if i enter a metaphor's real estate order and i want to buy up a whole block like that has a different value to me versus [Music] to somebody else this changes the value of these things drastically for me i don't know but if i do and i'm just renting it then that adds value to me a bit because i can monetize it and rent it out but to somebody that doesn't want to rent it doesn't diminish the value because then the guys rented it to come to the party so all of these additional utilities also the impact pricing consistently began in these all have varying levels of liquidity and pricing even though a transaction happens more infrequently than probably most of the workers yeah i mean perfect liquidity in project price discovery it would be the whole grain of all markets right it's going to have to be different depending on what s7 is right in the future where you know nft it's actually a roll up 5 000 other nfts and 25 of them are priced by or rated by foodies and some of them are made by moody's 2050 or whatever the next video like upshot is you know that his headshot involves stuff that you know it's going to replace those dinosaurs like that we're going to have so many different pricing mechanisms and hopefully it will be octane rhythmic and much more efficient and people have things like you know 2008 happening because actually it's more transparent let's suppose we'll have inside 10 different layers of this thing but yes price discovery would be great i think we need a whole bunch of effort uh in each particular asset class how to do it standards will evolve to the point hopefully better than we have in the normal system as well i want to bring up the topic of community here because i think if there's one thing that we've learned that's a universal truth with crypto if it doesn't have a community it's not going to make it and one of the reasons probably why punk's mating through the bear market was that because the discord was a fun place to be in the bear market as a shared place of absorbing all the pain with downward prices for two years uh so i want to talk about like maybe combine nfts and d5 how can that be a tool for a community generation how can that be a community yeah i think you've seen some really really cool stuff recently with just random groups of people raising funds to buy stuff between like constitution now and now we have the free roster which is really exciting you know while raising funds to christina now isn't like explicitly defined it starts to really walk into that territory um i think in general the ability for communities that are built around your nft's different groups to also turn it into like this monetary tool where they're able to build their own micro economies and do all this stuff inside of their shared interests it's just like really really interesting and exciting i think it has the potential also because a lot of people who like otherwise cannot do this in either country they live in or different assets that they're alone and all that um so yeah i feel like we're gonna continue to see a fund more of these just random is thinking about the implications of like what you can do with energies in community building like just supposed to take this in the music industry for a second like being able to track your fan base and their interactions with your work with your entities with your music with your concerts all on chains suddenly you have like a way more personalized way of like communicating with these bands figuring out who they are what they're doing that has so much value suddenly not only to every single output of like a creator's entire world but also value to that community and being a part of it and having these like energy passports and something that brings you into this world um nfwb like to say that like access is better than value like what what rules are you unlocking um with these entities uh i've been going around the idea of starting like an activism town for puerto rico and using nfts as a way to have fun for specific initiatives i guess like yeah right i mean like honestly just the ngos like oh wow they kept going like the nmt is such a more accessible entry point for most people it's such a beautiful way to rally people behind the calls it could be energy can be intuitive it can be hard to do whatever it is but it is a unifying limited asset and at the end of the day that that is essentially a community everybody can't deny that we'll talk more about that later yeah definitely i mean humans are social creatures and this kind of virtual world is something well then we're living in it's nice to have this share different that sense of community and we all have this pfp and that makes us unique we're all popping this token and athletic brings us together where we have a group chat that spins on its own like structure and we're all part of this together so i think a green in general really allows communities to be much more so distributed in all these unique fun ways um but then length nfts and d5 what we're doing is you can and then especially maybe that interest equates to something within the discord because you just take so much money into recording like you're never going to have so much money into your game it gives you a little extra so i think something has happened it's pretty remarkable over the last few years which is converging in this like concept of sociality and brands and and financial assets and i think it's a generational thing and you know if you look at the way that teenagers behave versus the way that my parents generation behaves for instance um financial financial interaction is a lot more like something that you care about online quicken obviously you know an example look at gamestop and the community around overriding right there's something democratizing happening and there's something that is sort of not going to make it we don't have beauty energy around them but like brands are realizing this right now brandon there's a reason why brands people work for rants are all over the events like that because they realize that if you're if you're an asset or you're a problem whenever you don't have that social health into it it wasn't possible before because we give them the social media to to be the administrative player of them you didn't have the ability to connect in that way maybe you go once a year to ceremonies your buddy from the club or whatever but now you've talked to people every day all day those things merge into what is an asset class how much do i care about this asset i think as human minds evolve with uh you know with phones in hand in those communities around them blur what is the community what's the asset that's what we're seeing right now is increasingly important i got i have one last thing to say especially especially for artists like i think i think something is missing from this conversation is like how an artist can incentivize secondary market action through their entity collection i think i think every artist should take a look at like the og crystals collection that you know that first mint this tiny little geode and then programmatically inside the smart contract every time every time it resells like another piece of that crystal grows out of it and suddenly like those would be more and more valuable and that floor crystal is suddenly more and more valuable and that encouraged me so that like people but it does have to do with like incentivized finance incentivized sales something that any artist can do get creative with your smart contracts contact the full facility that you know and use that creative problem solving minds and play with it because there's so much potential beyond just like minting the piece you made last year like this is this is a new playground there are a lot of agents and d fibros here but getting artists american musicians in here and tackling that landscape which is the contract itself i think is where we're going to see like a nice genesis of these incredible financial tools that are beyond us trying to retrofit energies into into d5 protocols instead of building it into contact itself so go in there and send them within second areas [Applause] well this conversation has been extremely engrossing and i actually have know how much time we have left so i'm just going to keep on going because someone stops me um so there's been a lot of use cases a lot of potential that i think there's a ton of fun here and i think we have too much fun regulators come uh and so uh let's start with sam and work our way backwards uh while i would what about the regulatory clarity of the lack of clarity is kind of holding back the intersection of nft fractionalization or the simply seeking out of defined entities uh what what is about the sec or cftc relevant to this conversation and what's perhaps going to be used as an industry to really help the most industry go forward well tough question um so i think what's relevant to answer that part of the question is there are two approaches that regulators seem to have sort of like what's going on the industry there's either music amounts of laws that were written in the 1930s and try to apply it to what we're doing now or and sometimes that doesn't make sense actually something's clearly or if you look at these properties what we're doing is something to do there's always going to be attention between those things and the definitions are shifting around too a pump seems like a piece of part pretty sure it's going to be treated like a piece of art do um so it's a blurry line i think that's the extent that reagan leaders will provide clarity is the extent to which you know the united states or whatever jurisdiction talking about can excel in that domain if you look at the history of like consensus for instance and you know at the beginning of ethereum there's a reason why a lot of it was in jurisdictions that uh you know understood the technology right so to the extent that our uh our regulatory bodies to understand technology and look at it really closely at least the extent in which your jurisdiction as a regulator uh is going to excel so i hope that you do that yeah i would just give them um 1930s 1940s i mean down issues and even though i'm a big fan like i don't believe in these nations but like they do and they're real and now and between that these are real issues for a long long time so even though like i've innovators um today to like find a lawyer and just work with these this is like an evolving shifting sitting on the regulatory unknowns right now but like you can do things in a more structured elevated way and kind of change yourself a little bit but the key is like if you're operating within the situation you are taking a little bit of some amount so you have to know where that lightness is oh where is your ring here killing right now the ones that can only find the right language to say what you want to do even for afternoon high degrees that it's uncharted territory it would be scary but slowly but surely society's catching up i think we're slowly figuring out like what this is all about we're extremely here what should be in this room and have some sort of submission is most people in regulation have no idea what's going on they're like bitcoin this is all some sort of bitcoin isn't it it's absolutely not um so there are many possibilities out there for listening to this podcast educate your peers because as much as as much as we might like to keep the playground for ourselves the conservatives are getting out of control and we can't do this in the shadows anymore and it's better to have people understand in their working on these regulations than all of us desperately clarity and a lot of um um a lot of stuff with nfts and conversations around maps and you know token missions and stuff uh it's so new and so unknown i feel a lot to me like in 2017 it's a very frustrating thing but like i also understand the regulatory bodies that are doing stuff are all so big and there's some resources but they're not all like crypto nurses incredible teams we can't expect them to like see some weird new wolf game project that comes out and maybe actually you guys that's all right guys last question uh let's uh think about something that you personally would love to use in the intersection of d5 and look on nfts if you want to lend out your pump you want to vibrate something i don't know but what use case could be built but it's not built yet that you are looking forward to that will actually improve your personal thoughts i really want to use a blending some called like a meteor down style sometimes uh that is like basically the vacuum change before the price uh particular like profile picture project or you can basically borrow against that sort of things imagination [Music] uh i'd like to see somebody use charge miracles to create a virtual geocaching so you have that in a tv you put a motion interest in it whoever finds it first just collects the interest and you can sacrifice the principle it's a cool way to engage i would like to have a way to uh build essentially like a reit of the metaphors and have it being run by really awesome people i've been interested awesome thank you guys so much [Applause] hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right
