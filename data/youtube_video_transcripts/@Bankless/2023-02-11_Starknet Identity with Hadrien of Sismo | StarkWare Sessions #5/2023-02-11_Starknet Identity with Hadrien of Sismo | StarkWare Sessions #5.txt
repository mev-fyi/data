welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless's darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this interview we are talking to sismo and sismo is an identity tooling set to help express your identity across all of your ethereum addresses sizmo lets you connect all of your ethereum addresses whether you have your board Apes in one address your crypto punks and another address or your governance tokens and a third address sismo lets you prove what you have in your wallet or what you've done in your wallet to some sort of third party some sort of web app some anything that's trying to access your identity but it lets you keep yourself private in the process so say for example you are trying to get into this party that is token gated by board Apes but you don't want to dox your address to that website sismo allows you to do a ZK proof of the state of your address to prove to anyone about the credentials that you might have in that wallet without having to dox your wallets and it's also useful for combining all of your identities across all of your wallets that you may use so that you can express all of the access that you have across all of your wallets all at once without having to dox these things together the use cases for this are endless and so we go into all of these details and more in this interview with sismo but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place Arboretum just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps feds can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 fees by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite D5 apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every layer too and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to spam both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview welcome back to the station back to the starkware sessions we are on day two and I have completely lost my voice talking to everyone here over at Tel Aviv Israel today and right now we're talking with Adrian from the sismo team Adrian welcome yeah thanks thanks it's gonna be great yeah how's your conference going so far how's day two all right it's going really great here a lot of good stuff are happening a lot of DK people so for a team like us that are doing ZK it's it's always great yeah so uh we're of course going to talk about sismo and I want you I want to uh see if you can explain sismo in a sentence but then we're going to talk about Stark net and then we'll go back to sisma yeah so sismo utilize uses GK proof so that you can selectively reveal the stuff from your wallet so let's say that you have a big wallet with many many data we're using ZK proof so that you can just take a piece of it and we tokenize it as an SBT so let's say that you have a wallet with like many nfts D5 stuff like that you can just pick one data one nft and you get a solvent token on another address that is Virgin that is empty that just proved that you own this NFC so by doing this you have chosen a piece of data and you can use this new address to connect on applications and to yeah just bring the data you want basically and this is of course an identity conversation uh to help like Express who we are but also keep ourselves private right exactly yeah it comes from the fact that I think that in real life you always choose depending on the context what you bring to the what what part of your identity you bring so like co-workers party you don't bring the same identity that's in your co-working space right and so it's a bit similar with this one what you're trying to do is that from your so rain data from your wallet or even other webto accounts you can exactly choose what you want to reveal when connecting to an app okay so I want to ask you about how you ended up over overall in this darknet ecosystem how do you get started was it with the Stark X or or Stark net like how did you get started and why did you pick the stock net ecosystem yeah so I think that so just to be 100 clear we're not yet deployed there we want to just to give instance of what system is like users in their front end they didn't generate ZK proofs like that I have a certain energy and then we need to verify it and this is more allows you to verify it on chain on ethereum and evm chains but also of chain like a server can just check the proof and we plan to deploy on sarknet to verify in Cairo so so that's we're not live yet yet but my I'm a good friend with like a lot of people that have been in the zika space for quite some time I was working at Avi and we worked with them on on on bringing Ave to there so yeah like a lot of friends in common but not yet like fully deployed there is there something uh specific about starkness technology that is uh conducive to what you're working on in sismo or can you also do this on well I'm assuming you could do this on layer one but that'll probably be really expensive uh what about other layer twos and then why did you overall pick starknet yeah so uh I guess that's system is a bit like we're not defined by blockchain what we do is a bit option we generate proofs and you can verify it anywhere so any blockchain can be a substrate for now we have many on EVMS so we are on on mainnet polygon diagnosis will soon be on another chance like optimisms and like Leo tools and slugnet so we are really chain agnostic basically ah so you actually you actually don't need block space do you you don't need to consume black space to produce a proof exactly but okay yeah we make it available on chain for two reasons first so that smart contracts can use it right and the other thing that is important I think is like the SBT Parts is that it's the standard that is well used even by option applications so by putting in our chain it makes it the proof the attestations it's usable uh it's composed by like snapshot Guild like all the tools that are talking gated basically sure okay how did you come up with the name sismo actually it it comes from the fact that you know seismology it's like signal uh science and so how good is that from all the noise that you have on your wallets you pick one and you reveal just this one okay so let's talk about how this is um conducive to Identity and I watched you give a talk this morning and you of course use the example and this is a frequent example using the web 3 world of huge big kids that pick and choose parts of your identity in the moment that they are relevant to the context that we want to talk about can you elaborate on this and then talk about how sizmo enables this yeah so so again we out there this is that there's going to be more and more Sovereign data that you own on gig on your wallets and then how now that you own your Social Capital that's not the case in web 2 in web 2 like your data is on Twitter Facebook LinkedIn and then don't let you do anything with it like it's impossible to create an event when you invite your Facebook and Twitter and Linkedin friends because they are so competitive on their data it's not yours it won't be shared like Twitter API is not payable so okay so now that you have like which is now that you have several wallet civil identity your Prof like your Dao identity your private wallet your ens now it's yours you can leverage it together but let's say that you want to prove your total amount of it let's say that you have three wallets with 500 if all right you're lucky then then you're lucky if you have that let's imagine that you can dream you could potentially prove that you have more than one thousand meter without creating any link between your wallets so that's where systems it it's like for now we allow you to granularly reveal part of your wallet per wallet and soon we'll do also this on an aggregated version meaning that you import in system world like all your wallets for now you can now start generating GK proof from any any of them and soon you'll be able to prove anything from the aggregated data that you have on all your wallets without creating links with them so the users is the only one that has the aggregated view and the users can the user can bring exactly what they need or wants to the app okay and so one important Nuance that I want to pull out here is like say I have three wallets I've got my nft wallet and my personally my nft wallet is also David Hoffman buddies and so it's also where I have my ens name and this is my public wallet it's my Flex wallet you know I also have my D5 wallet don't look at that one like that's mine uh and then maybe there's like another wallet out there that's my gaming wallet or something and so the idea is that you can use sisma to take out all the properties you want from any wallet and use and the point is to not be able to link them together so I can express what I want from each of these wallets but the important I want to drive is like maybe there's an app that is asking you about some data that you want to provide but you don't want to link these wallets together you also don't need to link any wallet to that app right because you don't need to the app isn't asking for your wallet it's just asking for perhaps a proof so it's not only about not linking the wallets together it's also not about showing the wallet in the first place right definitely yeah that's exactly this like what we do allow you to do is the app will yeah we're trying to fight against the sign in with ethereum version one we love it of course like you can connect with your as you said you're in s word it's a signal wallets everything that is here is public so you can share it you know that it's yeah but now let's say that you want to leverage your social capital from your private wallet right you don't want to share it so yeah we'll have this privacy smooth button basically that you can embed in any app and it's it's a sort of competitor but not really to sign in with ethereum but basically by clicking this button it's redirect to system where you generate your ZK proof and then you back to the app and the app just knows okay you have a board app or you have anything so yeah that's so you said not could be competitive with uh signing with ethereum but also could not be uh we recently did a podcast with um uh with uh Duane from uh Wayne from signing with ethereum and we call we talked about these things called Data vaults couldn't a sismo ZK proof be something that goes into like designing with ethereum datavault as in like you can create that proof and then have that available to you exactly that's what first we are not competitors because we can just enhance sign in with ethereum apps let's say you connect to I know like Finland you know feeling yeah they are doing like uh from your history you have a city or stuff like that and so you're already logged in with your what is your public but what if you want to import data from your private wallet you could use this mode from it so it's not competitor like you can just use it to boost like just you bring the data that you want right um I was actually in the in the in the filing a feeling Discord saying like hey uh I just logged in with ethereum to do my my stuff but you guys should use the ZK proofs to do this I was in the Discord so like telling them and then of course this is this is exactly what you're doing yeah that's that's our goal and generally like I think what thing that is interesting is let's say that you want to create a newsletter for ethereum stakers and you want to verify that they are all ethereum Seekers you don't want the address yeah of course you don't want it so this is it will be a very simple app you'll just have a previous mode you redirect it to this more you'll prove that you will take care then you get access to the email newsletter we also did something I don't know if you've seen this but with the foundation the merger pass it's an nft that gives access to conferences and basically uh I think the foundation computed the the list of the 130 contributors to the merge and to get the nft instead of just you know there's a white list and instead of just giving the wallet to get the nft they use this more to generate the GK proof that they were part of the white list without relaying so this was the ZK drop uh first app that uses this provisional flow so is there a conversation to be had here about um websites or companies or projects collecting user data because uh perhaps with like gdpr requirements they don't want to have you don't want to be receiving too much data that you don't need and so maybe like from the user perspective I might only want to give you a ZK proof to protect my privacy but from the company perspective I might only want to receive certain data because I don't want the rest of that data is there a conversation here as well yeah exactly so first like I think like like companies like Ledger they don't want the addresses but they want to do some loyalty programs so it's outside of gdpr but now we've been talking with Ariana it's a project that does that lets big Brands like lvms like Louis Vuitton stuff like that to tokenize their bags and they want to tokenize the bags so that they can have a relationship with their customers but gdpr and so they need a privacy layout they need to be able not to be they need to not be able to track their users so they're talking with us and see smoke would be like a gdpr compliance layer for this loyalty programs or supply chain stuff okay so uh question for you say uh there's a party that you need a board ape to get into and uh I don't have a board eight can I go to my friend who does have a board ape and I can get him to make a ZK proof of his board ape and then sell it to me and then would that work no no basically no but I just wanted to be sure to have the right answer but so the way it was that you would create a SBT of your board app ownership first in our current process you need to prove ownership of both the source that is eligible the owner of the board app and the destination so okay so that's our if you need if you want him to create the GK proof you need to give him also the private address of your real address so that won't work okay and then we have a nice property on our sbts they are actually more account bound meaning that your SBT all there if you will lose the address or if you you will sell it to someone you always have the opportunity by recreating your ZK proof of ownership of the source to burn and remains so it's this is It's it won't I'm sure you can find a way to give your private address to a friend but you won't be able to create a market of it because there's always the incentive I can get it back okay so so just uh check my understanding I can make a ZK proof of an nft that I have and I can give that to a friend but that friend doesn't have any assurances that I didn't do that again and again and again and like kind of ruin ruin the marketplace yeah so I wasn't precise enough like the zika proof is like first you have the nft right and then you own the destination address that will have the SBT okay so you need to have actually get proof you need to have both addressed at the same time so your friends address and yours so you won't give your private key to your friends uh okay so the only thing you can do is mint on the destination of yours then give the private key to your friend sure and then you always have the opportunity to brand and women's Okay so yes okay so I can make a ZK proof of my NFC and I have to also use a private key of a destination address for where the soul bound token goes but I can give that to my friend and then but then the again the friend doesn't really have any assurances that I don't do this multiple times okay yeah exactly but I could still get into the party though because I can still give it to my friend yeah that's that's the version that we released today but tomorrow like as soon as so we have this big thing of HCC big like the conference in Paris we have this masquerade it's a privacy preserving party and so to get in it's gonna be this okay but then what's great is that you won't be able the ZK proof will be off chain it will be on a one-time thing so when you present to the events you need to create the GK proof on your mobile app prove directly that you have the punch and then you access like it's on go you cannot unless you share your value to your friends you won't be able to do that sure okay uh we talked about so the soul bound token goes in the destination address I think we might have skipped over that part of the conversation can you talk about the role of the showbound token in the system ecosystem yeah so so let's start again with DK proof so I do as you can prove that I have an eligible account for a specific batch I'm part of the group of yeah you're in the club yeah I'm in the club I have a body I'm part of it I created proof then from this game proof we can use it all option like uh option services does that because can just check it no SBT involved or we send the GK proof Unchained to what we call a zika tester it's a smart contract that verify using a proof it's valid so it checks you have an eligible Source it checks also that you own the destination so it verified this UK proof and then it means the SBT on your destination and third is stores what we call a nullifier is the fact that to make sure that you won't be able to use the same Source twice to get two badges so One Source One batch okay so when you come to like the road map of sismo how how does this thing get started like what what is the first sort of ZK proofs that you guys generate like how does how does this play out in the future yeah so so today we have these svgs they are starting to be used to get some like I think of ZK pay that is a project on Aztec that Gates their Community to people that have been using um Aztec there are a lot of there's there are also a lot of personal tokens like in the system factory factory that system.io you can easily create a ziki badge like click click like a no code UI Suzuki badge for all your lens followers for instance so we have this I think it's it's great but uh I mean it is great but we're trying to aim wider meaning we want to really help application Developers to gate their services to specific users without getting their wallets that's what we were saying about so we'll we'll go to the market with the previous system button that is easy to integrate basically step one you choose your gate like I want to get to service to My Lens followers or people that follow vitalik I don't know then you you get all the you get the button to integrate in your front end and then all the solidity Library if you want it to be isbt or enough Channel uh package to verify the GK proof anyway yeah so uh for the listeners that are listening right now we have a lot of lens users and forecasters users in the backless nation is that probably where they might run into sismo first exactly yeah yeah that's stuck yeah we yeah forecasters lens the they are actors within the system ecosystem on two sides first they are sovereign graphs right so you can prove stuff from your forecaster I can prove that I follow you on pakista I can prove that for you on ends and then they can integrate system to do specific stuff like follow me only if you prove me that you are part of the proof of humanity registry sure and so on the two sides I think like we're building infrastructure for this kind of people like that's that's our Focus we want to onboard civil resistant teams that build these groups like anyway yeah yeah we're building for them very very cool uh if people want to start experimenting or just read more about sisma where should they go yeah we're trying to to keep the dock updated like a lot so it's always an iteration process so go to docs.io and create your first DK version factory.cism.io it's a very simple app you choose your group of eligible accounts from like you can say like my Snapshot voters people that follow me on lens like uh you can use yeah many things you see like sub graph like many things so you can create your ZK badge you choose the metadata and it's live so that's the thing that you can do today and and keep updated like within the next two months we'll release like this Dev tooling the previous system button that will be so exciting I think because I'm looking forward to it uh what's the website and any other social medias that you want people to follow yeah so it's sismo underscore is that's the Twitter that's the main Landing with the docs like the website is yeah the Ducks is our main Landing I would say that is awesome Adrian uh for the rest of your time here in Tel Aviv and at the Starcraft sessions uh what's what's exciting to you what talks have you liked what have you enjoyed who have you talked to anything that stand out to you so far yeah so it was actually one of my first stock net conferences and the I met so many people working on GK stocks I'm more like a zika snack guy yeah so like uh I don't know what that means but I love it that's what I meant like like crazy uh crazy amount of people that just blew my mind like yesterday I was an event and wow like the community is Big because I thought that I knew a lot of smarts and great people on GK and like it's twice the size actually so it's I think like it's just getting started like all these sticky stuff and uh yeah the crowd is amazing I I sincerely advise you to go this kind of conferences like uh it's a Salesman team going to be at East Denver we're not this time we have to shift what I told you about like two months of Sprints and then we'll go like many hackathons okay until next city here's the big one HTC is the big one and you we have our big party so yeah we're gonna be all in on NCC and before that we'll go at each photo is dumb and another uh we'll do a lot of hackathon so always happy to help you guys uh get started with this one Adrian thank you so much yeah thanks a lot for the inventation cheers foreign [Music]
