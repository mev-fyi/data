please rate and review it makes such a difference for us so i really appreciate it and let's dive in so solana ecosystem news and things happening i feel like utes to god's that whole uh that drop or that wait list was like the the a big deal this week uh did we you're on the waitlist i have have made it onto yout's list this is my celeb moment so two seconds of fame for me uh it's really interesting i mean so the the whole project is i think kind of like a case study in some ways so um they originally started and they had this like quote quote-unquote as they call it [ __ ] tax for people who listed below the floor that wasn't received super well but they had a really strong core community they decided to just kind of start from scratch so they overhauled all of the art they created this staking system where you could train your d god for your dead god and it worked right it really brought it back to life and i mean nft nyc they were huge like they were all over the place people were going from eath over to seoul specifically to join this community and they launched their dust token as part of that staking endeavor and it's actually done pretty well and as part of that they created dust labs which basically pulls out a bunch of tools for communities projects that you know to use in their native dust tokens so driving some demand for that as well and then most recently they have now launched um youth's list which you've probably if you've been on twitter you've seen these images coming out all over the place it's actually like a rebranded version of their next-gen collection which was supposed to be called duppies which they kind of gave up on decided to pivot went to ut's list and it's just like absolutely exploded i mean carly are you on ut's list no i the last night that you could like submit or apply cause it was like an application process to get on i i was sort of like i was intending to do it and then i got distracted and i didn't do it like i was on some chats that were blowing up being like last night for to apply for youth list and i was like um i'll catch them next time i i have not gone deep enough into into the soul ecosystem and i also right now i'm like i don't know maybe it's good for me to be able to actually be objective about stuff yeah i'm not a bag holder of things and i can like objectively look at things and what do you think do you have a sense of like what has made the community so strong i know these things are always so hard to like really quantify but i think they just really leaned into a strong clear brand right and so everyone who's in that community is really closely aligned with the brand they have some cute culture things like their shoei which is drinking out of a shoe that they've really embraced like during their nft nyc party they had an ice luge that was a shoe that people were taking shots out of and i think that they've just created a really fun home base for people in crypto and that matters right now people really care about that and then on top of that they execute really well right and so you have people that are in it for the culture that are sticking around you have it you have people who are here for business acumen reasons sticking around and i mean that's kind of the magic sauce it strikes me that they are just like pure hustlers like that that's the sense i get like they put out these videos where they're clearly running around getting videos of gary vee like getting video you know like getting these celebrities on board like doing what they can to kind of hustle in that way you kind of highlighted this in a couple moments like they've pivoted a couple times in ways that just feel like true hustler style of like this isn't working okay like let's let's try something else like we're gonna go and get it and get it popping and that's sort of the vibes i get uh you know from top to bottom from that whole group that's what they say like a bunch of them in their threads have said you know we build our way out of problems and i think that that matters in this space at the end of the day you know everyone's going to encounter difficulties and the teams that have staying power are the teams that are able to build their way out so you're on you list what does this mean in terms of like actually getting a ute like do we have a timeline on all of that yeah it's coming soon in the next couple of days i wonder if them you know they recently all basically got kicked or suspended from twitter so i'm wondering if that would happen and we don't know why that is i was trying to find this unclear they're saying i mean an attack from internal to tip twitter i think that was mostly a joke like i think that's a conspiracy theory joke but i mean maybe who knows these days um they they did a really great job with this right so you applied i don't know if you went oh you didn't go through the application process but to walk somebody through who did you go on you connect your your wallet like if you use phantom for example you connect your phantom wallet you connect your twitter um you uh give them some information about yourself like what are you building what are you working on or what type of profile are you what do you do in this space and you answer questions like about what's the biggest problem in the nft ecosystem how do you think we should solve it and their team reviewed these and i'm sure they had some type of like decision making rubric or maybe they just were all vibes on this but they reviewed it and then i found a really good cross section right of people who are building people are influencers people have small accounts but have really been hustling and grinding um and just started posting them all over the place and giving you know these little images that say like congrats you're on youtube the person celebrities like there's a bunch of famous people a bunch of fake ones i don't know if the howie mendel video was real but if it is that's like so cool love deal or no deal um and they did a great job but i think a lot of people were confused on how to transition you know into dust to have the token in their wallet to be able to mint they did i think a pretty good job like you just connect your wallet and then at the bottom it just says do you want to transition your soul into dust and you click yes um so it's relatively easy but i think that was a stumbling block for a lot of people and now we just wait and see there's also something with this ute store can you get us read up on on all that's happening there yeah so this is i think everyone's just caught up in the marketing hype right now where they're like i want to be on youtube and they don't even know why but if you go onto their website in the bottom i think it's the bottom left they have what they're calling a y paper you know pun on white paper you can read all about what they're planning on doing and so they the y paper basically covers how they're going to have y tokens or y's which is basically their version of like a common sense copyright and they'll create a ute store where artists or you and i if we decide to develop some artistic talents could create like derivative traits of sorts so you know we could create instead of my utes wearing a normal white t-shirt it could be an overpriced jpegs t-shirt i could then use my y tokens to take the overpriced jpegs t-shirt and put it on and customize my utes the nice thing about that is if you launch that and you create this sub community you can then get royalties from those traits you can sell the y or like the copyright for that derivative trait to somebody else and you start aggregating these y tokens over time for holding a utes which is really interesting to me i think the the difficulty here is the whole essence of this is based on people caring deeply about dressing up their profile pictures and whether i mean we're all trying to figure that out right is the pfp trend over is it a dip is this a blip on the way down is it coming back up as we get more into the metaverse are we going to continue to care about our digital identity and our digital ownership and wearables the things that we have if so this could be incredible if not i think that um you know people might end up feeling like this is just like a little bit of a shell project so it'll be really interesting to see how consumer behavior reacts to the youth store and all the things that they have planned rolling out um we've seen like a spring tea what are those what are those like websites where you can go on and like make your custom thing it's it's that exactly yeah i mean etsy or shopify but right and so for example in you know the lazy lions community the lazy hat community is super super strong and if they were able to monetize that then the community itself would then have kind of almost like a community sub-wallet where they can keep their community afloat aside from the lazy lions community they can really like start funding and driving a sub community which meaningfully helps floor price and the overall project but it kind of democratizes the ownership and responsibility for doing that across the individuals who own that specific trait so it's all very very interesting i almost wish it were happening like four or five months ago uh but it's great that it's happening now it's interesting that it's on solana and a lot of people from the youth community have been brought over so yeah i mean if it can thrive now that's wildly bullish you know if it gets activity and really uh you know you have a lot of people participating in this i think that's super bullish for for the long term because we obviously are in the the less active part of this cycle it's also continued use case for dust which is the this is what i was going to ask i was actually going to ask you the difference between why token and dust and how those two interact i i'm not 100 sure i think you probably can use dust to buy y token they don't get into the intricacies of it in their white paper and they also mention like this is really just top-level thinking and we'll get into the details and like operational logistics later on um but i mean that's part of the thing right now is dust has been going up up up up up like so i mean like exponential curve it's down a little bit totally but the which is why people are thinking okay is is the price is are we kind of priced in right now because in most you know let's use an eth example because i think most of us are familiar with that um between mint and reveal you have this pre-reveal phase where people are like so hyped right and it's going up up up up you're selling selling selling buying buying buying everything's crazy then reveal happens and things go down is that going to be what we're seeing right now with dust where people are buying so much dust because they want to mint or they want to get useless and then i think in the next couple of days when minting actually happens it'll be interesting to see um you know are there tons of people who bought dust but didn't get useless and then have no use case for it on the flip side are there a bunch of people who got youthless and did not yet get their dust and so they're going to need to buy in order to mint their their ute i don't know where it's going to fall but it'll be really interesting to see i think some of the market dynamics play out with the cost of dust interesting that does make me a little bit fomo i'm like i should have just done it like how you know it would have been kind of fun to go through that application process and then see like you know do you make the cut i mean it's incredibly savvy marketing too because of course ifomo because it does feel like scarce and exclusive and merit-based and like all these things that it you know merit-based it may or may not have been but at least they're proclaiming it was um and that's pretty cool um the other solano project that you really brought to my attention is abc abracadabra um yeah give us give us the breakdown there too i think this one is so interesting um people are likening it to goblin town but i think it's completely different so basically um if you're familiar with nine by nine nine or h g e on seoul yeah or huge some people say basically has a solana influencer account in the nft ecosystem and a eth influencer account so nine by nine by nine is like a known eath influencer you know i kind of became aware of him because he was the one who really like brought down budgie penguins and pointed in a positive way like he was a pudgy penguin holder and was trying to buy the project and then realized there was no money in the treasury and that the original founders had run away with all the money so he really like was sort of the whistleblower on all of that and it was already pretty popular up to that point but i feel like that also really like introduced him to a whole new group of people and then his sole identity is hge so he's like a different identity for his like solana personhood is that that's what's going on absolutely i mean that's my understanding of it i could be completely off but that's what i that's what i've heard um and so he created this abc or abracadabra project kind of like stealth mode a little bit it's these fun drawings they literally look like they were drawn by a 10 year old maybe even younger i clearly am not up to date on my child developmental stages um but the whole point is that they're made to remind you of how fun things were when we were kids like before growing up and just to continue having fun and they're really cute um but it's uh no discord no team no twitter no royalties project he minted all of them and then people just just started buying them up so i mean when we checked yesterday they were number one on magic eden number four on open c they've done like 122 or maybe even more now at this point uh k in seoul so like four million in volume for just something that was fun right but the interesting thing is people are really considering this to be kind of like a trojan horse project like they think this is going to be part of something that's that's bigger for him oh interesting is there is there like what are there crumbs to suggest that or is this just people wanting to see things because it's a bear market at first i think it was people wanting to see things because it's a bear market but of course you know anything that he does is part of a bigger picture it's not just for funsies um although that's the whole vibe here but um what they're thinking and again i'm not 100 sure on this is he tweeted out a hint that was this one of their characters basically like hanging upside down um with the letters posida p-a-w-s-e-d-a-h at the bottom and was like can you figure it out and of course hanging upside down backwards people just reversed it and it spells hate swap which is actually a real product that he has been working on so it's an automated market maker for nfts um which is very interesting you basically can create calls so like buy or sell um or both set rules for when you want to make your trades um but you put the crypto in up front to fund those trades so it kind of acts as like a liquidity pool for the projects you're interested in supporting which is interesting that's really interesting yeah i mean it he really is one of the few people that could probably make something like this happen um and then people are thinking that the fees that are aggregated and pulled from hate swap will be distributed back to abc holders in some way shape or form so like that's where people are thinking there might be some utility he of course has gone out of his way to say no utility if you're buying this as a speculative investment don't um but you know people think it's really interesting and then he tweeted recently saying coming shortly like clear documentation and how to's that'll highlight the role of abc nfts in hate swap so okay so there is so he has now confirmed that there's going to be some connection between those two very interesting and he he started open dao which again i remember being a thing back during that whole pudgy penguins sort of saga which is a marketplace and was kind of geared around like when one of the peaks of people just being frustrated with open sea and frustrated with marketplaces like him stepping in you know trying to do the marketplace thing so um yeah i i hold him in an incredibly high regard have not followed everything he's done you know closely but um i've always felt like he was a super honorable presence in the space and you just got that super authentic like builder vibe from him totally and i think that's kind of why people are are really on board with this because he he has the influencer perspective going on he himself is a market maker and he's not only building tools but also community so i think he has this really interesting cross-section of skills that um you know is what we need in the space right now so i'm really excited to see where this goes obviously classic fomo wish i bought one earlier so here we are of course yep absolutely um let's before we dive into the avalanche scandal again in our sort of alt eth um dive here let's just back up and and do kind of the macro picture would love to be would love to hear your perspective on sort of where the market is right now and what you're observing from a from a trend perspective so i think right now is this period of what are you building what are you doing we need to see some real work product from the project teams which totally makes sense right the euphoria bubble that we were in for a long time has popped and people are looking to see real output um i think the difficulty here is the vast majority of things that project teams are working on are bigger bets they're not things that you can roll out piecemeal and milestones and they're also not things you can talk about publicly so i think a lot of projects are struggling to find this balance of how much fluffy content posting engagement do we do while we work on these things in the background and how do we find a way to break these out into smaller chunks that we can push out and i mean we'll talk about some of these later on but i think that's a that's a problem for projects both big and small which is nice to see that it's pretty consistently applied across the ecosystem yeah well let's just let's just say what to me comes to mind when you say that and we were maybe gonna save it for later but like doodles yeah which i assume they're building and i i've been such an open fan of doodles in this podcast not a holder but just think they've executed incredibly well so i i feel pretty confident they've got amazing things going on but they are getting hell on social media for having for just being so quiet like they're not tweeting at all and it feels like the community is feeling betrayed and like they're not getting the updates at the rate which they've come to expect them or want them i think part of the problem with that is um something that i also experienced on cryptochicks right and so this is a much different project smaller in expectations and funding obviously so the type of work that we're doing is very different but the community was so angry that they weren't hearing from us regularly they don't even need it to be significant updates they just wanted it to be regular updates and i think that's what we're seeing from a lot of the dialogue right now on doodles is people are saying it's fine if you're back there building in the background but you need to be present right like we need to see you and hear from you there were some people who were tweeting like do they even still work on the project which is obviously like so dramatic um so i mean they're there the the problem is also people never are happy in this ecosystem right like they always want the next thing there were people at the doodles event that were livid and then came out of it having the best night of their life right but people were still mad like oh why does the doodles event and nftnyc they're bragging about how much money they have but then they charge 20 for a cocktail at the venue it was me i'm people right i'm just kidding um i'm not kidding but people will always find something to be a little bit irritated about this one's valid and i think people just want to like make sure that their feedback is heard and it feels like it's something that's relatively easy to action on they have a big enough team they have great culture so i think they should just lean into that like just do some fun fluffy things yeah i'm of two minds i think i largely agree with you on the one hand i do find the over dramatization of the silence like a little silly like an ft nyc was like a month ago or you know like it hasn't been that long it's been like a month and change since you last like saw from these people bit big things it feels like really dramatic to like tank the floor price to five with some eath or whatever like it just i'm like my god like these people are working with pharrell like they're clearly still building so so on the one hand i i feel quite eye rolling towards that behavior um on the other hand i am like you guys have a lot of money like you can't just like have an intern or something like tweet every so often like it does feel kind of silly to not it it doesn't feel like what's being asked of them here is such a lift that it can't just be done and um but i do think it actually speaks to a broader tension that i think we might see play out here which is doodles in particular i feel like has been very open about the fact that they are trying to onboard a million new users like they are they are really trying to go mainstream and you know i think it remains to be seen if a project gets escape velocity and successfully goes mainstream we don't know what that will mean for the token price i think there's this like tacit assumption that that means the token will become worth millions more or whatever that's not necessarily the case and it's certainly not like it could go mainstream and it could still take a decade for it to reach the kind of mainstream status that would make people the general public want like a collectible version of like the original collection so i i think this is something we're going to see more and more whereas projects are really focused on going wide it comes at the cost maybe of like direct benefit to their to their original holders or or it doesn't necessarily mean like a pump in original holder price the way that those original holders want um and i think this is like arguably a little bit of a precursor to some of that that we're going to see play out in the years to come for the many of these projects absolutely and i think this is part of the dichotomy of we want broader adoption but we also want to still feel like we're this special small group community that has a lot of attention and that's a really tough juxtaposition to straddle and like find the middle ground for so i don't know if it's you know like split teams where you have a community management team i think there's a lot that people can learn from on the timepieces project right with time where like they clearly run a very successful mainstream traditional media company but also have actually done a pretty good job of building a really strong community they've intentionally invested and resourced that accordingly so i think it's just a decision that that the projects and soon to be businesses and global brands will need to make and we'll see how that pans out for the doodle situation absolutely i i've been tracking really closely here something that's definitely correlated to crypto though maybe uh slightly aside from this which is the the bed bath and beyond saga and ryan cohen's involvement have you tracked any of this at all it's not directly crypto but it plays into i think what's happening in the macro market i hadn't until you wrote this down and then i was like oh i need to do some investigator work i i'm gonna have a newsletter coming out about it so so soft plug for my sub stack and you can check it out i i think ryan cohen is this like fascinating person that is in this like middling state where you have a group of people who track his like every move and he's like very famous to them and then you have a whole other group of people who actually don't realize that like their investments are somewhat impacted by ryan cohen who have no idea who this dude is um to the extent that people know him they might from from the gamestop situation that happened last at the beginning of last year i love talking about this i was like again glued to my screen uh when the game stopped run up and like short squeeze happened and melvin capital fell and it was just such a like you know i don't know microcosm of this change that's happening culture culturally in in the world and sort of among our generation and ryan cohen's at the center of that because he'd begun buying up gainstop gamestop shares um and and he ended up acquiring i think like 12 of the company has become chairman of the board and is really like pushing this shift for gamestop into the digital world specifically with nfts and they're partnered with immutable x and i i think they have really interesting things happening on that side i actually talked to robbie ferguson who's the president of imax about it on another podcast we do together so soft plug for that i suppose between two layers go check it out i won't get into all that now i do think the mainstream is like missing what's happening with gamestop like they keep being like ryan cohen hasn't actually done anything there you can't call him an activist investor because he's not even really affected change at the company their their their grand plan is some like lame nft wallet and like no no the grand plan there is actually a lot bigger it's like porting what made gamestop such a behemoth in like the early 2000s into the digital world in in a way that involves nfts and that i actually am quite bullish on and i don't think people get that anyhow though the the reason i bring it up now is um we saw like a a pretty significant dip i think it was like you know on the order of 20 or something in um ethereum and and broader crypto on august 18th um which is the day that ryan cohen who had been buying up bed bath and beyond shares earlier this year and people were expecting like the same sort of thing that played out with gamestop to play out with bed bath and beyond because he'd acquired 10 of the company on august 18th he like dumped all of his bed bath and beyond shares um in sort of a surprise sell-off that really pissed people off but bed bath and beyond you know tanked the price went from like 29 to nine dollars in like you know a couple day period um and just super correlated to you know the you know well soft crash i'll use that lightly because it was 20 dip and we see that kind of thing in crypto but um in the crypto markets and i didn't see that many people kind of attributing these two things together but it they felt closely linked to me of like crypto and meme stocks being these two very tightly correlated asset classes and the market overall fell but it was like three percent it was at a much smaller level so anyway that's i'm sort of right now trying to dive into just like how the the macro markets move across like equities and crypto and been having a fun time just diving into into the ryan cohen world because it's um i don't know i find it fascinating i only know him from from chewie well also the game situation but i'm a dog mom and so i love chewie um but yeah it'll be very interesting to see how much these you know it continues to stay coupled with traditional equities versus like starting split off and i think we're starting to see a bit of that already yeah um yeah i know we'll track it okay let's get into the one that you and i are most excited about oh yeah which is avalanche and what the hell is going on over there uh do you want to give us the the high level overview and then i think we should go through the accusations systematically and each give our take and sort of give folks a sense of um of like each of the points sort of one by one um but like want to give the just the high level for anybody who's missed what happened here i will try i mean this is wild i feel like we're watching like a very poorly produced spy movie play out in real life yeah you know it's it's crazy okay so um this is a little bit of a web i sent carly a drawing that i made the other night we should put it online and like link to it in the in the show notes because i actually think it will be helpful for folks to see that i felt like i was like in beautiful minds i was trying to keep track of all of this hanging things on the wall you've got literally it was anyways okay so um ava labs was founded by eamon gooncir colloquially known as goon um and they in the early days worked with a lawyer named kyle roche who founded a law firm called roche friedman that is confirmed right like they know that they work together in the early days roche got a bunch of ava labs and avax which is avalanche token which has now become you know hundreds of millions of dollars worth of uh equity so that's okay makes sense um what has now come up is this mad connection web because kyle roche was recorded in private conversations saying some at best questionable at worst like illegal things um and that spun up this whole disaster there was a crypto leaks article that came out there's tons of content on twitter and now people are trying to figure out like is there nefarious intent that's going on is kyle roche and roche friedman representing ava labs by basically suing all of these other crypto um companies including like dfinity and solana um in a way that is like basically kind of i would say like a legal activity yeah so let's take this okay let's let's let's go deeper by going one by one i have a list here uh but i think you you know that obviously in from a high level crypto leaks was the first people to like break the story and it was this long article interspersed with these video clips these secret recordings of kyle roche and the wait really itself yeah let's these video clips if you have not watched them you should go look at them the article is written with a lot of sensationalism the video clips are so interesting they're clearly like hidden under somebody's jacket with like voice disguised it's wild anyway sorry carly it's totally i totally agree again i was like i was just riveted by this whole this whole thing um yeah so it's this long article interspersed with these videos and there's definitely a lot of like editorializing that's where like the corny spy novel feel vibe comes in is because this article from the jump is just like not it does not establish credibility for itself like it's you know it's like and for the first i would say i don't know a quarter of it or something i was like kind of rolling my eyes like they're they're trying to create drama where it doesn't feel like there's that much drama but as you keep going you're like oh i don't know this actually does increasingly feel like where there's smoke there's there's fire and there's clearly just like a lot of ickiness pervading this whole situation okay so let's go through this systematically so first accusation accusation it's true you just talked about it is that ava labs and kyle roche are very close and that kyle has a lot of avax do you hold any avax by the way should we say that i do disclose i do yeah i mean i should disclose i do hold some avax it's not worth a lot anymore it used to be worth a decent amount i will also give the caveat that goon was actually a professor at cornell where i went to school my boyfriend went to school he was my boyfriend's professor and advisor to their hacking club so i'm not like friends with him but can we sidebar this does does evan have thoughts on goon i mean they had a he had a great working experience with him it was in the it was you know during like 2016 when bitcoin was popping and he was going all over the news talking about crypto and i mean he just seemed like somebody who was super passionate about crypto and the change it could bring in the world so i mean we don't have anything that's like salacious or even sensational to say about him he was just a professor and a professor yeah they're part of the accusations and this is again where it feels so it's so editorialized by the article is like oh goon has this like satoshi complex where like he fancies himself like he's jealous of the founder of bitcoin and wants that kind of credit and he wants that credit because he himself did not achieve like the academic success he wanted to success he wanted to do he's never like a tenured professor he was like an assistant professor did any of that ring like true for you you're like no i mean i don't know what his professor status is i'm also not a psychologist or a psychiatrist like i can't maybe i don't know i mean he there are so many clips of him on like mainstream media news outlets talking about how great satoshi is like how great bitcoin is as an innovation so i think it's like kind of you just pick and choose like i'm sure people could make up any conspiracy theory they want about me based on some of my tweets i have no idea it could be true it could be completely false to me that one's like a lot of supposition if it almost delegitimizes everything else they put out in that article because you really have to connect like a to z rather than a to b there were a number of moments like that and then and there's been some things that have seemed to have been totally debunked like they claimed that kyle roche was funded by brad garlinghouse who runs the boys chiller which is defending ripple in the lawsuit against ripple and and this article says that brad garlinghouse uh gave like a seed investment basically to kyle roche for kyle to start his law firm and brad garlin houses come out and like not only have i not invested in kyle roach like i literally have never met the person or spoken to the person i have no idea and i like i'm inclined to believe him and be like okay again another another doc against this article so that's all to say take this all with a grain of salt um but okay so ava labs and kyle roche are very close i think clearly that's true kyle says in these videos you know coming from his mouth he lived periodically with uh kevin who's the ceo ceo of ava labs which again could be true could not be true i don't know i don't have their rent or their mortgage information totally but that is that is something that that kyle himself could be that wasn't something that the article like editorialized so yeah kyle would then himself be lying but yes totally could be true or could not be true and the one the thing that is so clear to me about them being close is like it is very easy to validate that he has now you know equity that's worth like hundreds of millions of dollars that is something that is irrefutable like i mean i guess i i haven't done the wallet digging myself so it could be refutable but it seems like something that would be really easy to disprove for me though that they're trying to draw this nefarious intent here of like it makes no sense that ava labs which had just had like 100 million dollar investment was paying him in equity instead of cash which to me is like not that really true it's not that uncommon for early days startups to prefer giving equity grants instead of pulling cash out of their bank like for example facebook early days there's this relatively known well-known story of this guy david cho who was a graffiti artist who painted facebook headquarters he was given 60 grand at the time worth of facebook stock in 2000 and then when facebook went public his equity was worth 200 million dollars when it was 38 a share okay so like you ca there are a lot of people that just get paid in equity early days and startups sometimes it pans out sometimes it doesn't so this one is to me they really hinted at this meaning that he was getting paid so much to do something super sketchy which he could have been getting paid to do something sketchy it also just is a common way that startups will function so yeah so so let's like i i totally agree with you so this idea that kyle has a ton of avax and that means like something nefarious like why did they pay him in inequity i'm totally with you it was early days and we know that kyle's been involved with ava lab since very early days they apparently shared a co-working space again this is all according to kyle himself um in video and with that being said you know kyle in video says that he is like the third largest holder like of of equity between coins and this and that which again could not be true but i'm believing him when he says that cause again that wasn't editorializing coming from this article and that did read to me like that's a lot to pay your attorney right like it does feel like there's you're probably doing something that's just beyond your kind of typical legal work if you're if you're that large of an equity holder now he was an adviser to them quote unquote in the early days again beyond just a lawyer so we'll get into that let's go there okay so the second accusation here is that kyle basically sues competitors to ava labs with a couple of intentions a i think as a side benefit it depletes their resources it distracts their teams it's obviously not good for a company to be sued and in theory that helps ava because it's their competitors that are you know having that problem um but the the two bigger kind of accusations here are he he sues their competitors to gain insider information and to get access to like solana's insides through like discovery processes if you're a lawyer is doing a company you can ask for all sorts of you know documents from that company um and there's this implication from this article that he basically passes that information to ava in some way like there's sort of this corporate espionage vibe to the whole thing of like he gets all this information from these insiders and then passes the table labs um and then and then finally that he sues these companies to put a mark on their backs for regulators and to keep regulators from going after ava after ava because he's you know guiding a horse to water kind of thing guiding regulators to look at solana to look at dfinity to look at other companies that aren't ava labs the whole is so interesting like if you're gonna for everybody listening if you were going to watch one section of videos on the novel that is the crypto leaks article watch this section of videos this is i think the most interesting one they ask him point blank like why are you he says he thinks he's one of the top 10 crypto experts in the world and they basically whoever this is in the video which we can get to later says like why do you think that and he flat out says i sue all of these companies and i get access to all of their insider information which he says in the video what he does with that i don't know it's kind of implied that part is in my mind i'm not a legal expert at best unethical um really confusing and interesting but then i think the other part of this which you brought up is that the regulator's perspective i would like to believe that that entire governmental agency is smarter than to be completely influenced by i don't even know how old kyle is like 30 at best yeah maybe i don't know you know like i would hope that he isn't able to influence things that much but maybe he is oh i totally believe he could i i think regulators have no effing idea what's going on with crypto and they don't know where no i'm i'm really serious i don't think they know where to look and i unfortunately like i i'm not not a fan of this guy but i also don't think he's an idiot and i i think it's um it's easier than we any of us would like to think to kind of manipulate regulators or or turn the knobs there if you care enough because the truth is like just so many people don't care enough so if you have like a couple actors that care really hard and are willing to kind of cross lines or at least bump up against lines like you can get a lot done uh which is unfortunate so i want to talk about this passing kind of insider information along to ava labs because this is where i think there's a lot of editorializing like you know the article itself really spells out the discovery process the piece they really get detailed like oh in the discovery process you could you can get slack communications from these companies you can get all sorts of insight from these companies um and they really imply that like kyle's definitely sort of passing this along to ava labs and i think this is where it's not entirely clear you know kyle himself certainly does not go that far he does say i've sued a lot of these i've sued like all of the companies in the space i've seen their insides so i know where the space is going and it does yeah and it does seem to me like given how close he is or he claims to be if that's to be believed like if he was literally living with the co of ava labs the idea that he wasn't giving them some level of information now the question is like is it you know how material is that info but it does feel um feels very very shady just so questionable at best yeah um now it's interesting because this is something the the like suing their competitors thing is something that both ava labs and um and kyle himself have really come out against specifically both of them have seemed to say like that ava was not happy with kyle going after solana you know and what they're they're trying to position this whole thing it's like these are two totally separate entities you know like kyle has his law firm sure he's represented me at times yes he's represented avalanche at times but like you know there's no secret pact between us whatever and in fact ava labs has you know they've come out and said like we were upset and actually it's been a point of contention between us like they went after solana kyle himself says oh yeah they actually didn't like that i was going after solana i think that there's like a truth is in the middle here scenario where that may be true actually and and and solana being such a direct competitor to avalanche like i feel like those are the two you see kind of mention side by side all the time it's it's possible that the ava labs team did feel like this would uh call attention to the relationship or like that it like would maybe look too bad on the other hand it's to me feels quite clear that he probably did go after like craig wright who um claims he was satoshi nakamoto and had a coin bitcoin sartoshi's version bsv coin um kyle sued craig and it kind of tanked the bsv token value and uh the the whistleblower here claims that when he went to kyle's office there was a picture of craig wright that goon of eva labs had given kyle to celebrate taking down craig wright so to me the truth is in the middle scenario is that ava labs has absolutely encouraged kyle to um like go after some of their competitors and has sort of celebrated that but that there may be a couple individual cases where kyle activis acted of his own accord and went after solana for example and avalanche actually felt uncomfortable with that um only because they they were so specific in both saying they didn't want him to go after solana um and they didn't really correct any of the other like surrounding narratives i think that the craig wright photo is just so interesting to me like i just have to believe that you're not stupid enough to send i mean goon specifically like you found a huge crypto and company and yet then you're going to be as petty as to send this like multi-layered profile pic picture to your competitor it's just the whole thing's like so weird i just find that so hard to believe although it could be true i have no idea i totally believe it i think these guys are arrogant sharks i these guys are very behind the scene sharks so let me add one thing and then i want you to finish without maddie but like one of the other accusations is that um rosh friedman and kyle roach were also going after the personal enemies of goon one of whom was this social media nft like commentator in turkey goons turkish who made some joke or or went after goon you know kind of personally on social media and that kyle had this this turkish guy served papers the moment he landed in miami and he had it filmed like they were suing him but they couldn't swim in turkey so he had he came to the states for some reason he came to miami for some reason and he was served papers and that kyle filmed him getting served papers and sent that video to goon and that goon watches it like once a month you know because it's so satisfying to him to watch his like personal enemy get served papers and be shocked and embarrassed and all these things and again i buy that like i i think like that just there's a picture there that i am inclined to believe because for kyle to be totally making that up just doesn't really make sense to me like you know i don't know he could be stretching the truth right so he's sitting in this for all of the videos he's sitting in what looks like a conference room they have some stuff blurred out he's clearly trying to sell himself and impress and then i mean they say that right they literally or maybe they don't say this in the article but the person who is in the video who's doing maybe he's not doing the recording but is participating in the conversation went on twitter and posted screen grabs of emails from kyle to him saying like i think we'd be really great partners so there's a very clear like sales approach going on here which i mean you genuinely you usually stretch the truth a little bit when you're trying to close a deal and so there probably is like you're saying some truth in it like maybe kyle sent that video to goon goon was like ha ha happy to see somebody who made up a lie about me is you know being held accountable i don't know again i don't know everybody's like psychological profiles here um but i think the other interesting thing is whether the question is is aval labs basically passing down an edict to kyle or like roche friedman law firm to be doing the things that they're doing right like that's the core question here it could be the fact that there's an edict there could also be the fact that roche has so much money and such a vested interest in ava being successful that he goes off and does these things on his own accord to make sure that his you know hundreds of millions of dollars of cash cow gold at the end of the rainbow continues to grow alternate viewpoint again like i'm having like six competing thoughts at once i'm like deciding where i want to go next um i totally get it i think you're right i think the the the primary takeaway here is like we can't know really anything for sure here because the people pushing these videos clearly have a very vested interest in in taking ava labs down and and clearly have it out for them and um and have sensationalized this in a way that the tapes themselves don't directly back up um we're not seeing the full tapes we're seeing snippets of them he's could be taken you know he's i'm sure taken out of context at times kyle um we also don't know how trustworthy kyle is and the things that he's even saying in the videos because he to your point is like clearly trying to impress this guy um but there's a lot about this that that like definitely stinks and um and and i think one of the things that struck me is i do buy that these two teams clearly had a pretty close relationship at least for a long time and definitely still have a close relationship and it's so striking how like they seem to try and they don't publicly ever really disclose that like there's people were pulling up past tweets of goon like tweeting about rochemon freed going after rosh friedman going after um tether and filing a lawsuit and goon had this whole tweet i'll pull it up here and like read it you know where he's saying um like talk this is a monumental thing this is a monumental lawsuit against tether-based manipulation of cryptocurrency prices the law firm behind this lawsuit is absolutely top-notch they just recently won the largest default judgment in u.s legal history for five billion dollars against you know who i don't know is that craig right uh they are crypto savvy like no other firm and they have a track record of explaining difficult concepts in the courtroom uh you know crypto twitter is like whatever the case might be and however the court court might find this outcome the suit will bring an unprecedented level of transparency to tether and that's something that everyone can agree is a good thing like things were you know now really know this information you're like oh this feels weird like this is your law firm that you've now admitted as your law firm and like you know somebody who may actually have that's the thing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of avax and ava labs equity like it's uh it's tremendous my final takeaway here oh god i was just gonna say and how funny is it that it's you know who like is this voldemort are we saying he who shall not be named it's like i know i i don't even know who he's talking about there i don't have because this was like months ago so it's from october oh it's years ago it was like october 2019 so i i guess it probably wasn't the craig wright situation because that was um that the craig wright was was much more that's even better we don't even know who we don't know who we don't

to talk with this initial litigation offering because i interestingly enough i actually worked with a a a a rose friedman lawyer on a project i was working on and it was in the midst of the craig wright thing and so they were talking about the initial legal the initial litigation offering product that they were kind of setting up um and i actually think that's kind of interesting the second thing i want to talk about is putting aside if he passed along information from these other crypto companies to ava uh in a way that like materially benefited ava and was like you know non-public material kind of disclosures like that's clearly illegal and and he should end up in jail like that's horrendous um if he was simply which he clearly seems to admit to this like simply using litigation um as a way to go after ava competitors but not illegally doing so like that's kind of business baby like it's gross but like this is like since the beginning of time like this is how companies have gotten big and succeeded like name any big company today and you will find a history of probably doing things that are not like you know nice guy things to do i i'm reading a like book on like the founding of spotify and you know uh steve jobs worked pretty hard to block spotify at every turn from being able to come to the united states and lean on all sorts of like music industry executives like you know you know a little bit all's fair in love and war and uh but but i think that you know these accusations of taking things uh uh a step further than that is is pretty damning um and then the last thing is something you and i were joking about which is like just the tenor of these videos themselves are so cringy where at one point the person yeah and well the others that and then the person talking to kyle is saying um is trying to get him to admit something i i can't even remember the context of it um and oh it's how much avax does he hold like how much like what how much money did he basically make off this and kyle's sort of like i don't know if i can say like kind of demurring and and the guy literally says like we're your friends here you you should tell us we're your friends here and i'm literally sitting there being like what the [ __ ] are you doing like if if somebody's being like where are your friends here like they're not your friends like that is it was the most bizarre like obviously this guy's like interrogating you for information like and then and then kyle does it he kind of gives up more information and i was just like this is so uncomfortable because this guy sounds like a shady super villain trying to get you to disclose information you don't want to disclose how seriously if somebody even asked me three out of the at least 57 questions that we saw the hidden camera person asked him i would have been like this is questionable like i'm gonna take a beat even if you're trying to sell to them it's wild so i mean whether he did something illegal or not i think there's definitely some unethical activity going on here that the bar is absolutely gonna look at so it's funny for him saying i put a target on everyone else's back because you he really just put a target on his own back um he's i mean the bar is gonna look at this and i would not be surprised if even if he's not in jail he's disbarred but then on top of that it's like any person who's looking for counsel who sees these videos is gonna be like oh my god he could not even pick up on the fact that these people were clearly trying to get a ton of info from him i don't want him to be my lawyer so even if he's not in jail and not disbarred i don't know what the success of his legal career is going to look like moving forward yeah the only thing i can think is because we are seeing these tapes piecemeal you don't know how many hours and they're clearly in two different locations like you know how many hours he'd been spending with this guy this guy that he wants to impress clearly you know this could have been a 10 hour like over the course of 10 hours where there's a lot of like non-shady stuff happening in between and all we're seeing are the suspicious moments we're being like what the heck you know he also like kyle and his response is like i've been drinking so i don't know like that looked like it was in a conference room it didn't look like he was drunk but like maybe he's had a couple beers and his like just like cognitive reasoning is not functioning at its best like you know i'll i'll give him the benefit of the doubt but it's so like awkward to watch because it's so clearly like it just so clearly sounds like a setup from our vantage point point totally and so i think this is another point that we didn't really get into because i think it just complicates things and adds a whole other layer so this wasn't part of the the tldr summary we gave but it's now come out so roche or kyle is saying that he and this guy christian edgar hansen um were in discussion and so he knows that this was recorded in those conversations with this man and he's saying that christian edgar hansen is working with dfinity which is a company that kyle has a pending lawsuit against now christian has said i don't know dfinity i don't know the founder dominic williams like there's no connection here that you're saying that there is um but christianity hansen has been all over twitter posting like we spent a weekend together he came over to try to sell this like initial litigation offering to us and for us to partner and bring it to emea and to the european markets so it seems like this was during that weekend like it's identified and pinpointed when this all happened so you're right like they were spending an extended period of time together you probably do end up feeling like you trust people but that's a whole extra very interesting added layer here that i didn't realize i didn't realize that christian was denying that he had any affiliation with dfinity that was really completely denial's response and and and kyle posted some articles like a financial times article did you look at these that he had put in his response that were sort of i think backing up his story that uh edgar hansen or i guess mr williams uses yeah norwegian christian ager hanson with a string of spectacular business failures and a trumpian fondness for fibbing has made a hostile bid for britain's johnston press um i'm a street fighter notorious one time open text pursuer set site on medium media empire so like all of these people frankly to me just look gross like everybody coming out of this situation has some dirt on their hands and it is just again icky like so it's it's like the worst of crypto it's the total like bro sort of no regard for other humans complete focus on greed and how to make the most possible money for yourself like it's it's all of that stuff the question is like where is there actually something illegal um i i'll i'll give the the tldr on this initial litigation offering things you mentioned it twice and i think that's maybe the place to end which is this concept of essentially crowdfunding cases like class action lawsuits so that's specifically the tool that um that kyle rosh has used he'll get he'll find a plaintiff saying that you know he lost a lot of money on solana and solana said xyz things which makes it seem like there are security and then but they aren't a security and he'll bring this like class action lawsuit on but on behalf of some plaintiff that he that is feel aggrieved based on solana or whoever um and so these initial litigation offerings which they did for the craig wright situation is crowdfunding money for a legal case where there's the potential for really big payoffs and then if there is that really big payoff you know splitting it or you know proportionally giving it out to the the people who funded it so that this is actually a security and they're using republic for this so republic is um it's called regulation cf regulation crowdfunding and republic is one of the companies that's like authorized to do these reg cf offerings where if you're raising less than five million dollars you can actually like you know issue a security to retail investors um as a way to crowdfund and so they're doing this through a public it's called this and it's that's actually kind of an interesting concept to me i don't know if all of the outcomes from this will be terrible because it's just going to make people super litigious in scenarios and like put a bunch of innocent people in a lot of pain because they're having lawsuits against them that maybe they don't deserve um but it's also playing on this idea of just like you know the risk reward like kind of unequal asymmetric reward potentials like the craig white right situation i think it was like 200 300 million dollars or something that were like up for grabs on the back end of this and you know you're putting up a few million dollars on the front end so there's just this asymmetrical reward uh thing happening that from a purely like financial instrument perspective i think it's actually a very interesting concept i really feel like you could have a whole episode with a bunch of lawyers talking about this as a concept where they see it going yeah what you know what's legit about this what's problematic i tried to get my rosh friedman lawyer to give me his take on all this but he has not responded i'm sure he's not being arrested he's probably going through some stuff yeah i don't know and again i'm not trying to implicate him i don't know what you know he just worked there like i'm sure there's plenty of you know uh innocent non non icky people who for advert friedman um okay anything else you want to say on this i mean we really could probably talk about this for like an hour more because it's uh there's just a lot here i'm just living for this i have to say like i i borderline considered setting up tweet notifications for all of the people involved yeah yeah i uh i'm in the same boat i will be tracking it very closely um okay let's move on though sadly to some of the other things because there is so much happening in the space right now i think we'll go a little bit more rapid fire on some of these um muse sold their 1000 nfts that they had released as part of their their latest album drop um and i talked about this on the show previously this is really interesting because those 1000 nfts count now towards their chart numbers in the uk right so that's like a thousand extra record album sales um you know that will be counted towards where they land on the on the uk's like you know best-selling album charts and um this is something that's it's happening through a company called serenade that is saying they've you know pioneered this new kind of nft called a digital pressing my big question is i i don't really understand how much this is just like a marketing ploy and how much they've actually done something interesting or revolutionary from a tech perspective and i've actually tried i've talked sort of on discord and or you know manage my team i've talked on discord with members of their team we've been trying to set up a call so i can get some clarity on this but it's just been like they're not based in the u.s and so it's been kind of hard time zones to to connect up um either way i think it's a total win for the space obviously that anything related to nfts now counts towards towards the charts it's just a great it's another incentive for artists to release nft albums as part of their broader release strategy absolutely i mean this again i don't fully understand the technical side of this i read through their faqs they have some really good info on there like it's on polygon which is great right like lower cost associated we love to see that um it looks like when you buy a digital pressing it goes into a custodial wallet on like in serenade um but can very easily be transferred out which is great right that lowers the friction for normal people to get involved and and buy in this way all in all like that's kind of my main takeaway from this right we're taking we're moving from strictly nesting in the collectible use case in a world to functional mainstream use cases where this actually counts towards their chart numbers it there isn't a huge barrier to entry and all of this that removes that friction is just the best possible thing that could happen to us so even if it is really clunky right now it is such a step in the right direction speaking of music the vmas happened uh eminem and snoop dogg did a a video and a whatever performance with board apes that uh was resoundingly mocked on the interwebs i think even the nft community was like yeah this was cringy i mean i was at ape fest when they showed the when they did like their first performance and showed their first music video and i was i was obsessed right i was like this is so cool then we watched the vmas with my boyfriend's family and they were all like i don't get this it seems like a very like not 100 their video game and i'm not fully understanding i think it's great that they actually were on stage at some points right like i think that's really helpful i think people just wanted it to be less of a video recording and more of a true metaverse activation like i think that they kind of missed an opportunity here by not having a space in other side for people to go and watch this like quote-unquote live right like that was a really great opportunity still awesome for the space i love that we have them involved i think they're great advocates and champions but i think that there was just like a couple missed opportunities here probably logistically not possible right like i'm the other side is still an early dev so anyways that would be my yeah my understanding too is that this opportunity came to them like that like this kind of vma opportunity came to you labs like a little bit late in the game a little bit too late for them to execute at the level at which they're usually used to executing and i'm like you know what fair you're not going to turn down the opportunity to be in the vmas so you got to go for it but it it then means there's a limiting factor on like what you can actually achieve also years to plan for this right like there are major production companies that do most of the visuals the end performances that you see in the vmas this was done by an nft project right like that is in and of itself incredible yes the m m subreddit was an absolute dumpster fire and it was so funny to be in there but i mean it's great like even my parents texted me and were like oh my gosh like people are texting us about nfts because of the vmas and so now my mom is like thinks that she's like the next big crypto influencer so i mean it like this stuff matters it really does and frankly we're still in the meta of the the world hating on ft's so even if this had been perfect and executed at a hundred percent people were still going to hate on it because because people have like an ideological commitment to disliking nfts right now in this space which i totally understand and we will move past that and you know that like this will not be seen as like weird in generations moving forward um they also the dnas oh god i was just gonna say google search trends during the vmas for things like board apes nfts metaverse other side they were all up so whether this was cringy or not was it the absolute best it could have been maybe not but so many people now know about this that didn't before and isn't that kind of what we really care about totally and the vma is speaking of this they also had a best metaverse performance category this year um blackpink won that we had talked about this on the on the pod i talked about it with um dina and natasha from boys club they had been like you know we were a little disappointed because everybody nominated in the category like nobody was like really a metaverse like you know performer it was sort of like seemed like an excuse to like you know whatever for ariana grande or like some k-pop or you know whatever to me that's besides the point because presuming assuming this category persists again it's just incentives for more artists to now start thinking in these ways thinking about the metaverse much like you know artists thinking about releasing as an nft because it'll count towards your charts these little nudge incentives are super powerful absolutely i mean everyone who knows me knows i'm obsessed with the metaverse right now it's probably like the most commonly used word that comes out of my mouth which is sad and embarrassing and something i need to work on but this is great and yes you're right they were recorded performances they weren't actual metaverse performers but we've already seen so many more since this announcement came out right like post malone did his 12 carat toothache performance in horizon worlds super cool like really interesting experience charlie puth is now going to do in like the iheart music thing they have a big uh you know set that's coming out they're doing a concert and album release party in the metaverse it's just piecemeal right like we're getting there we're drawing attention to it and we're rewarding people that are taking some innovative approaches to accessible performances like there are so many people that got to see these performances that otherwise never would have been able to go to a live concert so i think it's cool agreed okay speaking of the metaverse we have uh finally gotten more information about the use for wow capacitors world of women capacitors this is something that came out i mean months ago i i just remember there was that whole there was a saga because they were air dropped to world of women holders and initially the galaxy holders like didn't get the air drop and then world of women tweeted out something like oh like the secret villain has like prevented the capacitors from getting to the galaxy holders and there was sort of this question of like was this planned or was this like a strategic very clever way to cover up some sort of error that happened in the system they're doing great they're doing great but now everybody has their capacitors and you you can basically redeem your capacitor for a virtual apartment it's a partnership that wow has with on cyber where blue capacitors there's blue capacitors i believe for world of women holders green capacitors for galaxy holders if you hold both a blue and a green capacitor you actually can can redeem them both and then get a portal that connects your one world to the other um and they're saying it's sort of part of this like very inclusive metaverse first branding strategy of like if we're gonna build out these broader worlds you have your avatar and now what you need is your home and that's like your anchor space and um so anyway that's it's interesting i think uh redeeming began this past week on wednesday and you have a month to redeem your capacitor if you would like to get one of these apartments so if you are a wow or wow galaxy holder uh you might want to get on it i think it's great right they have such an interesting community and culture that that exists within the wow community and i know there's been you know some difficulties particularly bridging between um original wow holders and galaxy holders but these are it's so interesting to help people explore other areas within and i know this is a controversial use of the word but web3 right like let's just group the metaverse metaverse concepts nfts all under that bucket for the sake of this conversation you're taking people who otherwise probably never would have explored having a virtual residence and bridging that gap and i think it's so helpful for people to start learning about other kind of like lenses that they can look at this ecosystem with um and just create culture and community spaces right this it's it's such a great way to keep people engaged and kind of find that hook that brings people back to the community so i love this at first i was very confused by my capacitor i saw it and was like i have no idea what's going what am i supposed to do with this yeah but they do a great job with the lore right like they have a really great storytelling team um and narratives around everything which is i think really key to the you know their con persistence in the space totally okay continuing on with news we have um art blocks announced art blocks engine which is their white label service so offering this up to like enterprise clients primarily where they can basically take the art block smart contract the machinery that essentially underpins the their like generative art smart contracts and attach them to their own website so that they you can have these um sort of like branded generative pieces on your site um interesting use case i have some speculation as to to how they're anticipating this playing out but would love to get if you have any uh initial reactions to this i will admit i do not fully understand everything that's going into this solution but the thing i really like about this is i think it it really improves accessibility right there are a lot of small brands women-owned you know companies that just don't have the ability to build a full dev infrastructure to launch an nft project or really get involved in this space this makes it a lot easier right it lowers that barrier and so i think that we'll start seeing um i think this will help with like diversity and inclusion efforts which i think is great um and we'll see what it looks like in terms of monetization for them they have some interesting theories that i've seen in their tweet threads i uh i don't think it was in an interview i did with him though he may have mentioned it on a panel i was hosting or maybe i heard him say it elsewhere but i've heard snowfall eric cauldron talk in the past about in the future you'll go into an ikea and you'll go to some like stand and you'll punch in a bunch of things and a generative art piece will will pop out um and i think that's a no-brainer i think we'll get there i think that's really interesting because yeah i would rather have like a slightly more personalized customized feeling piece that still feels like a little bit artistic or like arty um than maybe one that's like pre-made and being sold to the same ones being sold to everyone i don't know that this is getting us there but it struck me as like a step in that kind of a direction where an ikea for example could could be one of these partners and could end up using this white label service to cr to allow for like branded generative art on their site first of all is nfts but you can see this evolving in something that has like a physical or a real world tie-in and i've always just found that that use case a really interesting one and in general democratizing technology right like they're not gatekeeping something that they've built which i love to see okay moving along we're sort of in our rapid round here we're not being entirely rapid but we're doing our best um future proof had their it was the proof had their future-proof meet up yesterday uh held in la there was a in-person component to it but of course also you know broadcast out to to anybody who wanted to to track it um all cool things i mean you basically had an announcement of 50 million dollars raised from a16z uh which people were excited to see and some more information about this mythics drop that will be coming out in the beginning of next year are you what's like your relationship approved are you a holder of anything do you track it closely yes uh not a holder just a stalker i would say so yeah i just follow along with everything um i mean they're doing incredible stuff and i think that that is really like a power play community bringing in the irl meetups component is definitely something that people see as a nice to have rather than a need to have but it's so undervalued and over appreciated like people love it right it is so important that everyone gets to meet others in this space and part of the value of this community is the incredible other people involved so i'm really glad that they're leaning into that a little bit i think it's something that's oftentimes falls to the wayside or isn't prioritized by teams that a have like a lot of money and be you know are just working on really like requiring high execution and focus work so i i was really happy to see that they did this and to your point i think one of the takeaways for some people was okay everything really that they're talking about the mythics drop where which will include oddity holders audit holders will be able to burn their oddity for a mythic and you'll have just as much of a chance as a moon bird holder to get a rare mythic which people liked is sort of democratizing the the holding there um they also were making some announcements about high-rise you know which is their sort of tech product side of what they're doing all of that will really be playing out next year which your point is like when these projects to really get serious you end up having to invest in projects that have very long time horizons so i think there was sort of an initial pop on oddities when the news first came out and then as people realized the timeline here the the price sort of sank back down a little bit as folks were like oh i've got time before before all this plays out um but again you know not to put any project against each other but in contrast to doodles they're being really communicative about these timelines and saying hey we these things are coming but it's not going to be until next year and and then people can know that they just just need to wait i i was curious to see i was a little nervous for them because there's been you know some backlash against moon birds and proof in the past couple of months expectations that weren't met and i felt like the expectations were so high and the expectations were so high it felt like on this particular future proof meetup because people were disappointed because of the fanny packs and this was gonna be like the redemption moment i was worried if they were going to be able to live up to people's hype um but it feels like they did it feels like the community is really happy about this they feel really satisfied by what's come out of it and i haven't seen a lot of fun so so good for them yeah and i think there was a lot i mean obviously following the announcement on you know their their approach to copyright and ip like i think that there was a lot of concern from them from the community on the way that things were communicated out and so seeing them make a really strong pivot and over index on over communicating i i think that's a really strong signal for a lot of people that had concerns actually while you mentioned you mentioned licensing there another thing that i'll flag and won't perseverate on but uh miles jennings and chris dixon of a16z came out recently with their can't be evil nft licenses i'll probably talk more extensively about this at some point because i've been tracking the licensing thing pretty closely had some lawyers on here talking about it i think it's it's fascinating to see how it's going to play out um but essentially they have developed six nft in mind licenses um with with the goal that these are things that are they're posted on are weave and they can be like linked directly within the metadata of nfts so that they really travel with an nft from person to person that's one one issue that exists right now is to the extent that projects have licenses at all they tend to live on the company's website and as a you know second order third order you know secondary tertiary et cetera purchaser you're you're not necessarily you know forced to encounter that terms and conditions or that license at all and so it's very unclear like have you really opted into it like there's all sorts of kind of legal questions here so having licenses on chain and it's an awesome win this is something that they're enabling um and then having these sort of six standardized licenses that map to what we're seeing in the nft community is also great coming from a respected voice like a16z this is great one thing i wanted to flag that i thought was kind of interesting is these six different licenses they have um exclusive commercial rights non-exclusive commercial rights non-exclusive commercial rights and termination for hate speech personal use license personally licensed license with termination for hate speech and like a cc0 license and this this termination for hate speech the way that's maybe it's a wording thing i have to dig deeper into like the specifics of what each of these things say but it's like really hard to imagine projects looking at all these and being like we're gonna opt for the one that doesn't have the termination for hate speech like it if you opt for the the identical license that just doesn't have the termination for hate speech clause it does sort of feel like a condoning of hate speech just given the nomenclature of these licenses and i'm like sort of an odd way to go to choose to name these things this way and what's the point in even having the non-termination for hate speech licenses it's um i don't know it strikes me as as funny as somebody who hasn't actually dug into the language of the licenses yet so i can't speak to that i mean listen i love that they're being comprehensive in their archetypes that they've built out for the potential licenses like i think that that's great i agree um and perhaps maybe that's part of their intention is to like shift behaviors that people really understand like how you can be mindfully restrictive um i could see a lot of projects moving in the direction of like oh we actually might have had the open one that did not have the cancellation for hate speech but we didn't know it and so now we want to adjust to this new archetype it's also just bringing so much awareness to the i'm not well versed in this right i would have no idea what the nuances and differences are that's why we have a legal team for this and i think a lot of other normal consumers just wouldn't know and so inc like lowering that barrier of knowledge that's required to make informed decisions is so important and this is the type of foundational infrastructure that we need in this space in order for broader adoption yep totally agree um okay artifact dropped merch this was also something that i felt like had very mixed reviews on the interwebs uh my read of the situation is you have a group of people who think the execution was excellent in terms of you had these avatars modeling the different merch they looked awesome it was kind of like like a hot drop uh but very expensive it's like 300 for one of these hoodies and i think you have a lot of nft holders that feel like oh my gosh i've spent all this money on this nft just to have the right to spend another 300 on merch like what the heck man uh are you an artifact holder where do you fall on this i'm not an artifact holder yet again just another stalker which is clearly a problem um i i have a tough time with this because this is exactly what they promised they were going to be doing this you know they said they were going to be working with obviously nike high quality high output right i mean the execution is incredible they have ar filters that you can use on snapchat to like style yourself with the items there is so much that they've built into this and the the production output and the quality is just incredible if to me i feel like they're fulfilling their promises and so i think it's just because it took a long time and the market is where it is people have this negative connotation around it i think if this were happening in april people would have been like so hyped about this it also speaks to i think this misconception for lack of a better term around like well i bought this for fifteen thousand dollars i need to get my value for that it's like okay well these weren't minting for fifteen thousand dollars right artifact didn't tell you to buy this thing for fifteen thousand dollars right like you know like you bought this thing on a secondary because of a run-up and artifact received whatever they received of that right 10 i don't know what their their royalty structure is but like you know we saw this happen with proof where they were like i spent 30 thousand dollars on a moon bird and you gave me a fanny pack and it's like well again like or you know proof only got whatever they got of that and they have ten thousand holders like you know there's a there's people need to adjust their expectations about how much free [ __ ] these these projects can realistically give away to 10 000 holders and we have not gotten to a happy equilibrium on like what healthy expectations for projects are i also think that this just came about at an inconvenient time right like there was just all that reporting about how nike made 185 million dollars off of nfts so i'm sure you're sitting there and you're like you made 185 million dollars and now you're charging me 300 for a huddy so i i get it the optics of that are bad yeah yeah timing unfortunate output incredible right like what they've done is great and it's exactly what they they said they were going to do and i mean that's what we want we want people to meet the expectations that they're setting or exceed in my mind which they did awesome last thing that i am super excited about and uh and will be tracking pretty closely is this ticketmaster flow partnership um so ticketmaster is integrating flow for nft tickets dapper obviously has partnerships with the nfl the nba warner music and others um this is a huge win for flo i mean ticketmaster is the behemoth in this space and i have to say i'm i don't i don't know all the details on this just yet but like i'm surprised by how quickly ticketmaster has made this move i thought it was gonna take longer for for ticketmaster to kind of make a move into nfts i mean this is these types of strategic partnerships like across major companies take so long so i mean who knows how long this was in the works which means that they were already like so interested in this and really early on and they've chosen the best possible partner right like dapper labs has a proven track record of churning out really great partnerships with large cumbersome and not super effective organizations and i think unfortunately ticketmaster probably falls into that they're you know they just are a huge company it's going to be really difficult for them to be agile in this space but they've chosen somebody who i think is going to be not only a great technical partner but also kind of advisor and shepard as they enter um into the nft ecosystem i've been on the record being critical of for example the idea of doodles going on to flow as opposed to a layer 2 blockchain and i think people have interpreted that as me being anti-flow which i'm i'm very much not my position has always been especially for a project like doodles i think a project that's already established on a chain i don't think it's a good idea to bifurcate your your ecosystem by doing one part of it on one chain a different part on another chain especially people were talking about like wearables on flow and i'm like wearables for what your avatars that are currently on ethereum like and and because we haven't really established safe cross-train bridges yet but i do really have a clear sense of ethereum scaling and the network effects that exist there i've tended to be a bit of an ethereum maxi from that perspective for for particular projects and and arguably in general like i would have loved to have seen a ticketmaster partnership with you know with with a layer too um with that said like i'm not ideological about this i think dapper's so talented i think flow's an amazing feat it got so many people on board into nfts because of what they did for top shot with top shot and making it so accessible to consumers so hugely excited about this hugely rooting for the success of this for flow um and i think this is the potential to be just absolutely uh monstrous agreed i mean the weekend recently did nft ticket kind of like commemorative tickets for his recent tour which was incredible i was there last week um and they had like binance things on the seats you know it was really like they had leaned into this a lot as the first crypto powered um tour and that's what we want to see right like i can't even imagine how many people were there who had like never heard of this or thought it wasn't legit or were like i don't care about a colorful cartoon profile picture but i do care about being one of i don't know 100 000 people who have this commemorative nft for this like very specific instance um of an artist that i care about right and so i think seeing more and more of this and having a partner like ticketmaster makes these so much more accessible um which is awesome and i guess i'm checking here i i had somehow missed i know i knew the nfl for the super bowl last year had issued commemorative nft tickets i didn't realize that was also a flow partnership with ticketmaster but this is apparently that actually it was the two of them together for that as well um so chicken master has been in this for for a little while now what i'm excited to see is when they actually move and my hope is that this of course happens to tickets themselves being nfts as opposed to simply doing this sort of like after the fact you get this like commemorative nft thing which don't get me wrong i think that's um hugely valuable too and i think over time is going to really just drive the adoption of nfts and wallets and that's what we need because that's when the when you have the network effects of people owning wallets that's when the social signaling piece really comes in because if it's mainstream to have a wallet then you're checking other people's wallets you're seeing the concerts they go to you're seeing the coffee shops they frequent et cetera et cetera um so maybe these things maybe it does play out that nfts only ever really serve as receipts and not necessarily the tickets themselves but um but i'm optimistic i think we could see we'll see a move where tickets themselves are are on the blockchain it's not going to get done without a partnership like this whether it gets done with a partnership like this will you know time will tell see yeah but i think it's great maddie thank you so much for joining me this was a blast uh you are just fantastic we'll have you back i'm sure and uh any final news words you want to say before we wrap this up no i'm just happy to see that we're all still chatting about this and that there's so much movement in this space we i feel like we really needed a week like this to keep things rolling i agree awesome well until next time [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you
