foreign [Music] ation on the Pod today we have Jasper in harm of glow dollar so uh Jasper is the chief marketing officer at Glo and harm is the CTO uh glow working on the technology and glow dollar is a stable coin that embeds philanthropy inside of the glow dollar so basically the way it works is that it's kind of like usdc and except uh well you know except where usdc um creates revenue for Circle by you holding usdc by the way of of of interest in the actual money in their bank account glow dollar takes that interest and it gives it to give directly in order to reduce extreme poverty so the meme that we talk about on this episode is zero XP zero extreme poverty as the glow dollar market cap goes up then extreme poverty goes down is basically the pitch behind glow dollar so it's launching in q1 one of 2023 so in the next couple weeks I'm told is uh is TBD when it's when it's going to launch and one of the things that I'm just really excited about with glow dollar is this idea that we can embed philanthropy into the base layer of our economy if you exchange with glow dollar if you are holding glow dollar then you are um then you're basically helping to reduce extreme poverty which is uh I I think it's quite elegant that people don't have to think about their donations and they can just embed philanthropy in what they do so uh risks and disclaimers all defy and smart contracts are risky um I do not Advocate that you hold glow dollar do your own research on glow dollar before before you hold it um glow is also a green pill sponsor in q1 of 2023 and we really appreciate them supporting the regenerative crypto economics move movement and um you know I'm just pretty excited about what they're up to embedded philanthropy seems really great zero extreme poverty seem seems really great and just the Simplicity and the Elegance of if if a uh if a a Dao or someone that uses D5 holds glow dollar instead of usdc or tether then they can reduce extreme poverty it just seems it just seems like a pretty well designed system to me so um curious what you think coordination without further Ado I'll give you glow dollar enjoy working in web3 is awesome

coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty Goes Down Glow is a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company Glo is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe Reserve to give directly's basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported fast with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glowdollar.org greenpill that's Gro dollar dot org slash green pill alrighty what's up gentlemen how are you you're good how are you pretty good really excited to talk about glow dollar so can we hear about the uh the why what and the how of glow dollar yeah definitely um so we're harm and Jasper from the uh glow Foundation uh we're building the glow dollar and I think for the crypto audience the most basic way to put it is that we're a fully backed stablecoin just like any other stable coin um but we're a non-profit um and all of the money we uh generate we donate it and then we list people out of extreme poverty um by giving them basic incomes um and because of that when you hold the glow dollar um it's just like holding any other stablecoin but because of you um you're listing people out of extreme poverty doing so that's great I mean what I love about glow dollar is that it's such a simple mechanism for like a dial treasury or someone who's involved in crypto to hold glow dollar without it seems like without any additional risk I haven't I haven't audited your smart contracts or anything like that but it seems like a dow could move from usdc or die into glow dollar and then just create positive externalities by holding glow dollar is is it is it really that simple and and and also like what would you say to people out there who maybe hold stable coins and are considering moving them to to Glow dollars yeah um ideally it is really that simple in the beginning there will be a Delta right so I think when you compare stable coins there are a couple things you want to compare them on um one is utility like where what platforms uh is it supported by on what exchanges is it listed two is liquidity and three is um trustworthiness um and once we launch um you know we're we're not uh in our ideal State on these things but you know as we work over time we will get to a point where it literally is as simple as that and um we actually want to go a bit beyond that so if you're using stable coins right now then um there will be a point where moving to Glow dollar is truly um something that comes at no opportunity cost to you um but uh ideally um we can at some point say the same thing about holding US dollars so it's not just if you're a crypto person uh it's also if you're just a normal person receiving a salary doing payments we want to move towards a situation where you can do that in US dollars or in the glow dollar and if you do it in the glow dollar you're listing people out of extreme poverty and um you know uh harm this may be a question for you but uh you know in building that Network effect of glow dollar um I'm assuming it's an erc20 so basically anyone who integrates with any type of token can uh can integrate with with gold dollar is that true and also do you want to tell us a little bit about the technical architecture I know your CTO over at glow dollar yeah absolutely so it is indeed an erc20 um it works basically the same as all other stable coins um there's one sort of twist though that is that transferring US Dollars using glow is 10 cheaper versus the other stable coins that are out there um that's because um we essentially implemented an optimization on the smart contract level that allows us to check for deny lists or blacklists or the as they are controversially called uh entries in a more efficient way than the large stable coins that are out there Do It um and that's yeah between 10 to 15 cheaper than the Alternatives um it's based on a proposal by Alex Krueger who initially did this as a full request for uh the center tokens which uh Power usdc um they've never really bothered to implement it I think for legal and Regulatory and internal compliance hurdles or reasons um but we have connected with him and indicated hey we'd like to do this he was supportive and so we did and to put that into perspective um I think it was in June 2022 uh if usdc would have implemented this optimization that would have cost the entire ecosystem of usdc users about 700k less gas in one month so at scale these these sort of small optimizations are are really important um for the user however it definitely just functions as an erc20 um yeah and then if you want I can also go even deeper into our vision Beyond sort of crypto um which is more around okay how do we actually attract people outside of crypto to also adopt the glow dollar yeah so I mean I think that um for for me from from doing my research on you all uh it feels like there's this like there's this meme that's in your marketing which is that as the glow dollar market cap goes up the number of people in extreme poverty goes down like it's literally just a reverse correlation between how successful glow dollar is and the number of people that can be taken out of extreme poverty and I'm assuming that like crypto is the starting point but then when you said even going outside of crypto is that like your second act um how much could you reduce extreme poverty just by getting Market penetration in crypto versus you know having to go outside of crypto and into the Legacy system yeah good question so um when our market cap goes up by eighteen thousand dollars so one eighth on average we'll be able to lift one person out of extreme poverty so basically anything that grows our market cap divided by 18K and that's how many people lifts uh our list out of property so um when you compare this to for instance tether tether has a pretty brilliant business model so they're fully backed um which means they keep you know 100 of their market cap as value in a reserve and they invest at Reserve in uh all sorts of assets very low risk assets and on average we estimate that they make 2.7 percent of whatever their market cap is so if if debtor would do what we are going to do um they would be generating 1.8 billion dollars per year and that would lift 3.7 million people out of poverty so that's better uh Tedder now has a market cap of I think 66 billion dollars um the total stable coin Market um it depends a little bit but over the last half year or so it has been 150 billion dollars if we would you know theoretically capture the whole stablecoin Market we would on average be lifting uh eight and a half million people out of extreme poverty the numbers there are um I think pretty uh pretty pretty nice even though of course 8.5 million people was like nowhere near uh lifting everyone out of extreme poverty which which is our goal but um I I would still be uh proud of that of that impact what is the what is the number there of number of people who are in extreme poverty across the world it's about 650 million wow that makes me so sad um okay so doing some quick math 650 million times 18 000 uh in in glow market cap so if you got up to a market cap of uh two three it looks like um like 11 trillion then you could remove everyone out of extreme poverty I hope hopefully my math is is correct on that 18 18 000 per person in in market cap times 650 million to me equals 11.7 trillion in market cap you'd have to get to to reach 0xp which is uh which is the meme that I see on your website zero people in extreme poverty uh my notes say about the same number so that's right um yeah pretty impressive like I I'm definitely using a pre uh created Excel sheet for this um but um yeah 11 Point uh something trillion and uh that would amount to a little over eight percent of all the um Fiat money in the world so if we get eight percent of of all money holders um you know weighted equally to do this then um theoretically we could provide everyone in extreme poverty with with a basic income now right you know it's a little bit of an oversimplification because some of these live for instance in North Korea um can't really gets there with basic incomes so yeah it's an oversimplification right but um uh yeah on a high level Direction yeah so one of the questions I always ask guests is if in a world in which you're maximally successful what does the world look like and it feels like we've kind of reverse engineered that right here uh you're you're the meme is zero XP zero people in extreme poverty or as close to it as possible is that right yeah that's that's absolutely right um and um you know in terms of what we do um our our goal would be to get to a point where yeah like I said like using the glow dollar is equivalent to using the US dollar uh when it comes to security when it comes to utility um such that it really is a no-brainer for people to switch um and and and and you know if we get there then enough people should be willing to do it to actually get to these numbers I think yeah um what what is the reserve model so I I know a rudimentary about about stable coins but as far as I understand tether is fully backed in a bank account and they provide some amount of information to Auditors so that people can be sure that it's fully backed but there's always people who are kind of guessing whether or not tether is fully backed and there's like conspiracy theories about it I know with dye it's a decentralized collateralized uh stable coin um and then you've got various other models for for stable coins so like is is glow dollar one to one more with uh tether but with embedded philanthropy usdc embedded philanthropy die but embedded philanthropy or is it like a different model completely the closest model would be uscc Circle okay that is um that is generally what we look to as a reasonably good example of of how to do it in terms of transparency in terms of uh Reserve management um we want to go a bit beyond that ideally um have uh real-time Insight in our reserves rather than daily um I have a big four audit tie our hands to the Mast when it comes to what we can and can do with the reserve so we really wanna to everything we can to make this Reserve strategy as trustworthy as possible um but I think the way usdc is doing it is a very good first um right first model yeah got it so as I understand it end to end um people put money into glow dollar and then there's a certain amount of actual uh US dollars that are stored in a bank account somewhere that generates interest and In Like the usdc Model A lot of that interest goes to that that Revenue goes into overhead and just the profits of circle but in the glow model it goes mostly if not all into relieving extreme poverty so you get 400 450 dollars per year in uh dividends or interest per eighteen thousand dollars in global reserve and that's what funds the removal of people in extreme poverty is that sort of like end-to-end uh how the system works yeah that's right if you wouldn't get really specific um we like circled us will invest uh a part of the reserve in U.S short-term treasury bills so and and we will keep a part in cash the cash will not give us yields but it's necessary to have a liquid enough Reserve liquidity yeah um so Circle right now is holding approximately 80 percent in uh t-bills 20 cash you know we expect to get to similar uh levels and then uh these t-bills so the 80 historically they have a yield of 3.4 percent so 80 times 3.4 percent you get to 2.7 percent um so two point seven percent of whatever our market cap is on average a hundred percent of that uh we donate um and then we donate that to an NGO called give directly now they also have a little overhead so they have an overhead of about 10 um so you know you multiply a lot of factors but um when you multiply it all together you get to an average number that every eighteen thousand dollars of of Market skip uh provides one person in extreme poverty with a basic income so you know what does that mean in practice well um uh you can um it depends on on what a writer money comes from but I think Dao's are a very interesting use case um so uh I looked up the uh treasury Holdings of he gets going down for instance um they currently hold a little over 8 million in Sable coins um in terms of glow that would lift 466 people out of extreme poverty um so it's a pretty cool sort of like additional impact that any dial that holds Stables can just have with you know one flick of a button or in case of a dial like one vote and um and and that impact is essentially for free you're already using stable coins so you're already accepting the risk of holding a stablecoin um so in that particular case it's it's truly um uh truly a no-brainer I think maybe one small addition here is um one thing we haven't discussed yet is is the overhead right and um the people that are building this they also need to live um but we feel strongly that we should not be incentivized to to grow glow dollar to benefit ourselves um so 100 of all the revenue we make uh through investing in treasury bills goes to give directly um in its entirety the globe development foundation the organization behind the Glo dollar is entirely funded by donations by individuals um tell me about the meme of embedded philanthropy I think it's really quite interesting to think about embedding philanthropy into our everyday economic activities what is embedded philanthropy mean to you and um why is it a win for reducing extreme poverty yeah okay so the pitch is something like this um if we want to give everyone an extreme poverty basic income the limiting factor is how much cash there is to give away um so like by definition so we need a whole lot of money to to scale up that that idea of basic incomes and right now these basic income programs are often funded either from private donations or from a government philanthropic Aid and that is placing a fundamental limit on the scalability of these programs because you know there's only so much money that people and states are willing to give away so the the total addressable markets Gap uh so sorry total address will market for for anything that's based on donations it's just very small and um that actually makes a lot of sense so let's say you're the average U.S household then uh you have a savings account that contains about 40K dollars you spend about 60k so as an average U.S household you you control where a hundred thousand dollars go every year in the economy and on average you donate only uh two percent of that and only 0.2 percent of that ever goes across the U.S border so if you are a donation-based charity your total addressable markets is you know 0.2 percent like a very tiny slice of the pie chart of uh the money in the economy so if we want to take this this this this idea of giving people an extreme poverty basic income if you want to take that seriously and we want to scale that up seriously we need a way to fund it that does not depend on donations now that sounds like it's impossible because how can you contribute financially to a charitable cause without donating um but there are actually some instances of how that can be done a different way so I think the most famous one is what Patagonia did um the owner of Patagonia the founder of Patagonia donated the whole company to a charity a couple months ago and because of that you as an individual you now have two ways to contribute to the charity you can actually donate to the charity directly or you can wear Patagonia clothing and then the profit margin of that purchase goes to the charity so wearing these clothes buying these clothes is sort of like an act of charity so in doing so Patagonia embedded philanthropy in the uh garments that they that they create and sell and that trick could be applied to any product so you could have a philanthropic uh philotropic toilet paper if it's manufactured by a toilet paper manufacturer that donates 100 away now we're taking that to the extreme and we're saying well let's not embed philanthropy in any particular product but let's just embed it in money itself in the currency that we use in our daily lives um that is cool because well a money is a very Universal product so the dam of the US dollar is you know enormous uh well but B once you have embedded philanthropy in money itself you can actually embed it in in other things too so you can go through your boss and say Hey I want my next paycheck in glow well now your salary is lifting people out of extreme poverty um you can split bills in glow you can actually run whole companies on the glow dollar as the base money layer and now suddenly everything the whole company is doing with money um that's all lifting people out of extreme poverty so this way you can actually make that that pie chart of of money in the U.S household um contributes to good for the full 100 rather than just this tiny slice of whatever they're willing to and able to give away okay that was very long sentence but uh um I hope that's uh yeah I mean it feels like the the exciting opportunity here is that people don't have to remember to donate um if you just embed philanthropy into the economic system then you kind of set it and forget it you just go about your economic activities and know that you're producing positive externalities which um is fundamentally more scalable than remembering to donate um so it reduces the cognitive load and that also creates more scalability that might be too reductionist but those are kind of some of the key key points that I heard yeah totally agree it's it's that and it's indeed the scalability so you know there there's there's a group of people who donates 10 of their yearly income um that's called uh they're giving what we can pledge um and that's considered very extreme so that's a group of people like they're they're among the most philanthropic charitable people um and day two like 90 of their money is money that they don't give away yeah it kind of reminds me of um when I I used to work at a mutual fund company and um I remember them spending a lot of time training to get people to uh automate their um investments in their retirement accounts so that like every paycheck you get uh they we would try to push people to have like three percent of their paycheck go into their retirement account and people will save more over the longer term if they're just always investing three percent more um and so uh it just kind of reminds me of that but but for philanthropy so I I think like the set it forget it nature is is really pretty powerful yeah totally agree well um I I'm curious that I'm curious when the launch is how do people get involved how can they uh how can they participate in your ecosystem and um you know what opportunities for engagement are there for uh the listeners of the Greek Hill podcast most of which are pretty active in in web 3. Tom you and I pick this one yeah sure maybe um before I start going off on a limp I just really want me to say Just q1 Launch and then um we want them to consider shifting to blow as they're stable yeah sounds good do we want them to be active in social and stuff too yeah maybe we can say well good question actually uh well like follow us on Twitter yeah it's like a classic but of course that that is definitely nice um I'd say you know the easiest way is follow us and then once we're launching q1 uh actually buy some glow on a on the decks help us grow the market cap um and then if you're really excited you know you can actually start building on glow yeah exactly and uh and then our clutch green pill link right yeah okay maybe maybe you can say we're trying to get this thing from zero to one something like that right yeah that makes I think it's fun that you're having the CTO answer the how can people get involved question when you're the chief marketing officer but uh it's it's it's fun to watch um yeah uh so maybe I'll just ask again and we can and we can take it from there yeah sounds good cool so uh how can people get involved in glow say that I'm totally bought in on embedded philanthropy and I wanna help build this movement of zero extreme poverty by by helping glow launch and getting involved in the glow ecosystem where can I do that how can I do that yeah uh great that you're so excited um I think for starters go to glowedollar.org greenpill and then um join the wait list there so that you maintain up to speed on on everything we're doing we are very close to launching on decentralized exchanges that should happen in quarter one and maybe by the time you're listening to this we actually are available already on uh uni swap most likely um at scale so when that's the case we would really yeah invite you to consider changing your stablecoin Holdings to to the glow dollar and start uh help us make an impact for the better in the world and I think we're really at the stage where we're trying to take this from from zero to one as a project and one of the the key things that will allow us to to really make globe successful is if others start building on top of glow as well so um one thing would be to start a uh another project on top of the globe dollar or to include glow as a token in the products that you're building yourself as an alternative stable client that you like and support um and then finally I think what we believe is very important as well for the long-term success of glow is to go beyond crypto so it is sort of my personal dream and desire and ambition that glow will be used to exchange goods and services not only in the digital realm but also in the Physical Realm so I'd love for people to start accepting glow for maybe a cup of coffee or a t-shirt perhaps the green pill swag or the shelling points where I could also uh be bought using glow I think yeah we're really looking for more projects to to sort of sign on and start accepting blow as a as a true stable coin yep so it seems like uh y'all are about to launch you can sign up for updates on the launch at glowdollar.org you can go to twitter.com glowdollarglo dollar uh there's no W there and um once it's live you can hold you can huddle glow um and of course do your own research before handling any token of course um and and uh if you're a d app developer you can integrate glow in to your ecosystem and uh it's an erc20 so lots of stuff can be built on top of it and uh the launch is sometime in in q1 so check out glowdollar.org if you wanna if you want to get involved exactly polygon maybe um we're launching on uh ethereum network but also polygon that same time um in future expanding to you know a number of uh of chains but that's where we're starting great well uh is there anything that I didn't ask that you all want to talk about with respect to Glow dollar why you're so passionate about extreme poverty embedded philanthropy all the things that we talked about here is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say that's a generous question thanks um well maybe one one interesting thing is you know har mentioned the fact that we definitely want beyond crypto adoption and we sometimes get the question like what makes you think that after all of the cryptocurrencies that have tried to get adoption uh as a mainstream means of Exchange um which actually has been the promise of crypto since the very beginning of Bitcoin and has never been fulfilled what makes you think that you're you'll be able to get that kind of adoption um and my thought there is that you know people people wonder like okay why why is Bitcoin not used as a means of exchange and then the classic answer is well it's too volatile right you don't want to pay your pizza on bitcoin and then see it's be worth uh 100K a bit later okay sure but that that problem is solved by other stable coins like other stable coins are actually quite ready to be used um for everyday payments and still I don't know anyone outside of the crypto World who's doing that who's actually buying their groceries with with tether or usdc um and I think the answer is like why would you so for instance my parents they're pretty happy with their with their debit cards that just works in a grocery store and then you can say well but Sable coins are nice because it's programmable money or you have cross-border remittances um or you don't have you know all of the intermediary um parties in between the transactions or instant settlements it looks like sure yeah that's amazing and like as a technologist I love that um but my parents don't even know what these words mean they just want to pay at the grocery store so I think to break through as a means of exchange like crypto shouldn't be just as good as traffic means of exchanges they should add something that transformation cannot do um and my hope is that uh the ability to lift people out of extreme poverty at no cost that that might be the uh killer app the killer feature let's say that actually makes people want to switch to something that is uh not something they're used to [Music] um let's see uh but that's uh that's what we want to work towards maybe to add to that long Thoughts with some more thinking um I think there's also a natural Dynamic that will be able to create that some other stable coins aren't able to create so far which is due to the embedded philanthropy aspect of the glow dollar we will be able to um just by the virtue of that pitch attract people who are normally not so much into crypto to also put money into the glow dollar and we've already spoken with with quite some people who have said okay sure I will hold some money in Globe but then I will try to spend it uh as well as I can and only if I am able to spend it am I going to buy more so what I anticipate will happen here is you're going to have a new group of people who've never held any crypto before and have no interest in in crypto in and of itself they will have a new sort of means of payment and they will want to pay with it somewhere and then some smart business owners out there are going to think hey but this is a new sort of Niche that I can cater to they are possibly quite sort of values aligned to whatever that business is doing as well and they may actually start to accept glow um out of sort of a altruistic motivation but also a business opportunity and if that happens you sort of have uh fixed the cold start problem in the sense that you have people who want to spend stuff and you have businesses who want to accept it then you can really get a payments ecosystem going and that's not something I've I've really seen successfully develop um much in other web3 new cryptocurrency projects so far yeah totally um well it's really great to see the attraction that y'all are making and I think that you're doing something new and Innovative that's hopefully creates positive externalities for the world so um yeah excited to see the launch and see where it goes and uh and and um and so yeah for the for the audience out there check out glowdollar.org go to twitter.com and um looking forward to seeing how things grow in the future so uh thanks so much for coming on the pod [Music] thanks for having us for having us your pleasure cool [Music] foreign
