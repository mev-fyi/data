[Music] what's happening coordination got a really fun episode for you today i've got an episode with gregory landua the founder of regen network gregory is a true og having worked on local currencies in 2009 and following bitcoin and peer-to-peer money since its very inception we talk a lot about local currencies on this episode talk a lot about the lessons that financial capital can learn from living capital things like climate and biodiversity and diverse ecosystems of animals and plants in the animal kingdom uh gregory has informed a lot of my thinking about the space he published this piece back in the early 2010s about the eight forms of capital basically going from financial capital to also intellectual capital experiential capital cultural capital social capital and i just think that it's really created a vocabulary for me to understand the regenerative world that is being created created in the crypto space so eight forms of capital is gregory's work and it's very foundational to my thinking about regenerative crypto economics we talk about a high functioning automatic which is just basically how do we make the automatic or the default decision that economic actors make regenerative for public goods and for our communities we talk about how humans can be a regenerative keystone species for planet earth keystone just basically means the species that all other species depend upon and it that's the keystone species talk a little bit about robust and healthy ecosystems and what financial capital can learn from living capital in this episode so coordination this episode was one of my favorites that we've ever done and i am really excited to bring it to you today without further ado i bring you gregory landua the founder of regen network when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you

you have a really deep history in building regenerative stuff um and i'm curious to pull pull on that thread can you tell us how you got into crypto and how you founded the regen network yeah totally well so um gosh i definitely stumbled across crypto first like back in probably like 2009 or so when i was pretty deeply engaged with a bunch of alternative and complementary currency work like local currency work local exchange trading systems time bank work uh and i ran across the bitcoin white paper and that was you know like 2008 you know crisis and during that whole time i had been um doing a lot of community organizing actually in a very you know um quirky strange part of middle tennessee uh summertown um in hohenwald and we had been convening kind of in a pretty traditionally thought of as a very conservative part of the united states we've been convening politicians and business owners and farmers around this concept of of relocalizing and regenerating the economy and you know and and during that whole sort of like arc of my life and my career i stumbled across bitcoin and was really immediately interested and i actually remember sitting around a campfire uh with some you know pretty hardcore like deep green kind of like deep green resistance sort of bioregionalists talking about if bitcoin provided could provide us some hints around what you know relocalizing and having bioregional currencies reflective of ecological health might look like and having fun arguments and conversations about it way back then you know and and like right there the dawn of the the crypto era really yeah can i pull that thread a little bit not to take us on a tangent but i'm curious what you see as the upside in the work you're doing with local currencies does it allow communities to represent their their values in a little bit more of a uh high-resolution way like what's exciting about local currencies to you buy your regional currencies yeah i mean i consider money to sort of be a root protocol for social coordination and you know how we define the social the process of the social construction of value i would define as a basic human right i think you know if you look back in the to the dawn of history there's a really amazing debt the first five thousand years by david graber his recent book the dawn of everything all of your listeners should read these they're really foundational in understanding the the plurality and multiplicity of different types units of account forms of currency that that different cultures over millennia have have created for their own cultural con context and so i've always been really passionate about this concept of relocalizing that so that process of the social construction of value and sort of you know maybe a nested dunbar kind of uh scale where you really need to participate in asking questions about how you're reflecting value um in order to anchor it in a more holistic sort of health and the more that it scales and the more abstracted our money gets from our culture the the more the more challenging i believe it is to have our money systems be interwoven with the generation of public goods essentially because it just gets so abstract that you know the the games that we play around the economy kind of get further and further from something that accounts from for i guess a healthy society i see okay got it so that localization i can almost sort of imagine a i think in the united states there used to be different state currencies and and you know i'm wondering what it's like what it would be like in a hyper-connected age to have a bunch of local currencies that represent local values but then maybe there's like a uniswap pool to some sort of global more commoditized currency and what kind of interplay that creates between uh you know it's interesting because the united states is kind of constructed around localism and then the states and then and then the federal government now we've kind of got this you know united nations that we're a part of which are four different holons for human society um and and what does it do when you when you give those those local communities access to their own currency which represents their own values um i don't know if you have anything more to say about that but it seems like a deeply interesting hypothetical design space it's deeply interesting it's really dynamic there's a lot of work that happens around this kind of subject in the cosmos ecosystem i know bucky um ethan buckman one of the founders of the cosmos project is really passionate around this sort of like localism as applied to currency and monetary theory and design and okay it sort of resonates with this this sort of like concept in cosmos of self-sovereign state machines which are sort of like make it possible for a community to govern the economic parameters of that community in a sovereign way but interoperate with other economies in this sort of nested way and so you know there's sort of like a deep thread of this particular like geekiness right inside of the like the the the sister or cousin community to ethereum which is cosmos yeah yeah and and i want to get into that and understand that ecosystem um and and i think like maybe i would introduce a language early in the episode for us to talk about the different trade-offs that make different local currencies make y'all blew my mind when you published this blog post about the eight different forms of capital um taking uh what's commonly understood to be capital which is financial capital and exploding it out into social material financial living intellectual experiential spiritual and cultural capital and um you know maybe that's like a common language for us to talk about the trade-offs between values that different local currencies might have in this world um but i i guess i just want to like say in front of everyone eight forms of currency really blew my mind when i read it and i've treated as foundational in a lot of the designs that i'm working on these days so kudos for that i don't know if you have anything else to say about the eight forms of of capital yeah well super grateful and excited honored that it's useful and you know and that that eight forms of capital um [Music] framework was generated back in 2008 through a participatory process with a community so my thinking partner around that ethan olivia of and i um feel like we just sort of listened right we were we were listening to this community and we were at we we sort of charged ourselves with asking what were different unique and important forms of value that people didn't feel like were commonly represented by this concept of capital right and and we sort of gathered we interviewed people and we gathered all of these responses and we sort of distilled the eight forms of capital out of that as as these sort of patterns that could could represent a holistic conception of value and capital and then how it complexes into currencies um and use that as a living framework for us to navigate our work in the world so you know and and since we created it um or sort of like crystallize that as a framework we've noticed that it's been really deeply useful for a lot of very diverse different communities so the eight forms of capital is very commonly taught in permaculture design courses these days around the world and um and now it's sort of making its debut recently into the crypto space as it's discovered and rediscovered and regenerated by by folks like yourself so it's yeah it's it's exciting to be part of something but you know with all humility i think we were really just sourcing from the moment and trying to express what we were hearing yeah that's so fascinating i feel like so many of the insights that i have um in working with dals and working in this bleeding edge design space just comes from um communing with people and trying to sense make them like we're on the frontier what do we see around us and and it's it's kind of it breaks my brain every time i just kind of get to be in these these communities where ideas like that bubble up um and so you know has that been something that you've taken forward in your work in the region network uh be curious to hear to start playing forward that story about from 2009 uh to the founding of the region network and what you all are up to uh these days definitely i mean so regen network is um is built to be open public infrastructure for for living capital accounting and and currency minting essentially um and so that's what we're up to so we're really focused on um you know and and each you know it's a holistic framework and so of course to account for or to explore as a community living capital as the foundation for currencies and assets and in a living economy you also need to be asking what's the relationship between living capital and financial capital and living capital material capital living capital cultural social so they're all represented but the emphasis at regent network is really firmly on living capital and um you know and again creating public infrastructure for for us to be evolving new ways of accounting for and expressing and regenerating really at the end of the day regenerating living capital and regenerating just means a system where that resource becomes more abundant over time as opposed to becoming depleted uh at least that's the definition i've been working with how would you define regenerative i think that that's i think that that's a good um placeholder i i tend to use words like vitality viability evolutionary capability and capacity so regeneration to me represents um not just an increase in sort of like systemic capability and capacity but actually and but actually sort of um increasing the ability for the system itself to evolve and that feels really foundational to sort of the the conception of regeneration that i i work with um i see okay that's so interesting you almost like put it in evolutionary frame there the world's evolving a system if it can evolve along with it is regenerative it's going to keep up in the future um yeah yeah and in this case it's really about our biosphere our our ecosystems our watersheds our soil our forests how are we how are we knitting them back into our economic system so that our economic transactions relationships our our um our co-regenerating um our culture and our society our economy with the greater the human world with the larger ecosystem and i i come from a permaculture background myself you know my vocation in uh previous to web three crypto sort of blockchain world was doing um what i think you could broadly consider permaculture design implementation and um there's a great definition by a really awesome um sort of permaculture researcher named rafter sas ferguson of permaculture which is the art and science of meeting human needs while increasing ecosystem health and i see that always really deeply resonated with me as as a pointer around what are we trying to do here specifically around living capital and like how we weave living capital into this sort of like larger economic tapestry well we want to meet our needs right as a society as individuals as people in a way that increases ecological health and that's always been a nice uh just placeholder for me just like a north star amazing um you know what i think is so interesting about this space is how um i'm starting to ever since you published eight forms of capital think about different projects is just new arbitrages between different types of capital like ethereum and vitalik i think of as like an arbitrage between intellectual capital and the creation of consensus with the financial capital which then has enabled nfts which are financial and cultural capital um social media and blockchain is an arbitrage between financial and social capital in in what you're doing is an arbitrage not arbitrage but like a connection between material and living capital and financial capital and so you've just kind of given me this language for looking at different sub sectors of the web 3 space and viewing them through kind of like bridges between financial capital and and many many different different types of capital and you're the deepest person i think i know in the material and living capital stuff bro uh gregory i mean it's been like you've been working on this for like 10 or 15 years at this point so i think it's it's cool that you gave us all that that other language and and i really want to dive in on the material living capital and where what you think we can learn from that so i don't know anything to anything to say about that before i asked my next question no i mean i love that concept of arbitraging between these different forms of capital and um yeah that's really yeah that's really a nice um that's really a nice mental model um yeah well thanks for giving us the language to talk about that um i want to talk about permaculture next uh as a i think a modest my audience might be a soft be software engineers and might not know as much about agriculture as you do and i want to talk about permaculture and why that's such an exciting concept to you and what does financial permaculture look like what can finance learn from traditional permaculture well permaculture you know one definition i already mentioned which is the art and science of meeting human needs while increasing ecological health um there it's sort of a set of principles that we're were distilled from um the progenitors or authors of of permaculture into the world as a as a design science so there's a set of principles that um were observed amongst a wide variety of successful mostly indigenous uh generated land management and agriculture systems and a set of ethics so generally speaking permaculture is like kind of a design science and it's something that you bring to bear to to to allow you to in most cases it's people designing um the built environment or agricultural systems so living and and material capital systems you know in in people are thinking about nutrient cycles and they're thinking about catching and storing water and and renewable energy and they're thinking about diversifying cropping systems and my specialty in that whole world was really centered around agroforestry and agriculture and and those systems um and i did a lot of work kind of doing multi-enterprise business planning because one of the things you start to when you get permaculture pilled you start to see you know that that diversity is really um a key to regeneration and so when you look out in an agricultural system and you see nothing but corn for thousands of miles basically you know you know there's an issue right in order to support that monoculture system we have to pour immense amounts of herbicides and pesticides and fertilizers and have giant machines that manage it all and it wants to grow back it wants to grow the weeds are nature trying to rediversify it and so we're fighting these weeds all the time well you know permaculture is kind of almost taoist it's kind of like how do we learn to go with the flow of life instead of fighting life in how we're designing our agriculture our built environment and our agricultural systems predominantly like we're all really fascinated about these basic sort of survival you know like all of human life is is sourced from agriculture no one is disconnected from where their food is grown no matter if if that food is plant-based proteins that get recombined into some sort of like weird new age you know drink or if it's like a big slab of beef on a grill you know either way it is coming from the earth right and so right we permits are super earthy we're super earthy practical folks just kind of wanting to engage at that nexus of of the the process of humans extracting value from living capital right we need to we need to eat we need to have fuel food and fiber and permaculture is yeah it's a it's a it's a process to explore how to go about extracting value in a way in which the relationship is regenerative in which that ecosystem is increasing in health and i would sort of before i stop with my monologue i would invite all of your listeners who who who yeah maybe more on the sort of um software engineer spectrum of things to consider that a couple of facts um fact number one wolves right which interact with um which are predatory right and interact with bison and elk and deer as predators when you introduce a wolf into an ecosystem as a keystone predator the diversity and ecological health of the entire landscape goes up right um when so so wolves are this really fascinating um i think hint to how a species can actually increase the ecological health of the whole system how does that happen why does that happen i think these are really important questions to be asking and i'm always asking how can humans be a regenerative keystone species on planet earth how is our presence here actually uh a force for regeneration instead of a force for degeneration how is our presence in an ecosystem whether it's agricultural or wild actually engendering sort of this net regenerative results in which biodiversity and ecological health is the result of our interactions with the rest of the ecosystem got it um and you're so i i just had to google it since you said it and it sort of blew my mind a keystone species is a species which other species in an ecosystem largely depend and if you remove from the ecosystem would change drastically in the story that you told about the wolves are they the are they a keystone species yeah they're keystone species so in places that they were extirpated or removed from ecosystems all over the world those ecosystems have degraded and then the ecosystem changes and and it decreases in biodiversity and stability right and so um when wolves are present again you know like in yellowstone there's all of these indicators and all of the science showing that the ecosystem is more robust resilient and healthy you know and this is true you know you could think of the larger carbon cycle we're in this climate catastrophe we've been pumping you know um carbon from from below the earth into the atmosphere creating the you know greenhouse effect all these other things cl you know carbon is really the least of our problems in a lot of ways um this is an example of humans not behaving like a keystone species instead we're behaving we're we're behaving as a species that's tending towards simplifying and degrading and making ecosystems more fragile right but that is not that does not need to be the case there are plenty of examples if you look at at like a larger scale anthropological history of humans there are lots of examples of human societies acting as keystone species in which they're you know like in the amazon there were large you know and mesoamerica um there were large civilizations supported by incredibly biodiverse hyper biodiverse landscapes in fact some of the most biodiverse hot spots in the amazon there are studies showing that humans were tending these biodiversity hot spots through climactic changes and then the biodiversity was expanding back out from these sort of arcs of biodiversity and that humans were responsible for sort of seeding and stewarding this mega biodiversity of the amazon and so like flipping the script from degen to region you know we don't need to be a force for degeneration as humans this is all just how we structure our incentives our society our interaction with the the other eight forms of capital besides financial capital and that engineering and design question in a holistic way you know my entry into that was was through permaculture amazing um do you think a lot of this is just about considering second order effects of our actions so you know like when i eat my job to be done is to no longer be hungry right but there's these second order effects to my health of like what i eat accumulates over time and if i have the aperture of awareness to think about the second order effects of my decisions like i'll eat organic i'll eat like fruits and vegetables and that will create regenerative living capital for me because i'll be more healthy um i guess i just wonder does a lot of this boil down into making so that like the default choice for people it considers the second order effects of their um actions so that the system doesn't become self-terminating um is that one way of slicing and dicing it in what ways is that right and what ways is that wrong in your opinion gregory i think that's a great way to slice and dice it i think you know i in my language i would refer to that as sort of achieving a high functioning automatic where you know like our habitual patterns if we're just kind of on default mode are tending to have these sort of like positive second-order results instead of negative second-order results and i think that's that's that's totally right on um in terms of like how this is designing or engineering yeah i also think that that concept of the high-functioning automatic the default network is really interesting to me because one of the things i deeply feel is that being able to care about second order effects of your decisions is kind of a position of privilege right you know it's easy for me to pontificate about the effects on the world of our actions but uh like someone who wants to feed their kids probably doesn't like you know in his living paycheck to paycheck like it's hard to get them to care about the second order effects so one of the questions i always have is how can we bring the high functioning automatic or the automatic to be more of a high functioning automatic because i think it's too complicated to make the case uh to people when they're just trying to get that job to be done that that they should care about the second-order effects do you have any pushback on that or feedback on that how do you think about that well i mean it generally drives with my perspective which is that um if we're trying to rely on individuals making inquotes the right choice you know what we're relying on is like a moralizing argument in which you know people are are recreating the prisoner's dilemma right and time after time day after day where they have to take care of themselves and they got to play this game and they got to feed their kids they got to feed themselves they got to take care of the family and this statistically the trend is going to be for people to to defect not because they're bad but because they have present moment challenges that they have to deal with and you know net net like it's just going to all trend towards that and i think you know i think our quest needs to really be um and i think it is true being able to think about this pontificate about it is a position of privilege and i think we do need to be thinking about how do we create transparent non-manipulative non-coercive high-functioning automatic where people can opt in to a high functioning automatic where when you when you're making that day-to-day decision on default mode or you know i think another thing that's really important here to consider is that people you know oftentimes people defect not because they're bad meaning defect on like the public good not because they're bad but because they're getting put in a situation where they have to they have short time preference in an economic decision they got to get what they can get right now um otherwise they're going to feel pain of some sort right and it could be significant and we need to like as a society you know this like first order and second order effects short time preference and long time preference really we need to realign economic incentives right for short-term decision-making and long-term outcomes and that that question about how we do that in a high-functioning automatic i do think is like the the big kind of like quest we're on together with when you take the green pill and when you're engaging in regenerative crypto economics i think that's that's a big part of what we're all up to so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind

tax-free just go to alto ira dot com slash bankless that's a l t o i r a dot com bank list and start investing in crypto today i i guess i want to pull that thread a little bit further and i know that we're going like deep down the rabbit hole but i feel like this concept of the high functioning automatic is uh is is deeply important i guess i i want to ask from an evolutionary perspective where you think whether you think the high functioning automatic competes with the low functioning easy button um or you know the high like how can we make the high functioning outcomes more competitive against the the like low functioning but but cheap to satisfy out outcomes and or and i guess you know one way i would sort of frame it is that i've been talking a lot about uh game b with various different people on the guests on on on the podcast recently and and the idea there is basically like if you're greedy if you're like building an empire and you're you're sort of um you're you're basically only operating over what's the most uh giving you give you the most short-term domination or pleasure like you kind of like shift the game so that everyone else has to play the game your way um with when you [Music] i think i'm not articulating this as well uh as i could be but but basically like how do we make the high functioning thing the right evolutionary decision for each agent to be making because otherwise we're just gonna have a death spiral into low functioning outcomes how does the high functioning automatic compete with with the low functioning one is it because the low functioning one is self-terminating do you have any thoughts on that yeah um yeah i mean i wish we could uh conjure uh daniel schmuckenberger into conversation um just in the present moment i had great some great conversations with him at the shelling point but i'm glad yeah yeah but um i mean it's hard there's a hard question to answer in in like a single i think that's a really hard question to answer singularly or you know in a phrase or you know i think it requires some nuance and um context dependent maybe exactly it's context dependent and i think there's levels as well so i think it's important to invoke kind of like a leveling framework right so um so there's a there's a great living systems framework that i think through from time to time um that i was taught by carol sanford and she has some great books including uh regenerative business regenerative life and she's really sort of like sourcing these living systems frameworks from this sort of like jg bennett world and some some other folks for folks who want to geek out on where this is coming from there's a whole like really interesting sort of like lineage there but yeah this this framework um that i want to use to try to answer this goes from vital where it's like you know it's like a level of um you know like the fight or flight you know like you know you just it's survival like the survival mode right um let's just and actually i'm going to shift frameworks mid mid mid stream here and shift to like just think of a triage how do we you know there's um what are the levels when there's an injury that takes place in order to like get back to health so um before so so first you have um stabilize right like if you if you ever did a wilderness first responder or emt or anything like that you find somebody who's injured you just have to stabilize them you can't you know you need to staunch the flow of blood or you need to get their feet up or you need to stabilize their neck or whatever it is you don't really do much you just like minor intervention right this vital level minor intervention the next level up you've identified you you're like checking things out while you're stabilizing you're triaging then you can operate and you can make an intervention and you can like maybe stitch them up or set their leg or whatever it is if you go up another level you're thinking about improving so maybe you've stabilized you've operated now you're in rehab or whatever you're like okay like time has gone by you're trying to like improve your strength or like your mobility or whatever it is and it's only once you get past that level that you could start to think about you know maybe regenerating where something new is coming to be okay so like thinking through this you know this multipolar trap which maybe listeners have have heard if you've been releasing stuff uh game b world and and yeah yeah right we're all in this scenario where you know oftentimes survival or at least the best economic move is to sort of like defect from other people and yeah that same that same thing happens on just like a normal scale with just like people's livelihoods their day-to-day life products they choose to buy you know uh taking the shortcut but it also is playing out writ large at a geopolitical level where you know this sort of game could result in all of us being killed in nuclear oblivion or biological war or you know whatever it is right so it's sort of like it's just a whole fractal mess we have to ask the question how are people how does how does the second order or long game how does the long game i'll just call it the long game how does the long game compete when you're in survival mode when you're when you're needing to stabilize right and how does it compete when you're in operate mode and how does it compete when you're improved mode and how does it relate and regenerate you have to answer it at each of those four different levels so you can't it's it's like we have to get out of this flat land thing and realize that different people at different moments and different scenarios are operating at different levels and so you know i i think you know you don't actually have to win at the um at the sort of um that that first vital sustaining level where where it's like fight or flight you just have to not lose right and then you have to be incrementally a little faster at operating and repairing as you go up and then it's when you're at this these higher orders that i believe it becomes significantly more sort of competitive in terms of a strategy of a squad or a team or a company or a nation state that sort of like out cooperate the competition vibe i think really starts to thrive as you move up but but yeah you can't lose at the lower order you you just can't right yeah or if you you know if you do lose it at the lower order it seems like in the permaculture analogy like you know maybe you've sucked all the nutrients out of the ground then that's maladapted like you basically like ruined the resource which is maladaptive uh so so maybe the system is sort of self-correcting in a way self-correcting from the system perspective from the individual perspective obviously it's very uh hard not to be able to extract resources from the ground anymore when that happens and so there's kind of an arbitrage between the lower and the higher levels is what i'm envisioning i want to hand the reins over to you gregory you're just such a a giga brain thinking about these things where do you want to go next what didn't i ask you that you want to tell us about oh i've been so enjoying our dialogue i i mean i think it's interesting probably um you know i mean there's a couple of different places to go one is you know i think it's there's i think there's rich and interesting conversations to talk about sort of you know i have an ulterior motive to to cosmos pill everybody who's uh you know taking the green pill so i think there's like a fun dynamic interesting conversation to potentially be had there i think i think it's really interesting to talk about um i guess kind of the like the the nitty-gritty of reconnecting social construction of value to ecological health and what that means and how it's taking place in region and other experiments around the space that's another really interesting topic and maybe sharing with listeners a little bit about what's alive right now in region network and what we're doing and who we're collaborating with and and how that's affecting the real world so those are sort of three different threads i suppose we could choose one or or more nice um well yeah let's let's let's sort of go down the region network rabbit hole how can people get involved what are you all up to what's exciting that's on your road map that y'all are doing yeah so right now we're just in the process of launching uh nature carbon ton which is a on-chain carbon standard that we participated with the toucan team which is a really cool group of folks um to sort of bring into the world and the first place that the nature carbon tons showed up on the first chain was polygon now we're working on sort of uh multi-chain standard and bridging and and it's going to be showing up it has already showed up over on regen network and in the ibc world so the inter-blockchain communication enabled part of the blockchain sort of like universe and yeah it's really exciting because it enables us to be bringing an off-chain asset these carbon credits on chain and then using them as sort of a green money lego so that people can start to you know offset nfts or go long on carbon or you know built use it as collateral in new stablecoin experiments etc so it's sort of like it meets the defy and nft communities where it's at with a with a present moment asset with off-chain value and market and validation which is kind of cool in and of itself and there's enough liquidity in in those markets to do some really significant and interesting things so that's quite fun and interesting it's kind of different from most of what we do at regen which is about which is about building tools for people to natively mint ecological assets like carbon credits right onto the blockchain not pull them off of existing markets but to generate them sort of through the process of monitoring reporting verification and minting and the and sort of like dow governed um asset control where in our structure what we're really working on is sort of like every credit class in on regen network is essentially a dow there's like a natural capital or living capital dao it is kind of a bank for that particular asset and you define the issuance rules supply rules verification rules and then you can mint those assets up in the marketplace so in this case we're sort of like grafting the old style carbon markets and trust relationships and giving that an on-chain identity so that this can flow through as uh you know as a carbon asset and it can be used in experimentations while we're also doing this like kind of bigger heavier lift around natively web 3 ecological assets so take me like let's play this forward if regen network is maximally successful what does the world look like in 10 or 20 years like how will what does the world look like in which region network is is maximally successful well i think we've reinvented money to realign short-term ecological um short-term economic profit with long-term ecological health essentially um i think we've created tools both for sort of like a global index uh you know i think you know and this gets a little speculative and we tend to you know so how it actually shows up i think there's going to be something like a global sort of regeneration reward reserve currency essentially i happen to think that that's probably sort of an index system because i think it's quite hard to get it everything's so context specific and ecological health and so you really want space for local expression but you need to sort of like aggregate that and index it so i think we have sort of like a global indexed sort of reward currency that really is only ever minted it's limited supply it's proof of work is proof of regeneration essentially and and there's many different proofs of regeneration so it's not it's not singular realistic it's polycultural but it can be aggregated and indexed at kind of a global scale so that we really have access to units of account and stores of value that represent ecological regeneration and i think as that becomes true this short term sort of um short-term ism right and this prisoner's dilemma that we've been talking about i think it changes because the short-term economic incentives radically transform if this you know way of expressing value is ubiquitous and i think you know then i think we have a society in which the high functioning automatic is ecologically regenerative and it's not a moral or ethical imperative for people to like strive to be in balance with the biosphere that is simply how our society is functioning and we can point our aesthetic moral and ethical problem solving to deeper human issues instead of like the existence of our species on the biosphere right okay beautiful uh there's always a moment in these episodes where i where i think ooh the episode title just appeared in what the speaker said and you said proof of regeneration and i i'm gonna i think i'm gonna suggest that is the episode title which i think is just a beautiful metaphor for what we're doing in the regen crypto space yeah and like more on that i mean i think early on we really tried to nail a specific proof of regeneration protocol right and regeneration is such a you know a context specific place specific especially when it comes to living capital right that having a singular proof of regeneration protocol um felt at least at that moment and i think still a little out of our reach in terms of the mechanism design and so instead i think this is like a nice segue into like sort of like region network's thesis i guess is that we really are trying to create a community committed to creating many different proof of regeneration protocols amazing so your generator function for proof of regeneration exactly beautiful and and i love that we weave back in the theory that we talked about at the top of the episode which was all about high functioning defaults or high functioning automatics we got a kiddo let me know uh if you want to continue recording or if you want to we're good this is obi we got a kiddo in the house he's uh he oftentimes joins me for aob how you doing obi what is regen network pick nose there you go all right gregory is there anything that i didn't ask you that you want to tell us um well let's see um i didn't really i didn't really sort of talk so much about the like early regen days but i think that's that's fine i mean there's all sorts of adventure stories about like you know um choosing to go feet all in choosing to jump all in down the web 3 rabbit hole um coming from a place of you know honestly skepticism and more like earthiness and you know i think there are ways that i think i'm excited to see how the sort of like regen memes and the and this sort of green pill movement um and and especially your work at get coin and an emphasis on public goods is really i think bringing some important medicine to the sort of like crypto space that's that's really important right because i think um when we're too abstract and we're too sort of like gamified and we're too focused on sort of like determinism and mechanism and like like pure abstraction i think that there's definitely some danger in that so there's sort of you know one of my most fervent hopes is that this sort of green pill movement bringing region to crypto creates um an opportunity for all of us who may be sort of like charging breathlessly towards the digital singularity to take a moment and put our feet on the earth and fall back in love with this beautiful planet and this great the greater than human world and the non-digital world and really ask ourselves how are we integrating the magic and the complexity and the life that has given you know mother earth who's giving all of us you know giving birth to all of us how do we include that not just escape it how do we reintegrate it and how do how does this digital this moment of digital revolution um how does it give us new capabilities that can allow us to become that keystone species on earth yeah i think that is the big question um and i think that we've just started pulling that thread here and i think that you've created foundational work in helping make sense of it i know i use eight forms of capital every day in uh in my work but um we do have some more time like let's spend five minutes going through uh a war story of early days of regen network i i think that those are fun would you would be okay to spend the last five or 10 minutes on that totally uh yeah i love it i just love those founder to founder moments of holy we like almost didn't survive that i mean it was arduous it was arduous in the early days you know i think especially for us we you know we started in early 2017 and you know started cranking away on a white on a white paper started our sort of technical roadmap and in those days i mean listeners can probably many folks probably were around back then and you know crypto was very different um it was the era of like crazy icos and you know white papers nothing but a white paper and like a good i guess marketing game and 200 million dollars later or whatever it's like it was really really crazy and we decided that wasn't really our vibe and so we we were like yeah this is probably not gonna work for what we want because the problem is hard enough that we can't you know like there's just multiple dimensions of that ma didn't feel like the right way to approach it so we sort of backed off in those early days and then plunged straight into the bear market right and so it was it was a long and arduous um process to to fund ourselves to keep going to build a team to build a movement through that whole space and and what really got us through um was i guess trying to make ourselves as useful as possible with any community we were interacting with and that got us like the way we got through the bear market was we were doing cutting-edge ecological science work with the usda and leading research institutions we were like the largest contributor to the cosmos repo for the cosmos sdk and doing like any problem that we encountered right anything that we were like oh my gosh this is sort of a foundational challenge that needs to be addressed if we're going to have any opportunity to solve this more foundational issue we just were we were just dedicated to genuinely trying to solve it which is such a radically different approach than your standard sort of like move fast and break things startup where you're just like just get the product to market whatever it is we really took a very different approach and um and continue to do that i mean i think we sort of continue to feel like let's try sort of like move slow and fix things and do foundational work and and not be scared of facing hard problems and and being honest about challenges facing as an as an experiment really like it could all not work that could not be an adaptive competitive way to go about it but i have to say so far you know as a founder and and someone who's building a an open source public blockchain and community around ecological data and claims and assets with a focus on regeneration that strict adherence to take out the trash and do the dishes when you're you know and like look for what you need to do to make the system better you know build the software that nobody else wants to build because it just has to get done has actually like woven us in to a set of economic and social relationships where we're taken care of right and we're no longer in a survival scarcity mode we're we're part of a community we take you know and it's um so i just kind of want to like have a voice that's a that's a feels like an inspiring thing from my perspective to share with new founders and projects it's like make yourself youthful and and people will people community will embrace you yeah i really think that that's one thing that i always feel like i share with other founders is just the early war stories of man we had no resources and we had no money and and we were trying to figure out what we wanted to be and just that toiling sort of that endless toil in order to to get through and create value for the world and i think that a lot of startups look inevitable when you hear about them and it seems like they are inevitable but there's just years of toil and trying to give back and create value that that exists at the base level that i i think unless you founded a project you just don't know you just don't know about that it makes me more thankful for everything that i use knowing about how hard it was for those founders to get that project off off the ground unless they're extremely privileged or lucky so um you know deeply appreciate your work in the space gregory i'm glad that you uh have continued on this far and i can't wait to see that world where regen network is is fully fully successful yeah well super grateful to get a chance to jam with you kevin and always a big fan i'm excited it seems like uh in grant rounds 14 for for git coin we're gonna have uh some cosmos assets and be getting engaged with sort of like weaving bigger communities together so i'm just super i'm just i'm a fan i'm loving the green pill podcast and grateful to have gotten to hop on and share some of my stories i'm grateful to be creating a pluralistic world where we can both be successful in regenerating and we can do it together and cross pollinate so thank you for everything you do gregory yeah likewise [Music]
