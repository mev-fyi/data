you go try to talk to an African official today and say hey these guys are trying to start a virtual country in a digital country and blah blah blah blah they're just laughing you out the door right and the reason is yes take us as a joke like we actually want you to laugh we want you to keep on laughing because within the Laughing period we are building seriously so that by the time we reveal our leverage and our critical mass no one's laughing anymore and I think that was the similar Bitcoin strategy where today Bitcoin is taken as a serious asset but 14 years ago They're laughing you out the door welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless what would it look like to create a new country using crypto as a coordination technology we've explored this topic previously with Biology srinivasan he calls it the network State the idea of using crypto to create a new digital Nation it's an interesting concept of course but can it be done as Thomas Edison once said Vision Without execution is merely hallucination So today we're talking about the execution side we have a project that's seriously trying to build a new country for Africa they have a plan using crypto they have a road map what would Africa's crypto Nation actually look like that is the topic today a few benefits and takeaways number one why the nation-state experiment has failed for black people number two why Africa needs a redrawing of lines and how web3 can help number three why Africa is actually the best place to spawn a new network State movement number four what about crypto and crypto values are demanded in Africa what resonates the most and number five why aphropolitan the project we're talking about today thinks they can begin with an nft pfp project and end up with a country on the other side David What's significant to you about this episode in crypto we have a lot of very big ideas in fact we have so many Big Ideas that we don't have very many people actually trying to execute on Big Ideas more supply of ideas than we have executors of big ideas but today we're talking to some people actually trying to go after one of the biggest ideas that crypto has presented the idea of building a digital nation and not stopping there and trying to actually manifest that digital nation and the values and the infrastructure that that digital Nation produces into the real world possibly one of the hardest goals that exists but there are some Tailwinds here and I think this is a lesson that can be learned not just about the network State idea but how and why crypto is going to be adopted in general is that there are pockets of pent up demand for crypto things crypto values crypto networks crypto services and we're talking with the two founders of apropolitan about why there is so much pent-up demand across the entire con continent of Africa for something new something new from the way that people are organized and the way that infrastructure is provided to these people as the Arca of technological adoption sweeps the globe the word leapfrogging comes about but we are entering the world of crypto networks so how do we talk about the conversation of leapfrogging with some of the products and services that crypto networks provide things like money and finance of course but also things like governance and social coordination what does the word leapfrogging mean in these contexts and why Africa is primed to LeapFrog the whole rest of the calcified world into what is perhaps the next story for web3 but also perhaps the next story for Africa yeah this episode was incredibly exciting um and the project is incredibly ambitious um of course going into this you have no idea whether they can pull it off or not but you have to admire the ambition of this thing and the world changing nature if we are actually able to use crypto as a coordination mechanism to found and start new countries what sort of world does that leave us with so David I am very excited to discuss this with you in the debrief yeah of course obviously redrawing the map of Africa is a very ambitious Endeavor yet if we are correct on some Theses about crypto and what crypto supplies to the world and also we are understanding the current state of Africa and eche and Chica the two guests in this episode guide us through understanding that the idea is like yes it's super ambitious but the point of the point about the whole African continent is after the African continent is asking for this there's pent-up demand so yeah ambitious but the idea is that the Tailwinds behind this idea very easily triggers it to form into a movement at least that's the bookcase there's so much more to talk about in in the debrief of the episode I mean man we're talking about the idea of web3 coming to change the landscape of we usually would follow that with web 2 but no we're talking about the landscape of countries that were that were defined in the 1880s like finally we're getting some some churn in the world uh at least this is the the ideas that are going to be laid out in front of us today that would be a very big deal if it happens of course you

the African continent first by starting and founding a digital nation and then moving into the world of global Nation governance and ending with getting some actual physical land in the African continent and if this sounds a little bit like the idea of the bellagian network State then you're on the right track today on the show eche and Chica are going to guide us through why Africa is so primed to take a new shape aided by the power of web 3 and the principles that crypto networks have to offer the world chica welcome to bankless thank you for happiness a pleasure to be here so actually you and I ran into each other at uh zuzalu and within a few minutes into our conversation I was immediately just Goosebumps about uh this this potential this latent potential for both Africa but also for web three there's there's mutual interest here and I'm really just struck kind of like by The Audacity Of The Idea like you guys are you guys are trying to found a new country yeah which is you know an insane thing to say uh but in crypto I think we are all into the idea of very big very crazy ideas but what gives you what gives you guys the confidence the audacity to say that hey we're gonna found a new country and change the shape of Africa what gives you the motivation to even even do this actually let's start with you honestly I think for me um there are a couple of buckets like I think about this it's first we're we are descendants of people who did more with less so it's like we owe it to ourselves to do more and more and I think it's the technology today for us to do way more right so I don't think 40 50 years ago like when you take examples of other states that have been formed within 50 or 60 years I mean think about America right they were doing this without like the internet it's like hey what a new country they had to write pamphlets The Federalist Papers had to wait for it to get decimate disseminated throughout the rest of the world um but I think for us it's we actually also have no choice it's existential for where we're from right it's like one of The Inspirations for us was when Balaji said because the brand new is Unthinkable we fight over the old and we're like huh like it that just seems as a quote that encapsulates how we feel as Africans and what is it going to take for us to really transcend right and then the internet enables us today to really dream that big because it it acts as an equalizer if this was 40 50 years ago and we're talking about Network state we're still getting left out of the room now but we're not getting laughed out as much because of the tools that exist today so I think that it's just the right timing and the tools do exist for us to be able to build for that discrimination add on to that add some perspective here yeah I I spent in about eight years in Nigeria and I this is my second company right um and I remember how frustrated I was because I was running an HR software company and obviously it was a need and because of literally government and governance it was very difficult to get it off the ground and get it to the scalability that it needs um and I'm sure we're going to talk about this later but there's a lot of data sets that say that Africa is the next Frontier um it's still relatively unexplored it is the youngest continent in the world um and probably in about 50 years um probably three or four out of ten people you meet are going to be African right um and so we have to get this right and going back to what she said if ex-official this point uh right um so for me I just feel like as someone who actually lives in Lagos and saw all the potential for all the different Tech Founders trying to build something and literally a lot of times they were stuck and they were unable to scale because of governance I feel that we need something that's going to change and I don't think it's going to be building a new app or building a new technology I actually think we need to change the foundation of governance and how Africa is operating today chica what do people say when you tell them that you're like you're trying to found a country what's that what's their reaction right because like in in David was saying crypto we're used to Big audacious ideas but yeah I mean to the mainstream to the public that just sounds crazy yeah like what do people say when you say that so I typically get two responses right um so when I say we are looking to find a country it's normally like a like they've paused for a second and they're trying to reflect on like did I just hear what you said a digital country okay and then it's like okay walk me through that what does that actually look like and you should be honest I haven't had anyone write out like laugh but I do feel that you know there are people that are like that sound a little far-fetched you know and I I feel that once we start going into the details and it's like okay this makes sense or I I understand or sometimes you know they end the conversation like I still don't get it but I can see why this is needed right so I do feel that there's a lot of Education that is needed and I think also when you start sharing historical references of how other countries were formed it really helped people to really start to understand like oh this actually is possible because this is how other countries have formed in the past yeah so so of course uh We've acknowledged then that this is a big audacious idea and we're gonna you know walk into kind of the how um but before we get to sort of the how let's talk about the why and let's talk about maybe the state of Africa today at the afropolitan website you guys have published a Manifesto which I think is um is fantastic and I'm gonna read a line out of it because um these two paragraphs really really spoke to me scarcity weakness poverty wherever we look and wherever we are Africans worldwide are subjects not citizens access to Opportunities scarce security is not guaranteed for the most part life is just about surviving not thriving the nation-state experiment has failed for black people worldwide it has yielded nothing but poverty genocide police brutality ethnic Strife inflation weak government and the failure of our ecosystems what do you guys mean when you say the nation-state has failed for Africa at Jay what does that mean so specifically when I think about that um we drew inspiration from like the US founding fathers so Anthony Hamilton and Federalist ones basically says is it possible for societies of men to form a new government through reflection and choice or are we forever destined to depend on our governance through accident and force and so for us we're like no modern day nation state in Africa was created through reflection and choice it was always mostly through accident and force and so when we say the nation-state experiment has failed we're saying the way that that experiment was conducted in our African context was never actually foundationally sound right and it is obviously filled because it was always going to be a feature for it to fail right when it's a bug what it looks like is countries like Singapore or Vietnam or the Vietnamese War ended in 1975 Nigeria as a nation got its independence in 1960 so that's a full 15 years after but look at Nigeria today look at Vietnam today right night and day Singapore the Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew used to come to Africa to try to draw some inspiration for Singapore because it was still a Backwater State look at Singapore today look at a lot of the African nations today let's not even talk about the UAE right in in 1990 it was a sand desert literally look at where they are today look at where Africa a lot of African countries are today so when we speak specifically to the nation state experiment has failed we're saying we have not seen the benefits of it and in our Theory it's it's because we never actually get got to reflect and choose right and that has been the foundational underpinning for why it has felt I want to uh go a little bit into the world of history because I think a a theme that we're going to bring out in this show is that there is the belief here in the anthropolitan movement is that there's latent potential in Africa and that has been building for more than decades for like centuries and so also you know bankless listeners are probably going to be needing some some help some education about the history of Africa in order to fully understand what we're talking about here so maybe we can go back to the Berlin Conference in in the 1880s uh what was the Berlin Conference what did it do and what was the net result as it how has it defined Africa yeah so the Berlin Conference was a conference organized by like five or six of the major European powers so you're talking about countries like England France Spain Italy Belgium right and they were basically meeting together to basically decide on how Africa was going to be divided and shared right so all of them were basically having in fighting between each other so I think the German Chancellor basically called this conference and says okay this is how we're going to um divide and Africa among ourselves right and this was in 1884 I believe and it was called the Scramble for Africa and so by by 1904 at least 90 percent of most of the African land had actually been divided and and then colonized by a lot of these um uh European powers and that set the foundation again for our quote-unquote nation state experiment right because you can imagine the Berlin Conference there sitting in Berlin drawing lines on a map that are actually affecting real people on the ground so you have tribes that were you know together who got divided through those Maps you had ethnicities and religions that were not necessarily supposed to be together who just got you know thrown together take Nigeria for example like we got Amalgamated like 734 ethnicities just put into one map and then you're like hey get like you guys are forced to work together right so you're you see that um the consequences of that conference playing out over time and that has compounded We Believe for the African um story right so again the Berlin Conference a group of European powers came together how are we gonna share this African cake of a consonant he divided it into pieces everyone got a piece but the way those pieces were divided were not really in the best interests of other people on the ground and we have suffered the consequences of that even until today yeah and just to really drive this point home uh who were the African Representatives at this conference [Laughter] no none there were no African Representatives at this conference and I think that has really been what has played out for Africa in general like the world always has a plan for Africa and Africa really has a plan for the world right and I think that that's what we're looking to change even with the afropolitan network today right and the Berlin Conference are the lines that we see on the map drops yes and so till that has persisted 1880 to now so 140 years yes that has defined legally the legal jurisdictions of Africans but has been in complete disregard for actual cultural boundaries and differences and so understanding this context moving forward I think is going to be key in this episode but there's also another element that chica I want to I want to get your help on this word diaspora I think is is very foundational to this story can you define this word diaspora because we're going to need it moving forward yes and so I think it's important to uh lay out two things so number one many countries have a diaspora right and so for example China for example they have a group of people who have left China and they are in the U.S they are in Europe they're in Latin America so many different uh countries or ethnicities actually have a diaphor so I think that's important to uh put that there as a foundation so when we talk about anthropolitan what we're actually um a huge part of our community is the African diagram and to specifically Define that these are people who are black American right so they are in the U.S they can be afro-latina or Latino right and so they may be in part of uh Latin America actually one of the biggest African communities outside of Africa is in Brazil right um and in fact you will find a lot of Europe a culture which is actually belonged to Nigeria so there's a huge African diaspora in Latin America we are also in Europe we are in Asia you know we're in all parts of the world so it's essentially Africans in different parts of the world that are outside of Africa um that are considered the Opera and it's actually quite um there's different types I think also a lot of people think we're all black and we're not um if you look at Northern Africa um they you know they have different um ethnicities um some of them might be Arab um and then even to be honest if you look at at South Africa as well there are people who are um from Dutch origin um who have now become South African and some of them have left and they consider themselves part of the African diaspora so not only are we multi-faceted as far as where we spread across the world but also um ethnicity wise we are quite diverse and they're part of the African diaspora even though they're not living within the the nation-state and boundaries of Africa in all of the countries represented in Africa be because they subscribe to the African nation let's say one of the foundational I think ideas um for me and kind of understanding this concept of a digital nation was uh when biology came onto the bankless show this is I think his second episode on Bank list we'll include a link in the show notes guys so so you can get up to speed on his concept of a digital Nation because I think it's very much influenced the afropolitan movement but um the the the term nation state has two separate words inside of it like the first is nation and the second is State and nation is uh um separate than the idea of state so a nation is a shared culture a shared set of values it's almost akin to a kind of a tribe all right and so um that is the actual like cultural identity of a given uh people group right and that is separate from the the concept in the term state so state is is almost like the pro protocol that is the set of laws and regulations so um the U.S Constitution that that is part of the the nation-state protocol of the United States but it's different than the concept of of nation and what part part of what you're saying I think is yeah you know uh the history of Africa is really this division in terms of arbitrary borders and it's the state type protocol without kind of the nation and so this is um I I think an important concept for for people to to really understand is when we open up the the idea of um entering into a new nation apparatus people don't have to live in the same geography people have don't have to live within the same state uh boundaries we can redefine the state boundaries to be something else and that's what you're doing here with the afropolitan movement how many people are in the African diaspora so there are 150 million people worldwide if it was a country it'll be the 10th largest country in the world so we're talking about an absolutely like a very large population set and and growing very fast yes extremely large and I think something thing also interesting is that number one it's a group that even in Africa they have been trying to figure out and they've been asking themselves how do we pack into this Market because the interesting thing about the African diaspora is many of them come home right whether it's through the December you know we call this the homecoming um Ghana has officially labeled it as the year of return and we're going to talk about this later and what's interesting about the year of return is that not only has for example Ghana opened it up to ghanaians and then diaspora but literally the President also has to open it up to either black Americans and said yes you know for you know obvious reasons you have left but we're opening this home back to you and you can come here and you have a place and you have you know a structure and so I think the African asper is quite it's quite big but also the African Union has been trying to figure out how can they Connect into this group and I think also because of the cultural elements are happening now through afrobeats through fashion through film um and you can see this on Netflix you can see this on you know a different concerts I think there's a lot of interest in this specific group as well can we talk a little bit about the the solution you're proposing here and I think in order to to get to you uh explaining aphropolitan we have to explain the concept of a network State and uh actually where were you when you first kind of heard about this concept and uh you know what impact did it have and maybe could you help Define it for listeners yeah no definitely so I remember Balaji releases his first article called how to start a new country in April 2021 and I was in the car Senegal I remember like I'm up at 5 00 am reading this and my mind is blown I think like I said a particular quote that really hooked me was what he said because the brand new is Unthinkable we fight over the old I basically saw where Balaji was talking about because prior to that we had done the year of return in 2019 we're about a million plus people from the dashboard came to Ghana and then in 2020 because of covid we pivoted into media but through a social audio app called Clubhouse so in clubhouse Alpha Bolton and between Ayan Chico we built a community online community on there of about 200 000 people collectively so in 2021 when Balaji says hey he's proposing this idea of a network State he defines it as a highly aligned online community with a capacity for Collective action that's able to crowdfund territory around the world and eventually gain diplomatic recognition from pre-existing States it's a mouthful but how we basically broke it down was to say to ourselves okay when we were running our clubhouse communities we showed a capacity for Collective action we funded things like the Ethiopian Refugee crisis during the Ethiopian Civil War we we funded the police brutality protest in Nigeria and we organized around Clubhouse so we were able to even send Bitcoin to the the protesters in Nigeria and we organized that through a highly aligned online community and so when he then said okay you're able to crowdfund territory around the world we basically liking that to us bringing a million plus people from the diaspora to Ghana right and they were actually physically on land um and then he says um the next part is like gaining diplomatic recognition from three existing States we're not there yet obviously that's what we're working but to me it was like these are building blocks right like they're they're proof of Concepts right if you start to break it into it's each Elemental um um identity you're like it's not that far-fetched like you've already shown a capacity for Collective action you've already shown a possibility to have a highly aligned online community right you you need to crowdfund territory around the world right and you can start off as something as simple as like potential B works right in different places in the world and then you build up those uh uh Chinatown type models as you scale and then the pre-existing um State recognition is the one that you're really optimizing for because then you ensure your sovereignty at scale so that that was our definition from the network state there are a few elements that I want to pull out of apologies Network State idea that I think can carry Us in through into the next bit of the conversation but balaji's like Network Tech idea came from like potentially like aligning like-minded and like like cultured people and some of the examples would be like uh let's make a network state that has the freedom of of research in certain like a network State without the FDA and that would allow for certain people to do certain things and but he kind of gave or like people talked about the network States in very narrow senses but we we were just going through like some of the what we're calling the latent potential of Africa as a continent and the the other theme that I think has that's been um used about Africa and his relationship with technology is this word called like leapfrogging right like there was no landlines ever established in Africa it just went straight until uh cellular devices right and so I think perhaps what we're talking about here and and what the afroopolitan movement is trying to do is we're trying to LeapFrog governance you know [Laughter] the idea is like why can we do this whereas like yo if we make a network State that's about like uh you know freedom to innovate across like FDA regulations that's one thing but what about the freedom to be a nation that the African continent has never had before yes and so I I think that this is kind of the energy that that we're tapping into and so yeah maybe you guys can talk about just like connect the need of Africa to have a voice and the solutions that a network State at least proposes as a potential path forward chica you want to take us home on this one yeah so I feel like number one you know there's many problems like we could be here all day talk about that I will talk about something that I think is probably the most relatable um and it's something that we not that we necessarily shared we're in the same space with the zollu right um so Africans having the just as much Mobility as an American right and I feel that um today in Africa there are many African citizens who have difficulties not only being able to travel in Europe in America right because the Visa is quite long um and to be honest quite the meaning of all the different documents they require as an African to travel to many of these countries but even within Africa right um so for example if uh Nigerian wants to travel to Zanzibar as an American I can show up to Zanzibar right now and I get in right all I got to do is if it's on arrival and Nigerian actually has to wait a month to three months right yeah yeah we that's it we're supposed to go to the same for South Africa yeah South Africa so we were supposed to travel to Zanzibar and basically because of uh the Nigerian passport we basically half of our time that we're supposed to be in Denver with Ben still waiting in Kenya to get our Visa back right um and so there's a lot of just like challenges even with mobility and I think kind of the bigger issue here is that Africa needs to trade within each other right in order for us to get to our full potential we have to be able to do things among each other so I feel that there's a voice that needs to be had um when it comes to just simple Mobility like I just want to leave Nigeria and fly into London like as simple as that is and most people can just wake up and do that most a lot of Africans cannot right um and so we're hoping that as anthropolitan we're already having many conversations with different government entities around right what does a Visa look like for acropolitans right and just giving that simple ability to have move around right um so I think there's many other things we could talk about but that's just the one that comes top of Mind especially because me and AJ travel so much and it's something that's constantly top of mind for us yeah the the um bargaining power that yeah uh cohered Africa uh could get from this I think is is what we're really going after and yeah really This falls into the category of what I see the this movement going towards is trying to give Africans a voice for the first time they didn't have it in 1880 when the lines were drawn uh in in Europe about Africa yeah and and perhaps the African voice has been like robbed of being actually able to speak because the the tribal boundaries and the tribal groups have been divided and that it's been there's been a friction a lack of resonance between the legal topology and the cultural tribes and so how do you see this whole like Pursuit of a network State movement and the relationship of Africans having a voice actually I don't want to take one yeah so and I think you you really nailed it on the head David so again it's about organizing around shared values and purpose right so um a lot of tribes infight among each other saying hey you're not for my tribe so I can't vote for you right but no African State can point to the benefits that anyone has gotten from voting from somebody who's something to try right like it's not like oh hey we're from the same place I vote for you now we have access to facilities or Healthcare or whatever it's not working so now it's like how do we go back to now organizing around shared values and purpose and this cuts across borders right so I think when we read balaji's Network State the first critical part was that highly aligned online community like hey guys we're we're not aligning just based on race or tribe or sex or gender we're aligning based on our shared values of where we see ourselves in the world and I think again the internet enables us to do that at scale so imagine if you were on Facebook as a country with its own currency right but this time instead of an online passive Network it's a digital Republic right and the citizens are organized around those shared values and purpose that's that's the way I see it what do you think think some of those shared values are actually what do you gotta zero on in on one of the first ones was and like I gave the context of because the brand new is Unthinkable we fight over the old remember in our Manifesto you spoke about the scarcity right one of our biggest ideologies is an ideology of abundance right and I'll tell a quick story around why that ideology is one that we chose I I grew up among the first um young African immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area to break into Tech so my friends were folks who worked at Facebook or Google or Netflix or whatever right and they were the first ones in their families to earn six figure salaries and the change in their um family life or even in a community was very noticeable so over time we would maybe go out for dinners or for lunch and folks would be rushing to put their card down to pay for everyone's meal right and that's because they now lived in an environment of abundance I in in terms of like my my community you would see people say hey I'm a plant Dad I'm a plant mom but those things people in Africa would not have time to be plant dads or moms because they were in a state of survival right and so like one of my friends Stanley like I'll go to his house he would wake up in the morning and pick up a plant or a water bucket and water 63 plants in a patient manner I'm laughing because this sounds like David right now are you a plant Dad I've never heard that term right would you would you uh identify oh my God oh my God so my friend Stanley though that same man put him in back in Nigeria or put him back in Africa he would not have time or even the thought process to care about the welfare of a plant and so for us abundance allows us to aim for absolute human flourishing like what does that actually look like for us as Africans and it seems like for a lot of us we have to flee Africa to tap into that and I think for us that's the that's the narrative that we have to we want to change throughout for paulton and one of those core values is a is an ideology of abundance like how do we have an abundance mindset how do we play long-term games with long-term people right and I think folks like Naval have also helped like underline our philosophy with the movement as well so yes you know what's really interesting about this idea of abundance that you're talking about eche is um it reminds me of kind of the the memes of the United States of America right this land end of opportunity and uh you might agree or disagree on whether America has kind of lost that and the reality is not quite what uh what the meme appears to be but but that is the underlying philosophy that that is why America has been a place for immigrants uh over the decades and over the centuries it's because it has provided through its nation and through its state through its uh culture and through its set of opportunities that the the protocol provides like the Constitution it has provided an economy yeah a land of opportunity and it strikes me that if digital nations want to attract a population they are going to have to embrace that idea of abundance and they're almost going to need to maybe create opportunities create economies I'm wondering how you think about that and this gets into what the shape of afropolitan actually is because I am hookah Line and Sinker like I love the ideas that biology presents in the idea of a of kind of a network state right and you know I've I've read uh the network State we've had balajiyani's kind of explained it I'm just um I love it I it's just I hope like I'm there the one question that I have in my mind is okay biology is one of these people who kind of lays out the vision right and then kind of like disappears and he's like now everyone go do it right and so now we're on this execution point and it almost seems like a you know step one start an online community dot dot dot found a country at the other I think I'm like how do we get from the online community to Country it's all it's this these dot dot dots these ellipses in the middle that I haven't quite seen executed and I feel like aphropolitan uh you guys are actually trying to fill in those dots you're trying to take this staged approach to what it actually means to start with an on online community and evolve to and actually let's talk about the end destination remember that ambition that we talked about the end destination is some sort of un recognized World recognized legitimate territory uh with some land somewhere um that's the end state but but how do you get there what are what are the stages uh that you guys have laid out for the afropolitan uh movement here yeah so I could talk about stage one um because that's the stage uh we're in that we've completed and it's an ongoing stage and they actually can talk about stage two so when we were saying okay we need to start uh online community as I mentioned before me and Edge are quite successful in starting many online communities right and the most recent one before this one was actually our clubhouse community and we were able to show that okay not only do we get on clubhouse and talk about you know what's happening of the day we actually can move towards Collective action but when we relaunch acropolitan with the manifesto what we realized is that wait actually we need to make sure that the people who join us are actually aligned to this vision and yes we have this huge Community with us but not everybody can come in this first phase right and it was very important that we said we built a network right and this network is very close-knits right and so when we were looking at how we were going to actually apply this um in the web 3 space what we actually saw was nfts right and you know you've seen a lot of these nfps they're great tight-knit communities um and there's a lot of them that are doing different things for the collective actions and we felt that for onboarding a group of people who may or may not have inter um interacted with webp before this was probably the easiest way to do it and so we decided on 500 right um 500 people who would represent our founding citizens and what's interesting about it was it was a very Collective group of how we even awarded these 500 people so we first said okay we're gonna do nfts and we wanted to make sure that the art pulled a story and it was um quite connected to the African abundance experience and so the first step was we reached out to an afropology member her name is joy and she actually created a whole story for us right um and this story was just these gods and goddesses is and if we work we create this new world what would it look like right and she created that storyline for us um and that was kind of the underpinning of the art and so once we have the story we're like okay who's going to create this art for us and honestly how we found the artist Augusta I love him to Dad he's 21 very young just fresh um we actually saw him on Twitter so I was just on Twitter and someone retweeted his art on my timeline and I was like my God this is it like it just like it was this very like April like goddess like it was just it was just beautiful and so I was like this guy gets it so we spoke to him and we sold him on the vision and he was like I love this I I want to be part of this and so we spent a few months just pulling out the different art pieces and I think for us what was very important was that the art represented the African diaspora right and so if you actually look at the different NFC pieces it is from like um white all the way to very dark right um and even those with uh patigler and also just different you know um characteristics of the African diaspora and also the clothes as well so we made sure that North Africa and southern Africa and West and East all of those pieces were represented in the ark um and then we basically had an application process which is quite counterintuitive to most nft projects uh typically there's a lot of fomo and it's like oh we're selling it's this amount and there's like this quick Bid to Buy and we said no we need to make sure everyone's aligned and so we had an application process we had thousands of people apply and as a community because we actually have community members involved we actually one by one looked at each application um and those who were accepted were able to Mint um so today we have 500 people who are afropolitan citizens you can see it on open c um it is one of the few NFC collections where basically everyone is holding um because they really believe in our vision and um I think for us now we've been doing a lot of community networking uh there's a lot of specific events and programming that we do for the afropolitan community but that's really phase one was just getting pure alignment um and I think the NFC as they serve as our passports so people have a sense of pride of holding those nfts and it's a way for them to show that they're actually citizens of this nation that we're building yeah I want to hang on the subject really quick just to I think there's like a optimistic way of of talking about this and then there's the cynical way of talking about this uh so phase one of more of which we're going to go into so phase one implies of phase two and we'll get to face two in a second to me maybe this is like the establishing the digital Community phase uh but like the Senate the cynical take is like okay we're going to start a network State we're going to there's so much latent demand and purpose for doing this in Africa and now we're talking about an nftp project right so like that that's the cynical take right and then the the ambitious the the take that that I would like to lean into is like well nft pfps these are the icons of your digital representation yeah these are the the badges of your digital cultural self this is the identification of an in-group and an out group right like this is our tribe this is our community we've talked about this in the context of other pfps but I think the anthropolitan is taking this and actually putting rubber down onto pavement with this which is like hey all of the the azuki tribe that is currently having some drama on Twitter yeah like the the crypto Punk like blurry lines of a tribe these are all tribes but you guys are taking this into the actual hey we are going to establish our digital online nation and we're using these pfps but overall like how does this PFE strategy fit into phase one and like again please define phase one a little bit more uh more for us like the the establishment of the online footprint of the afropolitans like overall the color in the rest of the picture here I I think it was very important because you could start a digital Nation you don't need to utilize blockchain for that right but why put pfps or start off with nfcs in the first place remember from our African context we have scarcity we have corruption we have a low trust society and I think those principles that blockchain enable us to have whether it's accountability or transfer transparency or immutability was what we wanted to bring to the community even from a governance perspective so we're like hey your identity will be on blockchain it can be tracked it's transparent your community treasury will be on blockchain you can see where the wallets go where the money is going to again using those building blocks to show people like hey this is going to be different from our status quo because you you want a governance structure that's going to be held accountable so I'll tell you a quick story um my family sold some land to like the Mormon Church in in Nigeria and they wanted to build roads in the town and then the government is like hey no just give us the money we'll do it I mind you the government doesn't ever do anything so they're going to steal the money and so the church is like no we should do it because we know we're going to actually do it and then they're like um no just build the road up to your church and then that's it so when you go to the town all you see in the Mormon church is the tart Road really paved that starts at the beginning of the church and ends right outside of the church right and then the rest of the world that's um owned by the government is just in in tatters right and the example that I give with blockchain there is imagine a community has its Treasury in on the blockchain and you make it a milestone thing where hey if we say the government gives this contract to this contractor we can ensure it gets done because before the funds get disclosed fully they have to show proof of work or potentially proof of stick these are some of the principles we're looking to bring to the governance side of things and that was why it was very important that we said to our community like Hey we're going to go use blockchain and because on the blockchain we believe that we can increase transparency accountability and also obviously the immutable aspects of it to help engineer that trust where it's like don't just take me and chica's word for anything verify right like we want to move we want to really ensure that that trust is built from a nation-building perspective and so I can understand the skepticism when people are like oh now we're talking about pfps it's not to say that your pfp eventually has to be your actual password for entry the reason we chose the art passports was when we decided to go on this project David you have to understand where we are starting from most Africans connected from our history right and so for us it was like we can't know where we're going until we have a firm understanding of where we're coming from and most great civilizations in the world have built off mythology have built of art when you think about European Renaissance so we were basically just recreating that within our story but utilizing blockchain and nfts to tell that story and that was why phase one had to be us attracting the best of the best Africa and our diaspora and even our allies had to offer across board through multiple sectors yeah I I mean I'm I'm definitely willing to lean into the optimistic element of this like one thing I'll say is I think yeah people the the nft brand name is tarnished from um you know 2020 to kind of shenanigans um but but let's look at this from a base principles perspective all right so this is a piece of on-chain property yes that no nation state no colonialists no group of the United Nations can actually take away from visuals okay that's number one number two it's borderless yes anyone can access it uh there there's no permission required all you need is an internet connection uh number three this can be a form of identity so the idea of uh an nft being some sort of passport in the future of course that's necessary if you want to achieve governance if you want to vote that sort of thing and then the last point which I think you're getting to uh etchy is nfts can also serve as a unit of cultural expression and think of like the the memes that forming a nation requires right you think of Betsy Ross and The Star-Spangled Banner you know her sewing these stars and kind of a flag and someone could dismiss that and say well it's just a piece of cloth but but it it it created such symbolism in The Narrative of an early nation of the United States that if it kind of stuck and people rallied around it so of course in early nation state would would need some sort of uh cultural expression and cultural units and that's what an nft can provide so that is maybe the the bull case uh for all of this arbitrum is accelerating the web 3 landscape with a suite of secure ethereum scaling Solutions hundreds of projects have already deployed

the description below does that resonate at all definitely definitely yeah right yeah it does resonate the the part that I heard that that I really want to draw out is um the commitment to blockchain values and I think it may be maybe maybe the pfp has in the grand Arc of apropolitan overall a minor role in the whole thing except what it really does is it plants a flag and saying hey we are committing to the values embodied by the blockchain is as some podcast co-host says if you adopt crypto protocols you adopt crypto values that's right I say that right so it may and so that's the part that I've really heard out of essays like yeah if you call it just a you know be overly cynical and call it a pfp but it does the job of committing to certain values that are embodied in web3 and and commits that as like hey this is a part of our digital Nation DNA so you've got that as the base you've got the nfts that's part of um phase one here so now let's fill in some of the rest of the dots so now you have an on-chain Community uh with um some sort of identity assigned to it some sort of cultural expression right what what does phase two look like and then also fill in phase three and phase four how do we get from uh nfts all the way to a country [Laughter] so so the idea for phase two what we're calling it is government as a service but the way we're thinking it through that is eventually it's this platform that allows us to unlock internal economy among this digital Community right so the Afghan dashboard today sends home 70 billion dollars what the remittances back home how can we help facilitate that even within this platform you can think things like Risk Capital things like self-server night D um again like why I'm so um drawn on this physical Network state phase two aspect of it is if if you're able to utilize crypto the way I see crypto from an African perspective it's it's a back door to Financial Freedom for a lot of Africans right the traditional Financial ecosystem does not work for us basically alienates us at scale but through crypto or crypto principles we're able to reimagine a financial ecosystem that actually allows us to become insiders for the first time so we are systematically locked out whether it's like from freedom of Mobility whether it's freedom to transact crypto brings us into the conversation like you said crypto gives us that voice so with phase two what we envision it is hey there's a there's a potential super app you're able to do things like get loans defy loans so you're able to get um send money back home you're able to get yourself Sovereign ID within that ecosystem as well similar to like the Estonia plague that Estonia was able to develop we're looking to build that within phase two as well and then going into phase three what we're calling that is the minimum viable state which is how do we build up The credibility needed to be viewed as a country one day like chica said like when you tell the average person like hey we want to go start a new country there's always that look of I thought you were a serious person now I got it yeah where I can put you in but the thing is how do you build up that credibility and so for us last September we got recognized by the New York Stock Exchange as the first ever internet country for the Afghan diaspora so we basically went up there we got to ring the bell we brought our community together that level of access the New York Stock Exchange is a 200 year old institution so think about them recognizing your your movement tomorrow it could be the United Nations so it's a perception play other than that you're collecting stamps of approval you're collecting it's legitimacy yeah you can see as you go right and also we provide visa and arrival services for a lot of anthropolitan citizens today to four African countries so Nigeria Ghana Kenya and Tanzania again the way I like to position phase three it's almost like an Amazon Amazon Prime type of thing where Amazon says to me like Hey we're gonna charge you 20 extra for your Amazon Prime membership I'm like yo go ahead because you've shown me so much value that I could trust you where you're always improving and I think for us we're positioning ourselves for that level of legitimacy where people should our citizens should come to trust us that we're operating in their best interest where if we then say to the world like hey we have delivered this much value to you in phase three when we're then going for um recognition from pre-existing States you don't have critical mass and leverage to make that argument so then phase four for us is where the land piece comes in but we want to innovate on that piece because today when you think about a nation state you're thinking about a four corner border we want our border to stretch across the entire world what would that look like we want to combine two concepts together one is an embassy and the other one is a Chinatown so take for example maybe the U.S embassy in Ghana for example is a sovereign territory and a host government in chinatowns they have their own post office their own malls their own banking they hold like just little comments within the town you want to combine an embassy plus a Chinatown for a sovereign Africa town right and so then let's zoom out just to summarize right you're not for paulton citizen you navigate the world with the alpha calls and passport you're able to make payments for goods and services using that for calls and cryptocurrency within the afropolitan platform you're also able to get physical and tree into afrotown Sovereign afro towns located across the world and that is in a nutshell the phases that we're going to each face obviously has nuances involved so in something like phase three you could start off with a free trade zone before you actually get to the afro town but you're you're putting down building blocks before you get to the overall final version of a fully recognized uh sovereign country so let me uh see if I can summarize this and and see if I got got this correctly so phase one we talked about that uh we'll move we'll move straight into into phase two phase two you're calling it government as a service yes my interpretation is like grow utility to Africans I mean be useful to Africans and maybe you're saying like hey web3 and crypto does a lot of useful things for Africans and we are simply going to figure out how to be like a service provider consultant uh assistant uh to connecting the dots between the value that webview can provide to the the Africans that need web3 and then the idea is like all these Africans are like oh this was really useful this acropolitan thing is kind of cool I'm going to stick around and grow and I'll and I'll ascribe myself to the part of the afropolitan digital nation and so you you get legitimacy from Africans the people right and so that's phase two phase three is okay now that we have our digital footprint print our online footprint from phase one we have a growing population of supporters and people legitimizing our value that we're providing them from phase two we go to phase three and which is minimum viable State yeah and that is acquire recognition and legitimacy from authorities just get external powers that be to give like the thumbs up to oh afropolitan that is a real thing that we are going to contend with they have power they have legitimacy uh we are going to acknowledge their existence and their influence and they will have as we here is their seat at the table uh afropolitan please sit right here next shoulder shoulder with the rest of us uh and so that's phase three and then phase four is like acquire land yes anywhere anywhere where you can get it anywhere where it's appropriate anywhere where it's relevant put an embassy there create a a Chinatown version of afropolitan and then all of a sudden we don't have it's not about producing one Central Hub of anthropolitan it's about many many many satellites wherever African culture emerged wants to be there these are the phases yes these are the phases I think for me two questions kind of arise that might be in listener's mind right now is one is do I have to forsake my citizenship of my nation state in order to join afropolitan or can I be a dual Citizen and maybe the the second question kind of dovetails with the first which is uh is aphropolitan trying to replace the services of a nation-state I mean are you guys going to take like let's say uh Healthcare or court system you know like rule of law obviously uh crypto gives you some of that you can see the property rights layer but is this a competitor to the nation-state or is it more like a a supplemental type of uh status uh so yeah you know how do you think about that so to the first question um like let's say we were all citizens of Switzerland on this call and I said hey David hey Ryan we want to start a new country your first thought is why what's wrong with this one right it's like you already have stuff that works for most Africans when you propose this idea they're like no we don't even know what good governance or even like being a functional nation state actually even looks like so for us what we're saying is nation states need competition in every other business right companies have competition nation states don't have competition and so what then happens is you can be a citizen of Nigeria your government has no incentive really to really come through because where are you gonna go right you can't just go to the US easily they're not going to give you visas you can't just immigrate out like it's really one of the top one percent that get those opportunities to even you're stuck you're essentially geo-locked because of the place you were you were born you were born and so for us it's like how do we introduce a hedge where you're like one of the reasons you migrate out is for a better opportunity or optionality right what if that opportunity and those optionalities can come to you via the Internet right and then you can then point to your government and say hey how come after Baltimore citizens get this why don't we get that right and you're seeing those benefits go to people who actually look like you versus us being there and saying hey Americans get these benefits or the French get these benefits and we don't what's going on so if you're able to introduce some sort of competition where folks on the ground can say hey I'm an African citizen and I get access to this this and this why are my government's not doing the same now in terms of work whether we're looking to be supplemental versus competitive I think there's a balancing act right you don't want to really be too antagonistic from Get Go what you are saying though is can we act as a supplementary arm to what your government is unable to do for you today and really execute it in a high on a high level right so for example there are Partnerships that we could have with the governments of Ghana where they're like looking to attract like maybe tourism or FDI which is how we started out for the year of return that is a win-win relationship but the idea for us is you shouldn't have to forgo your opportunity on optimizing your life just because of what you happen to be born into like that is just even a ridiculous like starting point and so for us it's the afropology networks they can serve as that hedge where it's like hey if it's a dual passport yes but if you get to choose which Prosper is working for you in this particular situation so sometimes you could use your Amax sometimes you could use your Visa right like it's like what points are you actually going to get from producing this particular passport at this entry point so maybe there are spaces in which being a Nigerian or the Nigerian passport gets you a better access or maybe there are more spaces where having an athropolitan membership and after parts and passport gets you more access the idea is get optionality get an opportunity and get optionality and opportunities into into the ecosystem because that doesn't really exist at scale within the nation state framework yeah and I just want to add because I am a dual citizen right so I have American citizenship I also have Nigerian citizenship and to be honest I love having both and I like having the optionality of both there are things about the US that I have been able to benefit off of I think probably number one is education right um but then in the later part of my you know in my or my recent part of my goal year I really have been able to um take the opportunity of having a Nigerian citizenship and it's as simple as because Nigeria is part of ecowas I am able to travel across you know all of West Africa with my one Nigerian passport so I see an proposal passport is the same thing right where we don't want people to feel like oh I have to give up my you know my passport but again there's additional benefit that you can get from the acropolitan passport something as simple as payments right because today uh payments across different African countries is quite brutal it's not fun um it's not uh friendly and I feel that if we are able to solve for that and people are able to leverage that then they can think oh yeah like when I'm traveling across Africa I can easily do payments but also when I'm back in the US I can your payment into some African countries I think it's being able to utilize both right yeah chica let me just do a big plus one on that I'm a I have a dual citizenship as well I'm a dually so Canada and and the United States and it's fantastic it's great it's just like a fantastic Fringe benefit and uh I would love to join other digital Nations I think everyone should be a dual citizen um I I want to ask you guys another question here because uh David was talking earlier about earning that seat at the table earning uh legitimacy and for I think a lot of early nation states that has actually required violence that is actually a required Revolution that has actually required War I know afropolitan of course is very much this is an opt-in movements you're not you're certainly not calling for any of those things but I guess my question is is is is is broader is do you think that if nation states are threatened by what network states are essentially doing you think they're going to let you in to the to the club here yeah you guys don't even have a tank yeah I think I think this strategy is you want them to take you as a joke right like if I went to the 19th and said hey we're trying to do a digital Nation a digital country they laugh you out the room to do that is the same reason you wanted them to laugh at Bitcoin right it was a hahaha you're buying Bitcoin with pizza hahaha it's a joke it's a gimmick 13 14 years later no one's joking no one's laughing right and it's like yeah laughter in the years that they're laughing to really build in a serious way right because even like you're saying like aren't you giving a surgery away I'm telling you like you go try to talk to an African official today and say hey these guys are trying to start a virtual country in a digital country and blah blah blah blah they're just laughing you out the door right and the reason is yes take us as a joke like we actually want you to laugh we want you to keep on laughing because within the Laughing period we are building seriously so that by the time we reveal um our leverage and our critical mass no one's laughing anymore and I think that was the similar Bitcoin strategy where today Bitcoin is taken as a serious asset but 14 years ago They're laughing you out the door and I think that that is the same strategy here which is we don't want to frontal assault we don't want to go get tanks we don't need to do that the the historical context I draw with this is back in the day Harriet Tubman had like the Underground Railroad right which you got the slaves to freedom in Canada through the Underground Railroad with another work state you're building the overground railroad right which is like hey the internet serves as that cloud service and you don't need to go protest physically you don't need to go say hey pick up a gun or do whatever just opt out to opt into this network State and then let's amass our critical mass and leverage through the network State um Paradigm and I think that is the strategy here I don't think you need to have tax but you you want them to laugh at you in fact you encourage people to laugh at you because you're focusing on the folks who are actually aligned with you and building with them as you go so yes but also I want to offer another angle that I feel a few people are talking about this but I I think it's even more relevant to what we're building so I think even before coven uh if you were trying to have a conversation around how can a country and this organization partner together it might have been like what are we talking about well scope it happened a lot of countries realize like oh we cannot rely on tourism we actually need human capital people coming here into our country and adding actually productive hours to our GDP so what's been interesting on our journey is quite a number of countries have actually said we're actually interested in having conversations of what that looked like with apropolitan right and even if it just starts off as simple as you know being able to issue visas right which solves a lot of problems for many of the African um citizens right it's a start so I actually think that a lot of countries because of what going on in the world they're actually more interested in being open and having a conversation and a lot of countries in Europe are getting older like they're aging and Africa um provides a young fresh human capital of people and so I think that's also the advantage that acropolitan has is like hey we have Young Smart minds of entrepreneurs Builders innovators let's have a conversation of what that looks like in order to bring this group of people into your or your country right so I think that's another angle to think about yeah I think that's a brilliant angle I mean let's let's not forget that another uh you know equivalent path to uh achieving legitimacy rather than kind of like you know Monopoly on violence type of thing is the strength of your economy and it is true that Africa has a massive amount of energy potential right now and there's so much latent potential you just look at kind of demographics and population growth compared to much of the rest of the world and it's completely massive I um I want to talk about uh crypto for a minute so crypto in Africa of course one of the things I was thinking of going into this conversation is like the services that state provides its citizens I mean let's remember we are yes we are geographically bound and we are all born into a nation but the um the bargain we have with our nation state is that they provide a set of services for an individual and in return in exchange we provide you know consent of the governed yes I I will kind of opt into this and we will pay taxes we will pay for these Services right and some of the services they provide are a money system a Fiat system a banking system that's often tied together a property rights system so that if I own a specific piece of physical property someone can't take it from me they provide civil rights so the Bill of Rights would be an example embedded in kind of the Constitution they provide security which we've talked about they provide rule of law they provide a way to express societal consensus through governance so in a Democratic Republic of course that is a vote one person one vote of course and it strikes me that at least some of these boxes can kind of be checked by crypto infrastructure all right so I mean you're on the bankless podcast right we got the money and banking thing that we've been working on for a long time and it strikes me that a digital Nation like afropolitan can just kind of tap into that so uh can you explain a little bit more obviously we've talked about nfts but how else does crypto uh fit into this picture so um I remember watching Balaji come on here and talk about the whole Bitcoin um like get your money out of the U.S system the whole thing and if he had like if he had been speaking to a Nigerian audience would have just been like we'd already been done that bro like okay where have you been right and I think it's because other people are always wondering why aren't I why is Nigeria one of the top countries where crypto adoption is taking place is because we fundamentally understand as a people that we have leaders we can trust institutions we can't trust and money we can trust so uh chica could give an example when she first moved back in 2015 the naira which is our local currency to the dollar was 150 to one today it is 800 to 1. so if you are a Nigerian and you had kept your savings or your Investments you have seen that decimated across the board and so it's it's something I hope Americans or even Canadians never get to experience when you wake up and you see your money hacked I mean that has to be such a breach of trust it is a huge breach of trust so when crypto or Bitcoin came to the party I doubt the average Nigerian has read the Bitcoin white paper but they understood intuitively what type of time it was which was like look this is a hedge against the nonsense of the government this is a store of value I can actually put my faith in so it's almost like it went from in God we trust on the Fiat paper to encode We Trust right because they're like look I can trust the code because what happens is when Bitcoin goes down by whatever percent it affects everyone equally in the world right so if Bitcoin is down like five percent today if you're in New Zealand if you're in Ghana if you're in the US we can all see it and it's transparent but in our system in a traditional you know Fiat system you don't know the policies that are made and all of it is convoluted but what you do know though is your money has just basically been poofed overnight and so for us it was like crypto enables us to really ensure that freedom to transact but the transparency that comes with it as well because you're willing to say okay if if this is if this is happening in Bitcoin and it's happening everywhere in the world that's a fairer process but you can't be in Nigeria where you might have worked doubly hard or you've even gotten more Revenue this year 10x revenue and then your currency gets devalued overnight and you're like yo what what just happened like what is going on and you have no ability to even affect or even to change that because again by virtue of where you're born and what it does is it limits your upside to be able to tap into Financial Freedom or even financial services at Scout so with crypto like I said it acts as a back door for a lot of Africans and even after politics to that Financial Freedom because in crypto you're not judged by the color of your skin or by what you happen to be born into it's just download a wallet and get access into the financial ecosystem and and I've seen that um happen with creators within our ecosystem where before maybe PayPal or stripe won't process payments in Africa for whatever reason right but now because they're they're accepting payments through ethereum or through a crypto wallet that no longer stops them from having the freedom to transact and so for us the cryptocurrency or even the principles of crypto are very important to the movement because the idea is like there are three core values the freedom of Mobility Freedom to transact and then freedom to thrive not not just to survive and I think that that's something that I mean everyone in the world deserves but Africans especially even deserve more because of where we're starting from one of the things that you said in phase two essay about government as a service you dropped the very very small line of a afropolitan cryptocurrency yeah uh what is the thought behind that uh is this the where we're gonna make a currency for the afropolitan nation what was the theory here so again the idea is like we want money that we can trust and access the store of value Bitcoin overseas serves like is an example of what that can look like I won't say that we have developed that out yet extensively today but the idea is leveraging those principles right and I think for us it's just across the board like for example if I go to Kenya with Nigerian money I can't Transit I can't change that money for Kenyan money I have to change my money to Dollars first and then use dollars to change into Kenyan shillings right and so even an intra-african trading we don't trust each other's monies for very good reason right and so for us it's like how do we actually reimagine it's not just a governance play but it's also a financial ecosystem play which is if you can leverage crypto it allows for more borderless transactions today if I want to send money from Nigeria to Ghana it first has to go to New York City Bank or whatever get charge fees before it gets to Ghana these rules don't help us right or the way the system is currently set up really actually keeps us out as Outsiders and so for us crypto not enables us to reimagine this where like you no longer have to go to a bank and worry hey I might not receiving a loan because I'm black I might not receiving refinancing because I'm black no just trusting the code I let the code make that decision versus the current systems that we have which again is why we're also big kinds of Bank list because within that we no longer have to rely on the benevolence of whether a person is good or a person is bad we just all submit to the code and if the code works today cool but we know it's not because they're trying to keep us out it's just it's it applies to everyone equally and that's what we want there's a line in the bankless lore uh that we've uh invoked a number of times uh and it's come comes from Van Spencer when he asked uh about certain D5 protocol Founders if they're about that life and this is in contrast to Founders that want to uh form an equity company and potentially go public on a public uh you know the NASDAQ if you're going to be a D5 protocol founder and issue a token you've got to be about that life differently and so I want to invoke that question but inside of this brand new context because you guys are doing something completely different than just founding a D5 protocol yeah y'all are trying to found a country so I don't even know how you know the answer to are you really about that life but it's a question about eche and Chica as Founders how do why you two why are how do you guys know that you guys are able to ultimately spawn a movement that redraws the lines of Africa how do you know that you're about that life yeah so I think there's a couple of things about me and Ed Shea uh so we've been building Community for over 10 plus years right um and I think funny enough someone talks about this like how can you build a community when you haven't brought people together at a dinner table right so if you have not been able to do that you have no business of finding anything of this nature right and me and NJ have convened people all walks of life different ethnicities different types of people over and over and over again over 10 plus years I think we take Community Building seriously so this is the reason why even as we speak right now um our community members are creating a whole DNA initiative project and like figuring out what is the DNA of afropolitan um because it's very important that they are part of the identity but I also think for this to work from the African National perspective you have to find two people who are about the actual Biafra right and it's not just a Nigerian thing so me and NJ yes we are both Nigerian uh but we are very um it's very keen for us that we find people from Egypt from South Africa from Kenya from Ghana and literally like we've been almost like these ambassadors we're flying over to all these different countries and we're actually connect I think and meeting those people and every time we go to a new country we say hey acropologists and those who are not acropolitans connect with us right um so I think it's very important that you know the type of people that do this thing actually go and travel and connect with people um and also realize that you're talking about the diaspora you actually actively recruit people from all parts of Africa I think that's the only way to think it's gonna work and I think the other thing is that me and actually would talk about like this is a lifetime thing like we're not trying to I mean some may say like in life you about like we're not doing that right like we're here we from beginning we doxed ourselves you can see our faces we are real people um and I I think for us because this is like a lifelong mission for us it's not something that we sold the nft project and there was a wealth like we actually uh continue building and we are going to continue because this is so important to us guys as we uh draw to a close here this has been uh just fantastic it's cool to see so close to kind of the Inception of an idea of the network State talk to a group of people who are actually like doing the hard work to fill in the ellipses to actually like form a digital nation in a digital country it's so exciting and so we'll certainly be uh the monitoring what you guys are up to and keeping track of this project as well as many of the other ones on Bank lists but I want to ask you this this kind of question if you could sort of zoom out and Chica you were just talking about being kind of long-term focused here right and I want you guys to get long-term focused on this maybe two-part question like the first is we look 10 years from now what does in your ideal world if if aphropolitan is massively successful if it's what you hope and dream what does that look like and that's that's part one of the question and the the second part of the question is um what does the world look like when Nations um like your community and like yourselves when there can be Nation Founders like Nation startups what does that do to the whole world because I find myself excited by the possibility but also finding it difficult to to imagine what that world looks like so maybe you could kind of uh close us out with that eche what would you say I think for me it's like it goes back to that ideology of abundance right so if you can imagine like 20 years ago like if you if Netflix didn't exist right but you open up Netflix now you get to see storytelling from the cult the cultural perspective of maybe Korea or from India or from this or from that and it doesn't seem to take away from even the story so from the US or even from a western lens we're just saying we're adding more to the to the tapestry of humanity right and so for me when I see when I extrapolate into the future it's when Balaji talks about four Frontiers that exist space c land and the internet right in space there may be like 10 people up there on land a lot of applicants are not allowed to really really move on land in the sea you know black people don't swim like that I'm just joking they're like 3.5 billion people with more people still to come online right and with advances in starlink or like a whole bunch of other infrastructure there are more people coming online and what you've then seen is African culture them being exported in a borderless manner whether it's through our music whether it's through our movies or whether it's through whatever other cultural aspects of it and so when I extrapolate into what that world looks like it's a world in which we've really brought everyone into this abundance right and it gets more abundance like why do we have to even move from scarcity to begin with and that's very important where if we can align around those shared values and purpose and maybe if ideology is if our ideology is one of abundance when we come to the table maybe we sit down and figure out what a win and help win looks like versus you know zero some games where I win and you lose right and I think that that's very important for us even from a community building perspective which is we're always trying to figure out what is the win-win here and we need to get more creative in figuring that aspect out so when I sit back and imagine 10 years from now it's like you're an anthropology citizen right you navigate the world with graphical and passport you have a sense of Freedom that the same child in San Francisco has whether it is the child in Kenya as well right like you feel like the world is your oyster and you also have the freedom to transact you're able to get paid for the value and the productivity that you put out into the world and you're not judged by you know where you've been born or the call of your skin you you show up and you're judged in a fair matter and I think we're not asking for a unicorn like some or people are like is this a Utopia no we're just trying to raise the Baseline of competence for our people so that when we show up in the world stage if there's another Berlin Conference now you know you have Afghan voices actually speaking up for their own interests and that's very important for us yeah and I would simply say this because recently I saw a video of the Paris climate Summits right I believe it was the president of Zambia um and also the president of South Africa right and um so both of them were given an opportunity to speak and address this wide audience and basically they were saying we're tired of being bigger right like we want a seat at the table and the fact that in 2023 a president of an African nation is saying we want a seat at the table is a challenge right and so I think if we were to look forward in the future of afropolitan 10 years from now what it looks like is a president not saying that anymore right and saying we are here our voices are heard we are considered we are we are invited to the G20 Summit we have an equal vote at un it doesn't look like Africa has a smaller vote and it doesn't look like we're begging other countries to come and even in the context of when we talk about China and U.S and even Russia the conversation is about Africa is still oh well they're coming to get something versus it should be the other way around right um and so I think for us a future state of acropolitan is we're eating in those conversations and we're able to have you know people are able to see Africa from a Global Perspective and be included I think that the inclusivity would probably be the number one thing I would love to solve through anthropolitan yeah it's it's uh fantastic and um it's very cool that we're doing this in this new frontier of the internet where a new table is is forming and uh anyone can have a seat and uh you know it's fantastic to see what you guys are doing so of course we are supportive of helping the world go bankless and we are very excited about these uh digital Nation these Network State ideas that are flourishing and uh super excited to see what you continue to do in the future so thank you so much for sharing it ate chica to the bankless nation thank you so much yeah thank you action items for you bankless Nation uh you gotta watch or listen to the episode that we did with Biology which we've referenced a few times is called rise of the network State we'll include a link in the show notes to that also I read from portions of the afropolitan manifesto today it's fantastic you've got to read it in full we'll include a link to that in the show notes gotta remind you as well of course this crypto thing is risky so it was building digital Nations I guess but this is definitely the frontier and we are headed west it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot thank you [Music]
