hey guys welcome to the road to permission list this is a special bankless episode where we're hyping some of the companies some of the people some of the projects that are coming with us to the permissionless conference it's the road to permissionless that's why it's called that today we have ian and charles from ledger they're going to be there ledger the hardware wallet of course diving into ledger what they're trying to get out of the conference uh some conference advice near the end what their roadmap looks like we cover it all here david for people who aren't familiar somehow with what permissionless is i can't imagine who's not familiar with the biggest defy conference that's ever happened happening in may can you give them some details as to what they can expect at a permission list and why they should attend yeah certainly and i'm actually currently at uh dev connect in amsterdam right now and people have the shelling point has emerged that the next conference that people are paying attention to now that devconnect is going to be over at the end of this week is permissionless that is the new shelling point for the conference life so if you are a conference goer people are all talking about permissionless as the next conference that they want to go to and this is going to be the d5 conference of the year ryan and i have made a basically a reunion of previous podcast guests everyone that you know and love on the bankless podcast gonna be speaking at permissionless we got chris dixon talking of course we got justin drake talking we're gonna have a fantastic verge of the merge panel we're going to talk about how nfgt's are changing culture we're going to talk about how the metaverse is infiltrating our lives uh the most up-to-date conference about the current content tracks of what's going on in the mindshare of crypto is all going to be at permissionless may 17th to 22 the 19th and if you are a bankless premium subscriber there is a link in the show notes to get that done and of course if you are not a bank list subscriber but you are going to permissionless becoming a bank list subscriber is actually the rational thing to do because you save more money by getting that thirty percent off by coming on your bank list it's like three hundred dollars by now four hundred dollars something like that substantial and number goes up because as you guys procrastinate and wait on your ticket the ticket prices only get up so go only goes up so go to the conference where i'm going to meet my co-host for the first time who are you talking about i'm talking about you yeah i can't wait to meet man it'll be fun so guys uh lots of reasons to come to permissionless and lots of good reasons to listen to this episode with ledger and that is you know one thing i learned ryan is that people think that ledger's at the hardware wallet just like you know of course it is but there's like uh it's like an iceberg where there's like the ledger hardware wallets the 10 above the water yeah but there's like a mountain of potential below below the water below what can be seen and so that is what uh listeners are going to get a taste of it's like what's coming next not over the next like one to two years but like 10 to 20 years in the in the world of hardware wallet security and just user experience it's look man it's a class of self-sovereign tech that we all need in the 2020s and you certainly need on your crypto journey so let's get right into the episode with ledger bagless nation we are super excited to uh to talk to two folks from ledger we've got ian rogers who is the chief experience officer of ledger and we also have charles hamill he is the vp of product charles ian welcome to the road to permissionless on bank list how you guys doing great thanks for having me thanks um you know we're gonna talk about the conference because this is an exciting one i know you guys attend a lot of conferences um but you know i want to start here ian so your title is really interesting particularly for a crypto company chief experience officer can you tell us about that what is a chief experience officer at ledger what sorts of things do you do and and what experiences are are you uh are you helping to facilitate for ledger users sure it is an unusual title um you know i credit pascal gautier who's the ceo and a long time friend personal friend of mine with with having that idea and you know the idea is that when you get your let's say you get your iphone you know you're not really buying a piece of hardware you're buying into an ecosystem you're buying um the experience of apple really and you know that's what we would like to have with ledger as well you know we know that that the user experience in crypto generally is pretty challenging in a lot of ways and especially you know if you want to be secure you know there's there's there's hoops that you have to jump through there's um things that that are you know often difficult to do you're working with um you know you're trying to connect through a variety of means you know and you know there's there really is kind of lacking experience i mean for me i'm of a certain age uh you know i've been developing on the internet since pre-web and i remember very well when you know the internet broadly had had kind of similar user experience challenges you know when we were on 56k modems and you know trying to build audio and video applications in the 90s i was at nullsoft working on on winamp you know trying to build you know audio and visual applications in the 90s when people had dial up modems you know we knew this future was coming but the experience wasn't really here yet you know so we you know there are all kinds of you know things that that you were doing you know you set your your streaming at you know at at a super low rate to try to make it work and that's this is what it feels like to me today um so the idea is is that we're working on developing a much better experience in in crypto um you know not just a new product but an experience i think that's super cool especially for a uh you know on the hardware side of crypto uh bankless obviously is super interested and uh we want to get private keys in the hands of individuals more and more right so like where our mission is to help the world go go bankless and uh ledger is a key um hardware asset on that mission in fact we we kind of consider it almost required equipment uh and yet there is still a ways to go to make something like a ledger hardware wallet as easy as the iphone right and like the iphone classically you've got this unboxing you open it up you press the button and there's a hello and all of these different languages you go through the setup process in just a few minutes you have this amazing super powerful computer mobile computer at your disposal that can just unlock the world for you and um you know i've had ledger devices from from the very beginning uh they seem to be getting easier over time like the latest one uh your newest ledger nano model which we'll talk about that the unboxing of that was noticeably different it was like much improved so maybe that is part of the the influence of the chief experience officer and that's the apple type experience the iphone type experience i think is what it's going to take to get more people with self-custody of their private keys more people to go bankless and ian just to dwell on this for one more minute because you've actually had a background working at apple as i understand like actually in the in the belly of the beast can you tell us about that and how that informs how you see the world from from apple and coming into ledger about all of the different kind of improvement angles that have informed your experience sure yeah you know i did digital music for 20 years and you know from winamp to yahoo music to beats music and then and then apple music and you know definitely at apple they are focused on bringing whatever application it is to the widest audience in the simplest way right so it's really you know what even even the change from beats music to apple music was you know we we reduced the number of buttons that were in the interface we didn't increase them right um but i think that that there's a there's a an overall arc here as well which is you know how has technology changed culture and humanity that's really very relevant to where we are in crypto right now you know i remember you know 1998 there were plenty of people who thought we were crazy for wanting to listen to music on computers right and even even through the 2000s um you know you had people that were saying oh well i'm never i don't need an email address that's not for me right and i think you know we have something similar in crypto now there are there are of course you know you know hundreds of millions of us enthusiasts but there are still far more people on the planet who probably think oh this isn't for me this is something you know they don't realize that they ultimately will be owners of digital assets and you know have have the kind of the responsibility of self-custody um they don't it's not it's not part of their their purview yet um and i think that what we have to do is we have to you know bring people up that curve you know it's what you guys do it's what we what we want to do um at ledger and i think that the thing to remember is you know if you look at the adoption curve you know you've seen the numbers we're in kind of 1998 and 99 um you know crypto adoption is following roughly the same curve as as internet adoption and we're in that kind of 98.99 zone well remember that it was 2008 that um that brought us the iphone right we didn't get the iphone until 2008 and you know there were a lot of us who were toiling away building web apps for you know 15 years before the iphone came and we thought you know i mean look i was i was building music applications for your computer as if everyone wanted to listen to their music on on their desktop computer which is of course absurd and you know the iphone comes along and you go there it is there's there's the vehicle for this transformation and it's not that the internet wasn't exciting before it was you know i mean we had you know it was so exciting there was a bubble in 98.99 um there was over excitement and overheating in in fact but i think it's just a reminder that you know even though we know these things are inevitable you know if you'd have met me in 2001 i would have told you the future of music is subscription it's going to cost somewhere around 10 a month and at 70 million subscribers the entire industry grows again and it was a very unpopular opinion in in 2001 and and it was right it was inevitable but it also took a lot longer than we thought it would and i think that there are there are definitely some lessons there that are transferable to what we're all doing now ian the the line that we are in the early days of the internet when it comes to crypto and especially ux people usually go and think about their defy apps that they use right like our defy apps are clunky and the the web interfaces are clunky but rarely are is that metaphor used for the physical side of things the hardware side of things so i find that particularly interesting if we're in the early days of the hardware version of the internet what do you think that the hardware should look like in the future like what do you think it will look like 5 10 15 years from now and does that come with some sort of design philosophy about for ledger and the ledger hardware wallets like is there an overarching design philosophy that guides the the vision for the ledger experience yeah the you know the two core value propositions that we bring to the table are security and ease of use right so we're uncompromising on security which you know which puts us in the position of you know you can imagine the number of times that i've had people from my web 2 life say to me i just don't think you get scale without you know software wallets right i say well okay you're the person that told me that we wouldn't weren't going to get to scale on the internet because no one was ever going to have broadband and the person that told me that smartphones were for rich people and that everyone would never own a smartphone you know etc i think that every one of these transformations you know from the printing press to today comes with um with with an evolution in hardware i also think that if you look through history you know industrial transformations there there's a there's an unbundling and a rebundling right this is the unbundling i'm holding my you know my web 2 device and my web 3 device right here's here's the unbundling and ultimately there will be a rebundling but that's a very big technical challenge because it's like you know if i gave you the task of of protecting you know a billion in gold bars and then i told you oh and by the way i want to add a shopping mall and a restaurant on the ground floor of that building right i mean that's what that's the task that you know protecting what three value on your on your smartphone or your computer is up against so i think that you know for us you know the two things really are being just uncompromising on security you know building something that's secure not secure ish right that it can't be security theater it has to be secured by design because anything that can be hacked will be hacked so it's got to be secure by design and then trying to achieve um you know a great user experience with that and and i really feel like we have you know only a couple of pain points um there are there are main ones right one is you know setting up a device is difficult you know that getting over this mental hurdle of 24 words and you know if where if if the conversation in your head about where to keep your 24 words doesn't scare you then you don't understand it right and and so that's a big one um and then i think there's this this you know this issue of of you know all addresses being like you know these these these codes basically that you can't you know you can't get wrong right um and then i also think that that there's just this connectivity issue connectivity to web3 because you know now we're not just like storing some value and putting in our closet for six years you know we're actually doing stuff with i mean i don't know about you but i'm i'm using my wallet you know 25 times a day um and you know you see you that but i would argue that that experience of using the wallet a whole bunch of times a day is actually not not that's not the problem you know the problem i have is that you know i couldn't connect the foundation today for some reason i have no idea why but i couldn't and when i was trying to bid on something and and so it's those kind of issues that that i think are are kind of the the things that we're trying to roll over right now so i think getting that on boarding and and you know getting making sure that you understand the responsibility that you have with 24 words or maybe even helping you with that responsibility connecting uh to web three and then you know making uh you know making things a little more bulletproof and more addressable and also i think in that connection piece is another important piece which is reducing your exposure to scams bad actors um etc there's actually a lot that can be that can be done there there's a lot of ways that you can warn a user you know hey this contract is less than five days old are you sure you want to interact with it you know i mean there are there are definitely um a lot of improvements to come in those kind of areas as well it's funny there there are so much improvements and like part of the bankless audience of course we're like we're all hardened crypto natives right so a lot of us forget what it's like but like if you can as a bankless listener hearken back to the time when you first started on this journey and put put yourself in the shoes of somebody who's just learning about crypto and you're being told there's 24 words to remember and if you forget one of those words or somebody else boom your money's completely gone i i even stories like this um someone recently a bankless thought said to me you know for the longest time i thought i actually needed a unique hardware wallet device a unique ledger for every single ethereum wallet i wanted to set up i was like oh no like you basically get unlimited wallets with one device but it's stuff like this people don't know the learning curve is still is still very steep here i think i think actually you know i i was going to say i was at a at a dinner at a non-fungible conference with a bunch of very crypto native people but the security model was actually not that well understood you know someone was saying to me you know because i had my my ledger around my neck and they were saying to me oh i wouldn't do that i'd be afraid i'd lose it and say so what lose it i was like i'll tell you what i'll send you five and you put the same seed trays on all of them and hey you lose one don't worry about it you know by the way you couldn't say that about a device that doesn't have a secure element right i would always say that when i when somebody when i meet somebody who's got you know a competitive device i'm like how about this i'll give you mine for 24 hours you give me yours no one's taking me up on that yet but you know that if you understand the security of the device and and and the you know and and the actual threat model right the fact that you put your code in three times it breaks you know i mean and there's there's a lot more value in the watch around your risk you know actually right and there's value you know to an attacker if you're dead in your ferrari or your watch you know the the if you if you actually think hard about the you know about the security model and the attack model it really is kind of a miracle it's like having a safe full of gold bars and you like you know wave a magic wand at it and they'll disappear yet when you want to they pop back it's just it's it's an incredible invention but but i think it's conceptually really difficult and even people who are you know pretty knowledgeable in in crypto still don't really have their head around the security model because it's so foreign to us as as human beings i do remember a story where i i was traveling somewhere it was a while ago but this story was exactly as you described where i lost my ledger i left it somewhere and it was just a practice in just like mindfulness about like okay i this it's not that big of a deal it's not that big of a deal no one knows my pin no one knows my pin even though that's all my money but like no one knows my pin and it's just like if you really think about it it's like no you're totally safe but there's a hump you have to get over it wasn't all my money by the way it's just like you know it was worth this is why we all have more than one legend yeah yeah definitely and i i think what's exciting here too i i really like the analogy uh ian of like living you know apple and iphone and living in a pre-iphone world in the early 2000s it almost feels like ledger is at the phase where you know as good as it is today it's still there there's a lot of improvement that could be done we're still in kind of the the ipod days now how many of you guys had like a you know listening to this had like an ipod mini or something like this right they used to listen to music on and then the iphone came out and that was the killer app and that completely mainstreamed everything so what's cool about this is it feels also like ledger has a lot of uh future product improvements it can incorporate like ledger could still have an iphone moment in the future even though it's had a very successful hardware like an ipod type of hardware and charles i want to bring you into the conversation here because ledger has recently released a newer version of the ledger it's called the ledger nano s plus and i'm wondering i i just received one of these a couple of days ago but these are still pretty pretty new as we're entering the permissionless conference can you tell us what the upgrades are on the ledger nano s plus and what kind of the design philosophy was for this product absolutely um so and as you notice from right from the unboxing you you feel like this is starting to become a different company and a different kind of experience um and the the nano s plus is really um a device that kind of meets today's demands and you know we're past the days of well at least a lot of users are coming from from the nft world a lot of users want to hold coins on many different chains right it's not just about holding btc or holding be eth anymore and people want to use more chains more of the time so the lns plus is really a device that fills that need where you can receive all the coins that are supported on ledger at the same time and it also supports interactions with uh defy applications and nft marketplaces so that you can very safely um you know leverage this security model that we've invested a lot in to um to clearly sign nft transactions defy protocol interactions with ave or paraswap for example so that users can really you know leverage all of the new innovation that's happening uh on in web3 with this new device and it brings this capability uh to be on par with the nano x that we have which is really the kind of the mobile version of that uh of that device uh for people that that want to use it um on the go charles does this require like some big hardware upgrades um to the actual like at that level of the design or was this mainly software is it some common yeah absolutely so um so the nano s plus uses a newer uh generation of chip that has more memory and is more powerful and drives a bigger display so there was a considerable um sort of hardware innovation to to make that device and yeah it really is the kind of the state-of-the-art in in coin coverage ease of use and security and that chip has one other one other feature which is that it it's good it's it's uh you can actually develop and and run your your develop your apps in developer mode on the device um instead of having to run them in the in the emulator um which we haven't been able to do on the on the nano x but you can now do on the s plus so it's a it's a it's a great developer device as well can you just uh elaborate on that a little bit more ian what does that mean for the developers can you just illuminate what that means it means if you're developing an app um for the nano uh you know you you to test your to test the app that you're developing um generally you would you would test it in the emulator and then um and then you'd move it and hope that it behaved the same but now you're you're able to basically run in a developer mode um on this chip and so you can you can do your development directly on the device hopefully shortening your time to market because you don't have to go through this kind of second step of getting out of the emulator and seeing how your code actually behaves on the device and then and then debug there and then take one more step so hopefully it shortens the development cycle for uh for developers certainly okay and i would say it's a bit of an underrated uh aspect of of ledger is that it is really an open platform where people can you know build applications in essence to support their chain to support their adapt um and and uh basically submit their application for uh for integration into what's funny is like i i've called you guys before that like the apple of crypto and i just i really feel like it is so many of the analogies fit so well right so you've got this hardware device but now what you're saying charles is you also have sort of this this third party app store if you will that can be extended and that's an active development too with this this um burgeoning ecosystem of uh third parties who are building for this uh hardware device yeah i think i think the analogy extends even even further if you think about it from a you know a business perspective we have um we sell hardware uh we have um you know inside of ledger live you can you can do transactions whether that's buying or swapping staking which charles can talk more about um and you know we also um you know we do have this developer platform the developer platform kind of has four different levels because you can you know you can build an app for the nano and there are many you know there are many um coins and chains that are supported on the nano that are not yet supported in in ledger live um so there that's kind of it's it's whole universe then there's going into ledger live so i can see my balances and and and you know send and receive and stake inside of ledger live then there's the dap environment inside of ledger live and then there's also the connectivity um to other applications so you know a wallet um you know whether that's you know zerion or or or coinbase you know they you know or or even brave you know you can't really make a um a wallet these days without supporting ledger um and that but you know and the great thing for us is that you know multiple times you know you get a call from the folks at kepler and they say oh we're releasing ledger support tomorrow wait wait you are like do you need any help can we help you like oh no it was fine it was easy it was the same thing with brave you know as soon as brave announced their wallet uh you know charles and pascal and i are all like you know knocking on brendan's door like oh wait what about ledger support and he's like chill guys it's in there like oh okay all right nice um so you know you you know you do have these these pieces of connectivity and actually really and i think that is the underappreciated part that that a lot of the secret sauce at ledger is in that operating system um you know there is you know having that operating system that you can develop on top of and by the way that's the underappreciated part at apple as well right nobody you know people forget that without nextstep there is no oh there is no ios right um you know and but and the next step they started developing in the late 80s you know so you've got that you know that incredible um you know operating system layer there that that you know craig federicki and the team do that is just like you know it's completely underappreciated you know people when people talk about apple that no one's like i love osx you know um but you know without it you don't get all of the things that you do every day and this is uh very fitting with the ethos of uh the cryptocurrency industry right where you're putting complexity at the margins and you're allowing the margins to develop their apps and just allowing ledger to host those apps uh really puts the the power to the development teams which which makes a ton of sense and i definitely want to lean into that part of the conversation because it extends into the ledger live ecosystem uh but but first i kind of want to talk about the new entrance to the crypto space in 2020 and 2021 and the challenges that have arisen with this new cohort of people along with this new cohort of use cases uh nfts were really the thing that drove a lot of adoption in 2021 and that i think that posed a lot of interesting challenges for all the wallet providers metamask providers uh the ledger you guys and basically anyone that's processing a transaction because as crypto has developed so has the scams so has the tricks uh so it has the exploits so i'm wondering what the internal conversation has been like uh with ledger and and how you guys see ledger's uh role in helping uh helping enable users to navigate these traps to navigate these scams and uh how the product development and product iterations have perhaps changed because of the this new generation of crypto use cases and crypto users what are the conversations like with ledger around that well i'll start charles and then i'll let you finish by talking about you know the kind of things that that we we plan to have coming but yeah there's there's just no question and i think with people coming in you know and a lot of times their very first step is with a software wallet and they don't think twice about it because that's what they're used to um you know they they hear about something new they go to the app store right um and and you think like well i mean i'm gonna be protected there aren't i mean and you know not only are you not protected but you know you're you're actually being preyed upon yeah and i think this is particularly true of the uh the nft ecosystem as well the amount of board apes that have no question it's absolutely staggering exactly and i think and i think that people you know this has forced a lot of people to understand the security model the hard way right because you have you know you you have of course you know somebody gets their hand on your seed phrase whether they found that in your um you know in your photos uh because they think they got into your icloud account and and you know got into your photos or you know they they they just fished it out of you you know then then that's that's one thing but we've seen these other kind of attacks which are you know signing transactions that you you know that you know that you didn't want to sign right and you know blind signing we changed um you know the term to be blind signing uh because that's that's more accurate i think and you know blind signing is we're i don't know about you but i'll speak for myself i'm doing it multiple times a day still because you know to do the things i want to do i i need to do it i'm checking the url i'm being as careful as i can but i'm also mindful in my head of the fact that blind signing is like unsafe sex it's super fun until it's not and then it can [ __ ] up your life right um so you know the uh and and that's what we're up against so i'll let charles talk about what you know kind of the multitude of of solutions that we're working on are sure and um yeah so nft has really brought in a new crowd to to crypto and one that perhaps didn't have uh you know kind of a computer security mindset if you will and just installed an app and um found out the hard way and in a way i feel like self-custody and digital ownership is even more meaningful in a in an nft context right because people feel personal about their nfts and and you know having something in your hand is really helpful mentally to to to relate to that um so we've seen a huge amount of people coming to us you know from the nft world and you know a lot of the basic interactions with nfts have been you know insecure so far and um this early this year we we kind of added clear signing support for nft so that when when you transact with nfts within ledger live you're doing so you know clearly uh meaning okay you're sending one board ape to this address yes no instead of just seeing a binary blob uh that you you can't understand so that's a big evolution and it's it's also important to understand that we're doing this without compromising on security right what you're seeing on the device is not just an app telling the device show this right this is the device actually understanding what you're about to sign and figuring out okay this is actually a board this is this contract this is this is the real deal right so again it may not be fully appreciated even by kind of technical audience but when we were we're adding this kind of clear signing um capability we're doing so within our very stringent security model and we're not compromising on that so we've done that for nfts [Music] this year and we're sort of gradually adding more and more clear signing support for more daps and more nft marketplaces so that people can clearly sign in more places but we also see that there's a big need for kind of preventing mistakes and preventing kind of phishing attacks right because sometimes maybe you'll clearly sign something but it's it's not on the right website or maybe the transaction is doing some other stuff so we think safety will be a big theme this year for wallets um and we're really working on on ways that we can help users kind of preemptively be warned about about dangerous things um when interacting with web3 just to quickly dive into the ledger live ecosystem uh because it's interesting to have the desktop software paired with the physical hardware wallet right it kind of feels like a little bit of the barbell side of things like one on one side you have this massive maximally simple maximally secure piece of hardware and then you have this defy desktop app that's maximally expressive uh can you guys just talk about the long term vision for the ledger live ecosystem i'll all again i'll start and then i'll let you if you want to follow along with specifics i think you're right i mean you know if you think about it your your ledger device is actually quite simple right it does what does it do it protects your 24 words and makes sure they never touch the internet um and it makes sure that what you see is what you sign right because you cannot trust the display on on this device you can trust the display on this device so it does that and it does the job very well and then as you said you've got this maximally expressive thing in your hand that you can do all kinds of things with right so you can explore you know absolutely anything that you want to explore and knowing that all the time you know your private keys are safe and that at the time of the transaction i'm going to be able to verify am i doing what it is i think i'm doing which is why it's so idiotic that we're blind signing all the time right because here we have this thing that has the power um to tell us the truth and you know we're just you know it's like opening docusign going to the bottom of the page hitting sign and just saying wow whatever yolo um you know and so you know that that in in the idea is that we can bring more and more things into the ledger live ecosystem and if we simply add blind signing um to the i'm sorry add clear signing to those um things then then you've got all of the power because you have all of the power of the web the kind of infinite um power of the web with the security of web3 hardware so an actually an actually secure device not secure with a secure element plus clear signing something that is that is actually showing you what the contract you were about to sign actually says which is really the whole thing right because as you guys talk about every single you know time you do a show you're you're signing you know you're these are these are contracts and you know signing a contract without reading it is stupid so you know that that's really i think the the power that we have is to is to really connect web 2 and web 3 in that way all right guys so we have permission lists ahead of us and so what do you what are you guys looking to get done at permissionless you guys have goals for for the these conferences uh what are your goals for permissionless who are you looking to meet at permissionless if you guys are hiring what talent are you looking for just all the things that you guys are looking to get done at the conference yeah i was super excited to see i haven't been in the us for for over two years now so it's truly crypto conferences are back so it will feel good to to meet uh old faces and new faces right because i think we've all been kind of longing for it um and at permissionless really our goal is to to connect with the broader ecosystem um and the ledger is really horizontal in this space uh we talked to to all the chains all the dapps uh all the foundations everyone building on web3 needs security right so we're at really a special place where you know we we enable a lot of companies to to operate and and thrive in web3 so we're going to be there both on the on the b2c side of the business so that's ledger live and the nano hardware wallets as well as the enterprise side which is really can i think of it as a chain agnostic multi-sig for um for for enterprises for foundations for companies um and custodians that that want governance over the crypto assets while keeping self-custody so that's a big and growing side of the business that that that will also be present and permissionless um and um we're we're hiring on all fronts both on on product and engineering um so if you think self-custody is important and you want to build freedom technology with us then uh please uh hit me up and um will be super keen to to talk to you and uh see what the opportunities are ian i know you're not gonna be at permissionless so we will certainly miss you there but i think from your background you've been to a ton of conferences before for those that for the newcomers in this industry uh do you have any advice for the first for the first timer the first conference goer anytime for the the first cycler who's never been to a crypto conference before where's the conference in general is there any like life advice that you have here for these people absolutely you know uh carl anderson who's vp of engineering is going as well and he and i spoke about this two days ago so i i can um tell you some of the same things i said to to carl you know i think conferences like this are an opportunity to have three months worth of meetings in three days like that's really why you go you know um i think that the meaning of conferences has really changed um because of of podcasting and youtube etc you know you used to go um to con to conferences to pick up on that talk or that content you know i've found personally that you know you can get that talk or that content you know on in a podcast or or or after the fact often and that you know for me the real the real meat is happening you know elsewhere it's happening because all of these it's so rare that all of these people are in the same place at the same time um and so the ability to just you know meet people see you know and and just just really connect face to face um you know being able to see you guys um on this video is better than talking to you on the phone but if the four of us were sitting at dinner it's going to be so much more rich right so the opportunity to do that i'd really you know encourage people to prioritize you know true quality face to face um and then this is just what i try to do in life which is avoid small talk um you know i i really you know i i don't bless you i don't have you know from for me personally you know that you know if we're going to you know life is short um i'm on i'm on probably the other side of the curve or other side of the hill and um you know and and for me i want to talk about things that are substantial i want to talk about the future i want to talk about freedom i want to talk about why what we're doing um is important in the arc of humanity um you know and you know let's face it i mean talk talking about uh the weather is boring um and you know talking about the the price of ethereum today is boring relative to talking about the impact that that ethereum and this entire ecosystem is going to have on humanity so i would uh you know try to get try to get you know in front of the smartest people you can find and understand as much as you can i mean i'll tell you you know listening listening to bankless um has been a great you know education for me and you know there are many times that i'm i'm i'm listening to you know people that you guys have on and thinking okay i'm understanding you know 70 of this but this person is one of the smartest people i've ever heard speak and they are all in so i've got to keep going and uh you know hopefully that's the energy that that people will draw from the conferences great great advice from ian near the end so have as many real conversations with real people as you can at the conference that is the advice for permissionless uh ian charles thanks for coming on i just i just want to say one thing uh and set the context for for ledger uh for everybody thank god for ledger like i really feel that way in the bank list because when when we talk about um scalability in crypto i think one of the things we ignore is exactly what ledger is doing people talk about scalability in terms of transactions per second on the blockchain they talk about it in terms of the market cap of this industry but the real another measure of scalability an important one we can't miss the bankless measure of scalability is the number of people with custody of their own private keys we have to scale that number because if we end up in a crypto world where all of the assets are controlled by a new class of banks well that's not bankless at all is it and we're full circle to the world we just left so ledger is doing god's work in making it easier more scalable for individuals to hold their own private keys and and adding safety to that as well and security so super important stuff thank you for everything you're doing in the space and uh quite honestly like the bankless community is is cheering you on uh we hope you continue doing doing this work because it's incredibly important well thank you i hope you don't mind if i respond because it was so kind what you just said and i honestly got to chill when when you said it and and i i feel the same in terms of the level of importance and i feel like this kind of um you know coin maximalism you know uh is is really um you know misconstrued with what we should be is which is you know self-custody and decentralization maximalists and um and you know and i feel the same way and i think that i speak for charles as well when i say he neither he nor i can take credit for ledger and i just want to say that you know the the people who had the vision um for ledger seven years ago um you know the the the you know the founders the engineers i mean charles and i work for them that's that's the reality you know this is a this is a company that was you know once a small um you know french company built built by geniuses and you know we're on the same mission that that that you guys are on at bankless and you know charles and i are here to try to bring this to to a wider audience to take that genius to take that that you know the people who had this vision who people who knew seven years ago that self-custody is the game and that um you know these these incredibly useful machines that we have in our pockets and on our desks are not going to to protect that value you know sufficiently um so we are the stewards um you know of bringing that vision you know all the way and you know really thank you and and thank you for doing you know what you do we all we you know we hear a lot of talk about you know about banking the unbanked but we're with you unbanking the bank is where it's absolutely well said let's let's end it there then guys ian charles it's absolutely uh been a pleasure um we've enjoyed this conversation and maybe the last message for bankless listeners is as always if you got to be a maximalist be a private key maximalist i think that's what ledger uh says you should do and bankless heartily agrees thank you so much guys for spending some time on the road to permissionless
