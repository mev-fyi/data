facebook is culturally appropriating ethereum is ultra scalable and the ultimate guide to air drops all this and more on i'm luke and this is tldr where we catch you up on all the headlines and important narratives from around bengalis this week as always they're going to be links down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics so before we start i want to shout out our sponsor pull together v4 pool together is a no loss lottery where you can deposit assets check out the daily reward drawings and remove your funds at any time it's now on polygon so you can dive into the pool with minimal gas costs learn more at bankless.cc pool together so the markets have been insane this week with ethereum hitting a new all-time high at over forty four hundred dollars uh shiba inu actually flipped dogecoin in terms of total market cap and shibe is built on ethereum it's an erc20 token and i'm pretty like meh on meme coins like this they don't do anything except like attract value and speculation but also they don't claim to do anything except that they're kind of fun 40 billion dollars worth of fun but maybe on the more earned side of things the more justified side of things ethereum has had an explosive year growing tremendously nfts uh value locked in d5 eip1559 the merge on the horizon my boy ben covers it all in the state of ethereum and by the numbers the growth is impressive if you've been watching bankless though the growth should be unsurprising and don't be surprised as this growth continues it's also maybe not a coincidence that ethereum hit new all-time highs immediately after this article dropped also zuck announced that he's changing the name of facebook to meta which i loathe but what's really going on here facebook is seeing the writing on the wall it's a boomer platform and they need to get with the times and the trends are towards the metaverse where you're blurring the pixels between economics and culture it's happening but on whose terms facebook a company that answers to shareholders and wants to extract value from its users or a decentralized platform that aligns incentives between the network and its citizens our podcast with eric peters this week covered this topic more broadly eric is the founder and ceo of one river asset management uh and they bought 600 million dollars worth of ether and bitcoin last year and eric's takes were somewhat surprising for someone i generally characterize to be more of a traditional hedge fund manager eric sees quantum level change on the horizon change that affects things at a fundamental level for society what are the sorts of shifts that we should expect given this monetary to fiscal policy uh regime change if it were only that regime change or that paradigm shift that that were affecting us it would it would be the biggest one that we've seen uh certainly in my career um spending over 30 years but it's not because everything i just said is happening with the backdrop of blockchain technology on the cusp of rewiring the global financial system and spinning out of that project are a variety of assets cryptocurrencies that uh you know or various tokens that i think represent fundamental change in in probably how the whole world operates that will take decades to manifest but in the here and now it's affecting financial markets and investment opportunities etc what you can try to do is i think understand what are the biggest most important things that are happening and then kind of understand how they interact and then stay mentally flexible around well what are some of the things that those could mean and then then you're supposed to kind of look at markets and say well what are markets telling you some of this stuff means and you know and then i ideally invest alongside those trends as they emerge this means a reframing of power dynamics a reassessment of capitalism and socialism and a move towards a digital first society is it going to be america's corporations or china's one-party government or a decentralized set of networks that will lead this charge maybe it's whichever one can really scale out first after all i think that all of this this whole society game thing boils down to memes and capital efficiency the winners have the best combination of both both memes and capital efficiency uh and i think it actually like boils down further to just user experience people are going to go where the best user experience is it's only rational so the new meme is ultra scalable ethereum and the new capital efficiency is modular blockchains polynya dropped a bunch of articles and tweet threads laying out many of these ideas and they've been really stuck in my head lately modular blockchains separate out the main things that a blockchain does so that's consensus data availability and execution and instead of having this all on one platform one layer one you can actually split things up and specialize them and specialization breeds efficiency so with ultra scalable ethereum you have consensus happening on the beacon chain data availability happening among the shards and execution happening on layer 2 on rollups each of these things are optimized for their particular task and what you get back is a positive feedback loop where things are aligned to increase the robustness and throughput of the network if this is a lot or actually either way just watch the state of the nation we did this week and or read the article david dropped on it it's good stuff and if that's still a lot just know that the meme is ultrascalable ethereum and the capital efficiency is modular blockchains we also dropped the ultimate guide to air drops this week so many protocols give out airdrops to early adopters of their product and we have identified 25 likely candidates for future airdrops the first five are open to everyone these are element hop protocol defy saver ondo and saddle the specifics of the strategies to get involved are detailed in the article and the rest are available to you if you're a premium subscriber the general idea though is to use these newer protocols try them out learn about them and you may get rewarded for it but who knows not me not financial advice never is nothing is certain except death and unrealized capital gains taxes so kami russo came on layers here this week and she's the founder and champion of the defiant and the defiant is easily easily my second favorite crypto media company and they've been doing like awesome stuff for a while now and their growth is really really cool to see cami and david talk about what it's like getting involved in this world and building out startupy media companies and i think both have embraced new ways of publishing media that is overall better than the lagging traditional media so our editorial point of view is that d5 is the future you know like we we believe in web 3 we believe the world will be increasingly decentralized uh we believe d5 will become finance but um how that happens on what chain you know who wins whatever like all of that we leave it to our readers to do our job is to report on the space objectively i am super impressed by cami's story uh coming from chile and living all over the world doing fascinating journalism on a variety of topics and remember memes and capital efficiency well the defiant is making powerful memes through the form of informed journalism and quality narratives and storytelling is what really drives the way that we see the world we also hosted a fantastic ethereum vs bitcoin debate with david and justin drake on the ethereum side and dennis porter and munib ali on the bitcoin side and i really liked this episode it was refreshing to hear a thoughtful dialogue without all of the maximalist shouting and shaming that you see on twitter all the time uh i thought both sides made excellent points and throughout the conversation i feel like my views on money soundness security scalability they were all sharpened my biggest takeaway is that these communities when you zoom out for a second are really aligned the gap between bitcoiners and aetherians is much larger than what's uh is perceived to be much larger than what's actually true uh i actually i joke with eric connor a lot that you know ethereans and bitcoiners they actually value have the same values they just believe in fundamentally different executions um we believe in the immutability of money we believe in decentralized the world of decentralizing finance away from uh the powers that be into the hands of the people and it's really more about the execution about how we actually get that done uh and so while there appears to be many many differences between these two camps uh i think we all have to be reminded that um we're all in the same industry we're fighting for very similar things and at least we're not a centralized blockchain and what ends up being a pretty broad rift in culture is really just a few technical and ideological differences about monetary policy it's easy to get caught up in twitter drama picking aside and yelling at perceived opponents but i think it's a good idea to collaborate rather than compete wherever possible the broad mission is the same bring a non-sovereign store of value to the world and upgrade the protocols that our society is built on top of so with that i want to shout out our sponsors matcha alcomix ledger and arbitrum these projects are upgrading our society's protocols and also this video wouldn't be possible without them so thanks a lot and finally none of this is financial advice ethan's risky d5 is risky but we are headed west it's the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're
