there was some recent twitter hubbub metallic on beverage cancel culture you made the case for this green tea and red wine combo i mean to be fair this isn't like a regular part of my life or anything i only tried it a couple of times the first time pretty accidentally i was sitting on a plane with a friend he had some uh green tea and some red wine that he separately ordered and intended to drink separately and at some point he went to sleep the steward people came and they offered me food but i wanted to be able to like have the food and also do laptoping at the same time right so i needed two trays my friend's tray has these two drinks on it and so okay fine well i have to get rid of them somehow so you know why not just drink them i just realized that like wait wow this is like weird but like less disgusting than i thought are people trying to cancel you for for this opinion or are they more intrigued i feel like i'm far more intrigued i wonder like is the internet angry or over that tweet or when i looked like a version of tom brady that was on meth for two years
