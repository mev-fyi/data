welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with hudson jameson and hudson is a perfect example of this intro of the show he got pulled in like so many of us do into ethereum because he saw the vision for it but it's because he met the people and vibed with the people and in his words and many others felt like he found his tribe so he tells this story and we start at the very beginning in 2015 because hudson has been around ethereum for so long and we go up to where hudson is today and this is a story of the progression of the core developer and uh core developer community in ethereum the ef in ethereum the story of devcons uh the story of the dow hack the story of the ico mania the 2018 to 2020 bear market the story of prague powell and just really how each one of these events have shaped the story and trajectory of the ethereum core devs the ethereum community and therefore ethereum at large hudson he's one of the corest ethereum community members that there ever is and he's seen it all and so he's one of the most apt people to tell the story of ethereum and how it's progressed along the way both from the perspectives of the community and also the perspective of the core depths hudson is a person that just exudes ethereum values in ethereum ethos and so it's been a delight to have him on this podcast so i hope you enjoy this fantastic conversation with hudson jameson right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is

doing pretty good pretty good we got all the av issues settled so i'm happy about that yeah to kick things off the podcast listeners won't get this one but i have the the guests with the most flowery vibrant tv shirt with the most flowery vibrant wallpaper in vancouver's history going on right now i i'm proud of that i'm proud of it you can thank my spouse lilith they uh bought me this shirt and bought the wallpaper it was not me hudson uh a lot of early ethereum people and later at hearing people like myself definitely know who you are uh but can you just explain what your role okay how would you explain your perch in ethereum for people that are new to ethereum i would say that it was harder for me to answer this question last year because i was kind of like working so much i didn't have time to reflect but now i can say that i see myself as a connector in the ecosystem someone who tries to bring good vibes and niceness and make sure that like we're not just gonna turn into awful toxic you know maxis that are gonna you know keep people out of the ecosystem uh and also keep us on track for the ethos of ethereum and how do you go about doing that that sounds hard lately i post a lot but i also just maintain presence in a lot of different uh chat rooms i have a lot of discussions i feel like i've been told i'm one of the more social people at conferences and like online when i get into that mode so it's just basically keeping connections making sure um you know just kind of stay down to earth and talk to people about it and when did you get into a theory so i got into ethereum in 2014 to 2015. i was there for the pre-sale and i bought ether in the pre-sale but i didn't actually get heavily involved until uh i'd say early 2015 uh i was writing documentation for the homestead uh hard fork uh as a volunteer and then i went to devcon1 and volunteered and from there joined the ethereum foundation what'd you do before before that i did a computer science degree um at the university of north texas in denton texas and then went on to work for a bank at first i was doing mainframe development but i was so annoying about what the promise blockchain brings that they eventually sent me to what they called the innovation lab to be the lead blockchain researcher in 2015 which was really weird for a bank at the time but i got to look into all the really crappy solutions and scams people are coming up with uh to get kind of my um my grounding on blockchain in general can you put the listeners into the shoes of 2015 what was blockchain like back then what what what did crypto mean was crypto a word in 2015 um you know i'm trying to remember i think it was but it wasn't as widely used because there was still some like oh that's short for cryptography people you know right right right i would say that back then there was a definitely a different feel about things a different flavor because um in 2015 there was a lot of bitcoin forks that were still trying to compete like everything was a bitcoin fork everything kind of had the same idea that bitcoin had uh and there was a big um push for finding a way for people to use cryptocurrency to pay for a cup of coffee which as you can probably see over time yeah that was the meme and now it's like very different both in bitcoin and other places in the cryptocurrency space so yeah i wasn't around for the bitcoin fork and fair launch era but i've had it described to me as something very very similar to the food farm launch era on d5 during defy summer can you help like draw those comparisons for listeners who weren't around like and me yeah for sure no so like it it kind of was that way but i would say that um i think the biggest difference to me is that there was a much more diverse like political and social leanings uh for the d5 food era where that didn't play as big of a factor as back then in the bitcoin you know fair launch era and stuff like that in 2015 and maybe around 2014 i i feel like it was more very heavily libertarian and like heavily that kind of dude and i say dude because there was like even less women than than there are now and stuff like that so it just had a different it had like a different feel and a different like it was very policy and libertarian focused in my opinion and less about innovation and making really cool things whereas the d5 farm era was really exciting as well but it was like about making cool things and pushing the limits on innovation okay okay so the perhaps the word monoculture might be appropriate back then absolutely were were the bitcoin forks all that innovative like were they really all that different from each other how crazy did like the ambitions of these things go there were a few that stood out um and the problem was the ones that stood out as you can see the people i feel like in crypto who are the most creative push innovation the hardest sometimes are more quiet or they're like less like out there and like really trying to show their product at first because they're just really interested in making cool so for instance name coin um i think sunny uh made the first proof-of-state coin back then around that time setting aggrowald from cosmos no a different sunny um i think they're annan it's just like sunny 97 or something but they made they made um i can't not think of the name it was the first proof of state coin back then which was really crazy but like everyone was on it because it's not bitcoin it's not proof of work um and then you know there was a few other experiments that were pretty neat there was one that was um a coin that airdrop to like everyone in a country i think finland uh it was the first airdrop back then uh that ever happened and that was kind of a neat idea to play with the economics of an airdrop and you know giving people back like you know kind of like a universal income in a way but through a one-time airdrop my take on that whole era of crypto was that a lot of the ideas that it brought are fundamental ideas of the crypto industry and zero of the projects that invented those ideas made it that's correct and i think there's a few reasons for that yes and the thing is like so the biggest one is colored coins and uh you know kind of the omni uh kind of layer of bitcoin which was kind of a extracted you know smart contract layer in a way and colored coins were the first chance to do kind of erc 20 tokens but on bitcoin and like there was some interest in it for sure but like i i think it was more the team's execution of the idea like they weren't really marketers they were technology people like through and through i think that led to their downfall so now the need this really i guess at the end of the day highlights the the um position that marketing is a really big factor in projects if you don't have marketing it's much harder to get your innovative idea out there and the sea of other stuff just like it was back then yeah we'll we'll turn to the ico media in a second which is where i kind of think marketing really started um for i would say for better or for worse but it was mainly for worse um but i kind of want to go through some of the uh ideas that came out during the fork and fair launch era that we know of today you already named one like the airdrop um namecoin is now instantiated in ens i would say it's like that the what namecoin was was a blockchain that was a blockchain with like a name right was there like a currency of namecoin or like how did namecoin really work yeah so namepoint and actually funny enough it's still being developed there are releases every month or so there's like one guy doing it uh but um how namecoin worked was basically it was a separate blockchain that was uh a court of uh a code fork of bitcoin and you would get name coins instead of bitcoins and you could use you can mine namecoin to buy name coin uh like domain addresses basically so i could buy hudson dot i think it was dot name i i mean i'm not i can't remember it's been too long but i actually did mine namecoin for a little bit um it was it was a long time ago like but uh it and i think i got like seven namecoin which is now literally almost worth nothing but uh yeah it was very creative and it did lay the groundwork for things like ens um but i think that there were gonna be limitations just like as we've seen now any code i feel like that has forked bitcoin's code base now has limitations heading into programmability uh and that includes namecoin that includes zcash that includes litecoin everything like if you want programmability you're forced to do an l2 you can't do base layer as easily as you could right right right um was there any like philosophy on what the name coin asset would become uh and like fitting that into the broader landscape of like all of these different blockchains are being built with each one a little bit more of a specific use case than bitcoins bitcoin being money name coin being question mark purecoin being question mark what was the philosophy of like what the role of each currency of the blockchain would would be in over the long term back then uh you know i think i think that that involves them like working together which i didn't really see happening if i recall so blockchain interoperability yeah there wasn't there wasn't that cohesiveness and idea of blockchain interoperability at the time there wasn't cosmos there wasn't a vision of a network of blockchains so working with one of the blockchains didn't mean you were in competition but it's like i didn't see bitcoin people really clamoring to have like uh connections with name coins so i guess that's to say to answer your question there were people who used all the blockchains but it was kind of a wait and see who won out and then bitcoin kind of won out right was there what was tribalism like back then the tribalism was mainly about people who were against private and enterprise blockchains and i guess that's kind of biased on my part because i worked in the enterprise blockchain space which is which then and now wasn't really that great not like enough there's bad people there's great people there but just enterprise blockchain's a hard sell so like there are people who are like to this day you can't have private blockchains you can't have you know consortium blockchains those are stupid that's how that's where i saw it so i guess it's hard for me to say because i wasn't deep in the weeds on bitcoin development uh what the tribalism exactly was like there would sometimes be um some like some stuff where like uh someone would go crazy and a dev would say something absolutely ridiculous like luke jr saying something stupid and then like you know that would make news for a day and that's mostly what i remember interesting okay so i'm gonna go with the tribalism was not nearly as present as it is in today's world i would say between blockchains correct absolutely right okay so there was no real like sense of like bitcoin maximalism right yeah because it was kind of the only one it was like the there was a leader there wasn't a competitor or anyone really trying to compete there were people that were trying to do things that bitcoin couldn't do like name coin and omni and stuff but and all in all they they would be aligned ethically politically etc with bitcoin for the most part and the the launch of ethereum both has an idea before the actual blockchain got launched that was like bitcoin's first significant competitor right um because like ethereum as an idea was put out in 2014 and from my very loose understandings of the history back then like it offended a lot of bitcoiners back then and if you're telling me that um although there was no tribalism there was no real competition to bitcoin but then this ethereum yellow paper got released by vitalik and gavin wood and a few others and then a lot of bitcoiners were like that's that's bad uh to me that's like is that is that the first indication of when this like tribalism part of crypto really got kicked off i'm trying to think back to the feelings around the time when the yellow paper and white paper came out because i remember reading the white paper and was blown away but also by that time oh you know what else that there was starting to actually be more competition to bitcoin at the time like maybe 2014 2015 like you were talking about i might have to take back my earlier comments because i worked closely with darkcoin which was the one of the first privacy-based coins it's now called dash and they've kind of gone away from privacy a little bit but uh at the time i was working with them and they had their own unique like x11 mining protocol they were a brand new code base so they were starting to be those pop up and they were starting to go to battle with bitcoin for their lack of innovative features lack of privacy stuff like that i think ethereum's white and yellow paper coming out i think it didn't got i don't think it was taken seriously for a while i think that like there were a few people who were really interested in it but like it was posted if you go back to the forum on bitcoin talk it was kind of treated the same way as like a bunch of projects that never really made it back then like quarkcoin and stuff that had their own consensus algorithm and new ideas and new code base where it was like what's this about like like i'll look into it but like this isn't gonna change the world like no one was saying this is changing the world until maybe 2015 when it launched interesting so like this is like a little bit of a lesson in alpha like ethereum was just as like mixed in with all of the that never worked and went to zero as every other chain was back in 2014 2015 huh yeah exactly and i mean like the the marketing for ethereum back then was basically this guy named stefan twall and uh yeah and like even that and like that was good marketing from him but like everybody else who was made on the project like did not have the social skills or eq yet to like really bring ethereum to the level it is now or do something like what eos and other ones did to really bring their project up at a marketing level that's respectable but when i hear that i'm like okay good because part of like the philosophy the in my philosophy of chains is that the innermost i always view blockchains as like a set of concentric circles and the innermost circle needs to be these like die hard free open source software developer maxies that don't care about the money that don't care about the marketing that are probably like uh too like just socially awkward to really unders like promote this thing in a chilly way and that keeps the vibe of the blockchain very pure would you agree absolutely yeah blockchains and their communities have have a heart and like if you don't have the social acuity to see that find someone who does and you can copy their trades because like that is really what makes a project like valuable uh and also like worthwhile so how did you stumble upon ethereum the ethereum white and yellow papers like what what was that first like an introduction to you so i was working at usaa and um i had actually this was before usaa so i was i was working on dart coin stuff and i saw the white paper and so i participated in the pre-sale for aetherium and then i kind of forgot about it for a while like because i was getting like started at work working for usaa and i was reading about nick saba's like 1990s uh ideas around smart contracts which were like one of the first instances of a smart contract on a blockchain idea before blockchains were even a thing and i think that that inspired me to look even deeper into ethereum and then when i became like the blockchain person at usaa ethereum was the clear winner in technology and innovation um in fact we had some internal hackathons at usca where me and a team of people used solidity smart contracts before ethereum was released like in 20 early 2015 i think or 20 late 2014. so you you're running into literally before the blockchain was alive yeah i was writing on solidity with a few other people um it was like release candidate 6 i think which is like there was no documentation hardly there was like three videos on youtube of some randos like being like here's how to do solidity and they weren't even on the team uh because the team was working so hard but we tried it and i was like this works that's crazy this works um and so that's kind of what gave me hope because all the other enterprise blockchain people i talked to seemed to not know what they were doing the one exception i would say would be heiress industries which is no longer around but they did turn into tendermint um so so the cosmos tendermint people some of them um kind of started with aeris industries connections and other stuff like that to do enterprise blockchain stuff with their uh pro with their software but uh yeah that's just kind of a little side piece that i got to talk to some really early like cosmos people that was exciting and then so you started tinkering with solidity right read the white paper read the yellow paper got ethereum pilled uh not to put words in your mouth but yeah absolutely i would actually be at usa sorry for my uh old manager from usa but i would literally like sneak in working on on ethereum while i was at usca and then i'd work like a full day at usa come home and then ignore my family and friends and work six to eight hours on ethereum which i do not recommend um i think it contributed badly to my burnout later in life but uh i was that obsessed yes yeah yeah yeah certainly kind of par for the course for people that found and found these things very very compelling uh so what did you do about that well how did you how did you scale that up i did a few different things um and this actually goes into what i usually so like i right now i'm doing a lot of things to help people um mainly on twitter who just dm me like hey how do i get into the industry how do i get a job with ethereum or with blockchain technology one of the things is just like be in chat rooms talk to people and volunteer so like i let up the homestead guide development i guess like the um one of the only full guides on ethereum at the time uh in 2015 for a hard fork that was going to happen later and then i also um volunteered at devcon1 and i wasn't signed up to volunteer but i got there and it was pure chaos so i was just like hey i can help and i jump behind and i like did tickets and badges and then i did t-shirts and then i did like time keeping and then like three hours later i was like on the phone with the venue solving like structural problems with the venue and i'm not even i don't even work for ethereum someone gave me a credit card and said we need these copies now go down the street to the to the copy store and make copies with my credit card i'm like ah okay so like i'm just running around doing all this stuff and i did a post-mortem uh privately for ming chan the executive director where i wrote like a five-page thing on what went right and wrong with the conference and uh after that she wanted to hire me so i got hired to do the future devcons and devops and community stuff well this is a great lesson of people get hired after they just do work for free and prove their value for a lot of these communities uh the the early culture of ethereum i think is pretty interesting especially when like something like ethereum and bitcoin also as well especially in the early days before the culture is defined by the community the culture is defined by like the vision or the code and so like ethereum was defined by like a bunch of people who read the yellow and white papers and then like got compelled by the actual like ethereum itself rather than like you know ryan john adams and david hoffman of bankless on youtube right like no it's actually like ethereum code that is really talking to these people and attracted a very specific set of you know early believers into this thing uh and that was who you were experiencing and meeting with at like devcon one and zero at one and like the early days with him culture can you just like for the listeners and and also for me just like what was ethereum culture way back when like what was it like what was it what did it mean to be an ethereum back then it was it was very interesting number one i felt like i was like had found my tribe which i've heard from a lot of other people who join the ethereum ecosystem even today because there is this really cool thing and it wasn't you know maybe it wasn't as big back then but like you can cross like a lot like even if you have different political ideas than people you all kind of have the same ethos of having a decentralized censorship-resistant technology that it can be useful for everyone around the world that governments can't interfere with and so like that's something that brings a lot of people together and then after that there's this curiosity especially if you're into technology or you're a technologist like doing development work or something that this technology is being built by people who kind of are like you i guess is the best way to put it like everyone there had like pie in the sky visions there was people early on talking about nfts and ercs and uh the eip uh repo got released during devcon1 which i ended up eventually being one of the main maintainers of um so like all these things coming together was like really crazy and on top of that you had that combination with like reddit posters and somewhat twitter posters although less so than reddit at the time uh people like vlad zamfir where you'd read their stuff and then i got to devcon1 and i was like fangirling because i was like oh my god there's vlad and i got to talk to him and he was super nice and he actually ran out of fiat money and uh had like three or four bitcoin or something and was like hey can i trade you this bitcoin and you go to the atm and get me cash and i was like oh i'm doing a task for vlad and it was like i was just like so freaked out and i got to talk to like uh yeah like alex van dysen was super nice the first person i met when i got there was piper mariam and i i was the first aetherian person he had met too so i'd gone to dinner with like piper and martin swinde well before they worked at the ethereum foundation and we were all just there like we we found each other we're here like we've talked online for months every day sometimes multiple hours a day and we're here so yeah it was just this excitement of finding your tribe finding uh people who really relate to your ideas and being excited about a common goal i this is the same exact experience that i like communicate when i tell like my beginnings into ethereum like your devcon1 was my east denver 2017. uh just to have like a little bit more context on that like i was part of a a recreational soccer team with like some of my best friends growing up i was part of a fraternity in college i was part of all these like different like social groups but i never felt like 100 a part of these groups and then i go to dev uh east denver 2017 and i you know have like three days of conversations listen to the talks talk to strangers yeah like at the end of that weekend i'm like this is this is the 100 like alignment with this tribe this is my people this is my community and i even just after just like three days of this it was it was painfully obvious and it's just interesting to see like some of these like early relationships being formed just on just like a very just like a gut feeling of like this is the right thing for me uh and it's cool to see this like same story repeated both in the early days the middle days and now like the later days where we are today like through and through absolutely and like i i see something that i don't see in other communities that i see in ethereum are people who are welcoming like welcoming and accepting of people who are neurodivergent and i don't mean like explicitly like oh poor soul more just like oh you're autistic hell yeah like you probably code better and like oh like you don't i know like i know you're talking to me and you're staring at the wall right now but i understand that and i'm not gonna judge you for that like i would if you were at some kind of other thing right you know right like it's a lot easier to be weird in aetherium it's definitely true uh what what about um okay so that's like the kind of the community culture community vibe but like what about like actually getting  done like you kind of talked about the chaos of like devcon one uh was can you talk about like that whole side of things yeah you mean at the time during devcon1 yeah and overall just in like the 2015 to like 2016 era of the of ethereum and that and they're like this the the chaos of like because there's so many like visionaries right everyone has these like utopian visions for what ethereum could be and then everyone forgets to like also file the paperwork and make structure and process and all that stuff there were dozens of people who would work more than over time to keep things together despite people getting in the way and when i say people getting in the way like even even people what's the best way to put this there were forces that were going against ethereum at the time a lot of it was with the leadership of different organizations a lot of it was with developers being overly opinionated but throughout all that uh people just kept coding and kept making decisions and things like that i mean if we look back like some of the biggest things that i feel like just to get some spicy takes out there the biggest things that i think were forces going against ethereum were the like organization like the ethereum foundation like leadership and organization structure has always been wonky i mean i has made it a lot better but at the time ming chan if anyone read loreshan's book you can just see how crazy it was and that was put that was causing a lot of friction with the operations and other non-technical people at the ethereum foundation luckily it didn't affect the technical side much and then on top of that while ethereum foundation's doing that you'd have like uh parody technologies that would apply friction and stuff like that after gavin left the ethereum foundation to get their opinionated stuff across and then that would cause even more tension between groups and i only know this because um rather other than being in the ethereum foundation myself um i also led the core developer calls which meant that i had to be a kind of middle person between parody technologies romans java java java team uh and uh the geth team and the javascript team and everything else so like it was just it was just very difficult i don't think i think if you look back on those calls you can kind of see the tension and how difficult it was but it would be very very boring because they're core developer calls and they're just boring by default uh so yeah it's it's been a challenge hazu recently um talked a lot about his vision over maker dao governance and how right right now currently maker dow governance is being pulled in seven different directions at once because no one really has a coherent or articulated vision for what maker dao is therefore everyone imparted their vision for what it is upon maker down and tried to tug make her down in that direction is that kind of how you would describe like the early days of ethereum is like everyone it's like you know the blind man feeling the feeling the elephant metaphor like gavin wood feels ethereum is going to be like this and somebody else thinks ethereum is going to be like that and like all of a sudden like none of these visions are actually completely compatible with each other and there therefore there's friction is that a fair way to summarize sarah um yes and no yes and that there were people with differing visions that would clash and then eventually leave the ecosystem like charles hoskinson and gavin wood that's absolutely true i would say that even though that was happening though the weirdest thing i still don't know why this has happened to this day but everyone still followed vitalik's lead it was kind of the only way i can really describe it is kind of like um it would be bad for your clout and your social status if you were to go against vitalik at the time because he was the leader of ethereum uh i mean and at this point he just has influence in ethereum i don't consider him the leader of ethereum any longer um not in a negative way like vitalik's amazing but just i feel like he's purposefully taken steps back and he's had enough times when his ideas didn't go through that i don't consider him the almighty leader that's what i'm trying to say so and to what you said yes there was differing opinions on where to go but the thing that kept everyone together back in those days was vitalik uh and it was just an amazing feat of or maybe luck i don't know to this day of just people following the leader and really going with what he needed what what needed to happen for ethereum to succeed vitalik at that time was something like 17 years old i think and i remember watching uh i just i i shot that number from my hip so somebody needs to check me on that um i remember watching a video of vitalik um around the era of devcon one like very early 2015 2016 of vitalik young kid vitalik shaved head uh obviously in front of a very like professional camera with like a script of like what ethereum is like and it was like some early early marketing of ethereum and it's like vitalik marketing ethereum you would never see him doing that today and like it's definitely like somebody else came to vitalik and like vitalik we're gonna put a camera in front of you and you're gonna like promote ethereum and he was i'm guessing at 17 he was probably like okay that makes sense this is what i do not really having developed his total and comprehensive philosophy of blockchains that he has today what what was vitalik's what was vitalik like and like because he was around like 17 18 maybe even younger no not younger no not younger no he was i mean by the time 2015 rolled around how old would he have been he would have been like 21 over 20 21 yeah because i was like 22 to 24 in 2015. okay so he was born in 94. uh and so in 2015 he would have been 19. god that's so bad at math anyways this is an extremely huge responsibility putting on a 19 20 year old back in 2015 and 2016. like from your observations how vitalik hang like how do you handle that um i think he had to grow up really quickly but i'm not saying that in like a negative way just more of a that's what ended up happening i think he handled it pretty well under the circumstances i don't think i could have done any better honestly and neither could many many other people i know um he was definitely put in a position where there was a lot of people from a lot of sides talking to him and giving their opinions and it's really hard to cut through the bs and know who to trust and things like that when that's happening and i've been there too because like i was listening to the same voice as he was in ef leadership and outside of ef leadership where i'm like well wait are they really meaning well are they really wanting the best for this like so it's it's always really hard to juggle he um also and this is something that i think other people have commented on his speaking skills improved drastically uh from 2015 until today so that was something that helped a lot with um the communication around ethereum's vision and stuff like that uh but again what i try to stress to people it's like uh i almost feel weird dissecting vitalik because he's a person and to me it's like if there was someone on a podcast dissecting me i would feel weird about that and it's not to say that we shouldn't because he is a public figure and that's fair but like at the end of the day anyone who's talking to them to him like they start to realize like like he's just a dude right yeah exactly like he's just a person like and that's kind of the thing i've always taken and that's also why i think he appreciates people who provide blunt feedback to him about when he's wrong because he's not better than anyone else right all right well i don't mean to do this a little bit more yeah no that wasn't it yeah i'm going to do this i'm going to just ask one more question in the same uh in the same question do you think at that time in 2015 to 2016 that vitalik understood the magnitude of what ethereum would eventually become no i don't think so there were interviews after that where he said i had no idea would get this big this quickly and that is also an excuse i use a lot including the people close to me as to why proof of stake took this long we thought that we'd have a lot more time i feel like to get proof of stake and you know get out of the energy wasteful proof of work because we wouldn't get this big to where we're actually contributing to the demise of the earth interesting so so yeah that's that's kind of a take that i hear a lot of early ethereum people have which is no we had no idea it would get to this magnitude and because of that bad things are happening and we feel bad but we what you can't stop it once it starts crazy crazy and that's actually the first time i've heard that that uh proof-of-stake well my my general answer for why proof-of-stake has taken so long is that all the early ethereum developers underestimated how complex of a transition that was going to be um this is the first time i've heard that no one expected ethereum to become so gargantuan so quickly and that was actually a big reason as to why it got so complex that's kind of yeah i mean like i do want to separate it to say that like i at least me personally and i've heard this for other people too i thought we'd have more time to like really hammer out everything but the proof of stake transition has a long and sordid history because we want to do the most we want to um do our best to get it right at a time timely but more importantly get it right so that it lasts for a long time which is i think a lot of the motivation for ditching the casper proof-of-stake chain that danny came up with that danny finalized as an eip a few years ago and now that wasn't the hybrid proof of work proof of stake yes it was no no no no sorry not the hybrid no no it was the hybrid um it was the one where it was going to be like uh casper proof of stake and then we were going to put sharding like right after or something like that right right right right okay all right so let's keep on going in in ethereum's history uh 2017 16 is like 2016 i kind of correlate to 2020 and that like 2020 was up only for eth price after we hit the bottom in march and 2016 if you look at the price the price rights is like up only because it's like the crescendo building up to the ico mania when was it obvious that ethereum was about to go through this like massive bull market back then you mean yeah back then yeah oh man i'll be honest um i am an awful trader um i didn't even look at the price that much hang on let me ask let me ask this question uh slightly differently how did the community receive the auger ico oh that okay i see what you're saying okay that was pretty exciting when those things started happening because uh when ethereum i'll put it this way when ethereum first launched there were a lot of games like little mini games kind of like satoshi dai style games on on aetherium and uh like you know like kind of ponzi games in a way that we're like just little like be the top of the pyramid and that's all we had for a while and yeah like no seriously like you could look it up there's like games where you were there was a pyramid and you was like get to the top of the pyramid i'm like that's that that's sketch right okay so so there are games like that and like people just doing random stuff but like there were a few use cases people were really really excited about but they hadn't been developed yet one of them was maker now one of them was auger um another one was going to be um nose uh i think like uh what's it called oh the stuff where you could do a graphics card um oh uh golem golem gollum yeah was another so like those were kind of some of the big ones and the only ones out of those three that i feel like really delivered in all the ways they need to so far has been maker although it is going through somewhat of a crisis right now it sounds like from certain people yeah it's gone through crisis before yeah so basically to answer your question yeah it felt like once they started coming out with the ico oh another big one was digixdao for the for the uh gold that you could store i think i had some digix now i definitely had some ico auger uh tokens uh but uh it was very cool to see it being like it's almost here it's almost here and all we gotta do is give a little bit of money and that plays into the psyche of how the ico era tricked so many people into giving into scams or giving into projects that weren't going to make it because it's like oh this is an idea i love this idea and it's so close and all they need is a little bit of money i can throw in some tokens i can throw them some money for tokens yeah they see a little funding and then they run away with it and then it's like oh no but i had such i said had such high hopes and it you know scar it like a makes people jaded so that's unfortunate right but augur didn't do that and for listeners who don't aren't familiar with auger a-u-g-u-r is what you want to google it was the first ico on ethereum led by joey krug uh and it was a prediction market and it was it was the first like construction of an ethereum dap we called them daps back then that like i think just kind of made sense on paper it's like yes you do need a token for this thing the token has a very specific role to play uh and the idea is sound and that it definitely needs a blockchain to do it and so like that and it was the first ico on ethereum uh and so like it was really like this the one of the few icos that weren't tainted right like they actually built the product they actually delivered it uh but then it like kicked off this snowball of like that followed over the next like 18 months yeah yeah for sure and uh yeah auger was very impressive it turns out that like the downfall of of a lot of daps that would come out over the next few years and i'm talking auger i'm talking fun fare that's going to be on the regulatory yeah that's going to be on the regulatory side funfair was like a casino on the blockchain style set of dapps that used state channels very early on which was a scaling technique but i believe i'm not positive so don't take my word for this but i felt like there was a lot of regulatory pressure on both auger and funfair which led to slowdowns and then also the other side of it is other dapps that didn't quite make it some of it was a marketing thing where like you couldn't tell if they were legit in a stream of just daps and so they didn't rise to the top or get usage right yeah and this is when i come into this story where i like start to see these icos and be like oh you can find an idea before it exists and then you can manifest the idea into existence via your funding wow we've solved human coordination and then like 99 of them they're just like no you just paid us money thanks bro uh and then the bear market comes anyways going back to like the core ethereum developers during this era what did they think of it uh the few of them that were actually watching thought it was stupid and kept coding it's pretty as much as simple as that they never never lifted their head up from the laptop wow so like this whole entire massive mania went on and the core developers were like that's nice um not even that they would actually get a little annoyed some of the time because users especially new users would blame them for congestion on the network because there were major icos such as the status ico that would take down the net take down i say not actually take down but like slow down the network to a point where it was basically unusable for certain users uh who weren't paying high enough gas fees and at the time you know crazy that you'd have to pay a 20 gas fee and that's way too high like now it looks very different now but no like i would i would kind of hear every once in a while little quibbles about stuff but like um no if it was basically if it was important enough to be brought up to them myself or someone else would just bring it to them during the all-core devs call or in the chat room uh but no they just they just kept coding on on what they were starting needing to code on because like um yeah they cared more about the product of ethereum than the use cases uh that were fly-by-night potentially and how has your role in ethereum changed during this period where what are you up to these days in 2017 yeah so 2017 so uh when i started in 2016 the middle of 2016. i was on the devops team for the ethereum foundation one of two people the other is jamie pitts who's amazing um and then i also ran devcon 2 and then i ran devcon 3 in 2017 also in the middle of that time um our awesome communications director at the ethereum foundation george hallam had to leave so i took over his communications as well as devops as well as devcon i also started doing the eip um eip editing so like i was an eip editor and i did the all core devs meeting every other week so that was like all the things i did at that moment and it only grew yeah that was a lot of things uh can you just like how has the like the culture in the ef and around like the the innermost circle of the concentric circles of ethereum like the core devs how how has this like how's the vibe shifted by like two three years into it like how is it developed um yeah so by the time like by 2017 2018 right overall yeah going through the story of just the the progress and development of just like ethereum development culture progress uh just vibes of the innermost innermost circle of ethereum yeah we're starting to see some some uh stress burnout and being tired from some of the inner circle part of that also was something we completely skipped which was the dow hack but oh yeah that happened during that time uh so like that actually took out a few at least one or two core devs from their job not out of fear but out of just like it was just an absolutely the most stressful thing ever because there was a ticking time clock there was you know a lot of stuff at risk there was the you know credible neutrality of the network at risk a bunch of other stuff so that that affected a lot of people for a long time there are people who completely broke like mentally because of the dow hack and then after that uh as the ico thing happened there was a lot of stress and pressure that you know devs are still feeling to this day but have been alleviated thanks to some of the work by people like trent van epps uh who go and they're like more of a voice for the community than um you know having to speak directly to a core developer if you have a problem with your dap for instance um so yeah the morale morale wasn't uh the highest ever but they still believed in the mission it was just everyone was really tired we had been working for four years straight right right right right uh and if losers wanted to hear like just a very deep dive into the dow hacks story i did an episode with griff green uh layer zero with griffin and so like if you want to hear that part of ethereum you could just like supplant that like right into this middle of conversation with hudson um we'll when we you can dive down that rabbit hole because it's a definitely a deep rabbit hole but can you could you summarize like how the dow hack maybe maybe it's fair to say like left a scar on like the ethereum uh devs like how did the trajectory of ethereum change because of the dow hack obviously like we hard forked but like more about the developers and just their mental state yeah so i would say a couple things i don't want to name names just because it's people's private lives but there were a few people who um basically went through and had to deal directly with the stress and pressure of having making that decision being the one to code certain things being the one to challenge their ethos and you know figure out what their teammates believe in and having a lot of people yelling on reddit and twitter and podcasts or like all kinds of stuff so that just was a lot of stress that was put on them some of them took breaks afterwards and were able to handle it other ones fell out um and that's kind of what happened there i will say there is a positive to this in that the dow hack took fractured the community in a way where people who were purist from a you know sensor or like from a not immutability standpoint went with ethereum classic and then ethereum kept people who were practical and i liked that i stayed with the practical people i wasn't really i was back and forth on whether or not we should do it at the time i would have been fine if we had actually kept you know let the attacker keep the ethan and the dow tokens etc and not intervened uh but i respected the fact that there was a lot of discussion with the community from around the world that vitalik and others did to come to the conclusion that there should be kind of a signaling system from leadership including some of the core devs vitalik others that this should be the default option in clients uh some clients okay so can you summarize the argument as to why the choices were made in the way that they were about the dow hat sure yeah so um there's a few things so just the i i need to stress that there was a compounding factor of a timeline basically how the dow code was set up you only had i forgot what it was like 21 days to figure this out before the decision that you make is permanent you can either leave it how it was or you can put in a regular state transition uh which basically means telling the blockchain to do something that you usually wouldn't do which is to take the coins out of the dow attacker put it into uh back to the users through a multi-sig that was set up and you say only 21 days but it's also definitely worth to note that most contract hacks are zero one block and so there's actually a nice feature in the dow hack that was very serendipitous that allowed for a 21 day window so yes a 21 day window is very short amount of time to make a very big decision but the fact that it existed at all saved the ethereum blockchain from doing a full rollback of the chain and only had to do a regular state transition of one single contract exactly precisely and so the uh we do so there was people point to the coin voting that happened uh as like the reason that that's that the change that we decided this i think it was more than that the ethereum dot org blog post kind of referenced the coin vote and i think that was a bad move because there were like hundreds of chat rooms going on talking about this that me and other people in ethereum participated in and then would bring back the opinions to reddit publicly and sometimes privately to different developers and developer groups um and i think that the practical thing would be that uh if we had to hack that big um we had basically that was like the only major dap to participate in at the time you could look back and be like why didn't you know why didn't people keep their money like a huge percentage of people participated in that so you'd basically be saying like making a lot of people sad that they lost their money you'd be losing a lot of people who were using your blockchain and you might not recover from that or you can do this one-time thing from someone who is a malicious actor and then at an early stage of your development and you know maybe be more prosperous uh the best thing i heard about this was i think it was years later but andreas antonopoulos who's a bitcoin advocate and very popular bitcoin speaker said that he considers the dow hack like a baby hitting their head while they're trying to learn to walk like if you're a baby you're trying to learn to walk like ethereum is less than a year old from launch i think you've got to hit your head on a table and fall down but like you're going to learn not to do that and then as an adult you don't hit your head on that same table ever so yeah that's how i see it i remember andrus giving a talk at 2019 ethereum denver uh maybe his 2020 ethereum denver um and he talked about how you get one mulligan you get one because if you use it twice then you then you know two is a trend one is a mulligan two is like now if if like and now well fast forwarding super far into the future and we have like this tornado cache thing uh like if if the authorities came and said hey roll back the chain and you tell them well we can't do it and they say like well you did it twice like that's different than like a one single mulligan and i don't think and no one in today's world thinks that you can roll back the ethereum blockchain even though it did it we didn't roll it back we had a regular regular state transition but no one thinks that you can just do that no one thinks that that's a tool in the tool belt that we have i agree i agree the tornado cache thing's a shame too i mean i think it'll be solved in the end right but yeah yeah yeah that's at the very end of this conversation because we're going we're doing a very good job of going chronic criminals yeah okay so that was a dow hack uh we we will speed run through 2017. um the 2018 to 2020 um bear market uh was no now i'm here no i'm now i'm involved um so i can start to remember some of this how would you describe like developer morale and just like the developer attitude back then i thought that for developer morale was actually really good because there was a lot of cool new creative ideas during that time and we weren't distracted by a lot of the stuff that a bear uh sorry that a bull market brings um people say you know it's kind of cliche within crypto twitter to say like i'm so glad there's a bear market because now we can build but like that truly is a thing that developers feel because there's less distractions and there's less people throwing money at you to do things because that's a hard thing to turn away when you know you might not be making as much money so right um i i want to check my check this with you i think before 2017 the ethereum community and the ethereum like inner sanctum of book core dev believers was more or less the same thing and then in 2018 after the ico mania there was an actual ethereum community that was separate from the devs uh and like post-20 post-2017 mania i think this is when like there was this big growth in ethereum community that like you know listen to the devs and like listen to like what was going on but didn't actually partake and so there was like a new concentric circle that was outside of the inner circle of the ethereum core devs and vitalik and you and now then there's people like me anthony cesano ryan eric connor on this like more outside circle and i don't think that existed prior to that bull market would you agree with that i would agree with that and a part of that reason was less about the bull market but more about the fact that prior to 2017 there were less daps to get excited about and pull people in you kind of had to watch the core dev meetings because that's all that was going on it's like when you used to have only three tv channels in the 1950s like you just watched it or you just participated with the core devs and whatever they were doing because that was all there was there was just that an auger and the dow so like now we have dozens of things to do and we have d5 that's starting to come up and so now it's like our attention's on that so we're so the newcomers and other people are paying less attention to the core devs or if they are they're gonna start to have disagreements which is great i love that i think that's perfect because the last thing i want is and the last thing the core developers want is to have all the decision-making power with no influence from the community right and how and i actually kind of consider you as somebody that spans both of these parts of these circles you're definitely part of the broader ethereum community and you do your new interface with the core devs quite a lot how would you describe the this relationship between the innermost circle of ethereum and then the first concentric circle outwards of this and how has it changed how did it change over 2018 to 2020 or so yeah so i would say that ethereum itself as a community with everything involved in it got so big it was untenable for there to be more of a direct connection between the core developers and say the commoners on reddit or the commoners on twitter commentors [Laughter] what happened was it got so big that it was just untenable to do that so there started to be more direct things like at that time i was more of i would call myself a developer liaison all the time because i our core developer liaison because i'd be in reddit and i'd be in twitter and i'd be wherever else chat rooms and then i would bring the concerns to the core developer agenda or to individual core developers or projects or clients and then be that interface because they are so busy and there was so much on their plate they didn't have the time so it was more of a growth thing just it was more of a growth thing rather than like not wanting to be involved um not not to say that you you indicated that at all but just like the the core devs like it just got became too big right lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your note to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there zk sync is an ethereum layer 2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zk sync has combined the power of zero knowledge roll ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but cryptokiller apps need zk sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zk sync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zk sync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on twitter too at zksync how significant were there when did like a big tug of war happen around core devs where like there's like political desires to pull ethereum in one direction and the community wanted to pull in another direction did when did that become really relevant uh there's a little something called prague pal that was fun was that was that really the first instance of this that was the largest instance in my opinion of the community disagreeing with the decision of the core developers um i can't think of another core developers though did all the core developers believe in prog pal um i would say all the core developers were either neutral to approving just about interesting why why did that there's not every single one but yeah the schism came out because the community felt like they weren't being heard in fact i think eric connor was either on your podcast or sassel's podcast and said that like the community doesn't feel like her broadcast you mean into the ether could it be as oh it wasn't to the ether yes it was it was the episode it's crazy to think that eric connor did stuff once in a while [Laughter] shout out erica i love you okay so so basically uh yeah so so basically that was one of the biggest schisms because although the core devs had been making that decision for a while i came on reddit and said hey this decision has been made and at that time i was having a large family crisis so there was like a good two to four week time where i hadn't updated the community on anything like i had because i had been ethereum obsessed for years and it finally came to a head where i didn't so then when i updated them late i kind of blamed myself for this because like then everyone was like whoa we didn't hear about this we didn't get enough warning and then everyone like started getting like there was memes made about me like there was a meme that makira uh made uh and uh it was a thing where i was at a table like the table at the college campus where it says change my mind but it said uh prague is happening this year changed my mind and it had my face on it and i was like i got mean this is so cool but like but like other people were like oh man don't make fun of hudson i was like well you can make fun of me but don't actually like send me angry messages like a few of you have right like it got really contentious um and it ended up the community winning i guess to an extent but like at the same time like in that time we wasted a lot of time and money by doing like audits and there was just no cohesion there i think the community learned from that though a lot of people i talked to privately who were some of the biggest voices against prague apologize to me privately to say hey i got onto you too much i didn't research enough it really wouldn't have been the end of the world if it happened that kind of stuff right and and just to speed around listeners on proctol pro power stands for progressive proof of work and it was basically we're going to swap out the ethereum mining algorithm from eath hash which it currently is to progressive proof of work and this came about as a result of a bunch of asics arriving on the scene for ethereum and ethereum's supposed to be this asic-resistant mining algorithm and so if you enable asics into ethereum uh you produce a more centralized mining uh uh like industry around ethereum and we don't like centralization we like these things to be gpu mineable and so progpow was supposed to restore the first-class nature of gpu miners and ethereum but the community thought that this change was too political in nature and so it was determining there there were going to be some winners some parties of ethereum that were going to win over others and we didn't really justify i felt like it was a justifiable change to change the mining algorithm uh because it wouldn't have really changed the trajectory too much of ethereum and so the idea was like a minute we only necessary necessary changes only uh and so the and then but for some reason to this day i still don't know why a lot of the core developers liked this this update dude why did yeah progpal resonate with core devs yeah so and it was actually programmatic proof of work for those looking it up oh okay cool yeah this is this is why we're gonna be you not me yeah also if we have a if we have a uh i have a website hudsonjamison.com if you look like one page back on my blog post i have like a 15 minute blog post of the entire history of progpal um so if anyone's interested to get nerdy go there um so yeah the core developers liked it because that seemed like a to them like a credible threat um that asics could take control of the network and how we have it now is like and including today we know the people who are the top five biggest pools that make up over like sixty percent of the network or like seventy percent uh two of them make over fifty percent but they're altruistic and good actors we know that because they're helping out right now with the merge um but if the a6 came on those people would be forced to be kicked off potentially and then we'd have unknown actors operating asics that could easily take up over 50 of the network and then if they're bad actors who knows what could happen but all that was unknown at the time there was a rising asics were being made for um et hash um but they weren't like the algorithm but they weren't like super relevant yet they were starting to be here's the thing though this is very interesting because people are probably wondering well what about today are asics taking over the network now that we haven't done anything it turns out there is only about 20 a6 on the network as of earlier this year as what i've heard from people's analysis now here's the thing i think the reason for that is the pandemic and the chip shortage that stopped basic manufacturing and the pandemic stopped a lot of other stuff so had that not happened would asics have taken over maybe so really we're still at an unknown if it was a good idea or not but it turned out okay in the end because we're moving to proof of stake in a month i think yeah yeah yeah hopefully crossing fingers knock on wood yeah yeah but uh but yeah that's just an interesting side thing i was going to mention right yeah and it's not that like the pr progpal was really all that uh interesting it was more about the interface between the community and the developers which is really the biggest the big story out of prague powers it was just like progpal was this the the field between these two things um how how did that event impact ethereum would you say like moving forward i think that it was a wake-up call to certain people that there needed to be better interfacing between um the people who are uh making the decisions on the core developer side with the community uh so we started having more ideas about that the ethereum cat herders which is a group of people who do note taking for the core dev calls and they also do surveys of the community and educational podcasts and stuff like that they're a group i co-created with a few other people and um they also had some ideas that started to be enacted like we started having more ethereum cat herders on the call on the core dev call and we started interfacing with people like trent van epsmore to be a conduit and timbico to be a conduit uh for the community to the core devs and also tim started i think it was after right after that time tim started doing his uh tweet threads his all his core developer call tweet threads which have been very very valuable to get the word out to everybody so now if you're out of the know of what the core devs are doing like i'm not going to say it's your fault but like we have notes we have a twitter thread we have live and recorded videos on youtube and so like you just look at it yourself and uh it was the cordevs perhaps were they perhaps like surprised as to like how large and uh how large the ethereum community had grown at this point and like how much of a of a voice the ethereum community had gotten in the last like year or so i think that might also play into the story maybe i i never talked to anyone specifically about that point but i would say that i personally am surprised at how loud and big the community can get and not in a negative way like i'm impressed like i'm like oh people can come together and really share their opinion in a mature way unlike bitcoiners who literally just backstab each other and yell so and like again this this community that it rose around it was really like it was anthony cesano ryan sean adams eric connor me dc investor spencer noon was around um many other people who i've forgotten eeks on twitter shout out eeks um like generally he stays silent until something like political happens and then he and then he wakes up and then he also chad donates like 20 ether into like 50 different bitcoin grants um but yeah this is like where uh a lot of the ethereum community like banded together like yo we don't know how to be devs but we understand the philosophy and like we've got a voice uh and like this is i would call like this era of ethereum where like this second concentric circle around a theory i'm really really calcified and like got built out absolutely absolutely i think it did and i think the community is growing and growing but like we're starting to learn how to better manage that as as a group as everybody i guess like how to interface with people and like etiquette for how to talk to your projects and apps that you like and not be a prick in a discord server and stuff like that and around this at the end of this era uh i think 2020 maybe early 2021 i can't remember refresh my memory but that's this is when you actually uh stepped down from your role at the ef right yeah april 2021 i stepped down from the ethereum foundation i also pretty much had stopped eip editing for a while at that point but had been helping a little bit with management but honestly people like mike azolty who's a beast and a few other people have really taken up the torch on that uh and then yeah i quit the ethereum foundation uh waited a few months and then voluntarily checked myself into a mental hospital because because i was burned down and was having issues okay talk about that and also can you can you talk about this like burnout culture in this space yeah absolutely and just a quick uh what's it called phil yeah quick chill i'm doing a talk at devcon in bogota colombia on burnout culture and how to avoid it and stuff but basically i've had mental health problems for a while just like a like i have twitter threads on it you can probably search but basically and also on my blog but um uh i like depression anxiety bipolar 2 ocd adhd and probably have autism but we're figuring that one out later and that's not even a mental illness that's just like oh hudson you're kind of weird yeah so basically yeah it's a narrow technicality exactly so basically um i had been depressed and had not left my bed for weeks and um i part of my bipolar 2 symptoms is having intrusive thoughts so they're thoughts that like i literally sit there and have to think about them i can't stop thinking about them and they involve they involve suicide so i was sitting there in my bed thinking about it thinking about thinking about it i'm not gonna do it but it was so annoying and so just blasting in my brain i checked myself into mental hospital to like get help voluntarily i stayed there for a month in 2021 um and uh yeah it was a very good experience overall i did go to like a rich person mental hospital um called manager clinic which was really good i say rich person because like all the other like other mental hospitals have bad right like like like things attached to them like they have like histories of like not being good stigma they have a stigma around them yeah yeah so this one actually got me on new medicine they did a new test on me i completely got off all my old medicine onto new medicine and by the time i got out i was pretty good so then i started working for flashbots uh later that year and then i just and then i burned out again because i started working too fast because i was too excited about the industry and so um we left i left flashbots on very good terms in february they were super supportive the whole time about the struggles i was going through flashbots is amazing shout out to them uh and so then that's into 2022 i guess so we're almost there to now and uh since then i've only done zcash community grants which is a grants committee that isn't a full-time job so but that's that's been good for me as well uh can you talk about ethereum's role did is it ethereum that sent you to a mental hospital hudson that's a good question so i think that it was how i interacted with ethereum because it has been my blockchain's been my obsession since 2011. like in all forms and so like either bitcoin dark coin ethereum z cash and so i've had an unhealthy relationship with it where that's like all i would do all i would think about all i would try to succeed in and i think so that was ultimately me it wasn't actually aetherium but i do will say that to your point ethereum does breed a culture either it's either a hustle culture on one end or a like you need to devote yourself kind of culture that i think is very unhealthy and i think we're getting better about calling that out um but there's a there's a ways to go um i'm gonna have some very strong opinions on that at my devcon talk but in general we all need to just kind of make sure that if you if you are a boss have some time for employees to have like mental health days with no questions asked and like if you're a person like get get a therapist they're really cool like it helped me a lot that's like the number one thing that helped me and look into you know de-stressing yourself and finding ways to everyone's going to be different but just find ways to not get too obsessed so that you burn out yeah uh their therapy is tight uh therapists are basically just like personal trainers for your brain like everyone should have one regardless of like what mental state you're in oh yeah i mean otherwise you'll end up in brain jail like me so don't go to brain jail kids yeah they don't they don't they don't let you have real curtains it's all velcro it's not good right right right yeah no no things that you can hook a line around um yep uh hudson what would you say that you the you the legacy you've left behind has been in this in this industry the way you phrase that made me think that you think i'm leaving or i've left the legacy you've left behind so far so far so far okay okay yeah how have you trajectory been altered by your existence i think that there's a few times that i've heavily affected some of the trajectory behind the ethereum foundation um which i'm pretty proud of when i did my work there with the amazing people there there's some people who've been there since the beginning and are incredible um and then also from a community perspective i'd like to be remembered as someone who is nice and um did eventually did the right thing and started speaking up for things i believe in i think the first half of my ethereum experience i was very quiet about causes i believed in which are like mental health issues queer issues privacy issues because that wasn't in line with ethereum all the time uh but now i'm much more open about that and i want to almost be known for that i think i i think a few people are starting to call me woke on twitter so like you know there's a win [Laughter] see i just want to be a nice person who's changed some stuff i guess i i don't really have like huge goals or anything i just i just want to be a nice person if if you were able to spin up like five clones of hudson and set them off on different tasks of things that you want the industry to be better about or work on what would those things be um all right five clones one club two clones would go to z cash so that they could accelerate their their progress in deciding to join um a route towards ethereum alignment and programmability potentially i would have another clone go and work with trent and tim because that's really fun and they're awesome people and maybe they could do more collection of like community stuff even the trent's doing a good job and then there's two clones left hold on all right so two clones i would have one of them go to conferences and speak on that's like really important i don't know what those topics are yet and then the last clone would have like a like be like a posting podcast where i go over the post of the day on crypto twitter that's one of the best answers to any question i've ever asked on this show uh but which is a great i'm glad you answered that but what i kind of meant is just like what about the crypto culture do you think we would need to work on as a community oh um the biggest thing is going to be like actually take diversity and like inclusion of different people seriously because like there's kind of this thing where we were kind of inherited this libertarian-esque thing where it's like oh you could be gay you could be a woman it doesn't matter you're on the internet it doesn't matter but really it does matter because if you're not supporting people who are underrepresented they're going to be you know like interacting with people who do think they don't deserve a place at the table and so really what you're doing is being passive which is not helping them at all and you're being privileged and blind to their problems that they're going through so that's kind of a big thing right now is that if we get more diverse voices from different genders and sexualities and races and religions and ethereum that's going to be the ultimate way for us to really reach places we haven't reached before which is like non-white male spaces basically what you're saying is that if you take a passive neutral stance you don't get to pat yourself on the back and pride yourself in how progressive you are you actually need to tilt the board in favor of the underrepresented people and that that should be considered the new neutral is when you've tilted the board in favor of the underrepresented communities yeah exactly and it's like it doesn't have to be like oh give the woman a job instead of a man like it doesn't have to be like that but it's like i don't know just like if you see something call it out and don't just say well that person's stupid and must be in the minority like call it out i want to see 30 people calling out if if a crypto twitter if a woman in crypto twitter is getting like shamed or something i want to see 50 people call it out i don't want to see it just left there cool that's one example what other things can we do to help help in this regard i think that i think the community needs to be a bigger advocate for privacy um i think that privacy is incredibly important and it's a shame that it's not going to be built into the base layer of ethereum anytime soon if ever um because if it's not built into the base layer then you're going to have to bring on non-anonymous assets to turn it into railgun or tornado cash well not anymore or other things you know so privacy is a big deal and i actually i have a quick anecdote about you david if you if you don't mind about privacy sure so david you have a problem getting it up and what happens is when you take someone home from like a nice third date or something you're you know you're in the mood you can't get it up so you go and you buy penis you know erectile dysfunction pills for your penis and that transaction you maybe use a credit card or venmo or paypal and then suddenly it's out there for everyone to see the metadata is out there and you would think i'm not doing anything wrong so i don't need privacy so i'm not going to use an anonymous crypto for it but really someone later can look at the fact that you have ed and not date you in the future because they have a bias against that or something if they're like work at a place that has that metadata so my point is even if you're not doing something wrong you need privacy if i am funding uh like an like someone's abortion or like maybe an abortion rights organization um i don't want the government because this is something they're starting to try to do it's like come in and like actually look at those transactions and if it's across state lines charging you with stuff just because you paid that way we should all be supporting bigger privacy for both chat services and anonymous monies uh just not too long ago uh some like period tracking apps sold all their data to facebook uh so this is kind of like i'm trying to find the tweet from uh evan mcmullen about this uh oh yeah she goes in may i explained on stage that web 2 surveillance data would be used to prosecute women and limit their body autonomy on multiple podcasts i repeated that data self-custody is the key to safety uh and now it's happening uh and she retweeted something that says from the motherboard twitter account says we've obtained court documents that show facebook gave police and nebraska teenagers private chats about her abortion and then use those chats to seize her phone and computer okay so slightly different than than what i said uh so yeah super relevant still that that's a good example though yeah because it's like that's the serious case the other one's about your penis sorry i had to bring you in i would like to say that hudson used me as an example but this is not a conversation i've had with hudson previously yes i should make that clear that's that's completely a joke happening to use me as a as a person not not a personal personal experience everyone everyone david's penis is fine oh my god uh hudson i definitely appreciate everything that you've done for this community and in the very candid and comical way that you uh do all of your things as listeners of this podcast have enjoyed thus far is there any final messages or just final words of wisdom that you have to impart upon the listeners of layer zero yeah um i would say that uh something that a lot of advice that i've been giving to people ladies lately especially that are like just starting out in ethereum or blockchain i was just at z con the other day and there was someone who came up and like took a picture with me and another person who saw me at a bar and like wouldn't talk to me and i talked to them and i was like uh he was like i'm kind of star struck right now and i was like okay i'm not better than you and you're not better than me you're not better than vitalik or zuko wilcox or anyone else like you if you don't have confidence just fake it like don't interrupt people or be rude if you're at a conference with them obviously like there's still social etiquette but like don't be too starstruck to really put your chance out there to share ideas and meet people a lot of people are friendly especially in ethereum and zcash they're very friendly and open to chats and dialogues over chat message and chat rooms so start there and uh you i mean you really can be as big as you want to be and do as much as you want to do just try to gain some confidence 100 i really enjoy that sentiment and and honestly ironically uh the people i i've had this experience as well like some people aggressively like go out of their way to meet me and then like those people tend to be the ones that like pitch me something within 30 seconds and then there's the other people that are very silent and they're like oh i don't want to disturb you but just like i'm a huge fan and it's those people that i enjoy talking to far more it's like those people who kind of get it uh and want to be humble and not like you know bother the people that they see on crypto twitter or podcast all day but it's the humble ones that actually are the ones that have interesting thoughts and like are worth talking to and it's the super aggro ones that like go out of your way to like you know aggressively annoy you and like talk about hey can i come on your podcast i like don't have anything interesting to say uh and so if you are one of the quieter more introverted shire people of the crypto community uh you are free to lean into not being so quiet and
