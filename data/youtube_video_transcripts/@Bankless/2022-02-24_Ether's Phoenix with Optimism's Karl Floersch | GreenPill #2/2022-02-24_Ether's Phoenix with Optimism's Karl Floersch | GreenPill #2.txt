how can i make the highest impact today right that is like the only thing on your mind how do i make the highest impact [Music] hello and welcome to the green pill i'm kevin walke and this is the podcast about public goods and regenerative crypto economics this episode is with carl flores who is the co-founder of optimism and one of the primary advocates in the ethereum ecosystem for public goods funding i've known carl for a couple years now and he inspires me on many levels the first is just the level of energy and optimism through which he operates the second is his sheer brilliance in working at the plasma group and then later on optimistic roll-ups in launching the optimism layer 2 network so i think that optimism is a really exciting place because it's one of the best layer twos out there in the ethereum ecosystem and they've also pledged to give one million dollars of their first sequencer fees to public goods in the ethereum ecosystem through what's called retroactive public goods funding so carl continues to be a source of inspiration for for me and i hope that he gives you inspiration for what public goods in the ethereum ecosystem could become without further ado i give you carl flourish so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only debt his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap your swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless i am here with my co-conspirator in regenerative cryptoeconomics carl flores co-founder of optimism and of retroactive public goods funding uh carl what's up how you doing i'm pretty good i'm really excited to be here and excited to take the green pill um so tell us how did you get into crypto and how did you come to founding optimism well i guess it all started with my um my mom and my dad actually um my dad being a uh uh kind of radical political contrarian and my mom being a a hindu you know universal consciousness kind of person and then uh and then growing up on things like world of warcraft getting me into the the metaverse kind of all of those things combined it was just it was such a natural fit in uh around like 2015 where i just saw these devcon zero videos with with vitalik and i was like oh my gosh i gotta i gotta get involved i gotta start doing peer-to-peer stuff google is not for me um and uh yeah dove right in worked at uh consensus and then uh stopped doing that and worked on uh casper with vitalik and and vlad and traveled around the world and talked about ethereum and uh it is it has been a a whirling uh uh roller coaster ride ever since um uh i'm realizing now that you and i overlapped at consensus probably in 2017 back in the day yeah that's where bitcoin got its start as well um so i recall that you were founder of uh plasma group which was doing research on plasma and that's become optimism which is one of the top layer twos based off optoman's optimistic roll-ups can you tell us a little bit about that oh definitely okay so what happened was you know was working at was working at ethereum and we needed to scale this thing it was known from you know from the inception that we needed to scale up the the core software the core protocol and there was really a question of whether or not you know we scale it at the kind of base layer using layer one or if we allow for a little bit of permissionless innovation and start scaling at layer two and so uh myself uh jing ben kelvin we all kind of formed this group this ragtag coalition called plasma group which is which was exploring and researching kind of the the the deepest depths of plasma which was a layer two technology that is now being kind of brought into fruition kind of evolved into this whole optimistic roll-up uh roll-up space and has served as a lot of foundational elements so we uh for that for that technology so we worked on it from 2018 2019 um and then realized that there were some fundamental limits that made plasma not quite perfect for scaling ethereum that we needed to really scale ethereum at its essence and we're like okay let's do this let's fund optimism pbc a public benefit corporation two scale ethereum using layer two because we can innovate we can permissionlessly change the protocol and build what we needed to build so that was that was really amazing but there was actually a side story that i think is relevant to uh this podcast um and that actually has to do more with the the public benefit corporation side of things um plasma group was a non-profit and we set out to scale ethereum and clearly scaling ethereum is a quintessential public good for the ethereum ecosystem it is extremely extremely important for everyone and it turned out that it was extremely difficult to get the funding to get the talent to get people to rally behind scaling ethereum at a normal non-profit and that's just because there's no potential upside there's no kind of path forward once you actually do scale ethereum right and there wasn't even a lot of funding for scalability research in ethereum like the reward what was the vitalik post that said this billions of dollars per year is given to the bloc reward which is a public good it's securing the ethereum network but one one thousandth of that actually goes to researchers and i wonder if that's because uh we don't value that that public good or if it's just because it's hard to prove the usefulness of it with proof of work you have the proof of work but what you can't have a proof of knowledge work for code because it's almost like well the code i wrote this morning i don't know if it'll ever go live anything even if it does doesn't even provide value so do you think it's it's combined with people not uh appreciating public goods or the unprovability of of the value of that public good or both or something else without question it's both um i think that it was the case it is the case that we did not build these okay ethereum solved a lot of problems right it really did amazing there was it's a full technology stack from the peer-to-peer layer to the consensus layer everything so they did not solve governance as well right and governance is probably the hardest problem to solve because what you're talking about with like determining what is valuable is really a governance question so it was so natural that we just say okay you know what we can't solve governance we know that we need to be supporting and building these public goods let's just kick the problem down the road and let's give the money to the miners we know we need to fund them and it worked for a while but it eventually has become very obvious that there is a huge market failure here like this is absolutely the most egregious market failure in the ethereum ecosystem in my opinion is the lack of public goods funding that uh we have seen thus far right okay and so it was these insights that kind of led you just to fund well it was moving from plasma which i understand to to optimism which is about generalizable computation at a layer two but also bundling in maybe an economic model into the work that you're doing going from a nonprofit to a public benefit corporation which i understand is focused on the is a for-profit entity but it is focused on public benefit as as well is that right exactly so we have a charter to enshrine fair access to public goods that means that that is you know the number one thing we need to do that to fulfill our mission as a corporation and that mentality is it's great and public benefit corporations are really great vehicles for doing public goods work but it was not just the structure of the entity that that we care about in fact the entity structure is just a temporary thing the real lasting change is going to be rewiring the economic system that exists on ethereum today where transaction fees instead of just going to minors can actually go back to fund public goods for the whole community that's that was a key motivating factor that is in fact that is why it's so important that we scale ethereum it's because we have an opportunity to create that system that will fund public goods and we'll govern those public goods and the the you know the protocol in a fair and representative way what i think is interesting about what optimism is doing is that it's bundling a bleeding edge technology with almost a sort of political belief which is that public goods are good and when you use the optimism network you're not only benefiting from that technology but you're getting that bundled ethos would you agree with that yeah absolutely it's it's really like the financial infrastructure that you use should support your values and carry care about your values and so i want to use optimism right because i care because i because i will be benefiting from the public goods and i believe in the pursuit of public goods and the green pill and all that right okay well um i guess what what i want to like the big idea to me here is bundling one of the most successful layer twos in the ethereum ecosystem and by the way the ethereum scaling roadmap is all about shards in layer two um bundling that with retroactive public goods funding so could you tell us about retroactive public goods funding in the world that you wanna create using that absolutely so vitalik really ha i mean vitalik has is the genesis of literally like every idea it's pretty ridiculous honestly um but uh one idea that vitalik has had recently and just has captivated me ever since was this this idea that you should fund public goods that have already had an impact and the this idea is like really simple right it's literally just retroactive something that has already happened that has already had a positive impact you give money to the people who did that and the point is that you'd give it to them without an expectation that they're going to do more work right it is a literal reward for their impact for their the public good that they have created um and the weird thing about retroactive public goods funding is that immediately you're like okay if everything was retroactive then how am i going to get paid a salary right how am i going to actually get paid for my work and the funny thing is it's actually a second order effect this is the the key the key insight is that if you consistently pay people for the work that they provide and the value that they contribute to the public to the public good then you will start to see people investing in the public goods right it's not this like immediate you know feedback you're not paying someone a salary you are instead incentivizing the investment in public goods and so the the way that this kind of hooks in is it's like okay if if you're transacting and or whether or not whether or not you're uh whatever the source of funding is right you you can accumulate these these huge payouts based on the massive amounts of economic financial activity that we will have as a globe right you generate all this stuff and then you use that to essentially reward people who helped you get there right you look at their contributions you see who has been unfairly rewarded let me give back to them right so um would it be fair to say that this is an original insight back at plasma group which is that it's hard to rally talent around non-profits what if we created a world in which public goods are as investible as the average vc startup that has 1000x upside because we've created a world where public goods funding has billions of dollars of capital flowing towards it then you get this upstream effect where vcs will start looking for projects that uh create public goods in open source software or climate or journalism or whatever public good so it's about creating that world in which you can rally capital around uh public goods is is that fair to say beautifully put beautifully put so how's the how'd the first experiment go you all just finished uh retroactive public goods round one tell us about that indeed we did so we gave away a million dollars we had a collection of 24 what we call badge holders who were essentially evaluating these projects discussing them in the open and uh kind of considering figuring out what good ether what ethereum public goods should should we retroactively reward and and it was great it was i mean it was honestly pretty amazing to be able to do that in the first place and just you know that is the very beginning right this is this will be table stakes when uh you know a year from now um but it was there were there were actually some interesting challenges that we that we found there that that we weren't really expecting one of them was uh that it wasn't immediately obvious what a public good what is or how to really you know what to retroactively fund um because in reality it's kind of there's there's a little bit of a gradient in terms of uh you know how you define public goods what what a good is who's you know benefiting all that kind of stuff yeah and so yeah so it was really not not super easy um but we came one one framework that actually was really helpful in thinking about this was the fairness ratio so the fairness ratio is something that uh uh some uh you know folks over at una swap during a dinner conversation uh suggested shout out to you know those folks um anyway it is impact over profit so impact divided by profit so essentially what you want is you want to you want everything to be fair right you want everyone to give one val you know one unit of impact and receive one unit of profit right you want value in to equal value out right because that's that's like if we can define what we value as a society as a collective as a public and then we can give people the value that they have put into the system to the public then you can start operating as an actor in that system knowing that you'll be rewarded you think okay how can i make the highest impact today right that is like the only thing on your mind how do i make the highest impact so the so we realized that okay um projects that have made a bunch of profits even though they have added a huge amount of like value and they have had a huge impact but if they've made a huge amount of profits maybe they're not the right targets for these retroactive rewards and instead we should be giving profits like increasing the profits of the public goods that are underfunded right now and so actually in some ways public goods funding is is almost about you know making the economy a little bit fairer and and correcting market inefficiencies so anyway that was an i did not expect that kind of discussion when going into experiment one it's an interesting governance problem it reminds me about how on bitcoin grants there has been backlash against people who have raised tokens or vcs continuing to get bitcoin grants funding like hands off keep your money keep the money for the public goods that have not raised that money and like it's like the same governance problem but chopped up in different bits in both the ecosystem and it's it's kind of fun to look in the mirror and to hear how y'all have handled it um i do want to ask uh so like what's the end game with retroactive public goods funding you know paint me a picture of let's say it's 2025 what does the world look like what is the world that you want to build with retro public goods funding the world that i want that i hope exists that i hope i can participate in because that's what this is about right um it's a world where all of my digital assets my financial activity my crazy web3 metaverse activity all of that stuff contributes to values that i believe in and contributes to making a fairer more just society where i know that i can focus on value-add right i don't need to think about anything other than let me make a real big impact that if if if if that exists right i i mean i'm obsessed with emergent complexity i'm obsessed with like emergence generally as a thing and i have the sneaking suspicion that the the crazy um like the world i mean you talk about this the solar punch stuff right like the the incredible just potential future that we can live in that the simple rule that gets us there well coupled there are a couple of simple rules but you know what i mean is there's one correctly aligning the values determining what we value right coming up with systems for for deciding the values of our society as a you know species right that's that's one and then the other one is reflecting those values in our economic infrastructure and making sure people who put in value get out value so i'm really hopeful that in in 2025 i can work for a dao doing whatever i want to do uh that i think is going to really have a huge impact i don't have to worry about profit i know it's covered and i just i just i'm just contributing i'm just a worker bee you know right so so is there an upper like would it be fair to say that there's an asymmetry between value created and value captured with legacy business models and the way that the world works right now and the more that we can close that asymmetry between the value you create in the world and the value you can capture the more people can just focus on creating value as opposed to capturing value is is that a fair uh reflection of what you said precisely yes and and it just one of the dependencies of that is that people do feel like the right values are being rewarded right we we do reward things that we value in some messed up sense right but we don't have good mechanisms right now for for collectively determining our values um and so that is a key ingredient this whole governance question and i think for that it's really gonna it's gonna require a lot of in a lot of iterations and innovations but yes that is the future i want to live in so you meant you mentioned uh what is the mechanism through which we determine our values and i don't want to double click on that because i think it's really interesting um one of the things that i've realized is that when i buy something on amazon and like it improves my life like a new computer monitor or something like that i really appreciate it because i like i spent money on that and i know that i value it one of the things i've noticed is that people uh public goods are kind of like out of sight out of mind and there's like a there's there's kind of like an asymmetry there where um public goods are actually really really important but because they're out of sight out of mind i don't i don't appreciate them on as much so like you know what's what's the value of having a new computer my monitor if the sky is on fire or if you have lung cancer because of like not clean air or like you know you you don't have open source software and so i think that there's a nice symmetry there and i guess what i'm teeing up for you carl is um you know what's your favorite public good or like what's your top three list of of public goods that you think are good um okay wow i got a long list okay i'll just say my okay i'm not there there's not an ordered list it's too hard to choose you can't rank these kinds of things yeah of course one of them is definitely uh information dissemination so one public good is i i want open source software that allows me to better reflect my values or my i want my software that i use every day to better reflect my values and that can go from anything from my my twitter feed what things get get you know populated um there the the way that i'm able to spread information like i want public goods that help us spread pro-cooperative information or pro like you know societally helpful information i think that's a really that's going to enable a lot of other public goods right okay so like me media like reminds us that we're all in it together and and helps us uh disseminate information that risk reflects our values and helps us work together yeah exactly exactly and i mean look i wanna i wanna get in like mad at people too you know like i wanna feel like angry at the other tribes too but like i just want that to be like correctly channeled into uh uh some the the right avenues so i'm not yes anyway um that's one thing the other one is of course i mean low-key i i okay this is my recent i've recently just been listening to some podcasts on environmental protection and i'm like my god it is legit like this is this is a the the long-term future of humanity really really interesting to think about i definitely am very wasteful but i don't want to be i would love to improve that um and then the last one which is of course the most key to to to my current existence is the scalability of this financial infrastructure i do i do want i really want ethereum to succeed and to support the global economy because uh i think every human matters and we should include every human and be able to include every human amazing yeah if you didn't put the scalability of ethereum on there i think i would have to kick you under the table and say hey man show some optimism uh it or some get going grants that would be fine too living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bank list nation already have their ledger hardware wallet but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet the leisure live app and soon the cl cryptolife card powered by ledger the cl card powered by ledger is a crypto debit card with powerful features like an instant exchange to fiat where crypto assets are only sold at the moment that you swipe your card and also credit from crypto collateral where you can collateralize your crypto assets in order to get a higher credit limit you'll be able to manage your cl card powered by ledger inside the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to using making the ledger live app your one-stop shop for all of your financial needs go to ledger.com grab a ledger and download ledger live to get all of your defy applications all in one place arbitrom is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitram and arbitrom's defy and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee when interacting with arbitrary

to experience defy and nfts the way it was always meant to be fast cheap and friction free so i want to ask you a couple closing questions um and and i think that this last one is is kind of meta because you work for a project called optimism but carl you're consistently one of the most charismatic energetic and optimistic speakers for public goods and i want to ask where your optimism comes from where that energy comes from when you're when you're rapping about this stuff rapping is the the opportune word um i would say that there's a level of i mean okay first off i feel blessed to be in this community and so i feel grateful and so the energy that i put out i really do feel like i get it you know and it's more of a reflection like the the people here are just unbelievable um and i i am really excited to to like see where it goes and i okay here here's the thing right we can either we can either choose to be uh to you know not think that there's a possibility for change and not think that we can actually make an impact and and change and and go somewhere good and or we can try to make try to make that world actually come about and then have a good time as we do it so like i here's my you know if the si if the ship is going to sink i want to be like plugging the holes and singing and like having a good time as we're like you know fighting for our lives to make sure that you know humanity actually succeeds and uh you know consciousness pervades um and like if i was all you know depressed and sad while the thing was happening like that's like that's lame you know have a have a journey have a have fun keep it light you know totally yeah well one of the things i'll say is that if if we're gonna try to plug the holes in the in the ship then it's more fun to do it all together and i find your energy to be completely infectious and there's this feedback loop where we all choose coordinate over defect and the more people choose coordinate the better uh the coordinate decision becomes for everyone else it's that feedback loop that i'm really excited about ether's phoenix you will be rewarded for your coordination in the future public good solar punk utopia hello hello this is an ethers phoenix tldr so ethereum is all about building systems which enable mass coordination and the most fundamental coordination game that we're trying to solve in ethereum is the tragedy of the commons aka free rider problem aka prisoners dilemma in these games you have two choices you can either defect or you can cooperate defective defecting maximizes your short-term payouts but cooperation maximizes your long-term payouts and right now if you think about it right now it feels like we're living in a world where everyone is defecting cooperation in scarce supply so how do we stay strong and cooperate in a world full of defectors i got an answer for you it's ethers phoenix put a little faith into your life so what's ethers phoenix i'm glad you asked um so picture a future where public goods are being rewarded with profits equal to their impact right fairness ratio we are rewarding public goods well we can call this future this utopian future ethers phoenix in this world one of the most critical things that deserves retroactive public goods funding reminder that's just paying people rewards for the public goods they create one of the things that deserves retroactive public goods funding is not just the futuristic public goods but it's the early contributors who made that future a reality that's the contributors like you and me today so ether's phoenix will look back in time and reward us the early cooperators the early public goods creators it's kind of like a reverse rokus basilisk which is an evil ai that punishes you if you don't summon it but instead ether's phoenix rewards you for your early investment in public goods so let's build public goods let's invest in public goods and let's start a retroactive public goods revolution that's ether's phoenix for you we just heard from carl flourish talking about ethers phoenix which is the opposite of ruko's basketwicks ruko's best clicks is a demon that punishes you for not summoning it and ether's phoenix is a angel that rewards you for summoning it so it's basically a recursive algorithm that retroactively rewards public goods funders in order for bringing public goods into existence one of the things that's most interesting to me about ethers phoenix is like how do you know that it's good so basically in the x-men series there's a character that becomes the phoenix and she like turns on the x-men for a little bit and so i'm wondering if you're building the bringing this phoenix into the world how do you know that it's a good phoenix i think the answer is that at the center of it is that the algorithm only rewards you if you fund public goods and that's a really hard problem to know like which public goods to invest in but in the present moment but if you do it retroactive then basically there's a lot of consensus about how much public good say lib p2p has created or scaffolded or other public goods in the ecosystem so basically you've got a recursive algorithm that rewards public goods funders for creating public goods and then the result of that is ether's phoenix so really interesting take from carl florish so i my experience with bitcoin grants is i've been doing this for four years and it is sometimes a grind i work long hours and uh sometimes things blow up in my face and i want to ask like have you found do you feel like you've been grinding and like you know how do you keep that optimism alive when you're just working really hard on this to on on such a huge ambitious mission [Music] wow a lot of things one know your boundaries make sure that you don't stretch yourself too thin i have become extremely depressed to the point of you know being like suicidal being very scared very very depressed um because i pushed my boundaries and did not know what i needed to like be a happy and healthy human being um so that is very real mental health is very real um another thing is just during the grind trying to keep the trying to keep the the you know everything in perspective right like we are we are very small we are very insignificant we are part of these like big waves up and down and um it's you know you can't get you can't i i feel like very afraid sometimes of like losing what i have right i'm just like so fearful of change and it's really hard to remind myself constantly like change is okay whether it's up or down like it is totally fine and that you know once you once you like let go a little bit it's it's a lot easier to be um to feel good right you're you're maintaining your mental health you're being happy you're you're you know doing that and you're also not afraid of the future and you know that helps with anxiety so anyway it's a it's non-trivial you know but but uh totally but good vibes are important nice for sure yeah um is there anything i didn't ask you that you that you want to say about regen finance crypto economics green pills solar punk worlds is there anything i didn't ask that you want to say can i ask you how would you define what is what is your uh i just love the term regen finance what is regen finance well back in d5 summer there was this thing called uh d-gens like the d-gen score d-gen became a meme and i think it was kind of focused around people who are gambling with speculation in crypto and uh what i've what we've been trying to do with bitcoin grant's mission is to build and fund the open web we want to create a world where the median software engineer can quit their job at jpmorgan chase and work for the public good work on open source and i think that uh regen for me is just the opposite of djinn instead of focusing on instant gratification and that gambling and that race to the bottom of the brainstem it's about creating a a world where we're focused on a little bit more long-term values where we're focused on creating the world that we want to live in regenerative means that there is positive externalities to the work that you do as opposed to negative externalities and so i think that regenerative crypto economics are mechanisms that create positive externalities and that's what we're trying to meme into existence but i don't know our marketing guy is like kevin just pick a mean is it regen finance are you green killing people are you creating more solar punk world and i say it's all those things so um yeah i mean what would you call it if you had to if you had to meme the world we're trying to create i would honestly in i would call it all the things and i'd find one champion for each meme because it's really about telling the stories in different ways and it's all the same story right i really think that we are all saying the same things 99 of the time we're we're all kind of you know we are definitely in this together um in a very real way so i think uh kind of to each to each their own and um sure yeah one of the things one of the things i'm hoping to do is you know you can you can you can describe the world as much as you can but if you can show it to people um you know sort of uh like ghost of christmas future style like show them the world that we're building is is much better than telling them and one of the things that's really exciting about me to me is that all of the regen projects that you're going to hear on this green tail podcast all stack on top of each other proof of humanity uh and retroactive public goods funding and bitcoin grants and common stack all can be and it can create a more solar punch public goods world and if we can show people that world instead of tell them it then i think that's what will really get people to turn the corner beautiful yeah and i i totally agree and i just want to remind people that even if it's green and and regen and all these kinds of good you know good vibes things it's also going to be fun and going to be crazy and you're going to get your ups and downs you know it'll be it'll be great we we uh uh i think we can have fun while we're improving and causing ex positive externalities i feel like there's a there's maybe like it's uh uh like so there's some kind of like weird appeal to self-interest-ness you know but i think that we can align our self-interests right that's the that's the thing i don't think that we should be like shunning self-interest we should align our self-interests and have have have a good time with them so anyway that's my yeah aligning the profit motive with the motive to do good can be a really powerful thing when those two things intersect yeah so regens is fun regen is fun all right carl flourish of optimism how can people find you and how can people find you the projects you're working on online great so uh i work at optimism pbc that's out at optimism pbc definitely go to optimism.io that's that's that's the place to be um and then um i'm on twitter at carl underscore dot underscore tech um and yeah definitely follow vitalik also um i'm sure you do well carl flores thank you so much for being on the inaugural episode of greenfield great to have you and looking forward to having you back in 2024 once we have created a more green filled world peace out peace
