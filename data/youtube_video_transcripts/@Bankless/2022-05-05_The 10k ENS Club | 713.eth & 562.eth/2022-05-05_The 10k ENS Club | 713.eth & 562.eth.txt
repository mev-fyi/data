welcome bankless Nation to this very special episode of alpha leak alphalique episodes are where we uncover and unpack something that's going on that might be bullish in the world of crypto and on today's episode of Alpha League we're covering the 10K club and also the 999 club uh there's this weird thing going on in the corner of ens domains where people are speculating on numbers uh digit numbers especially the low digit numbers and so two things have emergently created been created out of this there's this the 999 club for people that own ens numbers Point like 999.heath and lower and now there's also the 10K club for people that own 9999.eath and lower than that and a bunch of weird things have spawned out of this and so we brought on two community members to talk about the Whole Bowl case for the 10K club and the and the 999 club like why are people doing this how is this being organized how is this being coordinated is this a Dao because the answer is no but also yes and so we're going to explore all of these things and we're going to at the end of this episode uh talk about why you might want to own part and be a part of the 10K club uh and so these are the alpha leak episodes we cover these with various communities in various projects throughout the crypto ecosystem each individual token or project or Community has a bold case for it so if you are a part of a community and you think the bull case needs to be told these are the shows for you so here's what you got to do you got to grab a team three people two people anyone who can give the bull case for your project or your team or your protocol or whatever you got to come up with an agenda and we've got to get you on the show so we can talk about the Bold case for your program and today of course we're talking about the bull case for the the 10K Club the 999 club and whatever other clubs come out of this ens domain we're going to explore that with two community members right after we get to

show on the road I'm here with two community members from this crazy weird 10K Club project on the bottom you see Leo who's also 562.eath and then on the top right you'll see soy.eth also Patrick also713.eath uh these are two community members I guess from this not Dow thing that's being created uh Patrick Leo uh thanks for coming on to this Alpha League show appreciate it thanks for having us like thank you cheers okay guys let's let's get right into it how did this whole thing start and also what the hell is going on uh what what is happening in the world of like low digit ens names and how did this whole thing get started uh Leo I'll throw that one to you well I I probably started off with my personal story and it kind of like will touch on all of these things so we were majority of us were actually following her I know I was following at the beginning um a uh nft influencer Daniel got hits and when he was talking about ens domains and giving ideas giving Alpha different ideas things to to get and then he just made a post saying it would be such a flex to own a three-digit domain and they won't mince it out at all he just said it would be such a flex and then his next tweet or in that tweet he attached how much uh Dubai number plates were being sold for and he was like well if the number plates are being sold for a lot what happens when these people enter the web 3 space they're probably going to want these uh you know three digit domains as a flex that's how it began a few hours after this two tweets just on Twitter yeah and then us being djans we started mincing them out I I didn't mince it out I actually bought both of mine at one eighth each um but and then and the community started saying oh this is all organic no no idea no Founders started saying hey why don't we form a club called the 999 where you know just a club for people who hold three digits and then that's where it personally hit me and it was like I said the 999 is going to be the most exclusive club in the world of ens and I want to be a part of that it's no doubt going to start attracting some giga brains just because I watched your interview with Kevin Rose and I started thinking about proof and I'm like this is an inevitability so then the 999 got together and then people started moving on to four digits and then um then the 10K Club was essentially launched there's a more detailed story for this but I don't want to take up too much time on this answer um I actually wrote a thread about it there's threads about it on on Twitter to explain the full story but it was just organically launched no Founders unruggable um and and it just came came about that's why there's such a passionate Community behind it and then we formed the whole idea of I am my digits my digits of me and it's been uh crazy ever since so it's just really this like property of ens and and numbers like so we humans created numbers we also created ens and so people just slammed these two things together and started playing the speculative game on low digit ens names I mean the bull case of course for ens is that it's going to be this the domain system of planet Earth in the future uh and so like there's there should be no like surprise that people are uh playing speculative games in the same way with ens names as they are with.com domains um but like I think it's the numbers thing that is really just like the kind of funny meme aspect about this see it's it's looked at as a meme but I think it's best to take it back to First principles right dot eth domains are going to essentially be your personal point of identification in the web 3 world when we had a we actually jumped on Spaces with nick.e the creator of ens and he said it's going to be your web 3 passport so every time I touch base touch I have a touch point with somewhere they're going to see my DOT each domain it's going to be my bank account my email my login and if we take a look at the idea of numbers across cultures cultures give them importance especially low digits in the Middle East it's not a flex to own a Rolls-Royce it's a flex to owner Rolls-Royce that has a multi-million dollar low-digit number plate attached to it right so if you want to think about it if I'm going to constantly touch base with people in the web free world having a low digit domain is essentially me walking around with a low digit number plate strapped to my my forehead right in the real world it's just constantly going to be a a touch Point uh cultures like in the Asian in the Asian cultures China Chinese culture they value numbers right they make decisions based on numbers we had a whale who came and bought 555.e for 55.5 ethereum and then he was located and asked why he did it and he said just for fun so it's not even about it's not even about it's beyond the just the community there is intrinsic value in holding these low digits especially when they're going to be used as your personal point of identification no different to a prestigious profile picture or a verified tick on Twitter Patrick I want to get your story in on this how did you discover this whole like ens thing where did you uh what's your Genesis with this whole like 10K Club thing um well if I go all the way back I mean I gotta eat Us in 2020. um and you know I thought this was gonna be a thing eventually um I didn't I didn't think numbers would be like the thing um as big as like specific words um so I only had one number one three-digit number when this thing happened and I was the one tweeting about it like me Daniel some other people are talking about the numbers and we're like there's only a few left like maybe we should actually grab them because like we're tweeting about them but you know we only had a couple ourselves oh my God I'm gonna grab another one and uh I sold it for three eth and I still have my my one three digit I picked up some more footage and um it's actually mind-blowing and it makes sense like in hindsight and it's just like you know it's like I was tweeting this stuff out and it's like I kind of faded myself a little bit um but I'm glad I'm still holding and stuff and yeah I don't know I think there's a crazy future for it like Daniel said or like Leo said with the license plates and whatnot right yeah if this is like our uh self-chosen like social security number of the metaverse which any ens name can be really like there's not any meaningful difference between the numbers and like David hoffman.eath for example or or like soy.eath which Patrick you have but also it's just kind of it's just like a shelling point right it's just like there is a fence around the numbers only ens names and like all the other ens names just because like it's numbers and like because people like to be in like at least in the the West we really like our lines and when everyone wants to be first in line all the time and so I feel like it's that same kind of property where just like you know first I got here first like look at my very low number I'm earlier than you uh even though you could have come in later but it doesn't really matter because the number is so low so what what kind of like behaviors have you guys seen in the community like how do how are people picking what numbers they want to get like are they just finding the the cheapest four-digit number that they can find or like are they playing like I don't know maybe they're going for like prime numbers like how are how are people valuing different ens digit numbers differently uh Leo I'll throw that one to you yeah so people are going with birthdays uh postcodes um you know some uh people if you're holding azuki or or a boy name you're getting the respective number uh that your your board ape actually has as an ID um palindromes um oof uh lucky numbers as well is a is a big thing um but there's no Central thesis everyone just has no flavor not really no not not really and that was like the beautiful thing at the very beginning is that initially we had the option to Mint what we wanted so people were actually getting something that was meaningful to them now it's become more of a secondary thing so you're just getting a number to have a essentially a pass into the 10K club or a pass into the 999 Club um so it's become less say meaningful but um there are still people who are so attached to that initial number that they got that they wouldn't ever think about you know selling because it's become part of like their identity so that's the type of behavior that um you know the decision making that people took yeah and I can definitely tell from the chat this meme of uh my digits are me or what's that what's the line I am my digits my digits of me yeah is the line yeah yeah and so like uh so I'm in the 10K Club my number starts with the six I can't remember what number it is uh so I need to go go check that but I'm sure as soon as I go realize what what my 10 my four-digit numbers are I'm gonna have that like number baked into my brain uh and it'll just be like a part of a part of me has anyone gotten a tattoo yet is that what's next not that I know of uh I'm sure someone will not that I know yeah like I I know I know uh Patrick as 713. yeah his entire identity is built around that I've never didn't even really know his name and it didn't it didn't matter because our numbers became our point of identity and it's it's why it happens the explanation behind it is it's it's it's a difficult one to say all I can say is it did happen so what's what's making the community so excited like are people I mean I'm trying to like ask my typical questions when I'm like okay like what's the road map guys but like is is there a road map and if there's not a road map what makes a community so excited about this whole thing you want me to take that one so yeah go for it um yeah so like Leo said um it Formed kind of uh spontaneously and it was just like hey let's let's make this little club and then you know a week later it blew up almost 7 000 people in the Discord there's articles around the world um and you know part of the reason like uh Daniel stepped down is he was like this thing is really blowing up um you know you just try to make this club and I want to make it Daniel proof like you know because he's he was fully docs he's an influencer and you know he's like I don't want something bad to happen in this it's like if he gets canceled for whatever reason and he's like so this is going into your hands now um I want to protect the community I'm taking a step back and there's no doubt um but I mean honestly the the there's no limitations to what can happen I mean we have a huge Community we have plans um there's multiple ways that we've thought about how to get funding um okay so we are thinking about actually producing a treasury yes potentially um and so one of the co-admins um and the server owner aox Aaron he's the creator of ens tools and we also have zamente who is the ens Visions Creator and they're working together right now coming up with a Marketplace potentially um which could bring in uh some Revenue um people in the chat they're talking about merch and people are mentioning you know the word da the word treasury um and there's there's a lot of things we can do we can have real life events ens education and that's a big thing because people really aped into these numbers and they don't know what they hold they know they own a number but it's like yeah they buy and then afterwards they're like so now what like what do I do with this thing so I've been really trying to push the education on that uh Leo any other perspective is like what that gets the community going about this whole thing yeah okay so I I mean everything that um 713 said because he's 713 to me um everything that he said um in addition to that so there is no like DJs hub for ens Maxis and the 10K Club has essentially been that so if you're a part of the club you're on the Forefront of the education you're you're going to be at the Forefront of the next thing that's going to take place um so it's a place to come get educated uh get Alpha we've got Alpha channels set up um and if you think and if we take it even a step backwards and we go say to the 999 and the value within that that has grown it's got legs of its own now the the 999 chat people the the reviews have holdboard apes or whatever whatever Community I've been a part of they've said I've never seen a community like this the relationships that I have personally developed have been so beautiful I'm we had a a catch up yesterday with a few members and then they were so bullish after the meeting 005 was purchased for 50 eath and 006 was purchased for 32 each from people who were in this chat being like this is how bullish we are on this and the the type of brains that it's attracting what happens is it you know people sell off and the new people replace them the entry point becomes more higher and higher so it and then those who are the the earlier Diamond handsing are there for the right reasons I don't I couldn't even consider think about something I want to be a part of the 999 and have that Network and now we're already talking about meetups and um you know there's a there's a member I've developed a good relationship with and a few others which is like he's like hey come to Singapore I'll host you guys and I'm seriously considering it so don't be surprised if you see me in Singapore soon like it's it's that's the it's that Community culture and now we and then it's expanded obviously to the 10K Club as well which is a little more difficult to do because there's larger numbers and a higher turnover than the 99 9 but it can be achieved with time well so I mean you could can even go beyond the 10K Club to the 100K club and you can keep on going to the million club and so like there is no it's not like there's just two clubs it's like an abstract circle of clubs all the way and it's kind of like people want to like work their way if they're if they want to play the ens numbers game they want to work their way into the innermost Club possible right and so if we do believe that ens comes to take over the world and blanket the globe as the new like domain name system of planet Earth like our children will be playing like the the 100 million Club game or something like that and they're gonna be like playing a game to try and get to like the 10 million Club game and trying to get to play the game to get into the one million Club game I mean this is the thesis this is the theory this is the idea I'm assuming but also I have to ask the question just like if everyone is like talking about going to Dubai and everyone's super bullish and aping into like three like the the lowest digit numbers possible for like 50 each like is this a Mania like is this is sustainable how do you guys know that this isn't just like a flash in the pan like all the other nft projects that we've seen either of you want to yeah uh yeah if you want to get that trick so if you think about like.com for example um not everybody needed a DNS like no one needed a.com unless you're like a business owner and um you look at those sales and I think like the average three digit sale price is like 300K and same with like four digit numbers so like 50k or so and uh I think ens has a lot more possibilities in the future than like a.com lever has um mainly because of sub domains and so for example like I have seven uh 713.eath that's the area code for Houston Texas so people from Houston they can you know I can maybe someday I'll rent like uh lease out sub domains to them and they won't need 713 to each but they can have like jake.713.eath or their business.713 out of these and you know whatever else they want um they could have Moon bird 713 duddies so there's a lot more possibilities like what is the true utility like what what's the true utility of this thing Beyond just like this social club like how can you monetize this thing how can we how can we convince the Skeptics that there is like real value here yeah I'll throw that one to you um as far as like actual the utility of uh ANS ANS itself I think Patrick's the best person to answer answer that but for me I can talk more from say getting involved in a community from a community perspective a lot of the projects that people Aid into uh they're Aid being into projects based on community uh with the idea that there's something big coming down the line so something that hasn't been delivered yet it's always a promise of a road map that hasn't been delivered yet but they hang out and they stick around due to community the 10K Club is the most organic Community that's ever been launched it is the place to hang out where you're going to have you're instantly going to you know have friends um do the engagement on Twitter is is insane um and then the 999 Club you asked it before well what if it's just Mania it's not like you know these sales are happening like crazy we actually went through a period where there wasn't any three-digit sales for like 24 to 48 hours and everyone held strong because the reason reason that people are in that club it's for the right reasons we're more focused on Alpha more focused on networking on relationships on on on on uh essentially being around Giga brains that's the idea now we want to try and translate that to the 10K club like I mentioned it's a bit of a more of a challenge but that's essentially the utility but there in addition to community it's uh I think 713 can talk about or Patrick can talk about the actual you know subdomaining potential and and from a more technical perspective yeah yeah uh 713 you want you want to lean into that a little bit more I know you were you were talking about that with like renting out subdomains but like what is like the the bull case of the utility of these things so before I get on that I'm gonna first finish on um Leo's part where uh we actually also have a lot of communities that have like helped us out because they know like we didn't have funding like we didn't sell people nfts we just formed this community so a lot of people are helping us out where they're building tools for us for free just you know gem pop Rank and a lot more um and then for the sub domain part um so I mentioned how you can possibly lease them out and it's a bit speculative but then you look at things that are already exist decentraland for example they built their own subdomain wrapper years ago and those are your usernames in decentraland so I used to own a plot into Central land and I could just use my DCL my decentral on sub domain um so like let's say it wasn't soy but let's say it was soy.dcl.eath I typed that in my browser and it loads up the decentraland webpage and specifically with a coordinates to log into my plot um that's just one example they monetize that you had to pay Mana to create um create that username or sub them in and Budweiser for example um they bought beer.eath and now if you look at their sub domains they register like Bud light.heath and uh Stella and I think uh you know several more so those are all brands that fall under Anheuser-Busch um because like Anheuser-Busch owns Budweiser and Bud Light and so many others so um they're organizing their whole company with those subdomains but if they wanted to in the future like let's say when the ens name wrapper comes out they'll be able to potentially like sell other beer brands subdomains under beer.heath if they wanted to um there's a lot more situations like that I mean it's really early the name rapper's not even out which I'm not sure if you know what that is but it'll allow subdomains to be traded as their own nfts okay so we're really early so like seven you have 7.13.eath and then you could wrap up I don't know any other number dot 713.e so you could wrap up 999.713.8th and sell that is that the idea sort of so it's not you're not wrapping up the um you're not like So 999.8 that's its own um like second level domain I think you call it um now so 7713. I can issue subdomains and people could choose what they want under my name and those currently can't really be traded because I issue them out as the parent domain and I can delete them and like revoke access or whatever anytime I want right now but when the names are wrapped those sub domains I'll be able to the parent can burn permissions so the subdomain owner can prove like like that they own that domain like it can't be taken away and it'll be an ERC 1155 token so they'll be able to trade those sell them just like the Central and subdomains so there are markets that can emerge on top of these assets yes okay do you know like what kind of parameters you can control like can you control trading fees I um I'm not I don't think so there's there's quite a few though they're called fuses um you can make them so if you wanted to uh they're not transferable which would be kind of weird it's like I guess you could send someone a non-transferable I'm not sure if you could send someone an untransferable something man I mean we have to wait and see but that's one of the options I saw there's a lot of weird stuff okay guys there's a few topics I want to talk about uh coming up in the second half of the show so I'm going to tease them now but just like this this idea of like it's a Dao but it's not a Dao it's actually many dowels but there's actually no doubt is like really interesting to me so I want I want to like explore what happens when you break the walls of what a dow means like we got we didn't just issue nfts it's not this profile picture thing but also it's operating and acting as if a Dao as if it is a Dao and there's some other conversations around the numbers games that are going on so all that's coming up in the second half of the show right after we

about at governance.ave.com all right guys we are back for the second half of this show and in the second half we want to talk about a little bit about how this is a Dao but it's also not a Dao uh and there seems to be just a a fractalization of clubs of ens clubs going on but uh because it is a it is a door it is Dao because it operates like a dow people are buying tokens they're speculating on them uh whether it's an nft profile picture Dao or it's a people trying to like all Focus around some erc20 token there's bags involved people have their their assets that they would like to to talk about and there's Community involved but it also breaks the mold of a dow too because the 999 Club is a subset of the 10K club and so it's like an or a club within a club and there also seems to be just like many other clubs being spun out of this thing that are like peripheral or adjacent to the 10K Club so so Patrick can you just talk about like the differences between when people typically talk about the word Dao and like what's going on in like this ens Club thing that's going on also what do you even call this like the 10K Club the 999 club like how do we even call this thing yeah so it's it's the 10K Club um and likely to mentioned earlier it started out as a 999 club and then there's kind of these like 10K clubs being thrown around while they're still minting out everyone's like well we should create a 10K Club if there's a 99 Club but they started some people started getting zero zero zero zero to zero nine nine nine so there are basically four digits and we're three digits and um so when Daniel created the Discord he's like everybody's welcome like just you know if you have a three digit or a four digit you're welcome uh to join so now we're the 10K club with 11k possible members 11k numbers so and I think mainstream hates that probably um because it doesn't make sense to them but um so with a dow I mean all right so I wouldn't call it a Dao personally I mean you know by the textbook definition of it like uh decentralized application Oracle uh I think eventually centralized autonomous organization yeah thanks so much okay I would I wouldn't call it a Dao um but the community did um it arise it arose really organically um everyone made their own choices it kind of just there wasn't like this one person that just said like you know hey I'm in charge like I'm I'm the numbers King like it's just everybody just started buying numbers and we all formed together into one one Discord one group and then you know ens itself it's like an it's a they have a dow it's an open source protocol it's like a public good and you could buy whatever you want under ens any anything almost and you know we're just we decide to buy numbers make this club and then there's people with uh you know different subsets of that hyphens and Xerox and pre-punk ens domains Emoji domains and like you know we're all deciding like what we think is valuable and yeah it's definitely happening in a decentralized manner but we don't have like you know a Dao like textbook uh style like treasury or anything so Leo talk about what is all like the little uh other groups that are forming out of this thing because uh Patrick talked about how there's actually 11k 10K club members is there a controversy yet as to whether that extra 1000 ens numbers are actually in the 10K or not like is there consensus around that answer uh and like what other what other clubs are are people forming in this whole 10K movement yeah so I think like at the very beginning there was questions around that and then it was just it just it just happened like no one it's very difficult to kind of go back and restructure something that just someone created the 10K club and it just stuck right if we go back and now change it to 11k it it throws off the bronzing and 10K also um it it just had hones Under the Umbrella that it's numbers up to 10K like it's not be it's not we're not we don't have a 11 and Beyond right um and in terms of the other clubs so naturally what happened is when the three digits minted out then they got you know started getting pricier four digits minted out and then that continued and then people started creating these subsections like The Hyphen club like palindromes like the things that you mentioned um and the best part about like this uh community that we built is that it is um 100 community-led Community Driven right so there was actually controversy between whether to keep all these different chats within the 10K Discord um buy 10K holders and obviously there's a lot of back and forth but it wasn't one person who said no this is the way it's going to be we actually could put it to a community vote we held spaces with hundreds of members uh tens of members actually jumped on and and gave their opinion and we had an incredible discourse and we decided as a community obviously there's some people who voted no but as a community that the best way forward for the 10K Club is to support ens as a whole to open the doors to education to open the doors to all clubs to be formed because Rising Tides lift all boats that was the essential idea if you want to be part of an ens uh you know d-gen Hub where there's Alpha being shared join the 10K Club if you want to take it a step step up um join the 999. if you want to form your own club go and do so we're going to support you come and put forward a request get enough traction We'll add you to our Discord or you can start your own Discord there's no one telling anyone that they can do what they can and they cannot do so that's the that's the essential uh idea of it all okay but uh give me your opinion on this so what what and maybe this is less of an opinion but maybe it's actually uh shown up in the markets what's more valuable like zero five five dot eth or 555.eath because like they're the same three digits right three digits right and so like three digits yeah so the people that start their numbers with zeros are they like on the uh like I guess it doesn't even matter if there's no like official like way of like drawing lines around these communities but it's just like I think it's just this one shared meme of like yeah I own zero well zero two three four dot eth or something and like I just it's I'm part of the same meme as actual two three four dot eth doesn't actually really matter here okay I don't I don't think it like that hasn't actually been a real big point of controversy because the idea has just been three digits four digits it really just has been like that you know it's three digits or four digits three digits you're in the 999 four digits you're in you know the wider 10K it hasn't it there was probably a little bit of talk but it hasn't been a big kind of controversy and the end of the day the market deems what's valuable or not and they've deemed that the three digits more valuable than say but but zero the zero uh five five three is worth more than nine three two you know what I'm saying so because it's closer it's closer down okay so what about like I'm seeing a lot of uh like on the bot sales on Twitter seeing like Emoji sales and also people are talking about hyphens in the YouTube chat what's going on with all these things um yeah so the Emoji ens domains those have been around um for quite a while there's some other Discord way back um I'm not sure you know what's happening there I haven't stopped in um but there's always been this little Emoji group going on um the hyphens they kind of sprung up after everything sold out I think I might be wrong on that um and you know they they've been pretty loud with uh you know spreading their group and stuff um we've had some fun uh scuffles with them but you know ultimately I believe we added that group back as well to our channel so yeah well so I I believe as we just started this stream uh five digit ens names have been sold out uh so yes congratulations to the not Dow organization of the 10K club uh like you guys have opinions on how fast it's going to take for six digit ensams to get sold out the million Club that's going to be crazy that's gonna but we encourage it all we we push for it all the more the merrier go keep minting keep going you know they're going to be minted eventually but how long I don't know what do you think Patrick good I don't know I mean I think I didn't expect 10K digits to sell out let alone 5K so I mean I'm sure it's possible it's probably going to happen um Eunice is way different than DNS but um personally I think the people that are if you're registering random six digit numbers like maybe you should go back and you know instead of chasing hype try to look for some gems out there there's because just last week I mean they're still pretty good uh domains left like metaverse cell cell tokens that eat like weed sailed out of Youth I've I registered all those like a week or two ago so I mean if you're registering like six nine five four three eight that eth I mean you know maybe you should you know think for yourself a little bit and try to try to find some gems so just be careful with it right even as the 10K Club does indeed grow in value and meme power uh it doesn't mean that like on the frontiers of this whole movement where people are are minting the highest numbers that are available uh there are still some ens domains that are not part of the 10K club that are probably still useful useful to own I think that's the the takeaway there and we talk about those like that's part of the alpha chat yeah you know it's just in the alpha chat it's hey this is available or why don't we think I just did this or I just discovered this new thing right like that's part of the the alpha chat you know to can the the idea is just to push NS education pushing us out Alpha and just keep being degents you know so what would you say is the relationship between members of the 10K club and ens token holders like obviously there's going to be more overlap than than typical but like is there strong alignment between ens Dow and the 10K club or is it or is it the ens Dow just something that just speculates on ens and helps ens grow as Treasury I forget that one yeah yeah the the EMS Dao I mean that's that's separate that's completely separate from the 10K club like we're not not related at all um you know that's their treasury from like the domain uh registrations and renewals and whatnot um and that's how they fund their development of the protocol and whatever else they do um well since this whole movement has started like ens prices I think like almost 2xed and I definitely think it's because of the shenanigans Shenanigans going on in the 10K lab right yeah definitely um yeah we it kind of sparked the movement and a lot of like Millions I think millions of dollars have gone into that though um in my opinion mainly because of the 10K Club sparking that movement but yeah so bullish if you're bullish 10K you're also bullish ens you think that that is a viable strategy to get exposure to the 10K Club but if nfts scare you you might want to do an erc20 token yeah maybe just buy ens um I'm not really sure I wouldn't I wouldn't really recommend it that way but it's a little hard to oh awesome guys yeah go for it Leo I was gonna say the the other really cool thing about um you know domains as a whole but even with digits is that you can you can have them for you know represent you whilst also moving from project nft project to project changing your changing that profile picture you know what I'm saying it's like it's on it's a little league on its own I can have five six two and then have a board eight you know and as my profile picture so it's it's kind of like um a double double Flex double representation the double way to explain who you are and and represent yourself in this growing space I will have to say when I first learned at this whole movement I've immediately went to go check if one one one eight was available because that's the number of my crypto Punk right there and no indeed it was not but I did find a four digit that is available which I'm gonna go I have to find that that number uh Leo Patrick 713-562.eath guys thank you so much are there any other thoughts or comments that you want to leave the 10K Club Community and the broader bankless Nation with uh Leo any thoughts from you I'd probably say this is just my belief this is my opinion that it's just really the beginning it really is the beginning and we have the power as a community to decide where this thing goes the potential is Is We I we can't even say because look what we've done in the matter of eight to ten days started with minting three digits to all 100K digits minted out and this incredible Community that's being formed we're still going through hiccups where where we're finding our way as a community but the the um the storm will settle and will eventually be we're going to have something very beautiful at the end of this personally for myself 713 a lot of 10 999ers and 10K members we've been putting in eight to ten hour days barely sleeping I'm in Australia so all the activity happens when I sleep so I've been staying up barely sleeping to give back to this community out of love where does that come from does that come from I mean I just have I have two three digits that's cool but I could just chill on them and get someone else to increase value it comes from a passion that you have for a community something really really special that we have going on so um that's that's my my final remarks really the beginning and um and stick around and and I have a feeling it's going to be awesome six months from now yeah um yeah I just wanted to mention uh don't over expose yourself um it's all speculative Anything Can Happen um if you want to take profits you know don't feel bad doing so um I did I told them when I three digits at three I mean you know obviously not a great play but I'm still glad like profit is profit so what's the three to three digit for right now I think it is like 14 or 15 or 15 eighth yeah something like that all right all right sorry to cut you off uh 713 anymore that's fine um yeah just it just uh again seek out education um you know there's a lot of ens tutorials and education so you own more than just a number remember that well awesome guys thank you so much for helping me unpack this whole crazy world of this not Dow thing that's going on uh the 10K club uh maybe the 10K Club of the metaverse uh so maybe it is the new status single status single it's the new bottom-up Org the center of a very very big set of concentric circles of much larger numbers uh so 713-562 thank you for coming on and helping me uh get this Alpha League episode out the door thank you thank you for having us big fans awesome cheers guys there are some links in the show notes that are not there yet but I will put them there things that are like explorers around the ens ecosystem and tools that you can check out if you want to speculate in the dangerous game of speculation they will be available to you but of course this is not Financial advice eth is risky Defy is risky uh the 10K Club also risky uh you can lose what you put in but we are headed west we're on the frontier it's not for everyone
