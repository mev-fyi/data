if D5 front ends need to be licensed defy in America dies people will not use defy through licensed front ends because it will simply look like C5 well I think I disagree with that but I more strongly disagree with at least one of the things you said even if I don't know which one I don't know that you can simultaneously think what you just said and also think that by far the most important thing is that validator is remain permissionless because what you're saying right now is you lose the whole thing if you give a permissionless front end but then you also said that you get most of the value if you have permissionless backends and so I think I'm now confused about which of those you think if you gate the way that people use D5 which is through a GUI if you gate that as a licensed financial institution you have turned defy into Trad file the sense I'm getting now is basically that that you think that like the front end is just about as important as a bag if you got like 17 30 odds on like which was permission to which was permission list you'd be kind of like I'll just take whichever gives me the 70 is that kind of how you're thinking about this I'm thinking of this from the perspective of actually wanting the entire world to be able to use an open immutable Financial system
