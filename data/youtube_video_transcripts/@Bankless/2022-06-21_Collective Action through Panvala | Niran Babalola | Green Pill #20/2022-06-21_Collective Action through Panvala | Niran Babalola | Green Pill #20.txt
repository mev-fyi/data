what up coordination today on the pod i've got neuron from pandvala on the show neuron and i go way back to our days at consensus in the 2018 cycle he's been working on collective action problems his words whereas i've been working on coordination problems my words each of us for about four or five years and penval has been a sister community to get coin during all of that time pendle is a community of communities they just launched a new product called stamps which you can see at pandola.com stamps pinball is an endowment to help people in their communities capture more of the value that they're already creating and pinball is a platform to give each person the power to control the value that they're already creating so that people can use that power to empower communities that align with their vision of the world so it's been really great to follow neurons journey over the last several years and i'm excited to provide that to you the green pill community to you coordination and so this is a really fun episode to go deep on panavala with neuron without further ado i give you pandola reef i summer has arrived and cello is here for it cello is the layer one blockchain for the regenerative finance movement it's fast planet positive and built for the real world cello has committed towards producing a sustainable future from the very beginning and is the world's first

learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] all right here we are how's it going pretty good so great to have you i feel like we've been circling this episode for a while and i'm really excited to talk about panvala uh can you tell me how you got into crypto and how you came to found pandola uh so my story of how i got into crypto started with bitcoin as it probably did for most people uh the digital gold narrative is a pretty strong one uh so like that's what got me interested in the first place it's like hey here's this new currency that maybe a lot of things could run on uh eventually i heard of ethereum these people who were trying to put a programming language into their currency and it sounded like a scam point to me not gonna lie it's like why do you need a programming language in your currency how's that going to make the currency more useful or valuable didn't make any sense when it clicked for me it was when i started contributing to an open source project called auger a prediction market platform i was excited about prediction markets at the time not really even ethereum i was like hey decentralized prediction markets that's where the value is that i want to go build something like that so i started contributing as a volunteer contributor and they happened to be using ethereum behind the scenes and i was actually contributing to that project that made it clear to me what it meant to have a programming language in your money it means that you can kind of write the rules for any interaction between individuals or groups of people write down the rules like it's the rules to a board game and instead of needing some sort of game master to enforce the rules of your board game the ethereum network is a network of thousands of computers that promises to be the game master for any game any social or economic interaction that you come up with so if you can think of any better way for people to cooperate with one another and get stuff done than the way we currently do things in our society you can literally come up with those rules publish them to the blockchain and tell people hey here's a new way we can work together i want you to do this with me and if they like it they don't need to rely on anyone ever again uh so at that point once that light bulb went off i quit my job i tried to find a way to work in ethereum full time and i came across consensus so i started working at consensus consensus is actually where i founded panvala i started doing security auditing work and working on some other prediction market stuff a couple different projects here and there but the idea that i couldn't get out of my head was that if you have this toolkit for social and economic coordination you should probably be using it to solve the hardest possible problem you can solve and to me the hardest problem comes to the stuff that we share like uh it's very easy to organize around the stuff that we don't share the stuff that just benefits one person right like the phones in our pocket have gotten better at a dramatic rate because there's only one person who benefits each time so every company knows if i can make that one person happier they will pay me more money and then they will get a better phone but imagine if a phone benefited two people or five people or ten people or millions of people imagine if all you needed was one city phone that everybody shared and it benefited everybody like it would suck you would have committees deciding what features the phone has uh getting people to pay for the city phone would really suck uh trying to make a better city phone you would you wouldn't be guaranteed that anybody would buy it because you'd have to convince the whole city to bite it would suck so that to me is the core problem that's hindering so much progress in our society we're very good at organizing around the stuff that benefits one person but once it benefits many people we suck at it we have governments which solve a lot of problems but they're just not that great so if we can find better solutions to organize the stuff that we share we're all going to be happier so i started building some things that looked like decentralized non-profits and pan bala was really the third in that series of prototypes the one that felt like it had the most lugs to me and what it really is is a network of communities that work together to push more resources to every community in the network using our shared endowment and the collective action that we take uh to drive value into that endowment so that's really the story of how it all got started uh but there's more i can dive into nice amazing um i love how you framed that you know like we've got this programmable money and we've got these network that's built on top of maybe we should start the solve the most hard thing possible using that and that's the things that we share like that just follows from first principles for me and from watching your shelling point talk in order to prep for this i know that you talked a lot about collective action and how creating collective action is one of the things that you're most passionate about um would you say that sort of fits into the theme of solving for our shared needs absolutely like uh again so like a lot of people when i talk about the kind of work that i want to get done with crypto they assume that i'm some sort of do-gooder and i think i'm generally a good person but i do not identify as a do-gooder at all i identify as a pragmatist i want to do the best that's possible given the constraints of the world that we live in like i am not trying to make anything wild and crazy happen like just like what is the best possible world we can live in is kind of how i orient my thinking and i don't actually think that i'm making any sacrifice by working on the problems that i think benefit the most people like i think when the story is written of what happens in crypto like the people who end up with the most resources are going to be the people who drove the most value to the most people possible so literally the work that i'm doing is kind of selfish like i think it's the i think if it succeeds that it will be good for me but i also think that it'll be good for many many people so like that that's where the collective action really comes in like for this to work like it's not about some sort of um technology that magically solves your problems for you like what i think we can do is like harness power that you've always had since day one well that is like uh there's a lot of people who see the the society we live in as one where they can't actually make that big of an impact on their own like there's a world that they want to live in the way that they want to change the world but our society is very rigid like we we're in a real sense a very free society but we're not a society with a ton of agency right like you can people will let you do what you want to do but do you have the economic resources to make it happen most people do not so even though we have freedom you don't have agency and agency is what i think we can all get through collective action i think you already have the ability to harness a dramatic amount of economic resources and have it flow in the direction that you want to and all i want to do is show each and every person how to do it like that's really what this collective action is all about it's not about what some smart contracts are going to do for you on a blockchain it's not about some sort of fancy math literally what it is is i want to convince each and every person on the planet that they have the power to drive resources to the things that they care about not necessarily the things that i care about literally i want each person to get more of what they want and i just want to show them how to do it amazing um i i i think this is an amazing place to just jump into the pan bala story and what you've been working on there because i think that uh how you're gonna actually see this through in the world is through pinball so so tell us about uh what pinball has been up to i think you recently had a product launch so really interested to get into that uh theory and then action and that creates results so let's hear hear about the action at himbala awesome so again panval is a network of communities right now there are 82 communities in the network we started with five communities a couple years ago and continued plugging more and more communities into the network a lot of them today are crypto communities open source projects dows like the easiest people to organize right now are crypto people because they're excited about joining new things and the way that they organize is without and open source projects so those are the easiest communities to plug into the network right now the vision again is for every single community on earth like i don't care what you're trying to do whether it's like a club a non-profit a dance class a recreational sports team a church like literally whatever kind of community that's coming together with the people they like to do the things they like is a potential member community of panvala and we want to include all of those communities so again 82 communities to get today we want it to be thousands hundreds of thousands of communities that's what we're going through so the way that we actually drive resources to the communities in our network is through what we call panwalla stamps so what panvellis stamps are are nfts that fund your community when you collect them you can claim these stamps anytime you make a purchase or you complete an action that a sponsor has set up for you and then once you claim that stamp you can redeem it with any community you want that can be one of the 82 communities that are in pan bala today or it could be any community you want uh us to help you plug into the network because again this is for everybody it's for all communities like we want you to be a part of this movement so uh there are three stamps that are live right now at panbala.com so depending on when you see this it might be the same it might be some new ones because again uh there's gonna be tons and tons of stamp campaigns these are the first three so the first one is from index co-op and what they want you to do to collect their nft that's worth three dollars for any community you choose is to either subscribe to the to their uh newsletter via email or subscribe to their youtube channel when you do those things you get a stamp that's an nft that's worth three dollars you choose which community you want to fund with that three dollars right now the most popular community to fund well with these stamps is actually get coin itself so those will go to the matching pool and help people find more stuff there uh colonel is also fairly high up the list uh but again any kind of community uh we we hope that the bankless community eventually joins and starts collecting stamps to fund what bankless does as well because we think it's important work and again it's for any kind of community there's also two campaigns that opelus is running right now for basically uh referring people to join opolis if you refer one person you get a stamp worth 5.28 cents if you refer five people you get a stand worth fifty two dollars and eighty cents they're based in denver they're very uh uh big on the 5280 meme uh so that's what's going on behind the scenes colorado yeah so again these are nfts they live in your wallet you get the redeemed version of them and then the community you choose gets the one that's actually worth money and then they get to withdraw those funds from pandola's endowment to fund again whatever it is that community does we're not trying to change the world in a way that we foresee we want to give you the agency to change the world and the way you want to see so collect stamps change the world nice uh and so uh people can go to pinball.com stamps in order to reach that experience is that right that's exactly how it works you go to pandola.com stamps you'll see the currently active campaigns and you can collect any of those stamps you want wow amazing um i think that there's just there's just so much here and i can't decide which thread to pull on uh feels like we're kind of like trojan horsing some web 3 reputation into the world here as well uh there's a decentralized society uh direction that all of this could go once you have enough liquidity of these stamps and i think that gets really excited exciting um i don't know i guess i'll maybe ask an open-ended question what what gets you excited about this community of communities and penn valley stamps and you know you know what gets you up and and gets you like really excited about about working on this uh so the thing that gets me the most excited is the world that i think we're all building together both me you everybody watching this like we're all building something brand new and you can feel weird new things happen every time you go to a conference or every time you see a new product launch but like what i see happening is a dramatic shift of resources to communities across our society and to me the main reason why that gets me so excited is because again our our society feels pretty rigid right now like people are unhappy with tons of things uh people want different visions of the way our society works and i want everybody to get as much of what they want as possible like there's probably things that you and i disagree on things that the viewers and i disagree on i don't care i want you to get your way to the extent that that's possible without infringing on what i want and that's not really possible with what's currently at the center of our society at the center of our society is corporate life and political life and corporate life is going to do whatever is the most profitable you can't really steer it on your own that much it's just going to do whatever is the most profitable political life is going to do whatever you can do to defeat your political opponents like that's all that's all i can do and it can't do that much like with community life what's so special about it is that you get your way almost all of the time again there's disputes within communities that happens but literally you're choosing your own community if you're so unhappy with your own community you're going to choose a different one so like we can get much more of what each and every one of us wants if we can drive a dramatic amount of resources to community life because again you get to steer where those go you can solve the problems that you see in our world you can shape the world in the way you want it to be and again i think this can solve both social problems that people see i think this is the way that we're going to solve climate change and that sounds like big and hand-wavy but i can go more in depth in that one as well i think when it comes to like working conditions for working people i think we're going to make dramatic progress on that because again when we change the way that most of the lovers in our society work from being just political lovers or profit lovers when it comes to individual choice then literally any problem you see you're going to be able to make progress on and that's not the way the world feels today like it does not feel like you can make a take an action that changes the world in the direction you want to see it that's not the world we live in but when this plays out when this decentralized society this broader crypto movement when it gets to that end state i think that's what it's going to look like you see a problem you are going to be able to take a step to fix it and maybe that step will feel too costly to you so you're saying okay well i'm not willing to do what it takes to get that outcome i want it's not because you lost an election it's not because what you did isn't the most profitable it's literally because you as an individual are like ah i would rather spend my limited resources solving another problem instead so again there's still constraints it's not a utopia that we're going to live in but literally anything you care about you are the one who decides what outcome we end up getting that's beautiful um you know it i'm hearing you kind of like talk to me about this collective action thing and i'm just realizing that the way i talk about coordination and coordination failures kind of jibes with the way you talk about collective action and it's just beautiful to hear uh hear that come back well i guess like the question i i i have for you is like does that does does all of this scale like you know if if we're a team of five and we're trying to organize some action within theopolis or get coin community um that feels like a more surmountable problem than what you said about climate change you know does does what we're building in the web 3 space scale to solving our biggest global coordination failures and and how do we get there it if not uh absolutely it does i think literally the projects that everybody is working on today are part of the story about how we're going to change the world i i believe that and literally i want everyone who's watching us to believe that too because if you don't believe it you're not going to do it like you can only do things you believe so you need to believe that you have the power to change the world and when i show you how you're going to do it like you just go do it like i believe you actually have that power i believe everybody has so to me like individual communities solving their own problems is very important and the main collective action that i'm talking about is important because i think it uh the the the vision that i want you to see in your head is something that looks like the labor movement something that's a whole bunch of people taking actions to get an outcome now the collective action that i'm describing is not about organizing against employers like that's not really what it's about but i think we are engaged in a broad collective action against middlemen in our society the people who are basically collecting money that really belongs to us uh anytime you're interacting with a company that sells you as a product to somebody else there is a middleman extracting value that belongs to you so that that means facebook and google which get a ton of their money by selling your attention to businesses that want more customers in the door they're they're making money that belongs to you and i think you can get that back uh anytime you make a purchase at a store and you pay with the credit card uh that fee of like one percent plus some cents every single time that's a middleman collecting value it belongs to you and i think you can get it and again what this collective action is is literally collecting stamps everywhere in our economy i believe that by collecting stamps you can change the way that value flows in our economy to go in any direction you want some people are going to choose to take the value that belongs to them and put it in get coins matching pools because they believe that quadratic funding plural funding is a more democratic way to shape public goods a lot of people are going to do that some people are going to take those resources to fund decentralized identity systems that they think give them more control in our economy over what uh what's actually done with their data a lot of people are going to do that like there's so many different people that want different things but the thing that we're all gonna do together is collect stamps because every time you collect a stamp dollars that we're gonna go to a middleman goes to your community instead so think about the campaigns that i was talking about the index co-op stamp where you get three dollars for subscribing to their newsletter or subscribing to their youtube channel they could have taken those three dollars and spent it on a facebook ad and getting gotten the same result what we're asking businesses to do is not charity we're asking them to take their marketing budget and move where it goes instead of spending their marketing budget and making mark zuckerberg richer so he can buy more and more of hawaii we want them to take that marketing budget and literally put it in the communities that every single one of their customers are in like that is literally how we change the world together the more of these stamps you collect the more the value shifts away from middlemen and into your communities and to communities like bitcoin colonel bankless and outside of crypto to those clubs nonprofits churches schools whatever it is you want to support there's this giant endowment with a huge balance and that is all the advertising spending in our economy today and again you need to believe that you can access that that you can actually take that value and take it to any community you want because again if you don't believe it you're not going to go do it but literally the way you do it is by collecting stamps the more stamps you collect the more of that value you shift and that's how you access the shared uh endowment that's there the value already exists those dollars are flowing you and i are going to change the way those dollars flow and they're going to go into everybody's communities yeah i think this really gets to the heart of how we coordinate in the web 3 era i mean you know i just love that you pointed out that you can get the same results with a facebook ad as you could with with one of these stamps but you're kind of cutting out the intermediary there and and i think that collective action but without these like value extractive intermediaries gets really interesting not only because then there's more money for the causes that we care about but also you get this higher resolution view of what the community cares about when it's peer-to-peer as opposed to peer through an intermediary that distorts and extracts to peer um and so you know i'm just envisioning this world in which we have collective action but there's no rent seekers in the middle and it's made explicit on chain we've got a shared source of truth around the actions that have momentum and just by making it more explicit it kind of enables more networked collective action uh for each individual agent in the system and i think that that's what's really cool about a world in which these stamps have if there's a lot of stamps out there then i think that that enables a lot more reputation enables a lot more uh sort of like understanding of each other i mean can you can you tell me about this world in which pan bala and pinball stamps is is maximally successful i guess that's the question that i'm that i'm aiming towards like say in five or ten years y'all are maximally successful what does that world look like sure before i do that i want to tell you this year and then i'll tell you that one so cool the the early days of uh this this movement this mass movement that we're organizing to shift where value flows in our economy the early days look like more and more communities building up a culture of stamp collecting it has to be normal in your community to collect these stamps to drive more resources to your community so again that means that community leaders like people who are actively involved in the community actually saying hey here are these stamps you can collect to fund the events that we throw the grants that we give whatever it is your community does like somebody has to actually be mobilizing people to build this culture from scratch it's not normal to collect stamps to fund your community today and the early phase looks like making it normal establishing a new culture where it's what just what people expect to do they expect to go get stamps and redeem them to fund their community that's what the early days look like so again most of those early stamps are going to be sponsored by businesses that serve crypto people because crypto people are who are here today so it's going to be people like index co-op annopolis it's going to be people like crypto exchanges it's going to be people like uh people uh trying to get developers to use their tools that kind of business is what the early sponsors look like and again the early communities are crypto communities but again we want to grow the movement we want to expand the set of communities in the network to be more normal people communities clubs nonprofits dance classes whatever it is we want to plug more communities into the network and then expand the base of sponsors to where it's more like literally every business in the economy we want to be minting these stamps to fund communities that their customers are in so if we fast forward a couple years after we've gotten uh scam to be ubiquitous in the crypto world uh and then spreading out locally to become ubiquitous in our own cities what happens then is that we have a new kind of power that we didn't before because again like what we're doing is starting by shifting value from advertising budgets to communities but once you have that stamps are actually fundamentally different from how ads work when you spend money on ads there's a point where you hit diminishing returns where you've reached all the people you're going to reach and spending more money on ads doesn't make any sense stamps don't actually have that attribute they're fundamentally different when you make a purchasing decision in the world that we're going to live in you're going to be making that decision based on how much in stamps you're going to get back from the business you do business with so you think of it as a percentage the same way with a credit card you might get a certain rate of rewards literally everywhere in our economy you're getting a certain rate of stamps that fund your community so the reason there's no diminishing returns on that is because it's a competition every business wants to give as much as possible to be able to earn your business so literally anywhere they can eliminate a middleman in their business they have the incentive to do so so again we talked about credit card companies how they're taking a cut of every transaction once we've shifted advertising budgets once it's very normal for businesses to get in customers by offering them stamps that fund their community all those businesses have the incentive to try to drive those fees down so they can offer more in stamps to their customers because again every customer is like which business can i get the most value in stamps from so i can fund my club my non-profit my church like every every everybody's making decisions based off of that so there's more and more competition to drive down extraction to the point where maybe they're saying hey if you pay in cash and you work around that middleman all together maybe you're getting vastly more escapes so again that's just one example of a middleman that's a nerdcon there was the advertising noman the credit card transactions there's more and literally that's the lever that we have to eliminate the value that they extract entirely so that market power where we're where we start up this flow of stamps from every business and then use it as a lever to eliminate extraction altogether gives us a world where it no longer is profitable to start a business with the aim of extracting value from people literally as a movement will have organized enough leverage that when somebody finds a new way to try to extract value we can put pressure to drive that value back into our communities instead we will literally be impossible to extract value from that's where the it's not just about driving more value to communities it's also reshaping the entire economy where there are no longer businesses that start with the purpose of enslaving you it's not the best word but trying to put you under their boot the way that the social media companies do they want you scrolling as much as possible so you see all the ads all the time and again that's not the utopia their early employees were promised it's like hey you're coming here to connect people you're going to build a better world with a better internet that's the vision that was sold to their employees but what they built was a giant surveillance apparatus to capture the value of all your attention that's what they built and again that's not because they're bad people it's literally because though that's the game our economy is today if you can extract value from people go do it and that's literally the advice you'll get from all the investors across silicon valley they'll say what's your moat how can you trap your customers so they can't go somewhere else it's good advice it's good business but the fact that that's good advice is kind of our fault like we the fact that that's good advice is something we should revolt against and again the way you revolt against that is not by taking up arms it's by collecting stamps to change the world extraction will not be possible anymore so that's part of what that world looks like but again this flow this flow of stamp to communities is so much more powerful than even that because it's not just about trying to get as many stamps as possible you also have the power as a community to say your stamps are no good here that is a company that wants to get your business that's offering stamps for your business you as a community can say we don't accept that company's stamps so that is literally the lever that i think you and i are all going to use to solve the problem of climate change that is if we can actually make it in each company's best interest financial interest to minimize the impact they make on our environment or else we will stop doing business with them and literally it won't be an individual decision if i go do business with exxon they give me their ex on stamps i try to take them to get coin but get coins like your stamps are no good here then any status i was looking for within the git coin community for collecting as many stamps as possible i no longer get that like the ability to say those stamps aren't good is how you can shape capitalism in any direction you want whether it's climate change whether it's better labor conditions and practices again they won't be negotiating against the business they'll be negotiating against all the communities that people are in to say hey like can you accept lesson stamps so we can get better working conditions that's the trade that's how your actions can always have an impact on any problem you see it's not like oh i wish the government would do this or i wish corporations would do that like the responsibility and the agency both end up with you and that's how you're going to shape the world the way you want it to be when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets opolis is a

tokens when you become a member of opelus by may 25th 2022 and get started working your self-sovereign life [Music] i i think that um it's just it's really just so interesting the more liquidity of stamps that are out there the more the more basically people who are collecting stamps then the more the word gets out about stamps and the more communities can start creating stamps and there's just this like network flywheel that i've seen you built so actually we didn't cover this but i want to go back to it real quick but you and i both started our blockchain careers at consensus or at least had coming of age in in the blockchain experience that can and i and i remember you launching pinball out of um consensus diligence and and how seeing how hard you've worked over the last this has been several years of sort of ideating and building and how many years are you are you three years four years into pinball so i guess i started working on it in 2018 it launched on main in august 2019 so it's been three or four years yeah yeah and so we've got the advantage of seeing that network starting starting to to really turn and i think that that's what's cool about it um well there's lots of things that are cool about it but it's just just watching you over the years has has been really amazing um i guess i'm curious like you've been through a couple cycles of of markets and you've been building in down times and in the exuberant times like how do you keep that optimism alive i mean speaking for myself i'm just like feel like i'm grinding i'm five years into get coin at this point like how do you keep that optimism alive what gets you up and gets you excited about about about working on this and um and does it feel like a grind for you sometimes and you know how do you manage that so uh bear markets are tough like again like the when the resources are flowing everyone's having a party and when they start to flow less there's a lot a lot more debates about what to do with limited resources etc uh what gets me excited is literally what the the the theme that i've been organizing people around is less about the value of a particular asset and less about even like um what something on chain is going to do there can be a crypto bear market but if what you're trying to do is organize a social movement i don't think the economic cycles affect people's desire to change the world so if you can provide people an ability to do that that doesn't depend on them having tons of resources then you're kind of relatively immune to economic fluctuations again it does take resources to run panvala so like i do wish the market was going up rather than going down but it's effectively something that can't be killed off by a bad market because again the the the desire for people to have agency in the world i think is not cyclical i i think it's i think it's a permanent state of what's going on here so it's just about making sure that the resources being spent to organize and coordinate this mass movement are being spent in a way where there's infinite runway like you just like if there's less resources available spend less but still do the work like organize the people show them what power they have and give them the tools to shape the world and they want the way they want the way they want is kind of something that i i will keep doing every day until i no longer can amazing yeah i feel the exact same way oh in a similar way with git coin and one of the things that i'm so thankful about in this space is that we can all be building it together um i feel like we're running web 2 companies we'd all be sort of elbowing each other out for market share but there's this sort of beautiful social and then technological interop that's enabled by the ethos of web 3 but also the modularity of web 3 where you know git coins one of the things we're focused on right now is grants 2.0 and civil resistance in a decentralized way we could accept the pan bala passports into that into our reputation system and pinball can get funding from get coin grants which by the way is not the get coin team that's the community through the aperture of bitcoin grants choosing to fund you um and just like that that social and the technological interop and um and then like maybe governance interop at some point like deeply tying things together creates this whole mesh network that we rise and fall together uh and i think that's a beautiful thing for a regenerative community if we have these impact owls that are each by definition because their impact ls have positive externalities and they're clustering around each other we're going to create this like rich fauna of an ecosystem that's on top of each other building modular parts of how we can regenerate the world and i see this like emergent bottom-up phenomenon that comes out of that i mean is there anything to say about i i think that you you're like the perfect person to ask this question because you've got i think you said 80-something communities in penn vault like how do you see dals forming into multicellular organisms like what's the future of dow to dao look like is it token swaps is it social interop is it technological interop is it all of it like what have you observed because i think that you've got the alpha here you've been doing this for four years and you've got 80 communities that pinball what have you seen and and how do you think that will evolve yeah so in a very real sense i'm kind of a traditionalist especially when it comes to what crypto and decentralization people typically believe like the default stance with new web3 dow crypto stuff is to try to find the new way the new way we're going to do things that emerges from the tools that we have and i actually believe most of what we're going to do is going to be a repeat of these uh something that already exists so i always try to find the old theme the older the better uh the old pattern that looks like what i think things can play out so instead of uh like uh token swaps i i'm glad people are trying them because they might be effective uh but i think what's like i i think the order that seems the most uh that comes up the most in history and that seems the most stable to me is finding ways to federate and uh basically have organizations where there's maximal independence within each community but they come together to act in their collective interests and the model the the metaphor that i use the most of my thinking is actually sports leagues like sports leagues do this a ton like they have independent teams that are independently controlled and have ways to organize for their collective benefit and they do that to great uh success in a lot of times uh the most interesting story in that regard recently has been major league soccer and seeing them like through sheer force of will makes soccer popular in america which is a a very hard task to accomplish but like they did it because they had this asset that they all built a network around and then they had ways to organize for the collective good of the sport and i think that same sort of thing is what will emerge through crypto and again i don't think we're there yet i think actually most of the assets that we have in crypto will end up being a barrier to competition a barrier to cooperation rather than ease it over time but i think if we have the cooperative ethos where we assume again just believing that we can end up in a cooperative situation is what's going to allow us to be there belief is a very important thing and if we believe that we're going to find ways to make all these things cooperate then i think we're more likely to do it i do think we're going to have to adjust what tokens and different assets and crypto mean to get there because again by default they're much more similar to corporations they're comp they're competitive by default but if we find ways to uh get past that i think there's a bright future of cooperation between all these different things out there nice yeah it's just a beautiful world when i think about intra-dao cooperation and then inter dao cooperation and then we start to think about ecosystems and um yeah it's it's it it's really beautiful when i when i sort of think up and down that stack um is there i think we're kind of running short on time is there anything that i didn't ask that you want to talk about i think we got to almost all the things the one thing that i want to be able to talk through with you especially is just visualizing since this movement that we're trying to organize uh involves so many different communities i think thinking through a thought experiment of how it would work with git coin in particular would be pretty valuable for everybody so like again people are already collecting stamps and choosing git coin to redeem them so if we imagine more broadly how stamps fit in with a git coin in general like the the the best example of how it can be used again this isn't how you have to do anything but an example of how it could interoperate is if people are collecting stamps and they're using those stamps to fund get coins matching pool the way to build a culture of stamp collecting within the git coin community i think is to tie that into the way git coin works so there's already a mechanism within git coin the trust bonus of whenever you tie into a new identity system uh leveraging the fact that identity is core to the way that plural funding works you get more of uh matching when we've been able to verify that your identity is strong so if we also say you can get a higher trust bonus if you're actively collecting stamps you're actively driving more value away from middlemen and then to get coins matching pool like i think that's one vision of how uh this culture of stamp collecting starts to grow and because git coins community is one of the most active ones in actually taking action that exists in crypto like there's a lot of communities out there but the get going community is the only one out there every quarter making transactions on chain to support what's going on so like the more that this movement takes hold within the git coin community the more i think uh it it will succeed in general like the coin community is very key to the the world that i see in my head amazing yeah i mean i think it's really beautiful that we've been building this this world together for several years and looking forward to seeing pinball succeed a lot and um you know as get coin becomes a dow and becomes its own beast i think that uh i hope to see much continued interrupt between pinball and git coin it's been really beautiful pinball git coin and i know colonel colonel is actually now independent from bitcoin but uh you know just i think that that's uh a beautiful example of dow to dial coordination and if we can kind of keep doing that dance and spread the word out to the rest of the ecosystem it's going to be a beautiful thing uh so thank you for your work thus far i'm excited about pen vowel stamps uh penvala.coms is the call to action and where can people find you in penvala online uh so on twitter i'm at neuron that's n-i-r-a-n on twitter and then panvala is panvala hq p-a-n-v-a-l-a-h-q uh definitely follow us and again like i the the key thing that i want you to leave here with is with the belief that you can actually change the world uh if you don't believe it you're not gonna do it but again i believe that you can collect stamps to change the world i want you to start doing it today i want you to show your community how to do it because again this mass movement that we're organizing it's how we make every community have a larger budget and how we stop having to have political fights we have stopped having to rely on profit to run everything literally you and your community can shape the world the way you nice collect stamps remove intermediaries and change the world that's the thing thanks so much thanks so much for being on the podcast man thanks for having me kevin cheers [Music]
