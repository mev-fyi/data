usually when people describe blockchains the word they use is network when you think network you think like the internet you think like uh you know an electricity grid you know something like telegram or facebook you think of traditional types of networks in traditional networks when you add another node to the network you add another server to facebook you can basically scale a network linearly but blockchains are not like that the larger you make a blockchain the more expensive it is for that blockchain to get validated and there's a bound on how large a blockchain can be and that makes blockchains more like cities cities are constrained by the land that they're on they can grow they can kind of scale out more and more over time but they can't get arbitrarily big if you think of blockchains as cities what is ethereum everyone complains about ethereum right ethereum is super expensive it's super slow it's congested you know everything's super old ethereum is manhattan but manhattan is the most happening place on earth if you want to be a somebody and you want to be at the epicenter of the financial activity and the cultural activity in america the one place per square foot that that is maximized is in manhattan
