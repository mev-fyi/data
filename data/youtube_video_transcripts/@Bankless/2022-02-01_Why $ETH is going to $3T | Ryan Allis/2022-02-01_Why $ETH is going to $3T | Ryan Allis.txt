hey bankless nation excited about this state of the nation episode david you ready to talk about eth the asset my friend it's my favorite asset ryan i don't know if people know this but i'm really bullish on eth and it's been a while since we have discussed why and what are the numbers behind the bullishness because that is the cool thing about ether is there are actual numbers there we can actually unpack and discuss some of the reasons why ether you can be bullish on ether yeah so like i think this this obviously if you guys been listening bankless you know that we think ethan is undervalued but how much how much by how much what is the model to prove that this is uh undervalued and i don't think this is the end all be all model it's a discounted cash flow analysis it's fantastic for for you know capital assets like stocks and you know equities and bonds and and dividend producing assets dividend producing assets but uh our guests today will show us why ether if you use a discounted cash flow model based on his blockchain fees alone ether should be worth four trillion dollars what it's not worth four trillion i only put three trillion in the tweet i guess i wasn't both enough yeah it's gone up okay the model was just updated uh as of today for these new numbers we have ryan alice on the podcast who's gonna walk through this discounted cash flow analysis uh this is part of the reason we think eath is undervalued so stay tuned sharpen your pencil we're gonna crunch the numbers we're gonna open up some spreadsheets and we're going to take a look at this asset in some more detail um before we do david we should talk a bit about our friends and sponsors at zirion because they are doing some awesome things we are huge fans of xeran i think last time we told you about their new nft features now they are upgrading the xerion d5 portfolio viewer to give you access to all the chains all the changes and also they've got some cool bridging functionality here david i know you've messed around with this a little bit as well what have they added recently what should bankless listeners be aware of yeah so xerion's got uh seven different protocols with two more coming all the evm protocols like things like avalanche polygon optimism and arbitrary they are all hooked into xerion with things like solana and phantom coming soon as well and so they are prepping for the multi-chain universe which is definitely coming whether you believe that that is a multi-layer one or multi layer two zerarian has got you covered uh seven different chains are up and running right now with over 500 different protocols integrated into xerion which really just lets you do literally whatever you want and so there's so many different bridges out there there's hop there's connects there's mover there's all these different bridges xerion just obfuscates that away and just makes it just super easy just go i have asset on chain a and i want asset on chain b make that happen for me and xeron just makes this whole entire user experience much much more trivial and easy to get that done so living a multi-chain life is enabled by xerion bridge within zirion guys so the call to action is go connect your wallet go play around with it and you can find a link to the show notes about that start trading across networks start bridging with xerion that's bankless dot cc slash xerion to find out more david i want to start with the question i ask you the state of the nation ryan is aspiring we are aspiring we are dreaming bigger dreams this is always something that i think people when they try and reason about ether and reason about ethereum they need to dream bigger dreams and so ryan today we are aspiring to dream bigger dreams and we've got the receipts to back that up and that is what we are going to unpack to the the day today the receipts that back up the rationale as to why people who are bullish ether should dream bigger dreams we want to thank the

fund he's a serial entrepreneur as well ton of experience in the space also has a fantastic newsletter that i subscribe to it's called coinstack where he writes about ethereum bitcoin polka dot all the other chains web3 the future of money everything i'm sure bankless listeners are interested in ryan welcome to bankless it's great to have you on thank you ryan super excited to be here on bank list i'm a big fan and it's been a goal to be here and i'm happy to be here today well uh you made it with this analysis my friend it's a fantastic analysis and uh this is probably a honeypot for for ever coming on the podcast right because we are just definitely drawn towards these sorts of things uh i mean listeners to the podcast know we think eth is undervalued and you are bringing some numbers to the table to prove it so we're going to get through your disk we're going to go through your discounted cash flow uh model here in a second and you know i i don't want to bury the lead here because basically you you are predicting according the valuation of discounted cash flow that ether should be a lot more valuable than it is today okay above 10k three to four trillion dollars is what the model says but i want to start with this question uh for you ryan so what do you how do you think about eth like from a valuation perspective high level i know we're modeling it here as a discounted cash flow but how do you describe eth when someone asks about it is it is it like a stock is it like a money is it a commodity is it something else what words do you use to describe it yeah obviously ether is all kinds of things i i like to think of ether as the token of the new digital age it's it's the primary money of the internet and i think from a valuation perspective you can look at it as a commodity you can look at as utility what ultimately drives the value of ether is going to be demand to buy the token to actually use it on the ethereum blockchain and so there's a core demand that drives the price of youth over time and as more people want to use the ethereum blockchain the price of ether is going to go up and also we now have cash flows soon coming with after the merge with the proof of stake transition to holders of eth and that in and of itself is going to drive institutional buyers to further purchase more ether one question i have go for around i was just going to ask like could you ground us ryan just for for a second in um you said cash flows and what we're going to look at in just a minute or two is a discounted cash flow analysis but people who don't have experience with this sort of thing you know didn't take finance in school you aren't aren't trying to value equities can you give us the tldr on what a discounted cash flow analysis actually is and why it's important absolutely so just briefly on my background i spent 10 years building a software company a ceo called eye contact in north carolina and then i did a two-year mba at harvard business school and when you go to harvard business school as an mba student they grill into you that the way you value any asset is the present value of future cash flows and so you can and anyone can model out the future expected cash flows of ethereum now this is something that you couldn't do two years ago and it's only since the eip1559 update in august when they began burning using some of the rent revenues from the transactions to burn the tokens which you can think of sort of like a stock buyback it's reducing the supply of ether there's a 118 million ether today that's going to go down if you follow justin drake's model over the next 10 years probably to 100 million ether somewhere around there and so it's like a stock buyback where it's reducing the supply and then the key thing is for anyone that follows bank list you know that coming later this year we have the merge we have the proof of stake merge and we will soon have the rest of those cash flows going that aren't going to burn the ether going to long-term stakers which are long-term holders so you can think of that as a dividend you can think of that as a on-chain cash flow to holders which is going to be very very attractive when you combine those two that means that 100 of the revenues that are being paid for in the auctions to use the ethereum blockchain are going to be paid out directly or indirectly to holders and because of that you can build a discounted cash flow to price ether so we've got two mechanisms here we've got one a stock buyback and then two we have a dividend distribution and the reason a discounted cash flow makes sense is because these mechanisms are in place when you model the price of an equity and you know harvard and the mbas of the world and the business undergrads have been doing this for decades already and that's why the same tool set applies here in your mind is that the case yeah that's exactly correct you could look at ether as having additional value as a monetary value or utility value but what i'm looking at is purely based on the cash flows the folks sitting in new york and singapore and london that are going to be valuing ether from a business perspective a year from now two years from now trying to come up with what is the fair value of this asset based on cash flows alone this is the model they're going to be using to be able to value how much should ether be priced at in terms of total market cap and then in terms of per ether so for all the listeners out there that don't have a business background or a finance background i don't know maybe you uh like perhaps me graduated with a degree in psychology and the name discounted cash flow is like what the reason why we have this discounted word in there is because you have to give a discount for money that you don't have today but you do have in the future and so if we think that this company or equity or crypto asset is going to be producing money for us in the future money for you in the future is nice but it's not as nice as it is money today and so that's where the word discounted it comes in because we have to make some sort of assumptions as to how to devalue money in the future versus money that we have today i just wanted to unpack that discounted cash flow uh side of things ryan you want to add anything to that yeah that's exactly right 100 in your pocket today is worth more than a hundred dollars in your pocket 10 years from now so that's why we discount it to create the value of it today and ryan i'm assuming that you've made discounted cash flow models for other assets before looking at your your model for for ether it kind of seems like you've done this a few times but how is ether as an asset different uh it is like the what's it like to go and do a dcf for ether is it you know similar run-of-the-mill like oh let me just plug in the numbers or are there any curveballs for producing a model like this what's it like to produce a dcf for ether well when you're doing a dcf for a company all you really need are its current revenues its current expenses and then you take it what what its are its current net profits and those net profits are essentially its annual cash flows and then you provide a growth rate that you assume that those cash flows are going to grow and usually dcfs are gone over say a 15 or 20 year period you're projecting the future cash flows of a business now that could go up that could go down but generally speaking a growing business is going to grow at some average rate per year the the us economy is growing about you know three to four percent a year somewhere like that if a fast growth company might grow at 30 or 40 percent a year now what's interesting with ether is two things number one is that because ethereum is a is a distributed ledger technology it's a smart contract platform there actually aren't any costs of running the network uh the costs are all paid for by the third parties that participate in providing security to the platform there's no centralized ethereum company that has a staff that has you know people they have to pay there's of course the ethereum foundation but that's completely separate from the ethereum blockchain itself and so what's unique this is the very first asset i've ever seen in 15 years of looking at different assets where there are no costs so 100 of the revenue from the ethereum blockchain is profit 100 is cash flow there is no overhead there's no servers there's no electricity it's paid for by the third party validators and so that's something that's extremely unique in an average business maybe they'd have ten percent net profits with ethereum you have a hundred percent net profits the other thing that's extremely unique is most businesses tend to grow about 10 to 30 percent a year ethereum if you just look at january 2022 the month that just ended and you compare that versus its revenues a year ago in january 2021 which of course even then we were in the middle of a bull market we have grown revenues year over year for ethereum by 400 407 exactly year over year and so what's interesting about this is not only do we have a hundred percent revenues our cash flows we also have a growth rate that's more than 10x an average growth company and yet ethereum is still trading at a price to earnings multiple that is lower than an average company so there's a lot of opportunity for upside yeah so yeah those two points you know the second point that you said is the growth right and david's getting pretty hot and steamy over there so we better slow down and get a little bearish for a second but um you know the first point where you said uh there are no costs ethereum doesn't doesn't have any costs just want to clarify that with you because i guess from the perspective of the ethereum network the cost the thing it's paying for is security and that i guess is it's from the ethereum network that is its expense line item but i think you're looking at it from a staker's perspective or a validator's perspective where all of this network security cost actually comes back in the form of a dividend if you are a staker right so right now uh hopefully listeners will know that ethereum is completely proof of work so unless you run mining nodes uh you are not receiving any of that revenue but in the future proof of stake hopefully uh june july of this year then if you were staking the network that means you you own ethan you actually stake it then you are a recipient of that revenue is that what you mean by no costs because if you're a staker you just get that revenue that's exactly right now with bitcoin you can't do a dcf model because on the bitcoin network which has revenues they're about you know 95 lower than the ethereum network revenues but bitcoin blockchain does have some revenues none of those revenues go to long-term holders they all get paid out to minors and so because of that you can't model the actual fundamental intrinsic value of bitcoin but with ether you now can model the fundamental intrinsic value of ether and you're exactly right because all of the security starting with the proof of stake post merge world just six months from now is going to be provided by a distributed network of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of stakers around the world potentially millions soon what what that means is that all of the security costs are actually being paid out to long-term holders who are staking the asset and so because of that it's a hundred percent of revenues go flow directly or indirectly to long-term holders and stakers okay revenue flows directly and indirectly i want to unpack that a little bit right and this will be the last thing before we get into the to the model uh there are direct like uh direct dividends being paid to those who stake and that those who stake they watch the amount of ether that they hold go up tick upwards slowly over time and that is a cash flow but then we also have like and this is where things get a little bit muddled because bankless has used different terms to describe the buyback and burn where like we we've also talked about how the burn mechanism is kind of like a dividend model but it's all but we need to be careful there because with you when you hold ether you benefit from the burn in a similar way to a dividend but it's actually a buyback uh and so while like you receive that value it's because through the process of buying back and so when we use the term dividend we're talking about ether stakers receiving ether distributions from staking their ether and validating the network and then there's the buy back which is for everyone else all ether holders that makes the ether more scarce and so while that revenue number for ethereum like if ethereum pulls in a million dollars of revenue roughly 70 percent of that million dollars will get burnt which is like a buyback and sometimes in the past bankless has called that a dividend but technically that's not right technically it's just uh a buyback and then the dividend aspect if we're going with a dollar discounted cash flow model the dividend aspect is just going to those who stake um so i just wanted to unpack that a little bit anything you want to add to that ryan that's exactly correct in in the spring of 2021 about nine or ten months ago you had justin drake on for some of his you know incredible episodes on bank list and he put out some models and from those models i was able to build this discounted cash flow with the exact assumptions you just shared that 70 of the transaction fees are going to be burned that's now of course happening um and that soon that rest of it the other 30 percent is going to go back to the stakers the long-term holders that anyone can participate in by the way does that ever happen in these in a dcf do companies i know companies buy back their stock but do they ever burn it they ever like just take it off the market permanently and just decrease supply that is what happens so when a stock buyback happens in traditional equity markets they purchase the stock back from shareholders and then they actually get rid of that stock from their corporate treasury such that the denominator of the total number of shares goes down which makes everyone's stock per share go up so it is fairly analogous uh so okay we talked about maybe maybe two uh differences which is the insane growth rate uh and you know um uh in comparing this to other discounted cash flows but one other difference maybe to to illustrate is um you don't have to wait for an annual report to get these revenue numbers and i think that's really cool like you don't have to trust insiders or you know analysts to parlay these numbers to you they're updated in real time and anyone can query ethereum and forecast this and create their own discounted cash flow models and that's that's a first in history especially when we're dealing with with this amount of uh capital and this amount of money so i think that's interesting but let's uh let's start to dive into the model then here and i'm showing it now ryan um and i want to start maybe on the on the left left-hand side with some of these inputs to the model and if you're if you're if you guys are tracking on youtube you can you can see this on my screen you can also click the link in the show notes to also go look at it you can see all the people that are looking at that because they've done that yeah okay cool and then for podcast listeners uh we will try to talk about these things but let's talk about the inputs to the ethereum discounted cash flow ryan so what are the most important inputs uh that we're assuming here and where where did they come from and by the way notice you just updated this today because the numbers went up i think from the last time i saw this so um ether is worth even more i i'm assuming you got that you updated this based on january 2022 already so this is completely fresh that's correct to your last point uh this morning which is february 1st here in the united states i literally went on a glass note and i got the january 2022 ethereum total fees total fees are equivalent to the other side is revenue people sometimes complain about fees but you have to understand as a long-term holder the other side of fees is of course revenue that is now being paid back to holders and so for january 2022 the total ethereum revenue was 1.35 billion dollars now that actually went up from 1.1 billion dollars in december 2021 and so even though the price of ether has come down by almost 45 percent over the last two months we've actually seen month-over-month growth in what really matters which is the amount of revenues that then get paid back out to holders so that's the very first input it's the revenue from the prior month you could also do the revenue from the last 365 days either way and then in the next row we annualize that number so we just take 1.3 billion times 12 and that gives you 16 billion dollars that would be what ethereum's total revenues would be if we do exactly what we did in january 2022 times 12 for the year of uh 2022. now you could just leave it there if you were trying to price the value of ethereum today on the proof of work model without the rewards going back to long-term holders you would take the total profits the total revenue at 16.2 billion however using justin drake's modeling it looks like the latest data post merge that i have correct me if i'm wrong but i think we're going to see about 1.1 million each that are going to be created each year as rewards for stakers and so at the current price of about 2 800 per eth that adds an additional 3 billion dollars in value that is going to be paid out to the holders the long-term holders and stakers of ether once the merge happens hopefully around july as you mentioned so you add those two numbers together 16 billion plus 3 billion and you get the total revenue for an on an annualized basis for a total ethereum network of 19.2 billion dollars that is a huge amount of money so that's the first input the first input is annualized total revenue i'm doing it january 22 times 12 but you could also do it the last year just just to pause there one thing we've often said on bank lists is like um blockchain sell blocks apple sells iphones blockchains sell blocks this is the product that blockchains sell in particular uh smart contract platforms like ethereum and so what you're saying is look last month january 2022 ethereum sold 1.3 billion dollars worth of its product that is block space and if you analyze annualize that that's a 16.2 billion dollar a year revenue number for the product that is ethereum block space that is exactly correct so that that's really all you need um you you start out the second input of course is your profit margin there are no costs in distributed network all the costs are paid for currently by the miners and later by the stakers and validators and so if you assume that 100 of the revenues are in fact cash flows then what you do in uh you can see in cell e54 you take the total 19.2 billion in cash flow for your 2022 here and you put that in as an input into the discounted cash flow and so that is the beginning year 2022 the first year in the model and then what i do is i've now forecasted the next 20 years of revenue from 2022 to 2041 and i've assumed what i believe is a modest and conservative growth rate for those cash flows i've assumed it's starting at 40 percent a year going down to 10 percent a year by 2041. that averages out to exactly 25 percent average growth over the next 20 years of the revenues from ethereum now i think it might actually be higher than 25 a year for the next 20 years and here's why um in the last year in 2021 versus 2020 it went up a thousand percent and then in january 2022 versus 2021 it's up 407 and even in a market where the prices of ether are down the last two months we've seen a month-over-month increase in the amount of revenue of ethereum the blockchain and while some say okay layer two side chains might provide alternatives as you all have talked about on bank lists ethereum is the manhattan of block space it's the block space that if your visa is settling a few hundred million dollars a day you're going to do that on the ethereum blockchain they don't care about the 100 150 gas fee to do that they're going to pay that all day long and so because of that i actually think we're going to be in a world where the cost to use mainnet ethereum mainnet on a per transaction basis is probably not going to go down even after sharding happens eventually in a couple years i think the price will stay around the same and i think the revenues of ethereum will continue to grow over the next 15 to 20 years significantly more than 25 percent per year so i want to unpack the annual proof of sake staking rewards uh so can you just uh remind me where that number comes from is that uh from uh blockchain fees or is that from issuance of new ether that's issuance of new ether if you go down to the bottom left of the model there's a table that shows the annual keep going all the way to the bottom there's a little table right there and so last i understand it we're going to be having post-merge about 1.1 million new supply created each year this is um then multiplied by the current price per each about 2 to get an additional three billion dollars in cat usd value um to stakers that obviously goes up as the price of heath goes up in u.s dollar terms and of course the total net supply for ether is going to be negative and so you can't say oh well they're just inflating away the value of ethereum to give out cash flows no they're actually giving out reward in ether however the total supply is going to go down which is going to be increasing the value of ether further right so previously then when ryan and i have talked about this on on in other shows we talk about how the issuance is actually the costs and that's where a little bit of these models kind of get finicky when we um have like these more legacy type mental models for understanding things is like the uh when we mint new ether that is a cost to the network or when you mint new currency that is a cost to the network but that's not how you've organized it here because while it's a maybe a cost to the monetary asset of the network for stakers it doesn't really matter because it actually just ends up as cash in their pocket uh and so there's a little bit of like a discrepancy i think between like just like having a traditional dcf model and like how we apply it to to crypto networks so when we take this is coming from the perspective of people who are staking eth while like ethereum is issuing new ether which is a cost of the network it's not a cost of stakers because it's just going right into their pockets is that kind of perspective you've had but am i correct right you you're just saying this new issuance will be offset by the burn and so it's basically like just consider it revenue yeah there's two things there so um this issuance will be by far more than offset by the burn right because we're actually going to have probably a negative issuance here however if you look in column g and h and rows 11 and 12 you can see that i've actually created two different values a little bit higher it's either ten thousand six hundred fifteen dollars is the dcf value per ether token but if you have staked the token then you benefit from that added rewards and so the actual value to you is higher by about about two thousand dollars um and so what that's going to do is is increase the incentive to stake and get a lot of people staking and providing security for the network amazing amazing i think this is this is really really cool um can we are we ready to talk are you used to want to talk about the inputs david i want to get to the outputs pretty soon but yes uh no yeah go for it you're right i'll ask my question after the apples can we talk about the outputs so when you when you put in all of these numbers and uh if you were to kind of model this with dcf as you're looking at like either as if it's an equity you're trading an s p 500 what are the outputs so what do we get i mean it seems like the assumptions going to this model are fairly conservative it's just basically growth assumptions of revenue and i guess you're assuming that block space doesn't on ethereum doesn't collapse and doesn't go down maybe in the face of alternative layer ones or the face of you know some people think layer twos will uh decrease the cost of block space i don't agree with either of those assessments so you know but i think you're being very conservative with growth so we put those assumptions in what do we get on the other side here well the outputs are are very attractive um the outputs are quite sexy and so um you know there's two ways to get the outputs i'm going to give you the the headline output and then we'll talk about the different ways to get there so the headline is is that if you hold ether today if you're on there and you're you know you just bought an ether for twenty seven hundred dollars today great because i think if you hold for four or five years there's a great chance that you may do quite well on that i know we all believe that but i think there's math here backing that up not based on speculation but based on real numbers the dcf value per single ether today an unstaked ether according to this model is ten thousand six hundred and fifteen dollars i don't see any reason why a properly assessed and evaluated price per ether should not be ten thousand dollars plus the only reason it's not is because the knowledge of how to properly value ethereum is not out into the mainstream institutions yet and there's also a risk discount that is being applied because proof of stake hasn't gone live yet the month that that goes live you get 30 to 60 days of track record with it actually being utilized and settling billions of dollars of value the price of ether is highly likely to move quite quickly i believe toward what the actual value of those cash flows are then you have 12 623 dollars and that is the value in the model outputs for the value per stake ether you get the equivalent of about two thousand dollars in incremental value per ether just by staking it and participating in network security because you're getting daily cash flows for doing that so where we are today at 2800 eath i'm expecting about a 350 increase just based on the dcf model alone and now keep in mind if the revenues increase faster than i project that's only going to increase the dcf value uh per stake ether and so that is that is the headline that is the underlying valuation here that on a fair value fundamental basis ether should be worth between 10 and 13 000 today and did we bake in a particular p e multiple in that number and how did we come up with that number isn't there an assumption there at some point yep so let me walk you through this so i think it's important for uh listeners to understand that price to earnings ratios are a simple way of coming up with what is a more complex dcf and so let me just walk you through this um if you go down all the way to the bottom right you're going to see a green cell it's in row 73 so just a little bit up and so if you go 73 all the way to the right to column l there's a green cell there and that's l 73 and that's 1.49 trillion dollars um and and what that is is the net present value of what the market cap of ethereum should be right now um and that's assuming a 12 discount rate which is essentially the standard discount rate that you use that you're when you value anything and what that means is that today ethereum has a market cap of 330 billion it should be at about 1.5 trillion according to this analysis and there's a huge opportunity for it to increase and so that is how you come up with the discounted bash cash flow per ether you just take 1.49 trillion the net present value of what the expected market cap should be and you divide that by 118 million that total ether supply and that gives you the 10 to 12 thousand dollars value per each now there's a simple shortcut to getting there if you don't want to do all this math for those of you that don't have mbas or you don't want to build a new model every time you're trying to value an asset all you do is you look at earnings and then you apply a multiple to that based on its growth rate and so uh look let's look at tesla tesla is one of the faster growing tech companies out there uh their p e ratio as of this morning is 302 and so tesla elon musk's electric car company is being valued at 302 times its last year earnings its 2021 earnings what that means is that it would take 300 years of 2021 earnings to essentially justify the value of the stock today now that's one of the higher ones in the industry but that's not abnormal for a high growth company to have a price to earnings ratio of a hundred to two hundred now the average company in the s p 500 today the average stock in the s p 500 it has a p e multiple as of this moment of exactly uh 37.32 and so i put 35 here in the model and so if the average s p 500 company has a price to earnings ratio of 37 what do you think ether's p e ratio should be the question is is ether growing faster or slower than the average company in the s p 500 well the average company in the s p 500 is growing at about eight to ten percent a year and ether is growing at 400 percent a year plus and so you'd think the p e ratio of ethereum should be significantly higher than 35 or 37 you'd think it'd be more like 100 to 200 which would make the price for ether about 16 000 to 33 000 but the reality is is because people don't yet know how to value ethereum as a cash flowing asset but they will in a year they might start understanding it after this episode and after the merge the current ethereum p e ratio as of this morning is a very low 20.3 which is creating the implied valuation of 2800 per ether that obviously is way too low compared to its comparisons in the market yeah and just for more anchors in the market amazon has a 56 p e ratio facebook has 21. google has 25 netflix has 34. and again comparing ethereum to these companies is an interesting comparison just to get an anchor but it's also we're comparing a network to a company and networks fundamentally do and operate and grow in different ways than companies companies are in my like mental model they grow linearly like one foot forward in front of the others where networks grow at all directions at once because ethereum is a permissionless network because anybody can come and deploy any sort of defy app any sort of nft project any sort of marketplace uh you ethereum doesn't actually have to like grow in any one particular direction it can grow it has the option of growing in all directions at once so it's very much the difference between like linear growth of what i would expect a traditional company to grow like versus geometric growth which is uh you know exponential growth orders of magnitude growth so when i see a pe multiple of 20 which is less than facebook when while uh you know facebook is like is uh i mean it was once a network it had network growth but it's hit the saturation point like facebook basically has like 80 of the planet on it and it's not really going to grow much beyond that ethereum has like one percent of the planet on it and it is way more permissionless way more accessible than facebook is uh and so the uh perhaps the pe multiple of of uh a comparing to a company is already selling ethereum short of of its potential that's right and you look at facebook's you know cash flow growth rate you know maybe it's growing by 20 percent a year it's it used to be growing it a lot more than that you know 15 years ago but facebook in 2022 is only growing at 20 maybe 30 percent a year you look at amazon shopify netflix similar probably 30 40 a year maximum but you look at ethereum it's growing more than 10 times that 400 percent a year i think it should be worth probably five to ten times what it's worth today what's interesting here too is this is um we've talked about this before people listening bank lists might be familiar with um you know that ether has a triple point asset that's sort of the thesis that uh ether can be valued based on based on three kind of you know commodity asset types one is a commodity or just super categories one is a commodity the other is a a capital asset and the third is a store of value what's interesting here is we're really modeling it based on a the dcf models it based on just one of those legs of the three leg stool which is capital asset okay so we're not talking about commodity you might value a commodity differently based on more supply and demand sort of metrics and we're not talking about a store of value store of value is also supply and demand but it's kind of rooted in this idea of use uses money and the more it becomes a medium of exchange unit of account then it increases in its moneyness and has this monetary premium almost its mean value what this analysis is doing is it's just valuing ether based on capital asset based on discounted cash flow so if you were to take this right which basically says the fair market value of ether is about 10 to 12 k okay and then you add monetary premium on top of that so we're at 10 to 12 k but now we see eth being used as the uh you know the money for the nft economy and when people are auctioning it on sotheby's you see yen euro dollar and ether right and people are starting to hoard their wealth in ether as well then there's a monetary principle on top of that and this model doesn't take into account that monetary premium is that is that the case that's exactly right this analysis is primarily designed for institutional investors who i expect will be coming into ethereum very heavily in the second half of 2022 once the proof-of-stake merge happens because they'll be able to value the cash flows that they're being paid to hold this asset which you can't do with bitcoin or any other major digital asset and so on top of the cash flow value the dcf value you also have the value that's supported by it actually being a utility token if you will where you have to have eth to use any of the ethereum applications to utilize d5 to purchase an nft and then beyond that you have a monetary premium and so you are right if you're looking at the full bulk case you have to use this as a baseline and then on top of that add the utility value and the monetary value so i think we're i mean i'm definitely in the camp that if ethereum's fair p e multiple should be 200 plus so if we take that assumption in what should the price of ether be well if if the pe multiple of ether were 200 based on last month's revenues times 12 you'd be looking at a 3.8 trillion dollar valuation you'd be looking at a valuation that's more than 2x what the entire crypto market cap is right now and you'd be looking at a price per ether of about 33 000 dollars fantastic fantastic that's exactly what i just wanted to use the sound board let me keep you up for that right ryan there's another aspect of this ethereum that's different than a company doing a dc uh dcf for and that's the combination of the aggressive buyback from eip1559 in combination with the distributions to eat stakers and so i want to get your head chewing on what happens when this buyback really compounds over time because i think that might really change the dynamic of the ether price in the very long term so i want to get you to start chewing on that but before i ask that actually ask that question we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i use gemiini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my preferred crypto asset on gemini you'll find over 50 different cryptos including many of the top defy and metaverse tokens like wi-fi and axionfinity using gemini earn you can earn yield on your various cryptos including eight percent on the gusd stablecoin gemini is available in all 50 states and more than 50 countries worldwide so if you're looking to upgrade your crypto exchange sign up at gemiini with gemini.com go bank list and get 15 of bitcoin after you trade 100 or more within the first 30 days that's gemini.com go bankless bank list is proud to be sponsored by

right guys we are back with ryan alice who has this incredible dcf model for ether the asset and a question i have ryan is that um we have this combination of buybacks pulling ether supply off of the market right now because of the the heavy issuance from proof of work it's kind of a wash but once we get to the merge the the amount of ether deflation is going to become really really significant and when that happens that makes uh you know the ether supply goes down over time of course but then that also starts to meaningfully uh increase the value of the actual dividends because say for example we're at uh you know call it 120 million ether today and i don't know how long but you know maybe 5 10 15 years maybe we start to get below 100 million supply of units of ether maybe even lower than that and that starts to uh in like compound the value of the dividends for stakers uh is that included in this model where over time the reduction in supply increases the actual strength of the dividend or how how do you account for that and is that something that we have seen before in other dcfs or is that something new to ethereum well that that's something that's quite new to ethereum you know as you've mentioned right now we have a slightly positive net issuance for ethereum although a couple weeks ago it was negative for the whole week for the first time um post merge there's going to be a lot less rewards going out and so there's going to be less issuance instead of having i think 4 million ether per year created for miners we're going to have 1.1 million for stakers and what that means is that the net issuance of ether is going to be negative if you look at ultrasound.money the the website right now just based on the last 30 days if you click that supply if you simulate the merge click that check box on and then click supply growth till you get to 30 days if you just look at the the last 30 days alone we're looking at a projected reduction in ether supply by a net of 3.6 percent per year which means you know we're going to be getting going from 118 million it's probably going to max out at 119 million or so and then it's going to trend downward toward 100 million over the next decade which is exciting and what that means is instead of making the denominator 118 million you know 10 years from now we can just sort of make a edit to the model and we can make the the model um 100 million and so suddenly now that's the new supply of ether um and that's going to make the value per state ether you know 15 000 instead of 12 000 and not only that there's a there's a dynamic in the market where as you're burning it um it essentially increases the price as it goes and so you're gonna have institutions coming in to get these cash flows um it's important to note that the three billion dollars in annual staking rewards um is going is priced in usd right uh because i'm doing a discount a cash flow model in usd but if the price of ether goes up let's say the price of ether then becomes 15 000 our dreams are are realized as two years from now all right now we're going to be having 16 billion dollars in annual staking rewards in usd basis and that's going to make the gap and the the delta even higher where the value per stake death is you know ten thousand dollars above the dcf value per eth so i i think there's a huge opportunity here uh wait so i think the ether supply accidentally reverted back to 118 million uh what happens if we boom what happens if we lock in a 100 million uh ether supply in the in the model yeah so if we lock it in 100 million here um it you know this is the outputs and then and then do we need to also change the current value per each because that's back to 2 700. yeah so if you know you're you're really going for the bull case here oh yeah oh yes i am you know if that gets to let me hide the middle column here i mean you're looking at a 25 000 value per state death just taking the price that you could buy it on the market and then adding the 10 000 an additional value of the of the value of those taking cash flows that gets you to 25 000 per each potentially within two or three years of now and then what happens if we do a p e multiple of 200 let's max out all the stats yeah if you do a p e multiple of 200 at that point and this is the highest my model has gone so breaks the model after this okay it's all we can do you get to 56 000 of value per each i guess that wouldn't be fair though because we shouldn't be pricing in 200 p e multiple of growth after we've already burned so much so i guess that would be that would be a little bit ridiculous however i'm a fan regardless this this is just silly right isn't it this whole thing is kind of silly like i i want to summarize this and then maybe talk about why it's so silly so this discounted cash flow model in your mind ryan is is kind of the the basement floor value of what ether should be and we're talking 10 to 12k is the basement floor is the base case right now as we're recording this the price of ether is 2700 okay so it's undervalued at even the base case levels of what this asset should be valued at so like i guess uh why why do you think why don't why don't people understand this why why isn't the market front running this a little bit i mean as we just said when we're coming into the model the data's here for everybody we don't have to wait for the ceo of ethereum to issue an annual report for us and tell us what the numbers are and what the growth projections are anyone can query the chain and see what they are so why isn't the market factoring this in right now and why does this look so silly well there's one or two good reasons number one in 2018 and 2022 bitcoin is down and now that's becoming less and less important as bitcoin dominance declines bitcoin dominance was 73 a year ago now it's under 40 percent and that's been declining quite rapidly and so as bitcoin becomes less important in the overall market if assets like ethereum will be able to um be valued based on their actual value as opposed to a proportion of the largest one in the space i think that's one reason and i think the second big reason is that people are applying a there's a knowledge gap and then there's a risk and then there's a risk gap and the knowledge gap is that there's only about 20 000 people in the world now that understand what we understand about how to properly model the cash flows of ethereum and you know that was probably 5 000 yesterday before this episode and so this is important alpha this is important information and i would say that once we actually see a successful merge and the actual cash flows are being paid out daily to stakers that we're going to see an on rush of institutions coming in they can't yet invest until it's happened but once it happens institutional investors are going to be really wanting those cash flows and that's going to drive the price of ether i believe in the second half of this year i hope listeners just heard there that you are front running the institutions if you're buying eth and you know this information and i think what you're saying ryan too is is basically like after the merge after this happens are the education like so david and i probably yourself and others have been pounding our fists on the table talking about the different ways ether as an asset should be valued but after it actually starts happening and the cash flows start rolling in our education work is kind of over because the market will just figure this out at that point in time like big banks other industry analysts everyone will start reporting on this and it'll be self-evident that of course this is the way you value an asset like ether and we won't have to do this intense education as we have previously that's exactly right we've got probably uh another four to six months here to accumulate i'm getting as much as i can really up until you know a 5k price point accumulate as much as i can there are going to be cycles it is going to be volatile you know it's going to go up and down in the short term but in the long term i'm a huge believer in ether and i'm a huge believer that if you look ahead to 10 years we're going to be looking at values that are you know more than 10x where we're at today and so i'm accumulating and i think it's even once the merge happens it's still going to take another 12 months after the merge for the knowledge to spread around the world and for risk committees to evaluate it and approve you know multi-billion dollar investments risk committees god it's something i'd never ever have to want to be a part of i do not want to be in a risk committee meeting i'm inviting you to our new d5 risk committee meeting david um ryan i i want to ask this question too so i read coinstack a big fan of your newsletter by the way and hopefully folks have an opportunity to subscribe uh at the end of this and i know you're bullish eth i also know that you're bullish other alternative layer ones and i wanted to ask about that and talk about that for a minute so because i don't understand it fully right it's like i understand the narrative trade around alternative layer ones um but i'm curious if you believe discounted cash flow is a primary way for layer ones to be valued as the way it's valued with with ether as an asset uh have you done a discounted cash flow for these other alternative layer ones and what does that yield because when i run those numbers back of the napkin i get uh i get red signals flashing that these things are overvalued relative to the cash flows and the block space that they're selling what's your take on this do you apply discounted cash flow to other alternative layer ones and if not why are you still bullish these alternative layer ones yeah it's a great question so i have not yet built a dcf for any other digital assets besides ethereum besides ether um the reason why i'm bullish on other um l1s and other smart contract platforms is simply from a technology standpoint i'm looking at the define market share and i'm i'm sourcing this data from defy lama and when i look at the total value locked in d5 apps across all the different smart contract platforms ethereum has a 60 market share as of today um tara finance smart chain phantom avalanche and solana round out the top six um and i wouldn't be surprised if polka dot starts taking some share after it launches over the next few months and so those are the ones that i'm particularly interested in i'm less interested in finance smart chain and solana you know but when you're looking at terra phantom and avalanche i do see some promise there from at least a technological standpoint they have of course made trade-offs in the trilemma and they are often as you know trading off central decentralization in order to get faster speed and more transactions per second many of these are already on proof of stake and so i think it would be an interesting project to take their current fees you can see the competitive l1 revenues on crypto fees dot info however because they've made such a trade-off with decentralization ironically in order to get their fees to be so low their revenues are you know significantly lower avalanche and uh well let's say binance smart chain is number two by fees and yesterday it was 1.5 million versus 33 million for eth and so you're looking at you know less than eight percent of ethereum and avalanches number two at 425 000 a day over the last seven days so i do think ethereum is going to be king for a very long time and from a technological perspective i'm looking at the the market share so is the bet basically right now that these alternative layer ones um you're betting on different metrics at this point in time you're kind of for these alternative layer ones you're betting on total locked value growth and you're kind of extrapolating that and you're kind of saying well if total locked value is growing and these alternative layer ones are able to cross the chasm and start charging for their block space in the way that ethereum is charging for its block space then you can start to rationalize the you know tens of billions of dollars that these alternative ones are uh are valued at today if you just apply a bl like a discount or cash flow model in the way that you're applying to eth my guess is like the pe has got to be in the like you know 2 000 3000 you know maybe for some of these the 30 000 mark it's like broken it it breaks the model in the opposite direction so i think you're kind of what i see a lot of investors doing is you're kind of classing these things as different it's like almost like ethereum is sort of value and growth type of play where these other assets are just like pre-revenue just um speculative venture bets specu or speculation or early stage venture bets at unicorn valuations is that how you rationalize this because this is sort of what i think people are doing i think that's right ethereum is the only digital asset where you can model out its cash flows it's only a smart contract platform where you can really model out its cash flows and realize that it's deeply undervalued um all the other smart contract platforms are have a very healthy valuation often in the tens of billions of dollars and um some are more than a hunt you know there's some that are 40 or 50 billion dollars now and i i think that is more based on hope and speculation than actual hard cash flow numbers i think uh ryan there's going to be a world where all of the layer twos that come online that aren't um that don't have to pay for security and therefore don't have to have issuance and therefore have much more reasonable uh like metrics that don't break the charts i think there's a world where especially when this multi l2 ecosystem gets built out and the tokens actually start to come and these layer twos also start to generate revenue in the same way that ethereum l1 has that there could be discounted cash flows for all the layered twos and so i think maybe there's a world where we repurpose your your your model for eth and start doing all of these same things with the layer two tokens when the layer two tokens come out uh i don't really have a question but i'm wondering if that is something that is also in your brain it is you know when you look at um arbitrarum they have 1.9 billion dollars in total value locked in d5 right now you look at optimism they have 300 plus million in total value locked on d5 and so as if and as they come out with tokens i think it'll be possible to to value them as well ultimately though i think your theory about ethereum being the manhattan block space of the world is going to prove true and even though there are cheaper alternatives there aren't necessarily better alternatives when you're settling very large amounts of money and that will always lead east to be the best let me ask you a deeper more fundamental critique of this style of valuation and that is a critique by um like the three hours capitals of the world the suzu's of the world and that's this dcf doesn't even apply to crypto okay this market trades on memes and narratives and that's it and dcf like valuations we're borrowing this from capital f uh assets we're borrowing this from from equities that's a narrative in and of itself and the crypto narratives and how it's valued might be completely different than the dcf models that we've used in the past how do you respond to that that this thank you for the dcf model but that just doesn't apply to crypto well in in a pre-2022 world uh you know going back 14 years now it is hard to create a fundamental analysis of what is the actual value of these digital assets today though we have real cash flows and the moment that you have money actual cash flows going into the wallets of these holders which is going to be happening in six months from now or less then people that control the hundreds of trillions of dollars of global wealth there's about 500 trillion dollars of global wealth today are going to look at that and they're going to look at how much they're earning from traditional fixed income which is about two to three percent per year and they're going to say wow if i can hold a u.s treasury and get half a percent a year or hold a corporate bond and get two and a half percent a year or i could simply stake eth and get six eight ten twelve percent a year depending on how many transaction fees you're going through there's going to be a lot of people saying wow i would rather stake eth and i would rather get those cash flows and so i do believe that as staking becomes normal and us taking rewards from revenues become more and more normal we are going to see traditional metrics begin to develop to combine with new metrics of valuing digital assets ryan if this model goes wrong how how would it go wrong what assumptions are a bit more brittle versus yeah i've assumed a 25 annual growth rate i think the biggest risk in the model is that the overall cash flows and revenues of eth don't grow and you know that would not be the end of the world because that means lower transaction fees for people but from a and that could then create more usage which would create more utility which can drive value for the asset in other ways but from a cash flow perspective the way this model goes wrong the risks in it are if we have um let's say l2s take over 95 of the market let's say alternative smart contract platforms take over the majority of the market and that the main net is doing less and less fees then that will impact the cash flow so that's where the model could be a little over optimistic and that's why i've tried to make these assumptions quite conservative to account for that what do you think of this that's like when you zoom out ryan have you ever seen anything like this so like we you coming on the bankless podcast we've made this claim uh you know often but you run ahead you were on a hedge fund okay and and you're making the claim that this is an obviously undervalued asset right that this is maybe like the market doesn't provide these sorts of opportunities where something is so fundamentally obviously undervalued like 5 to 10x undervalued is order of magnitude we're talking about just on like basic fundamentals alone have you seen anything like this in your time investing or is this sort of a i don't so when we start to say like a once in a lifetime opportunity it would start to sound like we're some kind of an infomercial but i just feel like the answers are so obvious i'm wondering if you've seen this in any time through your career of investing something that's been this obvious you know i haven't i i built this model almost a year ago it was late march early april of 2021 and it was just after justin drake's materials came out on bankless and you know that price of eth was you know 1300 or something right around then and i was looking at it saying wow i can buy east for 1300 and i can hold it all the way up to 10 000 plus there's a great opportunity and so you know that's what i've done you're right i do run a crypto hedge fund heart rhythm um we generate market neutral yield by investing and providing liquidity to defy so that's how we do what we do so we're huge users of the ecosystem and um i think there's a huge investment opportunity here and once we de-risk it once you make beacon shading live and merge i i think that's going to actually start playing out in the price performance that's it guys uh ryan alice here giving us the discounted cash flow it's a fantastic lens on ether the asset that you probably won't find in many other places as people are looking at the uh the day trading of ether not looking as much at the fundamentals ryan thank you for making this case for us
