where does this stop David are they going to arrest Tim berners-lee you know the creator of the internet protocols how about Netscape 1994 who designed uh https remember Mark Andreessen talked about kind of crypto Wars 1.0 when he came on the podcast he was talking about the Battle there I mean are the developers of Internet protocols responsible for how North Korea uses the internet in order to do nefarious things that treasury doesn't want it's absolutely ludicrous and I think that if if treasury or ever any government regulator in the U.S took this type of stance towards communication we would have no Silicon Valley we would have no free and open internet based largely in the US today we would have none of this Innovation and economic GDP growth it would have been completely squelched yeah bankless Nation it is the last Friday of August David what time is it it's the bankless Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier how you doing Ryan I was doing okay just okay though you know this this week felt like a a gut punch and we're gonna talk about some uh the bad thing that happened this week and uh in the show there's also some good stuff but um I mean getting the bad thing out of the way number one the Department of Justice has arrested Roman seminoff this is a U.S developer of tornado cash an open source privacy developer uh this one hurt David it feels like crypto continues to be under attack privacy and freedom are under attack it's a big freaking deal and we're gonna spend some time talking about an episode that's the bad stuff but we got some good stuff too plenty of good stuff the arrival of eip4844 draws closer this is of course the one that scales up layer twos further than they already have the friend dot Tech debate continues is it good or bad Ron and I did an entire show on that we will recap it very quickly but really talk about the big takeaways which are that it's proof that we are ready to go mainstream we got a main debut as well we got an airdrop to talk about and an exploit as well just a normal week in crypto so make sure to like subscribe rate and review wherever you get your podcast Ryan I don't know if you've checked recently but on Apple podcasts we are about to hit 1 000 five-star reviews so this is a call to action for anyone listening to on Bank list on Apple give us those five star reviews so we can legitimize the bankless podcast and get that top of the iTunes investing in business categories guys some of this will be edited out but maybe stay tuned to the bloopers after the show to uh to see how many times it took David to say one thousand it is hard though your boys got hard to say oh man uh you know what we gotta start here though uh this is pretty cool from our friends and sponsors over at safe a non-custodial bankless crypto wallet that the feds can't take from you it's called safe and uh they've got some account abstraction magic that they want the devs to know about so what are they talking about today and so you've heard us talk about account attraction of course how it's going to 100x the crypto wallet experience and kind of build the bridge that we ultimately need to get everyone else onto the world of crypto so safe is proposing their modular open source safe core protocol as the standard to move forward to transition all of our wallets to being smart contract wallets and they want you to check it out especially if you're a developer so safe core is unopinionated core standard vendor agnostic High component reuse AKA safe code and also allows to maintain interoperability and smart contract diversity so there is also a hackathon as well dedicated to building on safe core happening in early September in Berlin Germany if that is your neck of the woods so don't forget to register for that and if you just want to check out safe core and to start building in the world of smart contract wallets there's a link in the show notes uh speaking of cool events this one's not in Germany David but we're throwing a little party a little shindig over at permissionless this is going to happen Monday September 11th from 7 P.M to 10 p.m in Austin Texas David what are we doing here uh so every once a year bankless manifests in real life could you imagine that is the permissionless conference of course we've been talking about endlessly on the weekly roll-up for bankless citizens who did not catch it last week or for whatever reason missive roll-up how dare you we are thrown apart for you the citizens that is Monday the 11th at permission list so the one time of the year the bank list shows up in real life Ryan will be there I will be there the entire Bank list team will be there so you guys can meet all the magicians that make this show possible behind the scenes Big shout out to the team we're all gonna hang out gonna get some drinks 500 people is our limit uh we are not there yet so if you are a citizen make sure you show up in the Discord order to click the link that is only for Citizens as well as all the other podcasts guests that you guys have listened to all the people panelists that we've invited to permission lists anyone that's ever been on Bank list that's also a permission list we'll be there uh I think I think Eric Voorhees signed up today so he'll be there at the party along with everyone else you know all the fam I'm gonna I'm gonna buy that man a drink for what I think debate with us I will also buy well you can get Eric Voorhees I'll get Dan Kratz drink I'll get dank yeah yeah do you know what actually I got a surprise for you David because all the drinks are free the things are free Kraken is actually buying Eric for he's a drink thank you Kraken for thanks Krakens yeah uh well speaking of Kraken let's pull up the crack and price charts uh bitcoin price this week start of the week I think we're down from last week but uh tell us the Carnage here uh down seven percent oof Bitcoin has lost two thousand dollars off of its market cap starting the week at twenty eight thousand dollars ending the week at twenty six thousand dollars you know last week uh we were covering the prices during the dump I was like oh we almost never get to do this because it always usually dumps right afterwards you're excited yeah because we're excited about it we actually were able to cover the market action okay and so like I said like oh yeah so the it's we're biting them out right now it's at 17.40 or or maybe 16 16 40. I was like okay sweet we're actually getting the market action and then afterwards there was a huge Wick all the way down to like below 1600. uh that's the Easter price I'm talking about um uh so no we actually did not get uh the capture the market actions but well moving on to eat price 1740 is where it started last week down five and a half percent to 1640. uh Wix down to 1525 dollars whoa that got real low we're gonna talk about that we're going to talk about that in a bit why that Wick may have been but before we do let's talk about a few of the other metrics here uh eth Bitcoin ratio is that flat up 1.5 yeah so this is a Bitcoin sell-off that dragged the rest of the market down all right um and Global crypto market cap total market value of crypto what's that sitting at David yeah almost 1.1 trillion we did drop below a trillion dollars yeah but we're back up yeah I don't like Bitcoin below 30k below 2K and uh definitely market cap below a trillion enough buyers kept us above you know above one trillion dollars so thank you this is going to be one of those buyers out there I I was a buyer last week you're a buyer buyer yeah um I was a buyer I think via proxy um you know one of the things that I do is buying um total crypto market cap above a trillion though still I think this is going to be one of those uh bad news good news episodes all right so that was the bad news prices are down a little bit let's get into some good news here it's on Layer Two B look at the activity David what are we looking at here uh we're looking at a growing area under the curve of the scaling Factor hit new highs for the week at 5.2 x ethereums so the aggregate scaling of all layer twos on ethereum are 5.2 x one the the base ethereum mainly thanks to zksync era actually interestingly enough clocking in at 12.2 transactions per second coming in at number one followed up by uh so this is earlier of the week followed by base coming in at 8.6 transactions per second arbitrum seven transactions per second and op mainnet 5 transactions per second so really honestly like shout out to ZK sync era the transaction volume has been absolutely insane there is a decent supply of that that is Bots but also there's a decent Supply that's not uh airdrop Farms oh Bots okay passing money around and so like yeah like many many people think like oh well it's Bots it's like illegitimate uh illegitimate transaction volume it's not it's not real humans it's real money like that's there's a half a billion dollars being pushed around in ZK sync era so that's real actual like stress testing of the protocol Bots or not there are actual like deep new novel apps being built on ZK sync that real humans are actually using so it's a mix between Bots and humans kind of a taste for the future well that's what you're going to get when the transactions are so cheap then the robots can start affording it right yeah so yeah so cheap transactions are robot transactions um base flipping arbitrum and optimism by daily transaction count wow yep coming in at number one at the the optimistic Roll-Ups yep it's a big freaking deal look at this chart just straight up have you been surprised by bases adoption David uh I mean as someone who's been playing on friends all week uh no I mean from a month ago to now would you have predicted this chart a period of weeks outstripping ethereum and then also the two largest uh optimistic roll-up chains that have been live for like two years and bass beats it in two weeks I have the benefit of hindsight right now but I don't know it feels pretty obvious that's why people have been excited about bass all along like a lot of the L2 bass contrarians have been like why is everyone excited it's just another like optimism Fork like it's nothing new and then everyone the the base you know Bulls are like what do you mean it's nothing new it is the largest exchange the largest U.S public company exchange with their own Layer Two of course they're going to pump the hell out of it they have the marketing reach and so we're seeing I think the baseballs uh take a Victory lap here I would say it uh you know a lot of things in crypto do not live up to the hype I would say even among the people who are hyping it bases kind of lived up to the hype at least uh to this point in time um this is a post from will she hand one million trades on friend.tech in the last uh two weeks in less than two weeks that's uh that's incredible so would this be sort of base's first breakout app it's all friend.tech yeah I would say so yeah these are the Dune boards David what are we looking at here um this is fascinating roll-up economics what uh what do you see in these charts yeah this is just some great bankless candy right here uh this is why we've been bullish on uh layer twos fundamentally is because their economics just check out uh and so this is an economic dashboard from Nifty table shout out to Nifty table thank you for putting this uh dashboard together uh they've got a newsletter at Xerox trends.com if you want to sign up um so okay so on the top left on chain profit this is how profitable these Roll-Ups are and you can see like kind of like why I was pointing like yeah sure there's a bunch of bots on zksync era but they're paying ZK sync Arab ton of money that's real Revenue into the org bot or not followed by base this is uh for the month of August of 2022 followed by base profitability and then op mainnet and arbitrum and so this is the transaction fees that the Roll-Ups are charging minus the cost of publishing transaction data to the ethereum layer one is the profit and and that is what you are seeing on the left in ether terms and on the right in dollar terms and then if you go scroll down it'll kind of just walk you through the costs and also the revenue just all the economics that make a make a roll up a roll up and so um as just this is the June dashboard that basically articulates the economic case for layer twos uh and as you can tell they are extremely profitable so in aggregate between arbitrum optimism bass and ZK seek era all of them combined together profited 3 000 ether so far in August in the first three weeks of August 3 000 ether in August what would that translate to three thousand times uh almost eight million dollars almost eight million dollars thank you to the US dollar chart on the right here what I what I love about this David is um you know in so many I guess crypto economic models that are obfuscated or or hand-waved away this is like real tangible on-chain revenue and the business model for Roll-Ups for layer twos could not be more simple what do they do ethereum is a wholesaler of ether block space ethereum block space Roll-Ups purchased that and they resell it for more they are a value-added reseller and then they make a profit on that resale and that's how they generate 3 000 uh eth worth of value in one month it's a really freaking simple business model I mean like a lot of Technology here a lot of work to get the kind of the network effect but what what do Roll-Ups do they take layer one block space that they're in Block space and they resell it for a profit that's what they do so ethereum layer one is Costco and all of the officer Roll-Ups are your local grocery store that goes to Costco buys the goods restaurants on packages at restaurants yeah your local Distribution Center wherever that is uh yeah ethereum is a Costco of blockchains wow the new narrative watch it's coming from bankless no longer ultrasound money uh this is a graphic that I saw going through to Twitter last week that I thought was pretty cool the current layer 2 landscape I think this already needs updating because there's definitely some extra op Tech op stack chains that aren't in here but these are all the layer twos that are uh deployed to ethereum and then also the ones that are scheduled to be deployed things like scroll Taiko some other ones I'm not familiar with uh so you can see just like the Stark X ecosystem the ZK stack ecosystem the op stack ecosystem and then like the ones that don't have shared code bases like arbitrom starknet Aztec connect Etc linear where's polygon oh I see it no shared code base up here huh yeah this should be changing soon so the scheduled not live immutable ZK evm I'm pretty sure that is a polygon zkevm so the polygon will have its own ecosystem I don't know about the no shared code base between arbitrum Nova and arbitrum one I thought that that was a shared code base um the accuracy of this whole thing but this is like the spread of the layer twos and there's a lot of them is the point there's a lot of them in each of these uh this is kind of a new thing to to take a look at taking shape each of these I think will become super chains in and of themselves networks of chains I believe so we'll talk about that a little bit more maybe at the end of the show uh David some market news here let's get back to why there was this massive down a candle right after we recorded the roll-up last week um is at 26 000 at the time of recording yeah and it dumped down to 25 200. ether that was like below 1550. that happened last year we call this a wick or a flash crash yeah so it happened last Thursday the 17th I believe okay so why why did this happen uh so there were rumors that uh Bitcoin was dumped by Elon Musk uh from SpaceX so thanks Elon turns out that was unsubstantiated the actual reason was leverage it was leverage oh we did one of those things again yes yes a bunch of Apes loaded up on Leverage and then the buyers ran out and the sellers kept on selling and then we dumped and then there was a Cascade of liquidation so over a billion dollars was liquidated on Thursday both shorts and Longs which just tells you exactly how to generate some of this some corners of this industry is um that's all it was there's no conspiracy there's no no news nope it was just like when Apes piling in too much leverage this is what we get uh so 835 million dollars of Longs were liquidated along with almost 200 million dollars of shorts um so you can blame the Apes uh for that one thank you candles like that I don't remember when I zoom out but because I remember doing we do these every week David so I remember this happening probably like five or six times candles like this so this is a regular celebration just a cleansing of the Apes yeah it's like oh it is it is a cleansing yeah and well again they'll be back don't worry the good news is now you can buy lower on these assets so thank you Apes this was the largest liquidation event since FTX really so there's a fun that's pretty freaking big it's not not small yeah go back uh go back one tweet you can you can compare the candles uh half as big I would say as uh one know that you had the right tweet half as big as FTX so FTX had maybe a double exactly X way back here that's that's the FTX yeah almost an FTX worth huh and it's just leverage Apes being Apes David uh you know I spent the morning reading a fantastic Arthur Hayes article oh that's really interesting please download me I did yeah I mean you got to read it yourself I can't like put put this man's uh words into um into my own but I do the punch line for me let me give you the punch line yeah all right so he says this the FED wants to cool us domestic inflation but the more they simultaneously raise rates and reduce their balance sheet the more stimulus will be handed to Rich asset holders okay okay so the more they do this thing yes the more they raise rates the more they do the quantitative tightening thing the key thing is the more stimulus will be handed to Rich asset holders that's his the Jesus and he justifies it through the rest of the article um one interesting stat here David remember we were talking about how interest payment how high interest payments are for the government for the US government because they've raised their rates right so the FED is that and they raise rates yeah the US government has to pay interest on all of their debt and they have a lot of freaking debt and so now they have to pounce themselves right rather than even like one or two percent interest they now have to pay over five percent interest all right this amounts to a lot of money so this is the federal current government expenditures interest payments right we talked about that in previous uh um we talked about that in the previous rollout so as of uh the second quarter 2023 the U.S treasury will be handing out close to 1 trillion in interest payments to debt holders one trillion that's why rates are so high and Arthur contends that this effectively becomes a rich person stimi check okay because an apple holder semi-check right and asset holder stimi check right and who are the asset holders disproportionately obviously people are wealthy people probably listeners of this podcast I mean people who are not living paycheck to paycheck people who have some spare assets to invest right um this is we're talking about like top 10 types of individuals and so effectively this one trillion dollars per year David it goes to them and what are they going to do with it this is what Arthur is saying they're going to they're not going to buy they're going to buy more assets because what do they need most you know maybe some Services maybe some kind of luxury vacations that sort of thing maybe some college tuition I don't know but the rest of that goes into assets that's why property uh values are rising that's why asset prices continue to increase in this um higher interest rate environment and he calls this kind of the the rich person uh stimulus check so what we end up getting here David is interest rates are up but so our asset prices and so wealth inequality continues to increase it just feels like the pot is getting closer and closer to that boiling point and what is the next era the next phase of this well actually there was a Fed official from the St Louis fed who wrote a fantastic paper that I've skimmed but I'm getting ready to read this weekend um because you know it looks fantastic that's what Ryan does on weekends seriously I mean they're they're spelling it out and he talks about this new era of fiscal dominance okay that is the the key phrase here and fiscal dominance occurs when the Central Bank must set up policies not to maintain stable prices but to ensure the federal government can afford to fund itself in the debt Market what this means is the central bank is no longer in charge and the fiscal government spending is more in charge and they are going to have to print more money this is following the trajectory of like Bank of Japan kind of thing anyway the net of this is as you could expect more money printing asset prices continue to rise uh you know the fed and the US government really painting itself in in into a corner this is not like the 1980s when we raised interest rates there because our debt to GDP was something like 40 and now it's a hundred and thirty percent so that is maybe a taste of uh the article and uh you know as always I found it tremendously insightful well thank you for distilling that brother I feel bullish on what though my takeaway is that I am bullish on assets there you go risk on assets there you go non in crypto assets that aren't tied to Fiat um David what's this what are we looking at here yeah just something to add to the markets uh Lido steaks ether mantle um formerly bit Dal which uh got funded out of this buy bit exchange so this private exchange was just printing money throughout the bull market they realized that hey eventually the best case thing to do is to decentralize so we're going to make bit Dao and so we had the centralized exchange that slowly evolved over time to what we now know as a mental ecosystem really cool story uh regardless uh Xerox mantle has staked 40 000 ether from their treasury the bit thou treasury to State ether with Lido so that is a big dub for Lido 40 000 ether into the Lido um Lido State ether Supply uh so uh congrats to lydo this Dow as well the mantle Dow has a ton of ether on the balance sheets yeah 40 000 is not all of it it's like a 200 000 minority of the of it yeah yeah and they're investing a lot of this into the into the mantle ecosystem mantle uh is a sponsor of bankless disclaimer David what do we have coming up next coming up next one of the tornado cash co-founders developers was arrested and the other sanctioned oh so bad day we're gonna talk about these details and the significance of them and what they represent in the crypto Wars 2.0 which does not seem to be ending anytime soon um ethereum about to launch a brand new testnet this is the dencoon testnet so eip4844 is on the horizon uh layer twos a bunch of new upgrades in Layer Two Week the layer two summer continues to go on there's an airdrop to talk about that you need to claim there is a new exploit that we have to talk about uh so all this and more coming up as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that

the US government names Roman there's another co-founder who has not been located but was also sanctioned David this is really bad news in the tornado cash case not the first time this has happened of course we've talked about Alexa pertzeff who has arrested I believe over a year ago by authorities in the Netherlands but this is the first time the U.S government is directly taking action what went on here what are we looking at so so before we get confused there are two Romans that we need to talk about there is Roman storm and Roman seminov both are co-founders of tornado cash coincidence that their names are both Roman Roman storm resident of Auburn Washington not too far away from where I grew up and then Roman seminov of Russia both co-founders uh creators of tornado cash which is the uh privacy tool that we have previously I have previously used to achieve privacy in crypto before it was sanctioned by ofak the Department of Justice arrested Roman storm and ofac has sanctioned Roman seminov they were both charged with U.S federal money laundering upwards over over a billion dollars in sanctions violation so a quote from U.S attorney Damian Williams says while publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service storm and seminoff in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crime the action taken against seminov and storm was part of the government disrupting the ability of North Korea to raise funds through illicit activity and was aimed at protecting the Integrity of our financial System including the virtual currency ecosystem so Brian Klein who's a famous attorney a pro-crypto attorney who has done some landmark cases in the crypto ecosystem is the attorney for Roman storm his statement is we are incredibly disappointed that the prosecutors chose to charge Mr storm because he helped developed software and they did So based on the novel legal Theory with dangerous implications for all software developers Mr storm has been cooperating with the prosecutor's investigation since last year and disputes that he engaged in any criminal conduct there's a lot more to the story that will come out in the trial so basically Roman storm has been living inside the United States because of the United States citizen being a United States developer a cryptographer an open source developer and so he's lived probably with this cloud of like uh the department addresses really didn't like this tornado cache thing but nonetheless stayed in the United States as a as a patriot of Freedom I'd say understanding that this day might come and sadly it sounds like this day has indeed come yeah I guess a few this is definitely a gut punch as I said earlier for for all of Krypto and we'll talk about kind of the reactions and implications just a few points of what you're reading from was partially a press release from the US Department of Treasury um they're the ones kind of authoring the full press behind this and those were some of the quotes that you mentioned here and so the developers are being charged for creating and deploying the Privacy mixing software called Tornado and so if you've never used privacy software before on Jane you of course know on something like ethereum your address is completely public right and so if that addresses kind of linked to your name somehow you have no way to like maintain your privacy there's no SSL or https or secure encrypted communication uh for crypto right all of that metadata is is kind of leaked so tornado is akin to almost using encryption uh software for money sort of like I don't know David if or any listeners have ever used the signal app before right so signal Inc encrypts all of your Communications this did that for money you know failing doing that on chain people use sort of exchanges as a mixing service this course is not completely private but you could bounce your money in to Kraken and coinbase and then bounce it to a new address to sort of kind of pseudo protect your anonymity but of course it's not pure privacy protection it appears that these developers did not do anything more than the deployed tornado cache code and and importantly they are not being charged for anything more than that well not being charged for like aiding and abetting they weren't liaising with anyone they are so far as far as we know they are only being charged for being Builders of tornado cash well for deploying it and then this this is the other key Point not taking preventative measures to block North Korea from accessing this is very clear that you know North Korea and this Lazarus group they are unsafe reactors they are stealing money from you know crypto hacks and bridges and that sort of thing they did use a tornado as a privacy technology and the charges that these developers did nothing to block them the question though is it like how would it even be possible to block North Korea okay remember guys you know crypto this is code deployed to an immutable smart contract on ethereum you can't stop anybody from using it right how would you even do that you can't do that this is the big missing thing from this charge from the Department of Justice is they said they could have taken preventative measures without actually they just are waving this idea around without actually providing any details right and so I mean what a chilling effect right for American privacy developers or privacy technology developers worldwide and what a betrayal to me of American values and where does this stop I think that's part of the question uh that everyone is asking so what if you run an ethereum validator that processes one of those 20 to cash transactions what if you hold eth which is economic security right what if you tweet or do a show on crypto privacy what if you write a tactic in the bankless newsletter on how to maintain your privacy on crypto and it mentioned tornado cash I mean like that's uh we did that we did that I mean so like where where does this stop David are they going to arrest Tim berners-lee you know the creator of the internet protocols how about Netscape in the you know 1994 who designed uh https remember Mark Andreessen talked about kind of crypto Wars 1.0 when he came on the podcast he was talking about the Battle there I mean are the developers of Internet protocols responsible for how North Korea uses the internet in order to do nefarious things that treasury doesn't want it's absolutely ludicrous and I think that if if treasury or ever any government regulator in the U.S took this type of stance towards communication messaging the type of stance they're talking about for like money over IP if if they took this stance for communications over Internet Protocol we would have no Silicon Valley we would have no free and open internet based uh you know largely in the US today we would have none of this Innovation and economic GDP growth it would have been completely squelched and you know what when I when I read this press release you know it was one of the most kind of almost disturbing parts of all of this there's lots lots disturbing about this was how they ended it David let me read to you how they freaking end this piece I'm actually highlight it what is the goal of all of these sanctions these resin sanctions here here it is the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in Behavior get the out of here not to punish but bring about a positive change in Behavior you know what this reminds me of yeah freaking Dolores Umbridge right like that's what this feels like it's just it's for your own good we're just trying to modify what Behavior you're trying to modify like stripping American citizens Global Citizens of their ability to access privacy encrypt their money uh transactions in the same way we can we can encrypt our communication transactions incredibly disturbing what what are some takes from around crypto yeah so coin Center put out an article which is something that they typically do whenever something bad happens as a result of government decision making uh and so they say the indictment claimed the defendant's unlicensed money transmission engaged in the business of transferring funds on behalf of the public and also did so without registering with Vincent but also they're pointing out does the indictment State any facts that the defendants engage in any activities that actually qualify as money transmission under the relevant law that's probably what Brian Klein the lawyer is going to argue is that they are one side is saying hey you engage in money transmission and then the lawyer is gonna be like can you point to the time where either of these developers actually custodied or took control of any money because you can't it was just code it was just code the implementing regulations of the bank secrecy act to find money transmission services as the acceptance of currency funds or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency funds or other value substitutes for currency to another person or location by any means that's a bunch of legal speak it's basically was tornado Cash ever a bank or was it code was there any trust in these individuals did these two individuals have any Authority or power over the direction of these funds or was it just code interestingly in 2019 fincen virtual currency guidance a paper released by Vincent interpreted the regulations and said that an anonymizing software provider is not a money transmitter freaking obviously it's not yes like so so what are they doing now here here's uh Niraj on this what's he saying from coin yeah so neurologist is just also from coin Center just basically says the obvious Roman storm and Roman seminov did not accept nor transmit user funds they never touched users funds you notice the other nefarious thing about this is that in the indictment in the statement from the Department of Justice they said that the majority of money going through tornado cash was illicit but interestingly they previously admitted that only seven percent of money going through tornado cash is Elicia and that discrepancy between what they are saying in this document saying the majority of funds going through tornado cash is all bad and nefarious would they you can tell that like they are just trying to work up a case here because of the fact that they previously said that they know that only seven percent so they they're clearly working up a case here so so that means David 93 was like presumably not illicit it was just citizens of my money some of the other people's money for privacy on chain right which is again we don't have an HTTP there is no privacy Solution on chain right now that can be accessible on ethereum and this was this was it this was one of those and there was a not all uh scammers and tax evaders and terrorists and and Rogue States using this protocol it's like regular people they're stripping this function up because I I just want to reiterate for for those who aren't familiar we talked about this I know months ago when it happened any uh U.S citizen is actually not permitted it's illegal for you to go use tornado cash right now you cannot do it it's an o-faced sanctioned smart contract address yes and the again going down to the base principles of why this is important is like the the line the classic line is like why do you need privacy if you have nothing to hide um of course I think Bank assessors don't need to be have that these arguments reiterated like when I use tornado cash it's not because I have a skeleton to hide like I just want to hide my bad trades and my stupid nfts that I bought on one particular address and when I send you money I don't want you to be able to see anything guys it's just like I think if you there's somehow this Norm that we don't have around Financial privacy but but you know flip it around messaging imagine if the government could open up every single email every single Community every single message that you send to your your friends or your wife or your family and they had like read access to all of that that's what you have without privacy on chain I will note too this seven percent of tornado Cash's legal activity yeah I was looking at estimates for Dino actual physical cash what percent estimates experts estimate of that is kind of illegal or tax evading do you know what a good number is higher than seven it's thirty percent David physical cash maybe we should Outlaw I don't want to give them ideas do that they are also trying to do that okay so Seth from privacy another tweet from him says the logic so that he's quoting um he's got a picture of the of the document and says as discussed below this is a statement from the government the failure to implement AML kyc facilitated the ability of customers or the tornado cash service to transfer criminal proceeds between addresses on the ethereum blockchain without being traced and then importantly Seth says who's a lawyer says the logic that non-custodial Services must Implement kyc AML without is without prior legal precedent there has never been any statement or precedent ever that non-custodial Financial Services have to have to enforce kyc so it's one of those how do you find out this is illegal it's like arrested yes and rest you yes exactly there's not actually a law about this yeah I will say okay so there's one new thing it's like we've we've as a industry of cryptographers who are we we are Downstream the cryptocurrency industry it's Downstream of the cryptographers that have come before us in the 80s 90s and early thousands we've already fought cryptography Wars 1.0 why are we doing cryptography Wars 2.0 because as David's saying cryptography itself like encryption technology itself the thing that we take for granted every day it used to be on the U.S Munitions list right it could not be a technology there's export is illegal for citizens to use and we change that with the birth of the inner that's what you mean by crypto Wars 1.0 exactly so we've done this before why are we doing it again well because now we have the addition of cryptocurrency so now there's this new form factor and the government thinks that it gets to have a second attempt of making cryptography illegal or at least this particular particular implementation so the addition of financial assets is the novel thing here and this is where the torn token the tornado cache token actually has a story to play here so again Seth from privacy focuses on one of the elements in the documents here and says that this is most assuredly where the court will focus on profit motives as there was a clear profit at stake for the founders indicted here without torn I doubt that there will be any case at all made by the U.S government and so inside of the document there's a section that says in connection with the creation of tornado cash Dao the tornado cash Founders made a public announcement of the creation of a new token on the ethereum blockchain called the torn token and created approximately 10 million torn tokens pursuant to a formula created by Roman storm and Roman seminar of the defendants approximately 30 percent of torn tokens were distributed to the three founders and to certain investors in the tornado cash service and including some Venture Capital firms and so they were able to profit what off of what the Department of Justice is saying is promoting uh illicit illegal activities that violate fincen and so that profit motive is a new variable in what is now crypto Wars 2.0 it's the strongest part of their case if there was no token this would this case would be a whole lot weaker yes and so this is why we are thinking that we're doubling down on this whole torn thing but uh what did torn actually govern over a tornado cash could it could it have removed money from the pools could it have directed any money the answer is unequivocally no it could have not done that there were some very small surface areas that tornado cash the torn token governed over one of them was the relayers I think you could approve or unapprove relayers I think that was the big one uh but really there was no material control over tornado cash in fact uh tornado cash governance broke not too long ago from an exploit I remember I remember I don't know if you remember that story but basically tornado cash governance is now completely corrupt because of an expert that happened I couldn't do anything about it they didn't write control yet the pools still live on so it was actually proof that the tornado cash token is completely adjacent to the actual details of the protocol well and how far back do you kind of go around that too again ethereum stakers ethereum validators received some fractional proceed of a tornado cash transaction so there's a you know profit there like I mean so do you make ethereum illegal and validating illegal I don't know where this road leads this is Jake travinsky I'm struggling to think of something anything useful to say about this tragic mistake that is the doj's decision to direct privacy and speak and speech as crimes I'm blank when he runs out of words um the the treatment of privacy and speech as crimes let's remember what code is and why we want crypto Wars 1.0 is because encryption technology code is speech it's speech right and uh we have protection of free speech at least in our Western liberal democracies or or I guess so we believe um Jake continues privacy is normal code is speech the right to anonymity is essential to a free Society these are fundamental principles embodied in the U.S Constitution he ends with this take in time I'm confident they will be confirmed by the Judiciary even if today they were ignored by the executive so he thinks we still have a case to make on the Judiciary side remember when we first met with Jake um he he said I think all of this ends with U.S uh you know versus crypto in some sort of Supreme Court case right and he thinks that that's where we'll have to make our stand and um I mean we're getting closer to that I suppose so a tweet that I put out in response to this is cryptography is the language of Truth a stance against cryptography as a denial of reality arresting those who write cryptography as futile it merely causes unnecessary harm while resisting the inevitable and this is what I would say is emblematic of the friction between large-scale Authority coercive government and I say coercive relatively neutrally because like that's how a government works and then also the rights and the power of the individual cryptography is just Applied Mathematics and when you construct Crypt Photography in many different ways infinite different ways one of those ways of construction just like building blocks just like adding some numbers together you can get a system like tornado Cash Tornado cash is just math and is just deployed on a crypto economic system called ethereum there's no politics about that it is an expression of numbers and you cannot make that illegal and the reason why the government is trying to make that illegal is because it's looking at that thing and it's so cryptography so powerful that it appears like magic to people and so that disconnect of understanding it's seriously just misunderstanding that is what is allows them to have room to make this arrest I think I think I I want to add to that take right because you said it's a applied math and somebody might say yeah but you know like nuclear weapons are just applied physics I think the difference with cryptography is that it is a defensive technology only it is not an offensive aggressive weapon it is more like a wall that you build and and it is a tool for the individual a individual person can have a piece of communication that cannot be decrypted by anybody like not even that the NSA not even Mossad right the full brunt of government power and spending cannot break an individual's ability to encrypt some communication and keep that secret it is a defensive technology for the people essentially and that's what's at stake here and that's what makes it even more Insidious I think this is Amin solimani just so you get a picture of uh who this guy is which Roman is this David who are we looking at this is Roman storm at East Denver this most recent year looks like a regular kind of crypto eth Dev um standing next to you like I mean I wouldn't be surprised if you've seen him around a conference as David maybe without knowing it yeah probably yeah it's a yeah normal looking guy again she's from Auburn Washington that's like 30 minutes away from where I grew up so what do we do about this what do we do about this this is I mean solimani GM I would like to talk to the manager he he thinks we should go full Karen on this and we should raise a Ruckus I don't know exactly what that looks like well no that's the picture that he's uh that he's showing he's like how to file a petition removing someone from the ofax sanctions list so Amin is asking you I'll go do this after we uh conclude conclude here today Ryan to file petition say hey let's get Roman seminov off of the ofac list uh Roman storm is in jail uh Roman seminov is on the ofac list can you do that we can file a petition sure what else can we do I mean we'll do that but just that'll go into you know I I want to know like legal defense groups to fund there's always like coin Center and you know blockchain Association doing great work um we've got to figure out some other calls to action here but maybe this is related to this David because I know coinbase has been working on this um tell us about an update to this court case because it's it's it's definitely related yeah it's related and also bad also negative so this is the lawsuits against tornado cash so um way back when after tornado cash was added to the ofac sanctions list there was the mass dusting of people out of the tornado cash contract address which if you are a U.S citizen and you received any of this dust that made you violate ofac sanctions list because the law makes no effing sense um it doesn't account for the idea that a smart contract if deemed illegal can go touch you if somebody else uses the logic of that smart contract to send you money which is exactly what happened it's like if you got a an envelope with something bad in it and somebody dropped that in your mailbox you would be legally responsible for that yes and so there are a handful of people suing the Department of Treasury over this and so this uh coinbase is sponsoring one of them coin Center enter is sponsoring me I'm the other one and so this is not my case this is the coinbase sponsored case where I think the tldr is that the United States Treasury has won one of these lawsuits coinbase is going to appeal this but the Tweet here is uh the district court in the Van Loon versus Department of the treasury that Van Loon named sounds familiar that will be Preston Van Loon who is one of the co-founders of Prismatic Labs the related suit challenging the ofax sanctions has held in favor of the U.S governments on the Marist meaning that the treasury wins and the sanctions designations are upheld this tweet goes through the logic here three main points the tornado cache is an entity so it can be designated under sanctions regulations we the crypto industry want tornado cash to not be an entity we want it to just be code because of how it is that's what it is that's what it is in an association composed of its Founders developers and the Dao a body of persons who have combined and to execute the common purpose of developing promoting and governing tornado cash so you can start to see where the torn token and the tornado cache Dow start to be a very relevant variable here so that's the first of three reasons of determination here's the second that smart contracts constitute property under the applicable regulations is not plainly wrong so the court will defer to that determination in particular regular contracts are property under the regulations and so therefore smart contracts are just code enabled species of unilateral contracts how many things can you get wrong I mean like you can make a smart contract that is a property so an nft for example is a smart contract and I own nfts and so that is my property but I don't own a tornado cash even though it is also a smart contract or a system of smart contracts because you need to take the thing in facts and circumstances like calling something a smart contract doesn't tell you much about what that thing is an erc20 token is a smart contract an nft is a smart contract a dow is a smart contract uniswap is a smart contract literally everything on ethereum other than externally owned accounts are smart contracts so everything on ethereum is a smart contract not everything on ethereum is property so we need to figure this one out treasury so that's the second point the third no First Amendment conflict here has happened because the sanctions does not prohibit all expression just an expression using one service so this first amendment is our Free Speech one yes so they're saying that this is okay because tornado cash is is not a public place or Forum no problem here has been caused by a chilling effect on co-developers because it only limits transactions not writing or otherwise interacting with the code itself saying that when you type in the numbers in your keyboard and those numbers happen to manifest into a valid transaction that transaction is not speech which we want it to be speech I mean ought to be speech it's it seems very simple uh treasury news government does not want an https for money you they just do not do want that right that is not written anywhere in the Constitution that gives them the right just because something's digital they think they can surveil it they think they can access it um we don't think they they should we don't think they can it seems you know incredibly obvious to me but they're losing this case and so where do we where do we go from here so the coin based case is going to proceed I think that's going to be appealed to a new court it's got the coin um you also have the coin Center case which you mentioned you are a plaintiff on and so yeah the plaintiff on so it's like uh David Hoffman versus Janet Yellen and treasury uh that hasn't proceeded yet so that's going forward so we're pushing back in the court system but this this this Court ruling was a pretty major setback in the actual arrest of Open Source developers is uh again another major setback here so Paul Grewal the chief legal officer of coinbase uh just says rights are rarely secured that is on a path that is always up and to the right we will continue to believe the plaintiff's challenge to ofax tornado cash action is correct so they're not backing down they're just gonna appeal this and we're going to have another Rodeo the instances in which I've talked to two people at coin Center both Peter and Niraj from coin Center they've both said very positive things about the progression of my case um they think that they kind of revealed that treasury actually didn't really understand what they were getting into I can't really say too much but positive sentiments but we don't really know until the day actually comes and the ruling is ruled upon so plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it guys uh we'll try to come back next week with some more substantial action items for you and places you can donate things you can do but definitely there'll be a place to contact your representatives if you live in the U.S if you don't live in the U.S look I think the battle will be fought in your jurisdiction as well and so look at the us as kind of a Bellwether for some of these things because if it's not there it's coming to a jurisdiction near you um wow onto more jovial notes friend.tech continues to shake with crypto Twitter um we Ryan put out a tweet saying is friend Tech good or bad because cause people have opinions on this friend Tech is not universally loved by everyone and so there's a bunch of a bunch of division about whether the structure of friends is actually something that we want to promote we did an entire episode on this because I thought it was a pretty good conversation so a 45 minute episode that episode came out yesterday if you just want the update on friend Tech but I think the tldr is that friends has started to attract outside influencers outside of crypto FaZe Banks Gracie Hardy from only fans Grayson Allen an NBA player uh disclosure the DJ Duo is now on there so now we are scaling some of our crypto platforms to definitely break into mainstream Society autism Capital put out a take that's basically saying that all of the Soul and Spirit of crypto is lost and a friend Tech proves it just another Ponzi scheme that's another Ponzi yep uh so like I said if you want to listen to our takes about that uh there's we have a full-length discussion uh both on YouTube and on the podcast but I think the aside from all of that Eric Wall really sums this up best when he tweets out remember when one app cryptokitties took down the entire ethereum blockchain in 2018 we just handled an entire Ponzi speculation on our friends like an effing Breeze absolute progress and this is uh him showing uh Brian Armstrong tweet out that bass hit 16 transactions per second yesterday and not a single hiccup neither on base nor on the ethereum layer one so for those that have been here around since crypto kitties progress progress it's definitely worth celebrating we don't have time to get into this story today but there's still some question as to whether binance is in trouble or not here's the Wall Street Journal a headline binance the biggest crypto player is facing legal risks over Russia so the question I think is you know binance is is facing all of this investigation by the US government um this one in particular that binance was essentially serving uh ofak sanctioned Russian oligarchs not doing proper AML kyc and abiding by U.S regulation and so binance of course denied that claim there's other things in the works though too I think Travis Kling signed that I think Travis Kling sums this up pretty well there's some pretty wild action in the BNB token uh the BNB token was down wild negative action yeah wild it's down bad let me just say this this is BNB on the month um I don't know what's this downtown yeah and Travis Kling says not sure what's going on uh binance was sued by the SEC on numerous charges sued by the cftc had three senior Executives quit had a billion dollar collateral hole in binance Peg B USD had paxas forced them to wind down busd got kicked out of Canada Germany Netherlands Belgium about to be charged by the doj strong evidence of massive money laundering terrorist financing allegations under investigation in France for aggregated money laundering had their auditor quit and remove attestation like I could go on all right and Travis does go on so there's a lot that has surfaced but I think the big question in my mind is like who do you trust more uh CZ a crypto Banker or the US government and I don't know that's a hard one right now I can't tell either I can't tell whether this is like a mini SPF going on um because it's not quite like SBF it can't be or binance would already be wiped out or is this Western Government persecution of yet another crypto company like I trust neither of them David neither maybe I don't you know what I opt out to defy I will stick stick my continue sticking with the ethereum layer one and perhaps some layer twos you know I opt into ignoring all of these things and CZ can just deal with whatever hole he is in and if he's not in the hole then congrats well the rest of this episode is all good news let me just say that so David what do we have coming up now that is very very true the rest of this episode is absolutely awesome okay uh so far Caster on mainnet do you maybe didn't know that podcaster wasn't on maidenet we'll talk about what that means no not the ethereum layer one which layer two did they pick everyone place your bets uh moving on from that a new airdrop did you qualify we'll find out uh some eip4844 updates Circle and coinbase strike a deal and first Squad staking block gets shipped to mainnet gets verified so much good stuff so stick around for all the happy side of this week weekly roll up because we saved all the good stuff uh after the bad stuff of course because that's what you do so let's go ahead and get into all that good stuff but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask portfolio if you are in the middle of setting up your bull market battle station like I am Manassas portfolio is

said there was a middle ground called the center Consortium a governance over Circle it's no longer needed because coinbase is taking an equity stake in circle so we're eliminating the whole Center Consortium and so now coinbase and circle are banding together wow that is a Powerhouse and for those of you guys that don't know Circle and coinbase they had this project together called usdc you know that old stable coin well no now that used to be just circles projected now it is both of their projects there you go that's good yeah yeah so uscc is on six different blockchains launching between September and October will be base Cosmos near optimism polygon and all the chains doing all the chains all the chains David is this good news from for eip4844 and give me a quick refresher on what why I know that EIP by number eip4844 first we had one one one one five five nine uh that's in the rear view mirror that one's now called ethereum now that was the burn okay four eight four four we have the ethereum layer one block space which is what you know and love but we are going to get Blob space what is blob space for it is this uh first class it is this place for Roll-Ups to submit their state routes to it is going to be extremely cheap for layer Twos for Roll-Ups to leverage so that they can be the best versions of themselves it is basically the cheapest version of block space that is dedicated for layer twos to submit their state route 2. and so it's basically going to take off the breaks of all layer twos and so layer twos are all about to get orders cheap to cheaper and this is Proto dang sharding eip4844 we have another order of magnitude beyond that called full tank sharding but first you have to get the proto-dink charting why is it called Proto dang sharding well because there's Proto Lambda and dank red created proto-dink charting oh my God this is a mainstream ready huge nerds we don't need well eventually all of this stuff will just become ethereum and we don't even need to talk about it it's just all you need to know is this cheap blocks bit just like last EIP that that one 1559 that you mentioned David that was the burn we're gonna burn our eat this one roll-up's getting real cheap that's what's happening anyways the new so that was the background for 4844 what's the actual news yeah the news is there's a test net uh it's live this is per getting to be one of the last steps before actual dencoon gets shipped um feels like this year my speculation my not anyone else's don't quote me because I'm not an authority here I'm as a podcaster he knows nothing november-ish of 2023. it's November November is where my best yeah so 4844 uh dencoon and that's what we're hoping for for November uh okay huge uh moving on eigenlayer uh so eigenlayer increased their liquid staking cap so every time eigenlayer updates their staking cap for how much ether you can actually deposit into eigenlayer it immediately gets filled they they released a new cap they raised their cap and to another hundred thousand of ether to be staked with eigenlayer and immediately gets filled so now total in eigenlayer we have a hundred thousand Stakes either from Lido 20 000 safety a different rocket pool 21 000 cbgs and then also 14 000 actual vanilla virgin 14 000 uh ether from the beacon chain so every time they move the cap up it gets filled like almost instantly this is the restaking we did an episode of Diagon layer they should absolutely check out this is a very important primitive that that oh we're creating and this is like a vacuum cleaner for ether yeah just sucking it in yeah and the cool thing is the funny um no actually maybe it's not that cool is that what is this ether doing nothing it's just wait for the future it's just waiting to get restaged yeah so this is this is just showing demand for eigenlayer restaking to get restaged somewhere so all of this ether is just like waiting for some networks to spawn uh this is the first step this is like eigen layer loading up the engine so that it can actually you point its Economic Security which is retaking to any of the resacing networks that come online soon swear we will just stake put our ether into anything you know what I mean like obviously why are people because it's airdrops what's this David first Squad block what are we looking at it's a tweet yeah so this is uh the squad staking DVT distributed validator technology out of opal something that me and Ryan and many others in the ethereum shaking world are very very excited about uh has been an idea for a long time I've been on testnet for a long time but now we had the first ever Squad block proposed from etherfi uh congrats so they use opal and dap node so what what is Squad staking uh distributed validator technology say you and your friends don't have 32 each but you want to stake your eats together so you guys all run in your own node you each put your ether on your own node one of you guys has the leadership position and everyone else signs off on that and so four nodes or five nodes or three nodes can come together and the one leader node can build a block and sign it and then all the other ones can check it it's basically a multi-sig for each validators it's very very cool it opens up a ton of cool new use cases okay moving on scroll scroll is entering into beta phase so after launching its Superior test net this is the final stage before scroll main net so scroll also does not have too many sips before mainnet and so there are some ZK evm upgrades there are some Bridge upgrades here some infrastructure upgrades in this update so over a hundred projects have already integrated with scroll to date in their final stages before releasing a mainnet another MTM ZK evm Layer Two right so would you say this is one of the big three so we got ZK sync we've got polygon ZK environment and then scroll would probably be the third I mean there's other Pro would be the third and then Tycho I would kind of put as a distant fourth but definitely mentionable definitely you know big big four maybe uh yeah David forecast faster we've had Dan Romero on the podcast talking about web3 social uh and farcaster decentralized Twitter can you imagine that that's what forecaster is yeah they deployed somewhere you said to mainnet what mainnet did they deploy to we'll get we'll we'll get there I'm going to tease this a little bit first so Dan Romero tweets out a step closer to 100 permissionless far Caster uh because he is retweeting a tweet talking about farcaster hubs so there's 30 uh forecaster hubs so this is like the different ways of viewing the forecaster protocol the warp cast runs four out of 30 of them the rest are independently run and not subsidized so economically sustainable if warp cast the main canonical app of forecaster disappear tomorrow the network would keep on running next up Dan teases ethereum layer 2 mainnet migration and turning off the gating to sign ups so moving on to the next tweet what layers happen quick did they choose optimism they chose optimism optimism mainnet is now going to be the home of forecaster so you have the many different apps that make up the forecaster ecosystem that's that's warpcast that's Jam that's Yap uh the all the other apps that look at the forecaster protocol you have ens as part of the stack but then everything is ultimately going to settle down to an nft on optimism main neck as the base case for people's keys and so that is the complete forecasters deck built on optimism mainnet very cool and oh by the way I have 30 invites two bankless citizens who want to come on Far Caster today I've actually uh I've replaced Ryan I've replaced Twitter as uh the little spot in my home screen on my on my phone really you know flicked Twitter out of there and I put a warp Caster there and so I'm hanging out in warpcaster a little bit more and let me tell you the absence of bots there is very refreshing nice conversations too the absence of uh you know toxicity there's no salon at people you should retract that dude you need to apologize for that one that's too much do I I don't know uh the comments will tell you uh okay what is this a shielded mempool on optimism uh what what does this mean yeah so I wanted to really put this one in the agenda because of the uh era of privacy uh that is going around as a theme of this episode so part of the explanation as to why fighting privacy is futile is because we have other Technologies like an encrypted mempool that is now coming to the optimism mainnet and will also eventually be on the ethereum layer one what does an encrypted mempool do uh so if you don't want people to know what the contents of your transactions are before they get included as a transaction into the blockchain you need something called a encrypted mempool so shutter has built a shielded mempool using threshold encryption for the modular op stack so this is what they are releasing into the wild today this is a grant recipient from optimism's retroactive public goods funding efforts so optimism making a shielded mempool an encrypted mempool on its Horizon which is extremely cool and very privacy first very individual first and so so something that we definitely definitely could need in this day and age yeah I don't know it sounds highly illegal to me it sounds like they should not be allowed okay Mr fed I mean this is great too this is another example of I think uh layer twos kind of pioneering the frontier yeah yeah I can adopt it later and this certainly helps um you know minimize Mev and uh increase increase privacy um airdrops hey it's airdrop season I guess announcing the next air drop a new chapter in Cross chain Innovation what is this no no not announcing the next airdrop announcing next air drop well they said be next yeah okay so this is next from connects which is a one of the probably the earliest and most sophisticated Bridges across train roll-up bridges on ethereum so you can check out if you want to qualify for the Connex airdrop here in the blog that we will link in the show notes there's a bunch of different criteria it's too long to read out but uh if you can also interestingly what's cool is you can claim next on arbitrum or optimism or polygon or gnosis why do you have that ability well because connects is a cross Chain Bridge so it knows what chain you claimed it on so it doesn't matter as part of the obvious fishing and blurring the lines of all of the of all the chains this airdrop begins on September 5th 2023 if you don't want to mark that in your calendar you know what you should go do is you should go to earnify okay so this is earn.fi this is a bankless application that is provided for free there's a premium subscription when we say this is a bankless application we mean react this is our application this is a power app yeah it's it's um you know the airdrop hunter that we talked about last week guys this is this is um the sequel to that this essentially notifies you when you receive an airdrop so if you type in your eth address year or connect your wallet then you will know immediately if you if you have a opportunity at for next tokens awaiting you and not just the next airdrop Ryan but I was checking my email for the you know once per month I check my email and I actually uh was notified that one of my wallets I have not claimed the arbitrum airdrop and so this is a PSA for everyone out there arbitrum expires in one month so if you have not claimed your arbitrum airdrop you you need to claim it in the next one month now like some of you are like oh arbitrary airdrop happened forever ago why are you bothering to tell me this on the roll up well because we know that there's 1.8 million dollars of bankless citizens and or earnify users who have not claimed guys Harvard from airdrops guys what are you doing okay and so now if you think that like oh no that can't be me I've already claimed my arbitrum airdrop have you checked all your wallets because you can qualify for the Arbors from airdrop in like seven different ways yeah and so the only way that you can actually like I the reason I didn't know that I had this airdrop and then I checked my email and earned if I said like hey you have eight thousand dollars you need a claim bro I'm like oh thank you Ernest say bro I should say you idiot you idiot claim your arbitrary oh man well those have gone up in value to be fair but um yeah there's a lot of opportunity out there so um we're just trying to keep you looped on this you know there's a there's a link in the share notes to earn why but uh check that out I think it's going to continue to be airdrop season now we're okay okay yes I I hinted at this in previous Roll-Ups until I'll just call that back I said that like I know for a fact that one of our portfolio companies Ryan is withholding its airdrop for more opportune Parts in the market more bullish sentiment in the market that was next oh that was next hey so I think uh airdrop appetite therefore if that is a signal to it will be back signal Star Wars got some tech here and it's open source we like open source what are they releasing they are releasing their open source prover called Stone so this is a very core component of decentralizing a ZK roll-up a layer two is making the prover accessible so that anyone can produce a proof everyone can be a prover and so that is a very important critical part of every single role this is what arbitrim just did right uh no that's fraud proofs this this would be correlated to a ZK syncs bujum or polygons plonky this is dark wears Stone uh and so this is a their ZK stuff fraud proofs are specifically for optimistic Roll-Ups yeah I know it's fraud proofs but it's same Niche similar idea right so it's like yeah yeah we're proving our ZK spooky math aren't we yes exactly exactly right uh for any of the people who are in the San Francisco area or who are going to The starknet Summit on August 35th bankless citizens we have a 50 discount to tickets for you so if you want to go to the starkware summit make sure you show up in the Discord and we'll get you the discount code for tickets you know all these projects we just mentioned opal eigenlayer scroll starkware they're all going to be a permission list too yeah some of them might be at the party that we mentioned at the outside so everyone everyone will be at the time to catch them fire now has a wallet fire is a very useful extension that I now use it basically it checks it really should because so you pair it with metamask and and it checks a transaction to see if the transaction is kind of like a phishing attempt or a scam or not and it tells you exactly what the transaction actually is yeah it's nice anyway um that's a useful extension and now they also have a wallet I've not tried this out but if it's anything like their extension I'm sure it's pretty good so uh there'll be a link in the show notes where you can go check that out and see if that's a a wallet you can pair with metamask and some of your other wallets David there was an exploit this week on balancer though it wasn't that bad but just give us the tldr so about 1.4 percent of balancers tvl was at risk only certain pools boosted pools were affected so some of these pools were paused to mitigate risk and they will remain so so if you have been uh supplying liquidity to balancer in boosted pools you should remove your liquidity um and so it's probably too late for that isn't it well so so this is also part of this conversation shout out to Matt balancer in the way that they communicated this exploit they identified the exploit they took precautionary action and then they broadcasted hey there's a vulnerability you need to exit these vulnerable vulnerable pools without saying what the vulnerability is so it doesn't set any black hat hackers off on a well it did but they didn't give them the Q the hey treasure map exactly they didn't give them the treasure map so um overall this has been like one of the best handled exploits that I think we've seen they even built a UI while they announced the exploit to go check if you were in an infected pool and then a button to go with you wow so like shout out to bouncer well done uh congrats on only having a 1.4 tvl vulnerable exploit I guess that's worth congratulations for us um I don't think any money was affected uh I don't I haven't heard of anyone actually losing money so narrow escape from balancer uh really good protocol we love the balancer team shout out Fernando yeah it there oh geez they've been around for a while so yeah doing a great job really quick in the nft landscape uh congratulations to miladies for being number three out of the uh 10K pfp projects category only behind punks and apes uh miladies wow I do not own a Melanie it's not really my vibe but wow here they are oh those are them huh okay I've seen those oh those are the miladies yeah the like the weird corner of of I don't know even how to call it this is weird that I'm seeing the SEC in uh the good news section here but the SEC is set to green light and ether future ETF all right looks like that's going to happen uh we haven't had one of these before we have the Bitcoin Futures ETF now we get an ether Futures ETF this is Eric B from Twitter uh he says this is not surprising to us we said they would have proven ether's future early on in the race nice to be validated what does this mean for spot hard to say Beyond it shows that things can change it's nice things can change even grinches can increase increase the size of their hearts wow you saw Gary genser a grinch yeah that's the worst thing I've ever said about Gary there are 12 companies with applications for an eth Futures ETF pro shares volatility shares bit wise Round Hill among them uh I uh the SEC is not supposed to play King maker but I they do I'm what they do yes I'm not the SEC if you are going to partake in this game I recommend bitwise they are crypto natives they are one of us who the hell knows anyone from pro shares or volatility shares that sounds like some Boomer so if you're gonna buy some eth Futures ETFs do it through bitwise they're our friends wow we just criticized uh Gary for being a kid make King maker and here's David from Bankers I know I'm not I'm not Gary I do not play I don't have I'm not beholden to his rules speaking of not being beholden to the rules you like that segue here's SPF it's a bit not guilty for fraud and money laundering charges because of course he would uh he's also on bread and water do you know that so he's a he's a vegan in prison they won't comply with his diet so he has um mainstream news I didn't even see this on crypto news so there you go the morning as a as a consumer of nutrition content bread and water is not a recommended diet David he's in jail all right that's uh not a recommended place to be well thanks for these Pro tips from bankless all right what do we got next uh coming up next we got Vance Spencer's smell uh we had an episode about s-m-e-l-l the Fang of defy synthetics maker ether link Lido we got a question from the nation David Ryan what would you add what about the other tokens so we're going to add some add some letters to Vance Spencer's smell uh keep it don't cut it and then of course what were bullish ons and we did a very cool episode on super change which I think is going to be related to what Reiner and I are bullish on so all that is coming up and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible introducing ethx from stator ethx is a liquid staking token designed to maximize rewards all while securing ethereum with stator you can run an ethereum node with just four eth which is 85 lower capital and 35 higher Returns versus just solo staking stator has a multi-pool architecture with both permissionless and permission node operators to enable decentralization and scalability stator has extensive experience in building liquid staking Solutions on six proof-of-stake blockchains and is trusted by over 70 000 stakers seder has partnered with over 40 leading protocols on these chains to bring deep High utility to their liquid staking tokens stator is actively building Integrations and Partnerships across ethereum to bring the same great D5 utility to the east X token while smart contract bugs are always a risk in D5 the ethx smart contract has received three independent Audits and has a million million dollar bug Bounty with immuneify go to staterlabs.com staking protocol today mantle formerly known as bit Dao is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle Network's gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web free space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramps so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralized mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle questions from the nation this week this one from art Democrat bankless citizen our Democrats going to be at the party I'm pretty sure Art's coming to the party we are you met him in real life um yeah he was at our party in France he's been a more bankless parties than you ever good job art Democrat it's a great question here so we were talking about smell before the break uh that actually stands for synthetics maker ethereum Lido chain link so Vance Spencer said that he was bullish on all of these tokens we did an episode earlier this week on why the case for them this is our Democrats question what would you add to the smell cohort David and Ryan based on the the current crypto space Outlook and why why would you add uh these letters these acronyms so yeah what's your answer to that I think the two obvious low-hanging fruit uh ones that come to mind is uniswap and Ave we talked about uniswap in the van Spencer episode he said that um he's not convinced that liquidity inside of uniswap is all that sticky he doesn't see a large moat around uniswap and I take that point unisop LPS are losing money and everyone knows it and they probably know it too unless they have just like been ignoring reality yet they are still keeping their money inside of uniswap and so maybe we don't understand the moat but there does appear to be a moat or at least no one's really leaving liquidity out of the unit swap unit swap has over 85 of all on-chain trading volumes going through uniswap it's pretty dominant and so maybe we can't explain the moat I think there's a base there's an argument to be made that it does exist and all that needs to happen is a few select Innovations on unisop's own application layer in my mind I like you I think it's a it's extremely valid Contender to be considered part of the Fang of D5 like come on it's uniswap bro you smell you smell that what else you got give me another Ave would be the other one a um compound is pretty stagnant uh Ave is updating they did have that governance uh flip flop governance fumble with the whole uh CRV but I mean they're really the only ones I would say that are progressing forward meaningfully uh and like there's of course there's a conversation is governance going to work do we need more governance free Primitives but I mean between the market cap of Ave it is a blue chip um I mean everyone uses Ave uh and so smell plus u plus a you smell a you smell you smell it do you know I I guess what I would add is um I think Vance is focused on D5 which is cool but there's another area the layer two tokens yeah so IOP our poly Yelp yeah all of these can we make an acronym for this we probably can I mean you write these down all of them like you know I'm more bullish on some than others based on kind of their their fully diluted valuation where I see kind of the organic growth um I Hazard to share that here though because we love all of our children equally but maybe someday we'll do an episode kind of comparing these different ecosystems very bullish in General on Layer Two so there might be some other initials to uh to come up with and you know David David wants his competitor for smell so I can hear him click anyway he's trying to figure out how you get I got it a what do you got what do you got uh spaz scroll polygon Arboretum ZK sync oh I don't have the O for optimism spazzo there might be something better I mean all of the all of the big ones right um so uh anyway that that's not what Vance's portfolio is but um definitely bullish on some L2 stuff these days for myself and I know you are too uh Nick how worried should we be about Banks gobbling up eth and BTC through ETFs feels like a step backward if the majority of folks that own either of these assets actually own them through a bank instead of their own I've got my answer to this you want to take it oh really yeah I'll start with my answer so my answer is you know what feels like so great question Nick you know what it feels like a step backwards logging into your Fidelity cap logging into your e-trade account okay so like that's where you have to purchase these ETF assets they're not programmable you can't do anything with them you could just look at them in like side the Fidelity price tracking app so I would contend that it's net accretive to crypto because I don't think that the value is actually going to reside there because it's an inferior product and it's an inferior uh set of rails it's in tradify it's in the old banking system and these are crypto native assets right so you want their tokenized form so you can do things with them you can restake them like you can uh you know it's stake them for the first time you know use them in Lido use them as collateral for loans like freaking like there's so much more you can do with them I could send it to you uh if I wasn't an American maybe I could get some privacy for my uh you know crypto native assets so I don't think tradfi will be competitive against any of that and we'll just slurp all of their liquidity and then we'll use now I I'll make one exception though I don't necessarily think that holds true for Bitcoin I think it holds true for ether I don't think it holds true for Bitcoin why Bitcoin does not have a fully developed set of use cases in D5 inside of its ecosystem it doesn't have any developing experiences I think it is uh potentially more concerning for Bitcoin although I'm still not overly concerned but I'm not concerned about that yeah what's your take on that yeah my take is that uh one of the lines that I liked about how just the wheels of History turn is that science progresses one grave at a time it's a little bit dark some people are never going bankless some people some people need to die some people are just always going to have their assets inside of their centralized brokerages they are not okay they don't care to become a crypto person no um maybe their financial advisor recommends them like hey let's allocate one percent of your savings to crypto just because you don't have any exposure there and because it's inside of your Fidelity account we can just buy ether or Bitcoin inside of your Fidelity account and then these people will go and retire and they will go and be sipping Margaritas on the island on an island for the rest of their life and they'll never become a crypto person yeah at least they're pumping our bags and so for all the people that are going bankless that bought ether earlier than they did fine fine I love the back half of this episode by the way the first half of this episode It's All About cryptic values and like we're fighting for privacy and all these meaningful things and the back half is like we got some Bag pumping we're excited about that huh yeah that's that's what banklist does is we actually never mind all right I take it away uh this one for me although it's not my pfp um the SEC wants to make every crypto asset a security fincen wants to make every crypto person a money transmitter the IRS wants to make every crypto transaction and tax event America please save yourselves from your regulators I felt this one strongly this week um I what I think that they don't understand they refuse to understand is because they're I think these Institute organization there's always a book you refer me to about kind of the you know nation state apparatus I was saying like a state seeing like a state so each of these institutions are trying to Garner more and more control and they become kind of their own like autonomous slime molds they're just just zombies that are just seeking that but the new thing they don't understand is that this is disintermediated this is peer to peer all right right so even when you look at kind of the you know treasury stance against these tornado cash developers right they keep thinking of them as custodians as if they're institutions and they're not this is peer-to-peer peer-to-peer digital money it's a new thing but it's also a very old thing peer-to-peer is how we used to do money when like we would barter with Golds when we would have physical you know cash and I would give it to you and or you would give it to me and that record that transaction did not have to be recorded by some nation state it could be private okay so we're doing something new but we're also going back to something old and in this old system in this peer-to-peer system are now peer to contract type system we don't need the institutions as much because why were the institutions put in place they were put in place so that they could protect the people from large intermediaries who had more power who had the ability to manipulate to information Arbitrage to not be transparent they were put in place to help the people and now these institutions are getting in the way of peer-to-peer transactions because they think we still need them in these cases and they're grasping at Power and I think that has to change that has to invert the way we think about these crypto transactions has to be more like the old peer-to-peer model right and less like everything is intermediated through a bank and can be controlled by a regulator and The Regulators have to come back to their mission statement of like protect the people and how do you protect the people you give them access to privacy so third parties like Facebook or meta or Visa or Google can't prey on us and steal all our data I mean Google can scrape the blockchain and figure out what every transaction is right now do we need protection against that from our Regulators yes what are they doing they're stripping that away that's the thing has to change and yeah that's why I tweeted this out yeah that book that I frequently referenced seeing like a state um it gave me this one very big aha moment that made me appreciate a lot more about like how the nation state approaches crypto and that is um it explains why there's this always this antagonistic relationship between the nation-state and Aboriginal societies it's because Aboriginal societies are nomadic they don't centralize yeah they're decentralized right they don't have an address they don't exist anywhere they don't have a serial number they don't have a Social Security number and they're always on the move so how do you tax them how do you reason about them how do they fit inside of like the rigid grid your machine and so what the the nation say it's they're not the nation say isn't inherently racist but it is oppressive towards aboriginals and then also there's probably some racist people that you know blah blah blah blah um and and so like this it just doesn't compute the relationship between aboriginals and nation states like they're they're different languages and this is the same same thing that's happening with cryptographers and crypto systems they don't understand us they don't understand the systems we don't speak the same languages and so what do they do they oppress they silence they coerce and so this is if the whole rule of law system works in our favor we will be able to fight for that but by default it is an oppressive system that we need to fight against agree yeah and we need to spend a lot of time educating and I think that's what that's what a big part of the bank list podcast and the movement is right it's why we get politicians on here even though sometimes those episodes are you know it's like what is this person going to say I generally enjoyed it what they need like we need to engage we need to talk to them all right David what do you bullish on this week so this will be yet another articulation as to why I'm bullish on the super chain but this is a more narrow reason as to why I'm bullish on the super chain there's this growing axis over there between the ethereum attestation service who just did a podcast with optimism governance uh this platform called click and also forecaster is a part of this overall there's this axis of infrastructure that's growing that is helping establish identity in a little bit more of a roundabout way than I think people are typically used to like World coin scan your eyeball will give you an identity right um like there's many many identity platforms say like hey our platform gives you an identity whereas like optimism governance the whole op stack system ethereum attestation Service uh and then all this attestation providers like click they're actually providing you an identity in a more roundabout way more about like they're showing the content outside of your identity they're showing the Contours of your identity without actually trying to ascribe you an identity the way worldcoin is and so I think people are trying to look at what the frontier of decentralized identity looks like they would go look at this axis that's forming over in the op stack I think I mean the idea is that that scales out to every single op stack chain I I think I agree with that there's some cool things that we're seeing that that episode we did recently with ethereum attestation service okay if you've got no idea what that means it's not out yet but attestations are just you know a fact that um you can claim about yourself or somebody can claim about you and it turns out that attestations actually form the basis of this thing the social construct we call identity and reputation and so it's very cool to see different ecosystems in particular I think you're right optimism is really pressing into this formation of an identity and what's different about that in worldcoin is it's kind of like it's after of an identity rather than identity first right so there's like the use case for I I think that's probably how identity happens it has to sort of it's an emergent phenomenon it has to emerge you can't say here's identity now everyone come and get your identity step right up ladies and gentlemen here's your identity the only platform that does that is the nation state and that's because they have a gun pointed to your face yeah they got they got they already built the economy of scale to sort of um roll that out and make that happen and so yeah I think there's some really cool identity experiments going on so ethereum attestation service that episode is coming up soon it's cool it's public not tokens public goodsy and uh that's gonna be a foundational basis token tokenless I'm bullish about this I'm bullish about this idea of a super chain this this kind of structure that we're forming and it was part of the um back of the episode that we just recorded with uh Ben Jones and uh Jesse Pollock from the base team uh that's coinbase based team and um it put like it implanted this kind of um you know image in my mind that I think has already been more present in yours but I I don't know something about that episode really clicked for me I think what we're going to have is with all of these layer twos we're going to have federations of chains I'll call them United States of chains where each each chain is kind of its own state but they're all part of this confederation where they have kind of a an economic zone together and maybe a shared governance layer so I think all of these layer twos are emerging along that path so we'll have like the United chains of polygon while the United chains of arbitrum the United chains of optimism right and that's what they call the school chain super chain that's what they call the super chain and there's there's two levels to this Union that I I wasn't quite broken apart for me until that episode the first is like the social level and the social Alliance and that's very much about governance and a shared tax system and a constitution that all of the chains subscribe to and to me that starts to look like very Nation state-like or very like formation of the United States or the European Union like where you have all of these separate Nations agreeing to a shared protocol Constitution come together to create an economic zone so that's like this and they they have Representatives they have governance right that's where identity fits in by the way uh anyway that is starting to form the social Alliance and then there's also a technical Alliance here where we have shared standards right and this looks very much like um internet you like web 1.0 technical alliances right so DNS domain name services this is a um a governor sorry a technical standards body basically there's all sorts of technical standards bodies that um form the the internet but they're basically a more committee type driven right they don't have any kind of governance power anyway what we're creating in these super chain structures is like almost like a little bit of nation state and a little bit of technical standards body and we're combining that together in a new experiment I think this is the next Frontier of you know biology talking about the digital nation states I think this is that it's what we're creating are these digital nation superstructures and what's really neat hold on biology takes the network State he wants these things to go manifest in real life and buy land the digital nation state that's a bank list that's true that's original that is us yes this is what we've always this is what we've said and this is a and and so what what's interesting is it sort of positions ethereum in a unique place in that I used to think ethereum was was more of a a digital nation state in itself in fact that was kind of the original episode we did about this ethereum the digital nation state and that's true still but also it's kind of a fractal and it's it's more emerging as kind of a birthplace for it was situations well everyone was on the layer one yeah because we didn't have layer twos yes so um ethereum is a birthplace for networks of network States um this is really cool concept I think anyway um that's what's exciting me this week oh and lastly I think that's the structure that's actually going to scale us to a billion on chain users like I think we have it now I think we have the evidence because a look at what base is doing right new people for the first time ever oh we didn't even say you know bases almost up to um a million uh million a million addresses right yeah yeah yeah yeah that's crazy in like two two three weeks yep yeah it's I mean it's just like fractal scaling right how do you how do you get to 10 000 or how do you get to 10 billion people as soon as we get 10 billion people on this planet the only way you get there is fractal growth geometric growth and that is what is comprised inside of these like super chain phenomenons where we have permissionless forking of chains that all coalesce into an economic zone and share The Spoils of each one's Network effects there you go there you go meme of the week David what are we looking at the end of the week shout out to the boys club Twitter they produce some of the best memes about crypto so this is the meme of somebody pressing multiple fountain soda drinks at once going into the same cup and so on the left we have weird unused technology that's being mixed with volatile confusing money and hey that's crypto that's where we are that's a great name guys stay tuned for uh the Moment of Zen as well it's a song by song a day man I think you're gonna really like gotta end with this of course have you wait Have you listened to this song Ryan yeah okay so you have a main feature in it yeah do you want to give a parental advisory warning um it says the f word a few times inter in between Ryan and Adams there's an F word and it's repeated a handful of times wow oh wait no it goes Ryan s f word X of course you got to get the middle name yeah yeah yeah guys we're gonna get to rest in just a second but first disclosure is David and I mentioned a few projects today full disclosure we are Angel Investors to opal scroll and connects we're also advisors to optimism a few other layer twos as well both David and I hold eth we're long-term investors we're not journalists we don't do paid content there's always a link to all bankless disclosures in the show notes or at banklist.com disclosures all right crypto is risky you could lease what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] [Music] Big Red never told me [Music] Kristen Smith Brian quintense and Ryan Sean Adams yeah Ryan Sean yeah oh yeah Thursday birthday please [Music] why are we here [Music] that's right I don't know if you've checked lately but we are approaching our 1 000th approaching it's one thousandth God damn it thousandth one's thousandth God what is going on bro thousands thousand can you say it one thousand it's a thousandth one thousand Jesus dude okay Ron I don't know if you've checked recently but on Apple podcast Bank list is about to hit it's one thousand right you gotta do it Brian I don't know if you've checked recently but on Apple podcast we are about to hit 1 000 five-star reviews so if any of the bankless nation wants to be that one thousandth oh no we are about to hit one thousand five star reviews so this is a call to action for anyone listening to bankless on Apple give us those five star reviews so we can hit one thousand so we can legitimize the bankless podcast and get that top of the iTunes investing in business categories
