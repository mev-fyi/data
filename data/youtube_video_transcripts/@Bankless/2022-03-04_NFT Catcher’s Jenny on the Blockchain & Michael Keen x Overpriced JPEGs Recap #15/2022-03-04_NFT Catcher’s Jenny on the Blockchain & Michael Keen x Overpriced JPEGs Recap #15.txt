[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs and the nft catcher pod if you're confused if you're confused uh it's probably because you're not watching us on youtube right now so you don't realize that i am here with uh what i've been told to refer to as his highness michael mcqueen [Laughter] and jenny from the blockchain i will let them intro to their audience but uh for all you overpriced jpegs listeners hello welcome i am joined by uh these two to help us break down the the nft market of the last week or so and and and chat for today this week's recap episode so thank you all for hanging out with me for this one yes and and to all of our listeners on the nft cadger podcast this is a collaboration episode with carly from the overpriced jpegs uh we both do uh nft recaps and so we figured you know what why not come together and create the ultimate collab episode where we all you know do a do do a recap together on what's happening in the nft space so that's that also uh you can see us uh if you want to actually see us i know we never do video so uh over on youtube what is the youtube channel like where can i bankless youtube i think it's like literally youtube.com bankless uh yeah perfect you put it in there put in the show notes but yeah go go on bangladesh you can see their beautiful faces i forgot we were being recorded i forgot we're being recorded till you just said that well we've had an awesome episode i mean yeah we're talking space doodles invisible friends was a big drop i've got a couple projects i'm into that i want to mention i'm sure you guys do too do we want to kick off though with just like high level kind of macro how y'all feeling about the market this past week you're bullish you think we're gonna enter a bear mark like where are we what do you guys think yeah i mean it's a weird spot for sure there's so much coming out you have to sift through a lot of a lot of you know bad stuff a lot of garbage to get to the really good ones there's still great stuff happening there's still money to be made and there's still really cool things happening but it's pretty saturated like some of the ones that were were super super hyped kind of fell a little short um i mean i st you know it's also a buying opportunity for some things some of the some of the blue chips are down a little bit but uh it's hard to tell exactly where it's gonna go where's the world going right now it's you know so it's a weird spot so i think people are a little tiny bit hesitant um you know just be careful like you know be careful with what exactly you're buying because uh you gotta just gotta be careful all the derivative projects yeah for sure well i was joking last week i i was talking to zenika 33 last week who was on the show and and like there were i think like six or seven it was a little bit less than that but projects that had been like top in volume over the yeah last week's like previous week that i literally didn't know about yeah like and i'm like it's just it feels like it's just getting crazy and like three of them were cat projects you know it's like like tubby cats and you know and so that's sort of a strange position that i i feel uh jenny what about you you know what i feel like i have mentally prepared for all of my jpegs to go to zero if worst case scenario happens like i'm mentally prepared i've been thinking about like you know when is the top of this cycle like are we still going like are we entering a bear market soon like what's happening yeah i think about that um often and you know it's not like i'm trying to scare people or anything but it's like we could be at the start of a market who knows like i don't really know you know but i'm always kind of thinking about that i mean you know um i've said this before but it's like watching my uh top shot account value go from 200k all the way down to 50k it's like you kind of are like okay i need to know that if things go up like a crazy amount that they can also come down a crazy amount so um just kind of reminding myself that you know prices um especially with crypto and nfts you know they're always volatile and it's like um just kind of yeah keeping that in mind like you know i don't really know what's gonna happen or you know okay we have seen a lot of projects decreasing in value across the board a bit um we've seen a lot of crazy things where it's like okay people are clearly just trying to make you know some quick money here um yeah i don't really know what's about to happen but i am just like mentally prepared for whatever um and uh yeah i haven't really been buying too much although i have been putting some weight offers on fungi because i'm so i was gonna have you guys bought anything this past week for example like i feel like you guys both are better at like kind of deegening than i am like i'm not like every week i'm i'm buying into stuff i feel like you guys are like better at that than i am what's your what's your week been like i know i was like looking through my activity i put a ton of offers on on fungus trying to lowball see if anyone wanted exit liquidity um and i mean i haven't really bought much i wrapped my space doodle you know you had to pay i don't know i was like 50 bucks to do that or something um i wrapped my doodle sorry to make it a space doodle which was kind of fun but then i'm like oh now i have to unwrap it and pay more money to unwrap it so i'm just going to leave it as a space noodle for now but um did you all see somebody sold their space doodle not realizing yeah that means they were a bunch of people didn't a bunch of people do that that's what it was like sale yeah it was like yeah they lost like yeah they saw they sold it for five eighth is that what you just said there was let me let me look the lowest yeah the very first sale was a five eighth sale which it's like and then there was a 70th sale after that um and then a 90 and then there were normal looking sales where it's like okay this is similar to the price of actual doodles but yeah it's like people are thinking that this is a separate nft when really it's just you're wrapping your doodle so like if you were to sell your space doodle you're also selling your actual doodle away this was a non-dilutive way to expand the doodle collection without actually like you can express yourself in different ways but you're not actually getting an additional doodle um right do you think if if if you buy the person who bought that doodle for like five ether 17th or whatever who clearly preyed upon somebody who like had a misunderstanding do you think they should return it i mean that that's the moral thing to do that's the thing you'd like to see in the nft space but like i mean how about the ape stick it sold for one eth and you know like and then they've clearly been stolen right yeah they've been stolen someone flips it right or yeah for sure um i mean you'd like to see that happen but yeah somebody is definitely praying they saw it they knew what they were buying yeah i feel like if if that was me i feel like it it depends like who you are if you're if nobody knows you you're anonymous and you buy one like you're probably fine like no one's gonna give you [ __ ] but like if one of us like bought it for five years like we get a ton of backlash and people like you you return that and blah blah and it's like oh well damn like i thought i was just you know why why do i have to return it like you don't but it's like yeah if you're trying to be nice and like okay maybe you maybe you sell it back to them you know for the amount you paid or something i do believe in karma i'm like i don't know come on get your own make your make your money honorably or whatever i don't know go ahead michael yeah yeah you did you mentioned zenika he actually had a really really good tweet i'm a big fan of his i've been a fan of this for a long time uh super smart he had a really good tweet about just that he said if he bought it he would only do it just to give it back to the person at the cost just to make sure no one else did it like you know he basically said at the end like do what allows you to sleep at night you know totally kind of totally yep yep so um let me ask one question before we get into the rest of our call it regularly or you know pre-planned programming call it in terms of the projects we wanted to talk about you mentioned fungi and you're you're putting some bids on there can you tell me like why you like that project like if we know about it yeah we had uh one of the founding team members henry on and and uh he was awesome you know to interview him and everything but i just think uh first of all the art is super cool basically that these animated um really really great graphics like these animated like fungi that are like just walking around these little shroomies and um they're just so cute um and also i just really like what they're doing so they've already given a couple uh air drops to holders which are just like these like cute little i'm just more fun guy and i already am like obsessed with the art so i'm just like oh these are awesome and then um they have some really cool like uh different types of things that they're doing that i haven't seen any other projects doing like there's this whole concept of conjuring um where it's like somebody with like a genesis room has to like start this summoning circle and then you know like i think up to nine shrooms can join in and then you summon a nightshade and then somebody has to sacrifice their shroom for it like it's just this like whole thing and um and you know it's like okay yeah i guess they could just pretend that they're gonna do that but then not actually but they've already delivered on you know a lot of things that they said they were going to do and so um yeah i do believe um the team is is capable of of doing a lot of things and they have a gaming background so uh you know they're really trying to gamify uh this as well and you know they were the first um like you know how invisible friends like oh the walking things well they were like the first like walking things but theirs actually looked like really really good quality it hasn't yeah one of the vibes it gives me um lord of the rings there's like a lord of the rings like like the hobbit like it's like it happens like hanging out in the shire vibe to them that i i think is kind of fun yeah cool they're funny our community actually got really into it jennifer mentioned it a couple times and our community like really caught on to the fun guy also yeah sorry not to get everyone into the non-fungible i just think they're so cool yeah and i'm like i keep putting wii offers i'm like who wants exit liquidity come on like what are they going for right now what's what's floor um so the floor has been like lowering a little bit every single day so i'm like kind of like okay you know what are they gonna bottom out at like are you know how low are they gonna get right now i think i just checked like point one two i wanna say the floor is so i'm like i've been putting like point one uh weave offers on stuff because then it's like if you do a weak offer then you don't have to pay gas so i'm like pro tip yeah pro tip polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their d5 goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and zero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse okay invisible friends do y'all own any no no no we didn't get in did you get in on the whitelist no no i have friends who did but not this cow i had a friend who got in uh was on the allow list i guess sold his pre-reveal for nine eighth and bought a a cool cat yeah i was like yeah that was a good move that's a great move that's a great move yeah the floor is that floor's at 5.5 now that was a tough one there's only 5 000 of them so that's a really you know low quantity compared to a lot of these projects totally i yeah it's it's a little lower than i was expecting i was kind of wondering would this be like i guess we're all now forever more going to be like will this be an azuki play not like the next decision i don't think it's a replacement but like will this be the next project that somehow doesn't have this like sort of significant post-reveal dip um yeah i feel like azuki was like one of the only projects i've ever seen like actually pump post reveal because i i think didn't the beans get up to like 5 8 i want to say or something like that yeah and then it was like it dipped it dipped for like half a second it was truly like you could count in minutes the post-reveal dip and then it was just like whoops i think people were pleasantly surprised by the art and i think anime hadn't been done super well before and i think people just kind of latched on to that and they're like whoa this is cool um you know a lot of people are into anime so yeah zuki did good with that um and i still see people with azuki profile pictures on my timeline so the azuki actually kicked off a whole anime like genre of projects there's a whole souls and and all these other ones that have been coming but azuki they uh peaked up it about 18 or 19 eth and they're down to nine right now they're eight i thought they were still only ten last time yeah and they were at 14 a couple weeks ago yeah yeah um i actually kind of want to get one i'm watching and watching like somebody told me some really good things like they're supposedly gonna really have a nice ecosystem to them and airdrops and and this and that that's gonna be valuable theoretically um i don't know what the bottom is but i mean like i was looking at 12 11 10 and i'm still watching like 8.399 it's really get i mean i wouldn't getting tempting yeah i wouldn't affordable but like it's uh you know it's affordable for mike yeah so i literally interviewed somebody yesterday it wasn't a plan it wasn't planned as an interview but i was like actually maybe i record this we haven't i haven't put it out yet but i might i literally i guess i asked zenika yeah last week i was like dude who do you know that can explain to me why azuki like broke all the typical patterns like i just need somebody to like spell this out for me and he was like all right i got you the guy so uh i hopped on a call yesterday and i was like well [ __ ] like if i'm why don't we just record this we can put it out cause i'm sure other people feel that way like yeah yeah for sure what the [ __ ] is azuki azuki um and the i don't want to like uh spoil the endings that nobody watches that interview but like it was sort of like what you made the point about like anime i mean you had only one force and you had the sevens you had a little bit of this last year but it didn't manage to kind of stay anywhere so it was like the first yeah you know it did capture an anime audience for some reason that felt disillusioned i guess by only force the others so and then i think your point like that post-reveal art people were just pumped about theirs and didn't want to part with them and it's like and then they had good timing like it's sort of like there isn't like some crazy magic bullet that forevermore we're gonna be able to pattern recognize and be like that's the reason yeah which of course it is i crave that i want that i want that answer that's like perfect timing yeah some things are just what is it called like outliers or there's another word for it's like anomalies or something like that like some things are just like phenomenal yeah it's just like it just happens i believe the japanese market actually recently kind of started entering the market more robustly and i think that's probably part of it so i suggested that to my who is now my resident uzuki expert yeah i i suggest that too because i was like hey the asian market also kind of was entering at the same time he was like my sense is that actually azuki's played a little bit more on like the american interpretation of anime like it actually did like that the asian market was still in there kind of phantom like doing fanta bears and zipsies and like there were sort of other projects but that that azuki actually wasn't fully like an asian anime project i'm sure there was some of that but he was like it was actually more sort of like it seemed like americans i was like sort of like our like chinese food you know what i mean like it's not necessarily like asian chinese food yeah it's our interpretation like you know whatever fortune cookies like that's that's not a thing in asia what there's definitely like something kind of weird and racist there too of like the fortune teller or something right um okay wait let's talk about the opposite of azuki's which is pixel mods oh great thoughts you guys have pixelmon takes i mean it's i can't believe that they would actually go public with those images let me let me just in case somebody's been like living under a rock and like hasn't fully tracked this let me just break this down pixelmon pitched itself as this like open world rpg nft game that was coming that's like very like voxel art style and the like you know teaser images they were releasing really were like beautiful it felt like this ethereal world you were gonna get to enter like sweet people are like hyped up on that and the founder and this is where it gets really just shitty was also like saying crazy stuff like this is financial advice like don't do your own research which by the way red flag like if somebody is telling you that right run from that project like that oh my god it's such a terrifying thing to be saying to people anyway and then like and people spend like three it was a dutch auction yeah it was a dutch auction it's sold out right at three three east everybody buys in 70 million dollars raised 70. that's that's really sad actually we're kind of laughing about it but that's really bad yeah it's really bad yeah yeah and the art reveal happens i'm everyone has to have seen this by now right if you're listening to these podcasts it if you haven't like you have it's and we'll get into the meme because like i'm obsessed with the kevin thing i think some of the funniest [ __ ] hits here but we will say the sad thing is like yeah it's it's terrible art it was literally art that he was buying off of like marketplaces where you could buy voxel images like it wasn't even original art he was literally spending like 159 or the team or whoever it was right to buy voxel art and then just like make some tweaks to it to make it fit like their schema or whatever it is really disgraceful so there was one nft that literally the art was missing in it it was just the background like the art hadn't the character hadn't made it in the yeah like it's so disastrous like fire festival level [Music] if you know you know if you guys remember that like iconic sandwich that came out that became the representative of the fire fast festival debacle which was like everyone was given like two slices of like crappy white bread with like american cheese and one slice of lettuce people were like posting that with like the with the uh pixel mons like on that bread um i i have a thought i want to give on the kevin front but i don't know neither of you were bought into pixelmons right we we actually on it was funny because i think it didn't talk a reveal on sunday michael when we recorded it because i remember when we were like like it was before kevin even became super popular and we were just like oh yeah we saw and we didn't think people were going to be buying kevin up but we're just like haha that's funny like kevin like looks hilarious next thing you know starts you know pumps all the way to what 90th floor or something i don't know if there was sales of that i know i saw 7.5 each sale but now it's all the way down to i want to say like two point something or something like that but well there was a sad and i'll give my my just why i love kevin but there was a um i think then the science finders whatever the like project founder's name is he was doing all the shady [ __ ] like being like this is this is the next blue chip like this is financial advice um he was like uh he was like well like the art reveal was unacceptable like we're like putting two million dollars like fixed right like oh so generous like the balls to like feel good about yourself offering two million dollars out of your 70 million raise to fix what was like like really again sad for anybody who bought in especially if you you know you know but there were signs from the beginning i remember you know nft ethics which i think is a great follow on twitter they had a whole thread about pixelmon you know being potentially a rug and a scam before it even launched so like the writing was on the wall like if if people bought into that like that like i don't know i didn't see it and think oh i should buy into this project like i mean maybe maybe new people that got a little deceived because they don't really know like the you know how the standards or or what is kind of more of like a cash grab type of thing versus like an actual good project i don't know but like but like yeah i saw a lot of people talking [ __ ] about pixelmon before these guys were there like nft red flags kind of mini episode at one point and one of them was like if the project is claiming they will be the next board ape or saying they are the next blue chip that is a legitimate teams don't feel the need to tell you that right from the gate like that's weird and you know it's literally what he was doing um okay i'm obsessed with the kind of thing i think it's hilarious i the the threads of like people commenting being like i would die for that like i would die forget like i love kevin so much there's like 98 kevin's right like yeah there's a bunch and and i it reminds me it just feels like the perfect microcosm of the nft space and for some reason the analogy that was popping in my head which is kind of a dark analogy but i live in new york city i was here several years ago when there was some like ied like homemade bomb that went off in midtown like outside of a deli and luckily no one was hurt but literally within like 30 minutes of this bomb like people like stepping over police tape and like craters in the sidewalk to like still just go to that deli like new yorkers did not give up like like if you're in a small town and a bomb goes off like that's you know traumatizing for like but it was just this like perfect reflection of like new yorkers and just like the [ __ ] we see on a daily basis like we whatever we don't even care and i kind of felt that way about the kevin thing was just like we don't take anything seriously like we're you know a lot of very rich people here and we're invited we're immune we're immune and by extension people who will who have a lot of power and will only continue to have a lot of power in this world because money means power and like it's like nothing is sacred to us and like everything can be a a joke and it just felt like this beautiful encapsulation of this space where it's like this ridiculous thing kind of mildly tragic thing happens and like within a day it's just like a meme and we're like pumping this like meme into the it's just i think it's hilarious never underestimate the power it was something yeah people were spending a lot for kevin and uh do you see the time magazine person of the year kevin yeah someone made that and my favorite one is of the home alone the mom yelling kevin that's hilarious yeah i did i missed that one too and then there was a ton of spin-off derivatives like lots of those yeah people of course i mean of course right like it honestly smart like to to then make some type of you know derivative based off of kevin of course you know you you don't really have long-term intentions with that but it's just like funny and yeah you can probably make a quick buck honestly i was just thinking about this the other day if you're you know just trying to make some quick money like now is your freaking time like launch your cash grab while people still like mint whatever and you know people have no standards so like if you're gonna launch some type of cash grab scam now is your time like i don't think this i don't think this time period is gonna last for much longer where you know you can kind of just launch whatever and like you know you can sell out and you know just random people are just made into millionaires um instantly um yeah it's pretty crazy actually if you really think about it yeah i'm personally being really patient with what i'm minting yeah because of that reason like it you know we we've talked about it on the podcast before there's some times where it's time to be aggressive and everything's doing really well and there's other times where you know take your time and and you know wait till you get the feel that something's gonna be really good me sometimes even afterwards maybe you pay a little more but you you get a real project it's the warren buffett be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful you know like things feel all greedy they've calmed down a bit but like things were feeling really greedy and there's still an agreed feel in the air yeah like okay be fearful be fearful yeah um speaking of sort of again i'm now back back and forth from the opposite of this to the opposite that um i don't know if you guys have been tracking star catchers at all i kind of want to get if you if you have or kind of want to get your like thoughts on like wonder pals versus star catcher because i feel like these are kind of feel like kind of i don't know much about either i'd be curious to hear your thoughts because i feel like you you've kind of looked into it yeah i can get i can give them you know these were also kind of i feel like popular projects of the last week very similar art styles very kind of cutesy in that cool cat vein of art um which i you know i know clearly a lot of people end up gravitating towards that for me i'm like another one of these like it's hard for me to kind of distinguish you know so i i don't tend to you know like i didn't mind either i haven't been like you know die-harding for either i will say what what caught my attention with the starcatcher project is they they basically have like a vesting schedule for their founding team so the revenue like 35 of the revenue that's going to the founding team is getting locked up and there's first of all a year cliff so they can't touch that until they've been with the project for a year and then after that it's literally a four-year vesting schedule it's like being a part of a startup and i i thought that was really interesting and um such a good signal that we're not a cash grab i hadn't seen another project do that or i haven't seen one do that and it was like a very clear way to say hey no we're in this for the long haul right um and i was curious if you know if you guys had been tracking that or your thoughts on that or or um if you've seen other projects do it but i think that could be a new interesting standard yeah i i love that and um our uh friends at penelope i don't you know penelope's we'll have to have them on sometime but um but yeah he's i know that like for them it was like they did a whole okay everyone is working here for a year like everyone like signed like a one-year contract at least you know to be working on the project for one year and it's like you know yeah just it's the little things like like that where it's like okay you know they're gonna be working on the project you know for for at least this amount of time and it's like um it gives you a little more like reassurance that that you know they're not just gonna disappear or you know when the going gets tough they just leave um so so yeah i i love that idea though and i hope more projects start doing that yeah i haven't heard that about star catchers i think that is really cool um i think there definitely needs to be more transparency um like before the drop where's the money going to go is all the money just going to go to the founders bank accounts or is it going to go back into the community because it all can be tracked on the blockchain so like they shouldn't be scared to say it beforehand um and uh and wonderpals i've actually seen a lot of people talking about that and it seems interesting i haven't you know quote unquote aped into either of them but um wonder pal seems like it has a good chance it's actually got a solid floor it's over half an east yeah i agree they also seem to have some good partnerships i saw i think betty tweeted out her wonder pals and they they have like you know they they have a wonder pal based on a creature nft and a wonder pal based on a doodle and i i think and i don't want to speak out a term but i think like they actually have kind of relationships those projects you know yeah they seem to have done a very good you know just a solid like marketing job um you know and sort of tapping into existing communities in an authentic way so i agree i think they um i think both of them are interesting projects i just i come back to like with if there's the flood of information you're getting like on the surface i look at these and i'm like i don't i don't know how to differentiate this from from a cool cat or from like a bunch of other projects yeah and it's the hot new thing like i always remind myself that next week there's going to be a new hot thing and the week after that there's going to be a new hot thing and there always will be and there will be some that stand the test of time but most won't most won't stand the test of time no offense to any of the you know even if they have the best intentions like you know most startups fail uh i have a hard time buying into stuff that um appreciates in value so quickly like you know the floor price going up like to one east or something in a day it's like honestly i don't think i've ever spent more than one eat on an nft like i'm more of a i try to buy in super cheap and then just hold on because it's like i don't have a hard time like pulling the trigger and i don't really have that much like capital to work with some i try to just hold on to stuff mostly but it's just like yeah like uh i don't know how people um you know i think with the whole kevin thing it's like stuff that you know is only gonna last a day two days three days and then you know once i have days down like you're gonna just get caught holding the bag it's like i don't know how people actually make money trading and doing stuff like that because it's actually really hard to successfully do i totally agree and i've said this before like i've had a couple of byes above and east and i'm the same way i'm like oh my gosh how can i part with like this much eat it's just i definitely still have that mentality totally where i'm like it's just it's hard which is stupid because a lot of like well no i guess it's it's not necessarily but like you do a lot of the projects that are already you know the some of the biggest gains come when you're buying something at two-week but then you know yeah it'll go to 10. like sometimes those projects like i kind of want to buy a cool pet for like i wouldn't hit them and they're like an eighth and a half i don't know what they're at now are they there yeah they're lo they're last night they were like 1.35 i'm gonna look right now because i've i've been keeping my eye on that too yeah that feels like the kind of thing that very well will likely will probably go higher yeah cool cause it's such an established project it's one and a quarter right now cool pets is down because you know they're having a little bit of tech problems they're trying to work through it and i'm sure they will you know like and i'm i keep reminding myself that the mutants sat at three three and a half eighth for a long time i was so close to buying a mutant at 40. yeah i bought i bought a couple other things instead and for so long i was like patting myself on the back like that's right carly like it's fine my kids haven't done anything and then of course like that weekend they just like exploded like the jimmy kimmel weekend and yeah and i was just like god damn my boyfriend has given me so much [ __ ] for that he's just like hey would you ever end up buying that that mutant i i've been seeing mutants are doing really well i'm like stop it stop trolling me cool pets have that feel you know like i agree 100 it has that community it's like they they have such a die hard base like they've had some tech problems it just feels more like an opportunity than like the start of the collapse of cool cats you know like they've done so they've proven their ability to execute in other ways many a time i think it that's the hard thing too like um if you believe in a project and you and you see it start going up then then you're like oh my god like i feel like i need to buy in like right that's that fomo feeling but then when the price starts to go down a lot of people are like it's like oh i thought you still believe in that project why do you suddenly not want to buy oh because it's going down and what if it goes to zero or something and it's like it's really just um yeah it's like you have to buy when you're not you're not supposed to buy when everyone else is buying you're supposed to buy when nobody's buying and they're you know they're kind of neglecting the project and then you sell what i mean ideally sell when everyone's buying it's like you know if you actually really really believe in something then you know the price decreasing should be a good thing right like you don't you want it to be on sales you can buy it at a lower price um if you loved it at five ethan you know you should really love it at once yeah yeah unless you think oh maybe it'll go to zero but it's like well if you had that conviction you know in the beginning then you know why why don't you have that kind of conviction when it's going down in price but i think that's just like a mental thing um that it's like a lot of people have to go through and yeah it's like getting over that uh barrier and then realizing oh i'm you know supposed to ying when people yang and like you know what you're supposed to do be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy right it's so hard in practice because it is so terrifying to buy when everything's dropping like nobody else is buying it goes against all of our like human instincts to like go away from the crowd you know right [Music] any projects y'all are looking forward to or kind of keeping your eye on what are your like you know what's your okay there's a couple that i uh i'm excited about coming up what's the one uh i like you you're weird have you guys seen that no no that's pretty cool it's pretty cool okay i like you comma you're weird i-l-y-y-w um they have you know they have a cool looking road map they have a ton of engagement it's actually minting on the 7th 7th of march i'm not on the white list sadly at this point but i'm trying to um i think that's a cool one coming up the one i'm keeping my eye on is uh it's meta architects so uh yeah let me they have like i read i read about it it's hard to kind of explain but they're like algorithmically based houses so like the computer makes it they don't have to create each one and they're these like cool things and then supposedly you could even like if you want to end up building it in real life or whatever it is but like you said josh josh was brought on as an advisor so you know i piqued my interest a little bit and started looking into it and they don't have like a gigantic following yet but they're just getting going there's actually one more that i'm super excited about uh do you guys know zayn gaziani he used to work for garyvee now yeah he's on he's on twitter really good guy and he's got this project coming out called chippy's world and it's only going to be like 3 000 pieces and he's got a discord going and he's just he's really cool he does some really unique things i've been talking to him that's one you know we always say bet the jockey and that's one where i think he's gonna do a really really good job he's uh he like he does some really cool things he turns his discord off for the weekend so like you know like people can kind of like go outside with your family exactly and he's just he just seems like a really good guy and like i just with so few of them i'm gonna i'm gonna try and invest pretty good in that one like i just it's one that i have a feeling about chippy's world um i really like him and then i just keep the back of my head says one gary v tweet about it since their buddies like they they communicate on twitter sometimes you know like one garyvee tweet will send it to the moon you know how that happens really that's some good alpha i'm looking at it now we'll we'll show the link in the discord again of course you're on research yeah right i've never never i i people know i hate giving financial advice or i hate like like i always say like i'll tell what i'm doing and why i'm doing it but it's up to you to yeah do what you want right right i really makes me uncomfortable to tell people like i have people in my real world that ask me all the time hey if i have a thousand dollars what should i buy you know like dollar cost into right yeah right i i've bought a thousand nfts and probably like 100 of them are worth something so like you know i've said this before on here it really is like the vc model like nfts are like vc's right like you you you kind of you just need one to hit right because when they hit yeah they usually hit big and then that covers all your losses but most of them are going to be crap you're right you're right and so it's like that's what a vc does you know they bet on a bunch of early stage companies and don't just need one to go really well yeah um how about you jenny do you have a couple that you're uh eyeing so i don't think i'm gonna buy this it's just um you know sometimes i just like to observe things and so uh tai lopez i don't know if you guys know him or any of our listeners so he actually brought a ton a huge wave of people including me into crypto in in 2017 uh early 2018 you know during the local top of the time but it was like which is why i'm like oh my god is this a local top signal that he's launching a project but anyway he's coming out with his own nft project and i'm just curious to see if he brings in a new wave of entrepreneurs because um you know i mean i don't know he i know he kind of um fell off his social media a bit the last couple years like just kind of living on his farm and everything uh buying buying up a bunch of real estate and all that but uh i mean yeah he's kind of making a comeback his his project's called original garage like original garage.com.com i was like watching his video i'm like damn this dude i i remembered how good he was at like selling and like just like talking but anyway um yeah i'm just curious to see if he brings in another wave of entrepreneurs uh similar to like gary vee and um i mean tom bielieu kind of he didn't really bring in too many people but so yeah i'm just like interesting i think i saw nate alex [ __ ] on this yeah did you guys curse on your podcast i realized i've probably dropped yeah every bad word on this one because in my show i don't care but okay yeah um yeah i mean i i think a lot of uh nft people uh hate on him but i just think about uh how he how he really brought a lot of people into crypto and uh i feel like he might do the same for nfts even though yeah his copy can be a bit cringe sometimes in the writings and stuff like that but it's like just that like hard sell marketing kind of guru guy yeah just like the ultimate entrepreneur type of thing where it's like you know how he's posing from in front of his lambos and things like that you know but um what's the what's the what's the kind of pitch for the project is it like is there is it a utility thing social club he wants it to be like oh real world uh utility so there's like three different tiers and and you know really it's just like it'll be like access to his um access to his courses mentorship calls like things like that so um and then he's even um he said he's like buying up uh looking into buying up some hotels where it's like only nft holders uh can come to us i don't know um yeah we'll see what he does with it i mean i'm just gonna kind of uh probably just watch it but um yeah i am i am curious to see how that goes um it it's tomorrow like i said something like i'll be watching and we're recording this thursday this will be friday is when it'll come out so it'll come out yeah it'll be yeah yeah i'm looking at it right now he has 128 000 people in his discord and uh wow well i joined it yesterday and i was um looking it so he has a white list but it's kind of like complicated process to get on it and i was just like oh i don't know about this i wasn't a huge fan of his discord in the whitelist process but um but yeah i mean like i said tai got me into crypto uh you know a couple years ago and so i'm like you know i do i do like him as a person i think yeah he does some cringe things sometimes but um and he's also uh nft miami week or whatever what's that event called we're going to michael yeah and if she weave miami yeah yeah so um anyway that's my any any any projects you're excited about carly coming up or like you're like i have a couple they're like maybe weird one weird ones in in that it's like very atypical which is kind of what i tend to be drawn to like i'm again i'm not like a good dj in terms of like your kind of standard necessarily pfp stuff like there's a project i think that's minting right now i think it's open until next week called um genomes dow and like this this concept is it's awesome so it's basically 23andme but the problem with 23 and me if you guys know like the genetic testing you know company that everyone's into tell them you're from like this village in scotland or whatever they they sell your your genetic data to pharmaceutical companies and that's like a big way that they make money and of course like none of us read the i'm sure whatever however many page you know disclosure thing you sign when you buy 23andme and um and of course you don't see a scent of like your literal dna the most like fundamental thing to you getting sold you don't make anything off that so this is basically inverting that process and saying they'll do genetic testing and they'll send you a kid it's it works much like a 23andme except all of your results go into a locked vault that only you have access to kind of similar to like a you know an nft wallet thing you and then if uh pharmaceutical companies want to access that data they have to request a very specific query they have to tell you what they're querying they don't just get all of it and then if you approve that you get a cut of what they pay to access your data or to access your your genes so i've never done a 23andme i've always thought it was kind of interesting but like never did it yeah and so i love this because i'm like this is a very like you can make a little money off of if you know i can decide i can get the info and i can decide if i want to sell parts of it so they're doing an nft drop that's live right now where if you buy the nft you get one of these genetic testing kits to do the thing and they also have a mechanism where they'll if you give them permission they'll do a couple like select queries on your results that will impact then how your nft looks in the end so like your nft will the visual look of it will be impacted by your like genetic data so i think it's just interesting it's just i love these kind of interesting uses of blockchain it's called genomes dao it's genomes dot io we'll link to it g-e-n-o-m-e-s um and i they're they may have two sites i'll make sure i get the right one because they have one like about sort of the nft part of it and one just about their you know they're sort of a you know the non-nft side of it um so i think that's cool it's minting now i'm talking up to their team about kind of maybe other ways we can like highlight what they're doing because just broadly i actually feel like strongly that you should you know you should be able to if somebody's profiting from your dna you should also have profiting your dna um that's erratic that's radical that's radical yeah right exactly it's all these concepts that you're like that should be so basic how have we gone to the point where that's not and yeah i saw that on your list i was actually i looked into a little bit it does look really cool and i think they're even doing a more comprehensive uh like your full genome rather than rather than just like the the little bits that uh 23andme looks at if i'm not mistaken yeah i can't speak to like the technical science behind it but they do i know they they say that on their website and i've met yeah they're definitely not lying where they're like you know 23andme does this like tiny little like ultimately a tiny percentage of things and ours is more comprehensive um it can even let you know if you're at risk for certain diseases and things like that yep yep totally which is awesome i i will say like i've actually done that i have done some of those like specific genetic testing so i've like yeah like family history of certain things that i need to know like if i'm also a carrier for and so um this i think does have some of that built into it as well which is which is great axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their

your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com a couple others i'm gonna i'm gonna throw out yeah please do matter i work with the team i work with a team called blockblock who are doing this i've mentioned it before on the on the podcast um it's led by by kai turner and a designer named tm who's amazing and kai is an art blocks artist he's also the co-founder of block block and he really designed the concept around matter as an art blocks artist who loves art blocks but is like hey there's other ways we can do something similar in a way that's a little bit more meeting artists where they are so if you're an art blocks artist you have to be very um you have to actually be kind of coding savvy as well you have to be able to code to to produce art for art blocks this is um generative art that based on like layers you know so if you're an artist and you you design in layers you can input your layers into this sort of generative art algorithm that will then produce generative art without you having to like dealt with the coding side of things so um basically they we it's sort of like a we end of they thinks i'm really not involved in it but i do work with the folks who are doing it um they have their second drop happening is live right now with two artists wax bones and rom brandt really talented artists it's like a collaborative uh drop with generative drop with the two of them and proceeds fund a dao in part um that then gets used to invest in like up and coming artists and like you know lift up artists who you know maybe are out there working hard but not getting the recognition or you know aren't famous yet or whatever so very cool dao component that benefits artists along with like just a cool concept to allow more artists to participate in the generative movement and so i love it again none of this is ever financial advice i just i like to celebrate the work that i think is like interesting um and so yeah check that out it's m x t t e r the x sort of stands for a bunch of things but there's this collaborative piece because all the drops we've done have actually been collaborations between artists thus far um so that's happening right now tartarus is our second it's the second drop there and uh yeah yeah this is about the auction going on ends in 21 hours current bid points so every day and for 14 days there's a new piece every day that gets dropped and if you bid on it and you win you you join you get your member of the dow that determines where like this treasury goes like which up and coming artists whatever but if you bid and you don't win you still get you get like this poab proof of bid like kind of thing and then if you collect five of those you you know you get sort of uh like prizes and rewarded just even forbidding and being a part of the process even if you don't win so again like lots really try that's like geared around benefiting participants in the ecosystem benefiting artists like there's a real ethos of that um which is awesome so yeah nice don't love it don't know folks any anything else you're like interested in tracking degenning on researching i saw smiles versus down to 0.9 i i'm kind of watching the floor i want to see what they bottom at i i may or may not try to snag when i know michael's a huge fan and producer has them too yeah yeah we're yeah we're huge fans that one that what do you love what's your what's your pitch for smiles uh well i met and i actually hosted a clubhouse room with waheed and the team from smiles versus about a month before they dropped so that's when i was first introduced i mean he's got an amazing story he's 21 years old he's from afghanistan he came to the us by himself at 16 and he's done collaborations with supreme before his art is super cool him and his team giovanni and uh and i just that one is one that i just know is doing really cool things moving forward it got up to like two and a half feet and then it's back down yeah it's back down to 0.9 for whatever reason it was a while it was toiling it between 0.2 and 0.3 and that's when i was i was telling everybody i could like that's one that you know i really believe in i still really believe in that long term i think waheed is going to be a star um his art is super like i was um he tweeted recently um like four different pictures of of pieces i don't know if he if they're like one of ones or if they're airdropped holders or what the situation was but like he really pays attention to detail like you know it it's crazy like how good he is with these um with these pieces and i'm just like dang like this dude's really good i don't know yeah they look they really well the smiles themselves look really dope and then the art that i saw him do as well was like yep his one-on-one stuff his one-on-one stuff goes for for big money and yeah i saw that tweet also he was like showing i think he was showing like how it started or like and then like the updated version or whatever whatever he was showing there yeah there was a that was cool looking though but yeah he's that's what i just have so much confidence in him in the team they're always around they're always on twitter spaces and they keep doing cool things and it pumps and then it's just it slows down for whatever reason and the lull and that's one like that you know for me i'm pretty confident thinking that eventually it's going to be a 5-10 e project i really think so the reds are one of the rare ones if you go through the collection of like like jenny said the details are are really good like it's just it's just a cool character they were signed by time them and toy boogers at the same time so they're gonna i think they're gonna be putting out children's programming with these characters wow oh that's awesome i'm glad i you know have known of it but really never deep dive yeah i'm really excited to hear all that i will absolutely go do a little bit more deep diving on that because i i like everything you just said yeah yeah i'm a huge fan why he is the star like especially you hear him talk and and learn about him and it's really inspirational he's really he's really awesome are you
