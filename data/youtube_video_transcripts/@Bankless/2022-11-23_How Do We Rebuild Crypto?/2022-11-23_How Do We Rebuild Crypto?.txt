how long will it take to rebuild Where Do We Go From Here well the good thing about the ecosystem now and this wasn't the case back in 2014 with gox is that you know we're much more developed now we have dexes we have many other exchanges that have gone through several bear markets that seem to be reliable over time so I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of like where are people going to go trade and like you know what alternatives they have it's going to take some time I think to recover from kind of like the political damage that has been done here obviously there's maybe 10 billion dollars of client funds that are still trapped in FTX that's going to take some time to recover from obviously the prices are depressed you know as a result of all this as well so I think we're going into an even deeper Bearer Market winter we don't have another Bitcoin having until you know like March 23 I think so you know it's going to be some time and you know I think that's sort of like the next big event that might cause us to kind of like bounce out of a bear Market
