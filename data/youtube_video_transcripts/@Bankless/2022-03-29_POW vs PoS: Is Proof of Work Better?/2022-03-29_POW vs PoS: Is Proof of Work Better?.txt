essentially what you want is something a commodity or an asset that is vast majority of its value is the monetary premium that's an example with say gold where the vast majority of it is held for its its monetary premium and very little of it is used in industry compared to something like oil that is you know entirely for its its utility value and so if you were to go about say designing a blockchain system and he wanted to maximize its monetary properties you would make one where you would sacrifice everything else in order to to make the best possible money and so for example if i you know want to make the best possible fork it would just be a fork it wouldn't be a fork and a spoon and a knife and so when it comes to say a money that is suitable to you know put your corporate treasury in what asset do you put that in and so historically the best one's been gold and so now we have potentially these new competitors that can come in and do it and what would you select you'd select one that is the most decentralized the one that doesn't sacrifice any of those characteristics to do other things
