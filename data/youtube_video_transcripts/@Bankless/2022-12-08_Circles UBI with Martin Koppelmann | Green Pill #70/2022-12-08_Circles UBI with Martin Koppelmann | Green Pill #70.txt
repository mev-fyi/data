foreign [Music] friends how you doing on this episode of the green pill podcast we are talking to Martin koppelman of gnosis and circles Ubi so in this episode we talk about circles Ubi which is a web of trust based mechanism for doing digital identity and then once we have digital identity there then there is a Ubi of uh a Ubi that is distributed in circles tokens so basically we talk about web of trust we talk about circles Ubi in this episode we talk about gnosis's larger approach to building a house of Brands into Building Products which for me is very you know inspirational as I'm figuring out what's next for me after Bitcoin so uh you know Martin's just for those who don't know he's a luminary in the space I mean gnosis is one of the ogs in the web3 ecosystem and it's just really fun to talk to him and hear how he talks about this I'm really great to see uh the Builder of gnosis safe and Cal Swap and gnosis chain also building regen web 3 stuff with circles Ubi and I I I just think it's cool so I think that coordination you will find this episode to be cool also without further Ado I'll give you Martin koppelman of gnosis and circle CBI enjoy coin shift is a leading

to do this episode really excited to talk about circles ebi so let's get into it what is circles Ubi yeah Circle CBI is uh in a way two things um one kind of an identity system but the primary primary thing is it tries to bring Universal basic income uh into the World by creating a new currency of better form of money got it so uh what what is that currency and and how does it work yeah so I mean essentially I guess uh Bitcoin uh came along and uh and um opened up the question or made it um uh made us humans think about what money is again and how um money uh could be designed and obviously kind of that it can be designed um uh yeah I guess outside of a state and um yeah our second CBI um realizes this potential that we can design money different um and says okay what if we bake in the idea um of universal basic income directly into the money system and kind of there are two two arguments for that one you might be convinced generally that it's a good idea uh to um to want the Ubi and then you can either say we take an existing um an existing money system and then somehow have a redistribution mechanism somehow collect money and then distribute it or if you want that anyhow um then you can also directly um yeah kind of bake it into the money itself and that's kind of 0.1 for circuit CBI point two is um that uh yeah with every money system um you might ask why uh why would people want uh want to adopt it and it needs to have a perception of of fairness and obviously um yeah kind of let's say it was Bitcoin you have those early adopters and those are really Keen uh that everyone will adopt Bitcoin because essentially that would mean a huge wealth transfer uh to them um so an alternative perspective is simply saying okay we want something similar as Bitcoin but we want uh to have a fair a fair distribution um of the money and yeah that's another perspective of looking at circles I'd love to to uh to to maybe ground the user in an example of how circles Ubi works and uh oh man I remember signing up for circles Ubi about a year ago when it was really going viral and so I'm wondering if you could if you could talk about that first time user experience uh what do you have to do in order to in order to get the the circles Ubi tokens right so yeah in circles um as soon as you sign up you get one Circle an hour so kind of one Circle represents uh in a way one um one human hour um but circles has this yeah kind of specific um civil resistance uh mechanism and um yeah and that's based on web of trust so kind of the the standard way to uh kind of to sign up for it is um to connect to other people or concrete the interface is designed in a way that you need to be trusted uh by three people who have um already um joined the system and again that's uh that is yeah that is are there two reasons uh why it works that well that way one is indeed a civil resistant aspect but the other is is even more important the other is that money is always or money is essentially a social uh construct if you are on an island alone then money really doesn't matter because money is always uh yeah kind of tied to humans money is only only relevant to humans so humans decide to accept something um as money and that is essentially um what what what this trust connections uh means so in circles actually if you look under the hood everyone individually issues their own um yeah their own specific token so in that sense their own kind of money and trusting each other means um if you would trust me then or if we trust each other then essentially what we are saying is I am accepting your money your personal money and um and you are accepting uh my personal money and to make things um to make things uh yeah kind of ideally uh easy and ideally to be able to abstract away from from the fact that in circles you hold uh yeah kind of you hold very different forms of money distrusting each other means we are kind of making our currencies with with each other fungible by saying we can um exchange them one to one so if you're new to circles you issue your own money kind of uh then then no one no one would accept it but if you are part of well of a circle of a web of trust then within that Circle or within those trust connections um yeah your money or your circuits are uh are fungible and can be can be transferred so we had a couple episodes ago we had Brian Ford uh who is a professor that's been studying civil resistance on the podcast and he was saying that basically in order to create civil resistance you have four options you have uh in terms of mechanisms to connect the system to an actual user you can use Biometrics you can use government identification like kyc kind of stuff you can use presence-based things which is like you're in front of me so I know that you're a human and then the last one is web of trust where I trust you and you trust uh Alice and Alice trust Bob and so there's a flow of social trust and it seems like from what you said that circles Ubi is based on web of trust is that a correct perception oh absolutely so uh yeah it's it's in its in its pure form uh it's completely based uh on on web of trust it is possible to add um to add other uh other forms to it so uh that is yeah not or kind of only experimentally live but we we have uh fee or we have features coming up that you can yeah kind of get additional attestations or verifications uh to your account and that could indeed be um well the other options you mentioned um but at its core circuits is based on this web of trust exactly basically I sign up uh I have to get a vouch of some sort from three people that I know and then I can start getting the token drip so it's basically a mechanism through which the sign up flow is baking in the creation of the web of trust and then once I'm in then we can the system releases Ubi tokens to me is that more or less accurate correct correct cool um yeah so I mean I'm curious um I really have a thesis about a lot of these regen mechanics so okay so first off going from one token one vote to one human one vote I think is a really huge step forward for the ecosystem because it brings more democracy into how we build these web3 mechanisms so I think like that in its own is really novel I found that for anyone to really take seriously any of these civil resistance mechanisms there has to be like an economic mechanism that causes people to care enough to sign up for the Civil resistance like on bitcoin it's like you do all the trust bonus stuff because you want to participate in the grants matching seems like on circles Ubi you um you do the web of trusting because you want to get the Ubi tokens and um you know I think it's interesting to know that there's like um there's almost like two parts to the system there's the Civil resistance identity mechanism and then there's the reward mechanism and you know uh like Bitcoin uses quadratic funding circles Ubi uses Ubi um can you say more about the Ubi end of the spectrum like why'd you guys decide to go with Ubi for this as opposed to some other uh reward mechanism yeah I I would uh go to this question but before that I would also raise uh yeah intention for another aspect of it you mentioned there needs to be economic incentives and yes there is an economic incentive um to kind of sign up to get the Ubi but there's also a very interesting other element of it which I think is missing in many other web of Trust Systems and that is yeah the opposite of a of a reward in a way kind of um a penalty so in in other um obviously the concept of web of trust has been around uh for for a long time uh going back to uh pgb uh pgp and and of course also project like bright ID and they are plenty um but it's not always clear um uh what it means um or kind of how valuable is the information that you are trusting someone so in a way for example let's say on on Facebook uh or on on Twitter you like someone or you follow someone um and the question is how um yeah how how valuable is this information and with circles there is an interesting aspect that if you are um if you are too loose um with uh with trusting people so let's say there's a random telegram group and then people ask yeah please please trust me and you trust them and you don't actually kind of uh yeah well you don't actually verify that it is um a real person um then in circles you are uh yeah you are potentially losing money because um what you are doing by trusting them is you are saying you accept um their circles uh or even more and you are willing to um you are agreeing that they can exchange their circles uh for yours and now um that means as soon as your circles have um have some value um and that can easily be established by you yourself putting up some liquidity for your own personal circles um then by trusting someone else you essentially say that their tokens um again have the same value so now this other person can take now now let's pretend this other person is now indeed a bot or someone who tries to um spam the system and you kind of just blindly trust them because you asked they ask yeah whatever on telegram to to be trusted they can now take their essentially worthless tokens because you can obviously create hundreds of accounts um and exchange them against your tokens that actually have value because let's say you simply put uh put up some liquidity against the stable coin um for them and yeah they can essentially then train yeah or get you you get a bunch of their personal tokens uh and they they run away with with the stable coin and now kind of their personal tokens because others might very well be more careful um and will not trust this person then essentially you end up with circles that you can uh you can't use and you can't spend anywhere in system so uh yeah that's why there are kind of those those two important uh economic incentives there is an economic incentive to get um to get connected and to to build as many trust connections as possible because that means your circles are valuable in the network because there are people that um are willing to accept them but at the same time it's also important to not connect to people uh that are yeah that that where others don't want to connect to because yeah they yeah are fake accounts um and and in my view that's a very uh yeah important additional um dynamic yeah it's really a kind of an elegant design I think the way web of trust works with respect to the the identity system and um it's just kind of beautiful to see people experimenting with these regen mechanisms live in the wild I mean it seems like circles has gotten a good amount of adoption and that you're pouring some some resources into it so you know could you say what it what excites you about about working on this uh on this problem space uh after you've had many other successful projects of course uh but I'm you know I'm curious what what kind of Lights you up about this specific one yeah for sure so um yeah a little bit of the uh his history of circles um we started or launched or kind of the ideas has been around for many many years I think seven or eight years or more I believe uh initially it was described as a fork of Bitcoin because back back in the days Bitcoin was the only thing that existed after many years and essentially ethereum coming along and making it possible to program a system like circles it launched um uh roughly two years ago and indeed um after the launch uh well there was quite significant hype within um three weeks uh roughly 200 000 people um signed up but then unfortunately um yeah kind of they're just it was it was still quite early so there were all kind of technical problems the team was very small it was actually just a two developer team so then kind of after this initial hype um things yeah slowed down significantly um and there was not uh for a while uh not much you could do with circles however now um two years later we are again in the in the um or we are now in a good period to um yeah reactivate or a lot of circles activity so there is a quite active local community in Berlin with yeah kind of weekend or at least monthly markets and uh and yeah quite a couple of places in Berlin where you can buy all all kind of things for circles there is a larger program in Indonesia and in Bali coming up where yeah where there's where there's a team planning a rollout on circles but also um for the yeah kind of for the initial crypto community that mainly signed up two years ago we are currently yeah planning some some relaunch and specifically this idea to bring um yeah bring liquidity behind your own um uh personal circuits what excites me about the project is still the question of um what is a good form um of money maybe uh yeah maybe maybe what's a good decentralized stable coin actually so uh so so far we are seeing um we are seeing all kind of stable coins and also all kind of stable coins um failing um and in circles to me has a promise to uh to be actually a a form of money that is used um yeah in in day-to-day transactions uh but that is deeply rooted in um existing social social relationships so it's not kind of just a um yeah some uh speculative bubble that's disconnected from from the actual economy ideally it's very uh very uh connected uh in yeah well in people so in a way the circles every every individual circle is in a way backed by the person um that is behind this behind that that Circle and so by the by the economic activity this person uh is is doing and of course its Network so everyone who is who's trusting this person that's really what Bex uh every individual Circle it's it's really interesting um for me to think about how powerful web of trust mechanisms can be um and and I think that the reason why I believe that they can be so powerful is that um web of trust is basically how Google invented pagerank and became the number one search engine in the world and a technology giant so every time you go and you uh when Larry and Sergey were writing pagerank they basically realized that any vote any link from one site to another site was a vote for that second site and you know if you distribute reputation points along a web of trust graph and that's basically what page rank is and it's really neat to see that algorithm be reapplied in the web 3 ecosystem as people vote with each other over who has credibility and that creates legitimacy I think for pagerank because you always get the best stuff at the top but with respect to the monetary system inside of circles Ubi there's a similar amount of legitimacy that's bootstrapped there and it's just kind of a novel way of constructing an economy there so I don't know if you have any comments but that's you know for me the bleachers what what is it especially elegant about this mechanism yeah and and I I absolutely hope or we also want to make it easier to uh to use this web of trust graph uh in in other um contexts so I mean there are plenty of applications but one just very obvious one is let's say a rating system uh yeah which currently get gamed all the time uh by um by all kind of uh civil attack and Bot attacks so where you could very well imagine to vote to sorry to wait uh ratings by um the distance of that other person that is uh rating in in your web of trust graph so yeah so it seems like there's sort of an iterative process where uh or or like the attributes of the system is that the Ubi is paid at a a periodic interval it's unconditional right this is universal basic income um it's paid out on an individual basis and it's uh I also see this thing about cash payment there but does that just mean that it's the circles token that people are are getting yes yes working in web3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many

roadmap next what do you what are you all uh planning on doing with with circles Ubi next and how can people get involved in and play with the mechanism yeah so um so as I said this is one um yeah we want to make it easier to uh for for people in a way to Signal they are serious about their own circles um and that is by or kind of one one easy or there are at least two mechanisms to do that and one will be to Simply put uh put some money behind um your own circles um yeah whatever could be uh die stablecoin um and and the other mechanism is of course to uh to concretely offer um offer things um that you let's say you're a freelancer and you are kind of saying I'm I'm willing to maybe not um yeah to to accept circles as a payment for for my work those those kind of things um yeah really really make make your own personal um circuits valuable and and so far um yeah we didn't really offer great ways to to do that so um that is coming um then as soon as those mechanisms are available we uh we are also working on a second concept um to form um groups so the the pure web of trust mechanism is is quite powerful but also uh complex um and and um makes a few use cases hard so you need to kind of remember if if you um if you trust 50 people let's say then your total Circle balance can actually be 50 different tokens of all those 50 people um you trust and and and that makes uh that makes it a bit hard uh to integrate um to integrate circles into well the ethereum ecosystem so let's say even on uh on on git coin let's say some someone would want to accept circles donations then circuits isn't really exactly a specific token it's it's yeah it's it's thousands ten thousand hundred thousands of tokens and again that that makes it just just practically uh harder to deal with it so um and and and the second issue is again uh in a way everyone is individually responsible for um for for making their um their own personal circles um valuable by again saying I I offer for something for it so groups can be um or groups are well are very very human human thing and kind of if you want to uh um yeah get something done like a universal basic income it always relies on on groups so kind of if you are alone on the world you cannot receive a basic income so you will always receive a basic income from from your your group from from a community um so with groups or we we add a layer to circles where um you can simply Define a group and that can there can be various rules so it could be a group could be a Dao where where there's some some process to be to get become a member of the group but a group could also be based on some attestation so a group could be you need to do this um uh this verification process whether it's Biometrics or kind of there's this proof of humanity uh with this kind of or there are a bunch of bunch of bunch of processes to um in each of those uh could be a um a group and now uh we are able to say okay let's say there are a thousand circuits accounts that um that uh all yeah belong to a specific group um then we can uh create um yeah kind of a circles group token that is exclusively backed by the individual circles so essentially it means if you are a member of that group you get the right to take your personal circles and put it kind of into the group contract and and mint at that moment the same amount of those those group circuits so now it's a bit easier simply to to do things like um yeah establish liquidity um or establish simply value or trust in in that um in that um yeah in a way Circle or group circle because again it's now no longer backed by a single individual but by a group and obviously groups can be yeah can be more powerful I guess yeah I I I'd be really interested to see you know how we can how I'm saying we as in the Royal we but like this ecosystem can create interop between all these different web of trusts and reputation systems that are being created the IDS verifiable credentials Soul bound tokens civil resistance is just so high upside for the web that uh it's I wonder if there's a way that the sum of all these systems can be worth more than uh each of their parts and you know by these systems I I'm thinking of all the green pill episodes we've done on civil resistance uh get coin password World coin bright ID proof of humanity all of these things it feels like there's a lot of great experimentation in the area and I can't wait to just see us have more of a one person one vote money Lego it's gonna be really powerful yeah for sure for sure and yeah we are aware of all those other uh and yeah are happy to connect uh as as much as possible uh on this node it's kind of quite a technicality but I think it's an important one uh in in circles we have uh very early on um decided that um uh smart contracts smart contract identities are important um so every Circle user is actually um yeah kind of a noses safe and the important thing here is that um that we believe that is a much more um durable identity than um your private key because sooner or later you will your key might get compromised or you um you you lose your key um so we don't think that is a that's a good thing for an identity that ideally you could use for for your whole life um a smart contract uh yeah allows you to uh well to change the key later to upgrade the key to upgrade the account to have social recovery mechanisms so yeah we see or yeah whether you want to use the word sold on token but but um yeah an identity in our view cannot be a um cannot be a private public key pair truly neat that uh yeah that you're reusing gnosis safe there it feels like there's a strategic complementariness between the different products and the gnosis safe portfolio or sorry in the gnosis portfolio and then probably The Wider ecosystem of money Legos as well so uh I think that that's really cool what um I I guess like zooming out a little bit I'd I'd be I'd be curious sort of I know that you're really involved in gnosis and I know that gnosis has multiple products uh safe just spun out on its own uh do you see you know zooming out do you see uh circles eventually spinning out of gnosis one day also uh is that kind of the model that y'all are uh moving towards is incubating projects and then spinning them out um yeah although I think circles is is an exception uh so with the gnosis we did well initially we we started with prediction markets uh but back then simply so much infrastructure was missing like like a wallet so essentially the the uh the backstory of often also safe is that many years ago we wanted to do a token sale but there was no logistic wallet that could handle tokens so we wrote a multi-stick handle that uh modestik that can handle tokens um and that then later became the north to save then other things like uh count swap uh also were initially meant to or well we wanted to build prediction markets uh there were no really exchanges or decentralized exchanges so we needed to work on those on those first and those two projects then later um spun out of the of noses circles uh is is an exception because on circles uh was never part of gnosis so with circles the only um the only connection is is me um I yeah again came up with the idea of circles many years ago but then a community formed around this idea and when circles was launching uh two years ago I was actually just just on the sidelines in involved and I kind of always tried to support uh the yeah various teams that have been working on or around circles um over the years but yeah it was never it was never knows this project however now there is there is a another connection again and and and and nurses will probably yeah or will probably start start to supporting circles uh more because circles launched on a big yeah two years ago the the ethereum was obviously way too expensive I guess price wise for for a project like circuits right where the intention is you can make a payment you can whatever you can pay your coffee with it um so it launched on on xdi uh one of the few side chains uh available um at the time and yeah uh a year ago noses merged with xdi and and turned yeah xdi into into gnosis chain and now kind of um uh that is actually our large focus on nurses so safe and car swap are spun out and gnosis is now really kind of uh doing noses chain and circles is one of the one of the uh most important applications on noses chain so in that sense um there is now the connection again and gnosis will certainly support the support circuits however it can right it's really neat how your gnosis is kind of incubating this house of Brands uh you know nurses chain nose is safe Cal swap uh circles Ubi and you know for me as you may know I recently left get going down and I'm no longer in a leadership position there and they have their own independent autonomous governance and I think that this like super modularity where you have each product has its own governance and contains scope but there's strategic complementaries between each of the things uh is a really elegant way to build a house of Brands and to just do more than you would be able to do with one large monolith so I'm seeing some parallels between what you're doing uh with with what what we've been doing in in that respect um although gnosis is huge and very successful and so I'm a big Fanboy of yours as well so uh it's neat to see that as an example yeah I hope I hope actually that this model um or what we certainly did then is that all those projects or they they spun out of nurses they often create their own uh on tokens although circuits has no circuits against the exception year but the other is to create their own tokens and I think it's a super well important model then to or model I very much like and would like to see even much more is than those yeah shared incentives and it's actually very easy with tokens you can do those token swaps and you can do you can do bonding curves of tokens against each other I would actually like to see this uh much much more even much much more happening in the industry that um I mean so many projects are kind of dependent on each other we are building this super composable um yeah ecosystem and and I think it's uh yeah it's it's always good to do that as much as possible to have uh yeah shared incentives well I think the uh your hit rate is is really cool uh I I I hope to not be a one-hit wonder uh and not just be known as the get-going guy for the rest of my career and I hope to have multiple hits as well so uh it's it's been inspirational what you've been doing is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say Martin um no I think covered it okay well um maybe a place to end is uh where can people find you in circles online yeah um so the uh website is joint circles um joint circuits.net um of course also on Twitter uh yeah I'm I'm most quite active on Twitter uh copyman k-o-e-w-p-e-l um great we'll have links in the show notes for everyone to click on those and uh thanks for coming on the Greenfield pod to talk about circles Martin yeah thanks so much uh for having me and thanks for for all your work uh in this in this field yeah really excited about the regen future that we're all building together all right peace [Music]
