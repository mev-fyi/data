I'm thinking like 20 24 2025 is when I'm planning my bull market I think it's going to be sooner than that because the second the market sniffs it out the market usually prices these things out six to 12 months before the reality actually even happens so Market continues to go down for a while but then starts to turn in 2023. I think the turn happens in 23. yeah if you ask me I think around mid-23 potentially is when things happen we've been in a bear market now for a year usually bear markets don't last more than 18 months it all kind of lines up even in a tough recessionary environment I mean stocks could go 20 lower from here but nonetheless you know that would put it within an average you know 40 decline is not crazy for a recessionary bear Market mid 2023 and David if kryptos front run that by six months then we already bought them I just want to say Ryan you're running out of time to get your three-digit ether brother
