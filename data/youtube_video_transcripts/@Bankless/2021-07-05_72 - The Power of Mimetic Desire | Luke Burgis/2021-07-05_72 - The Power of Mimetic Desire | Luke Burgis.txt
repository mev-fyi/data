[Music] welcome to bank lists where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an episode really cool lens on crypto mimetic desire what did we cover today we brought on luke burgess who wrote this book wanting the power of memetic desire and this came on my radar when i was listening to luke on hidden forces the hidden forces podcast we had a dimitri kofinas on that is a past episode and i immediately knew that we needed to get this guy on bank list because he's talking about some of these very core fundamental things that we talk about on bank list at times but in a different lens and also i think luke luke talks about it just in a little bit more clear and articulate way the conversation of what mimetic desire is is both important for anyone anywhere to understand but it's especially important in crypto where some of these assets are particularly valued by reflexivity or by group think or by collective psychology um we all know in the world of crypto you survive by understanding being multiple different disciplines this is a very multi-disciplinary industry uh and uh the power of memetic desire transcends all disciplines all academic studies and it applies to crypto in so many different respects and so we brought luke on to talk about and and teach the bankless nation what is memetic desire how does it impact our lives and then we frame it in a crypto conversation in the second half of the show yeah david early on you know we've we've always since we're starting bank lists we've known that memes are important to this entire industry and so early on we did an episode on on memes that was sort of live but it didn't have like a ton of research it was just kind of crypto natives take on on memes right it's just kind of you and i we've always wanted to return to this concept of memes now this isn't quite like this isn't just memes because memetic desire is not memes but it is related to memes and it's almost the energy that propels memes but oh my god it's an important concept like again one of those fundamental concepts that if you don't understand memetic desire you probably don't understand crypto you might think you understand crypto but you actually don't and i'm just like this is an episode that i'm going to think about a lot because the implications aren't just like many things we cover on vegas aren't just crypto implications these are like life implications right and how society's organized implications and like how i'm going to be thinking about this episode because it's going to be one of those things where i start to see it everywhere right and then i'll have to make decisions with this new mental model uh framework and see how i'm being influenced how my memetic desires are being influenced and make more rational decisions as a result but i think this is going to be a key cornerstone episode for you guys and it's definitely a key mental model and concept that we're going to keep returning to you on bankless it is that important right so bankless nation i want you to step into the side of uh the matrix and get ready to pull that cord right out of the back of your head because that's what this episode feels like it's one of those things like if this feels very much on par with our vitaliks episode on legitimacy which we bring up is actually one of the themes of this show also felt like the josh rosenthal episode where we're really just zooming out and and viewing this thing from a very very holistic perspective and that really helps set the foundations to how to operate inside this industry but like you said also just live your life this is just good life information it just also so happens that crypto is also good life information and it applies to crypto just as well as it does life david quick prediction i think luke is going to go crypto native i think he's going to become a member of the bankless nation he's super open-minded about it you guys should stay listen to the end make sure you hear luke's comments when we ask them the question of what do you think uh about crypto super insightful there too all right guys well let's get into the conversation but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in d5 with balancer you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility this makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases balancer pools can make asset indices but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity additionally balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to pre-determined rules such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity at banklist we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t-shirts too much success balancer v2 brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you in v2 idle tokens are capable of generating yield in defy without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancers asset managers balancers of vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost for trading on other platforms balancers mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d5 by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange dive into the balancer pools at app.balancer.fi the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest this is luke burgess he is the author of a book titled wanting the power of the mimetic desire in everyday life read his book so is david luke really came to our attention after his appearance in the hidden forces podcast we wanted to get luke on to explain this mimic desire concept which is that kind of the base of a lot of things in crypto maybe a lot of things in life maybe everything in life actually when you dig deep enough uh and we want to relate that to the bankless journey as well luke it is fantastic to have you how are you doing today hey guys i'm doing really well thanks for having me on man we have so much to dig into because when dave and i stumbled across this this concept of memetic desire we just immediately saw so many things in crypto through which are kind of like different or or could be seen through this lens uh and uh could help people who are investing in crypto buying crypto on the bankless journey in general and we want to kind of divide this into two two acts or two pieces here luke if if you could help us with that the first is we want to understand this concept that is core to your book this concept that you call memetic desire there's another related concept around memes that we've talked about on on bank list we want to like talk about those two things how they're related how they're different and then we want to apply um the lens of memetic desire to some concepts in crypto concepts like money the social coordination game of money concepts like markets concepts like nft these concepts that exist in the traditional world but also exist in an accelerated way in crypto certainly in a digital way uh something we want to understand so that part one and the part two uh you game for that you ready for that i'm game let's do it all right man let's start with this memetic desire what the heck is this what is memetic desire so it starts with mimesis this is the key word mimesis is or mimetic m-i-m so it comes from mime or mimicry so this is different than meme or mimetics which is m-e-m so memetic is just a fancy word for imitation right it comes from the greek word nimistai which means to imitate human beings are as aristotle recognized 2 500 years ago by far the most imitative creatures in the world we are freaky imitators we imitate language facial expressions uh social norms in fact if we're not good imitators things get awkward really really fast so imitation is foundational to what it means to be human so we are memetic creatures that just is to say that we're imitative what rene gerard discovered he was a french academic who wrote did most of his work in the in the 60s through the 80s is that if we're so mimetic and if we imitate all of these other things it would make sense that we also imitate the very desires of other people too so he coined the phrase mimetic desire uh so humans have these powers of abstraction so unlike animals which also engage in imitation they engage in rituals like when one gorilla stands up and beats his chest another gorilla will do the same thing they imitate at the superficial level what gerard calls the level of representation they can imitate superficial things we can imitate interior motives and actions and things that are go all the way down to the level of desires like we can intuit what other people want and we imitate them almost always subconsciously so other people's desires legitimize and give social proof to our own and make things valuable or less valuable now there have been crazy studies about this like babies that are 18 to 18 months old to two years old can look at an adult taking some action and intuit the motivations or the desires underneath the surface level of the adult's action and then imitate the adult's desire not the adult's external action so one of the famous studies with this was in an adult goes into a room full of very young little babies toddlers and he's got like a toy dumbbell and he starts to pretend like he wants to pull the styrofoam ends off of the dumbbell but he kind of fails and he can't quite do it they leave the room and nine times out of ten the babies pick up the dumbbell and they know what the adult was trying to do they just immediately pull it apart so our levels of imitation go very deep to abstract desires of other people and we're constantly reading and taking social cues based on what other people want and allowing that to influence what we want but that is almost entirely pre-conscious or subconscious so gerard identified this mimetic nature of the human person it's just how we are we're just memetic creatures biologically this stuff's hard wired in it's also hardwired in and we know that our brain has mirror neurons in it so when we see somebody else do something like eat an ice cream cone the neurons fire in our brain that would be the same neurons that would fire if we were eating the ice cream cone so you know we we see external things and it triggers this memetic response neurologically and and does things and and kicks hormones in in going so yes i mean this goes down to the level of a biology it's hardwired into us the difference between us and animals is that we have these powers of abstraction so we're talking about things like crypto and lifestyles and career goals um it also comes into play with these things too and that's where it gets really interesting i think a really important point and when ryan ryan did the intro he talked about how mimetic desire is a heart of the heart of the industry that we operate in the heart of crypto but then also zooms out and it's actually at the heart of everything i think it's a really important point to to drive home is is that babies when they are born at day zero they are geared up to do one thing really above just beyond like living and having a beating heart is to see what other people are doing and try and distill down as to what their goals are what their objectives are and so if there's one thing that babies can do when they come out of the womb is that look they can look at other people and understand at a very deep like subconscious level the goals and intentions of others and that's actually one of the ways that babies and and young people like growing up that's the scaffolding that they have to become a human being is that they they use the understanding of other people and what other people want as a way as a model for operating in the world and so the fact that it comes out at day one indicates the the how far down in the basement of the human brain this this effect goes and therefore naturally because it's because it's at day one of the human body and the human brain of course it's in every single thing that we talk about and discuss as as adults and to some degree it's also suppressed like it's not really a conscious thing that we we see as adults it's just something that we act out and it's uh and this is why naturally uh you came to onto our radar when you were on the hidden forces podcast talking about the hidden forces that dictate the world it's this this power of memetic desire is the substrate that we all live in it's the air that we breathe it's the water that we swim in yet we don't really identify it really anywhere it's the base layer it's it's layer zero um and we can talk about that later because i think there are some other layers and we can't really understand the other layers until we understand layer zero and two interesting points on that you say from day one babies are imitating it's actually from like t minus three months we know they're imitating during the third trimester while they're in the womb they can hear the intonations of their mother's voice so the second that they're born they're already imitating the way that their their mother spoke in their cries so chinese babies cry differently than german babies because it's a tonal language and german isn't quite so tonal so that's how deep it goes even before they're born they're imitating from the womb from the womb and we know that here's another really interesting point about this babies imitate facial expressions and follow the eyes of their of their parents from the minute they're born but they only do that with humans they only imitate humans not uh robots not animals they seem to sense that oh these people are like me and are therefore worth imitating i think that's a fascinating point that we we somehow like mimesis or mimetic desire is something that actually connects us together as human beings yeah that that point's super interesting a book we we talked about a lot on bankless is uh yuval harare's book it's called sapiens right and he makes the point that like the thing that separates human beings from animals is our ability to coordinate our ability to share mental stories themes tell stories but ultimately our ability to coordinate that is our superpower and if you think about um you know mimetics and our ability to to mimic that is something that uh is incredibly powerful it's given our species the ability to socially coordinate at levels the animals the animal kingdom does not have that is the cornerstone of all of our technology from social technology to like hard technology to things like the internet to everything that we've built up over time this is a power for humanity if you will but it's also kind of like a to use dungeons and dragons terminology it's kind of chaotic neutral because it is a power but it's a power that can be used for good things uh but it's also a power that can be used for bad things for for tearing down is that sort of how you see it as it's just a superpower that humans have we have to recognize it but like whether it's good or bad is kind of dependent on context that's a great way to think about it it's a double-edged sword i think we have to have like a real ambivalence towards memetic desire because it can be used for good and it can tend to lead us into conflict and rivalry when we don't realize that it's happening so yes it's an incredible power it's kind of like the sexual powers right uh they can be used for good they can be used for for bad they can get people into trouble like pretty much most of the human faculties that we have can go and can go in both directions and the medic desires is the same thing how come this doesn't show up on maslow's hierarchy of needs than luke maslow's hierarchy of needs is interesting so you know maslow didn't seem to be concerned with the he was focused on human needs and i don't think he understood the universe of desire and and kind of the structure of human desire that rene gerard identified um if you look at maslow's hierarchy of needs it assumes like a teleology right of like things that a human needs and we just kind of like once we once we knock some out we just kind of move on to the next ones and there's this very like clean progression as we move towards the top but in 2021 2021 you know we live in a world where it's really dominated less i mean there's there's more models of desire as gerard calls them than ever before so we have to take a step back because i i don't think i can explain the difference between maslow's hierarchy and gerard's non-hierarchy of desire without understanding like the way that that gerard said desire works and by the way for those that aren't familiar with this i just bring this up because this is kind of psych 101 stuff you know some of you listening probably learned this in in high school as well but maslow's hierarchy of needs is like just this triangle the base layer of the pyramid of the triangle is psychological uh no physiological needs like food water warmth and rest that sort of thing and then it kind of scales up to things that uh are less basic needs and more psychological needs and more kind of you know self-fulfillment but nowhere on this chart do we see mimetic desire and i'm kind of curious why so continue the story sure i mean memetic desire permeates every single block on that chart all the way from the bottom so when we start at the bottom we're looking at things that are heavily instinctual so we have kind of a biological physiological basis for things like thirst and hunger and warmth and security so those things are the bottom of the pyramid think of it as like our body has things like built-in mechanisms built-in signals that tell us what we need so if we're dying of thirst in the desert our body just has built-in mechanisms that tell us we see water we're going to drink the water even if we're alone right it's very simple as we move beyond the world of purely instinctual responses into the universe of desires think about lifestyles and career choices and abstract things like stocks and crypto um and and just just the world of ideas and desires we don't have the instinctual basis anymore we we lack that so like how do we choose one object of desire over another gerard's finding his really important discovery is that we find them outside of ourselves we don't have the built-in mechanism so we have to look externally to find the signals and we find them in the form of other people or groups that model desires to us and signal to us what is worth wanting and what is not worth wanting so these are called our models of desire they basically generate and shape our desires for us this is very different than the way we normally think of our desires we think that i think in our hyper-individualistic world and hyper-rationalistic mindset we have this idea that like we generate our desires on our own or we want something purely based on our objective rational analysis of the qualities of the thing itself and that's denying kind of the social process that we're all embedded in and the way that we look to other people to help us value things and and to understand whether or not they're desirable now when it comes to maslow's hierarchy this this memetic desire has seeped into every level of it so i don't want to pretend that okay there's certain needs and then once we fulfill the needs then we move into the this world of desire it's not like that i mean look at today water itself it you know we typically choose the water that we drink largely based on mimesis it's not just like there's water now there's 50 different brands of water all marketing like different properties like how do we know which one to want so like even the things that maybe used to be more uh let's call it instinctually driven are no longer that way like mimesis has pervaded every single part of that pyramid so most of that pyramid are not needs at all i mean they fall more into this structure of desire that gerard was describing and you know that if you look at the pyramid it would seem as if one could move up the pyramid individually without anybody else but that's not the world that we live in we we live in a world surrounded by other people modeling desires to us all the time so i think that pyramid is not a pyramid at all it's basically a pandora's box after you get past the first two levels especially you can just lop off the top and we've entered the universe of desires i think the context of being in a 2000s era world really changes up the role that maslow's hierarchy really offers us like maybe if we go back 5 000 years and we talk about like do you have water as in like do you have access to a stream that you can drink water from or else you will die and then also if you talk about clothes and shelters like oh do you have like the height of an animal on your back and also you found a cave like great like you've got you've knocked down those basic things off of off of maslow's hierarchy in 20 in the world of 2021 like most of these things are largely taken care of for us at this point and so now now to what you say it's like no it's not about having access to a stream it's now do you like voss water or do you like smart water or do you like dasani and then also carbonated man carbonate all the way topo chico i'm a topo guy and but then also with clothes on our back it's no longer just like oh i found like the height of an animal to keep me warm it's like oh there's a fashion sense that i particularly go for and fashion changes every three to six months and hairstyles change and just you know culture changes and as a and really what mimetic desire is is this game that we all play is like oh you you're picking that so i'm gonna pick this so you're gonna pick that so i'm gonna pick this and all of a sudden we have fashion trends and hairstyle trends and different which is what culture ultimately becomes uh luke does that vibe with you it does vibe with me i mean i heard one person put it like this for the first time in human history we're no longer struggling with scarcity or having to cope with abundance that that's one way to sort of abundance we're having to cope with abundance so we're no longer struggling to survive and struggling over scarcity i mean there are still scarce things and memetic desire creates scarcity by the way but for the most part you know we have most of our basic needs taken care of and the challenge for us is coping with abundance and that's where mimetic desire really goes into overdrive coping with abundance i love that line and that i think the way that we are coping with that is that maybe mentally humans are like okay we have all the 50 different types of water but what's the most desirable water what's the most desirable fashion sense and so even though we are in this land of abundance it seems like mimetic desire is actually trying to reintroduce scarcity back into really abundance because that's the game that's the game of mimetic desire i think that's right and you know there's a there's a thousand different altcoins and crypto assets to choose from it's overwhelming right like what's the signal through the noise and memetic desire uh seems to be playing a more pervasive and a more important role in today's world than ever before because of this very thing you know because we we do live in a world of abundance it's less clear what's desirable and what's not and the objective criteria i mean there are objective underpinnings for you know whether things are beautiful whether things are true or desirable but we all know from having spent some time like in the investment world and just as human beings um in in our romantic life and in all in in politics that there are all kinds of other things going on that influence why people want things and mimesis is really the hidden force that i think once you understand what mimesis is and how it works you start you can't unsee it you start seeing it everywhere around you especially in the markets yeah absolutely i feel like that's so true you do start to see it everywhere and i want to just make sure that this point is underlined this this hidden force as you say this thing that underlines everything with with the things that we want individually and desire individually but also the things that we um desire collectively are not our own so it appears this way it appears that i like this certain paint color on my wall because i'm the sort of person that likes that that pink color it's my choice or i drink this specific water or i buy the specific cryptocurrency what you're saying what mimetic desire is saying the theory of of the medics is basically like no you didn't make any of those choices the clothes that you're wearing the vibe the way that you're talking the accent that you have everything about you is mimicking those around you other humans we we're not individuals in this world we're part of this society this collective group of humans that we mimic to one degree or another and therefore this is the sobering truth that you're bringing to light is our choices and preferences and desires and wants aren't really our own this is what you're kind of unveiling this is the man behind the curtain i just want to make sure that that's underlined for folks how would you put it i would put it like this that um our desires are not individual our desires are interdividual and one of gerard's collaborators coined the term interdividual psychology and he's saying we can really only understand psychology um at the end individual level like not just as every as every person is like a stand-alone mind we can only understand psychology in a relational context right to bring other people into it so like if a husband goes to a psychotherapist the psychotherapist can really only understand his psychology if he understands the relationship with the wife right so it's where it's interdividual psychology here's one way to think about it what what gravity is to physics mimesis or memetic desire is psychology that means that it is a this relational force that that desire is sort of generated in and through relationships in the space between people not like ex nihilo from from ourselves and that's a really important point so i think you said it very well that a desire is social and desire is generated and takes shape through a social process now one of the first questions that a lot of people ask me is like i'll frame it in crypto terminology blockchain terminology okay like then what's the genesis block here right like like is it is it turtles all the way down is it memetic desire all the way down yeah jack butcher and i actually put out an nft called memetic desire all the way down um just like poking fun at this concept so i guess if you're a theist you would say that the genesis block of desire is god um if you're not a fiest then the genesis block could come through some stage of evolution right um you know 2001 a space odyssey like sort of depicts in the beginning of that like there's just like innovation and and so we could admit that like yes some people can do things that are then imitated or copied um but it seems like desires are kind of spread and passed down through the ages through some process of of imitation their derivative you can even see how that works in a family right like that the desires of parents very often get passed down to the children um so that's you know it's a little bit mysterious but i think we can just look at our own experience and if we if we look at a lot of the things that we've wanted if we look hard enough we can usually find some hidden model somebody or something that gave us the idea or planted that desire in us in the first place so we can see animals having nomadic desire we've brought this up so far in the conversation and but animals just have a much more uh blunt version of mimetic desire and so you know you could theorize that when we were apes we and we still are apes lord to a very significant degree that we were participating in the same mimetic desire that we are participating now it's just that now that the human brain has grown so much more complex we are able to dive into much more nuanced levels of momentum desire so perhaps mimetic desire goes back down to life itself right and maybe this is an it's an interesting time to bring up the subject of memes um but before we do that i'll give you a chance to add in any any thoughts luke well i think this is a great time to actually talk about genes and and and talk about biology and the difference between genes and memes and memetic desire so i think we have layered thinking is really important and i think that the best way to understand this is looking at a few different layers so let's just start from the beginning just real quick like what what is a gene a gene is a self-replicating unit of biological information that is stored inside of a chromosome right and and it replicates it's got some code it's like make more of me that's a gene so a meme this is a term coined by richard dawkins in 1967 in his book the selfish gene uh he coined the term meme intentionally riffing off of the biological gene and a meme he's trying to find like an analogous uh situation for ideas and and and non-organic things and he coined the term meme in that book uh susan blackwell expounded on it in the in the 80s and 90s so what is a meme well a meme is not a unit of biological information it's a unit of cultural information that is stored in a in a human mind or in a human brain actually where it's stored now is really interesting right because we have like second brains and extended minds and memes can be stored on the blockchain you know what i mean like so i literally have a folder on called memes on my computer it's right so it's just i have purchased the memes [Laughter] it's a it's a unit of cultural information that is stored somewhere and and and it's self-replicating right and is and it's passed on but so what's common to both of these things is like the role of replication or imitation and the way that they're spread and they both have to do with information right so so a meme is about like a stored unit of information um so information on its own doesn't really have much meaning right think about it like if i would have said the the meme brexit to you 10 years ago you'd be like what the hell does that mean i mean it's like is that like a k-pop band or something like it wouldn't have it would just wouldn't have mean it meant anything to you right but like brexit is a meme that represents think of it like short code right like like shorthand it represents a bunch of desires it represents rivalry it represents like that it represents a culture it's a very compact unit too like even like like mega right make america great again that is a very compact unit of like four words that just contains four letters so much culture four letters excuse me exactly which culture well that's a really important point crt meme okay like these things are like uh what a meme does is like concentrate memetic desire and concentrate people it's like a it's like what a laser does to light like like a meme is incredibly powerful right it represents this whole complex set of of desires and things and rivalries so my point is that memes emerge from from like from culture so there's like a there's a level before this like memes this is not the base layer and what i propose is that the the the base layer is is mimesis and like human desire is is like the base layer layer zero right before there was language people were wanting things there was desire there's this social process out of which culture emerged so so culture and memes are kind of like uh layer one but you can't really understand that without understanding layer zero which is memetic desire and the social hidden forces like we know this we know that pre-lingual babies uh are are a have memetic desire they they fought they do gaze following joint visual attention with the mother the mother looks at something they want something to right so this is that's the base layer layer one would be culture when the memes come out of the culture and they don't make sense without it they don't have any meaning and then layer three i would say is like the app like like an application layer right it's like it's like the way that that we um apply memes and and various things to bring about outcomes so like there are application layers in politics where like memes are created to represent a certain group and then that meme is either attacked or or it's boosted and so those in my mind and this is kind of complex i have to like write a sub stack about this but those are the layers in my mind yeah i always feel like you're like so the app layer is something that we would refer to on on bagless that you're talking about it almost becomes like the um the institutions right like some of these memes end up in like legal code and institutions and like you know um technology like money is maybe an app layer on top of layers of mimetic desire and then memes i i was trying to get my head wrapped around this because it's difficult because mimetic desire and memes uh they're spelled differently right and they're kind of related but they're also different so i was wondering if you'd agree with this luke when i was trying to wrap my head around what's the difference between what you're talking about memetic desire and memes and like what are some of the similarities so a meme is that unit of information that that idea or that unit of desire but its memetic desire that really gives uh the meme life that's the social force that's like the the energy that propels a meme into existence and without memetic desire the the unit of information that you have the idea that you have that's encapsulated in a meme just dies it doesn't get propagated doesn't get pushed out through society it just kind of is out on its own has no energy and it dies but the successful memes are really propelled and pushed through the energy that is like memetic desire that's what pushes it it's almost like memes are the what but memetic desire is kind of the the yes and the how around this yeah well i think that mimetic desire is the missing part of fully understanding memes i think they complete each other i think it's really important to understand the relationship between memes and memetic desire i totally agree with you that memes are like the what they're like the information but they don't describe the how like the behavior the energy that actually does anything and dawkins himself was was not i don't think he really articulated how it happens i mean meme theory by the way is like it's it's sort of controversial i mean there's a lot of stuff that hasn't really been figured out um and i think one of the missing pieces there was memetic desire like humans are the carriers of memes and humans have memetic desire we're mimetic creatures and understanding how the behavior of humans gives life to a meme and allows memes to spread is really important here's another important distinction between mimetic desire and and memes memetic desire is the imitation of desire it's not the imitation of a thing it's the imitation of desire so we're imitating people so we're not imitating like a what we're imitating a who and that means that mimetic mimetic desire is more volatile if the if the person so we're imitating their desire and their desires could change and since we're imitating the person and not an idea as their desires change our desires change too so this is another another difference is that we're talking of the difference between information and imitating and replicating information and then imitating desires and and that's where memetic desire is in a way more chaotic and more volatile it's like um it's like looking at a flock of starlings right and and like it's still mysterious like how they change direction like the murmuring how it happens and we know like it's probably due to the seven starlings closest to one of them is what determines how they move but we're still not entirely sure so the movement of desire i think is just there's far more complexity in that system than there is in just looking at memes as discrete units of information so the to keep on going with this metaphor there's more people's genes are largely dormant uh and and we have way way way more inactive genes in our dna than we do active ones and depending on what environments that we put ourselves in some genes will deactivate while some genes will activate right well the reason why we have so many dormant genes is that when we go into our particular novel scenario we have the genes that are ready to help us adapt to that novel scenario we just have to activate them and so when it comes to this game of mimetic desire which is largely a game being played at the psycho-social level like it's your brain connected to my brain connected to ryan's brain connected to the people that we engage with all these brains as like a mesh network this coordination game of who is everyone's looking around is like who is wanting what like what do you want well what do i want does that mean do i want that thing and all of a sudden the activation of a specific meme or gene or whatever is activated by and and and and yeah activated by this this psychosocial game of mimetic desire and so we have all these potential there's infinite level of memes out there like like ryan said all a meme is is a little kernel of information there's infinite levels of kernels of information but it's the mimetic desire that actually decides to activate one and the reasoning for why something gets activated is largely kind of just like a complete mystery which goes back to the the whole murmuring metaphors like we don't know how or why starlings change their path or behavior but they do and they do it in a coordinated way when you look at it from a bird's eye view and another another metaphor or anecdote that i have as i was watching a youtube video i shared it with you luke you know what i'm talking about um about these uh the ways that like the universe just tends to like sync up with some way shape or form and there was a video of people in some concert hall and they were clapping at the end of the show just random clapping as random clapping does and at some point in time it just flips into synchronized clapping and so everyone's a complete chaotic mess and then all of a sudden everyone's clapping on the same beat and it just happened completely organically completely randomly no rhyme or reason no one coordinated this all of a sudden the human brains the psychosocial level layer just synced up and all of a sudden we're all engaging the same pattern of behavior because that's what humans do yeah i mean we see this at um you know like at raves and and that like there's certain circumstances where like people just seem like really in sync with each other and that's why i kind of like to describe the way that desire like moves between person to person it's not really a rational process it's more like an energy it's more like it's it's caught by contagion um you know the word contagion really comes from you know the latin root of the word is is you know contact right to be in contact so when we're around somebody it's sort of a function of proximity so absolutely i mean this is not to say that there's not some objective qualities to to things that are out there um you know i think like i think of like nfts right and and like i think some some i can look at and and i'm like this is has some objective value maybe it's tied to a physical asset or it serves some some purpose or like it funds some like social good or whatever and i think i can make some distinctions there so it's not to say that this is totally random but there will be a first mover um and if the right people sort of move second and third and fourth and fifth uh mimetic desire has let's call it like an amplification effect in terms of it which almost shapes the perception of value i mean value is largely it's subjective right value is subjective so like the memetic desire shapes the perception of value and then initiates a a positive feedback loop a reflexive process through which the the more people join this the the more the value increases luke can i like so i i don't want to jump into act 2 yet before we're ready but can i just like illustrate this point with because nfts are just such a perfect example of memetic desire that i know our listeners would be familiar with um have you ever heard of a crypto punk luke yeah these things are yeah okay so these look like um when they first came out i thought these were just stupid like to be honest right i mean it's just like pixels of a face like okay cool i could buy that but like who cares but my um model of crypto punks has completely changed probably within the last two years and the reason is is because crypto punks are being used more and more as sort of a social status signal in a culture that um i am a part of and that i like so large you know venture capitalists or people who are in defy circles d5 degens or like crypto natives that i respect and i like and i appreciate hanging out with and that listen to this podcast they have these crypto punks right jay-z just changed his profile shot to a picture of a crypto punk and my world view on these things has completely changed they've gone from like insignificant like pixels to oh my god i want this like i don't want a rolex i don't care about that i don't want a porsche or a lambo i don't care but i want a crypt i want my own crypto punk and how much will i pay for that i don't know but this is what you're talking about is this is not something that i natively want that came up through my maslow hierarchy of needs biology like yeah i just thought that suddenly one day i woke up and i wanted a crypto punk i'm doing it through mimicry right it's because i want to copy all of these people that i like and respect and that are part of my my social group so is is that right is this just like memetic desire happening in um in in crypto world yeah i mean what what are they going for these days is like some astronomical 35 000 yeah each for one yeah yeah i think they they differ right like depending on the qualities of the crypto punk so if i understand them right there are some objective qualities that you know are part of the narrative about why some cost more than others right right right but yeah each each one has their own property some of them are smoking a pipe some of them are aliens some of them are zombies each one has their own property list and each one can have like two properties or six properties and there's there's very much this coordination game as to like there are some properties are just more valuable than others there's no rhyme or reason as to why right right so i mean in this case i think you know it's pretty easy to see that mimetic desire the imitation of desire has created the scarcity that has driven up the price of the crypto punks like they wouldn't be the fact that the pixels on the screen we consider extreme extremely scarce goods that that very few people can afford is itself a product of memetic desire so there's like objective scarcity there are things that are objectively scarce in the world right like water in some places is objectively scarce and then there's subjective scarcity and i would say subjective scarcity is usually the product of memetic desire it's only scarce because we want what other people want and that's i think it's an important distinction to make luke i think it's about time that we get into act two of the show because we're already starting to dabble with it but first the last topic that we need to cross off the list before we get there is the concept of a rivalrous desire because that's where i think we really introduce the topic of scarcity can you walk us through rivalrous mimetic desire is that what happens when david and i want the exact same crypto punk so what happens that's exactly what happens yeah so so gerard thought that you know rivalry was at the heart of the human condition was a fundamental principle of human behavior that we don't acknowledge enough we don't like to think that rivalry is pervasive throughout the world but when you when you realize that rivalry is largely a product of memetic desire you start to understand why and you see how how much rivalry drives decisions and can be explanatory for decisions that on the surface like aren't rational or don't make any sense right like why would this political party like do something that doesn't seem to benefit anybody well the answer might be because it hurts their rival while also hurting them at the same time and that's like a satisfying thing right so so rivalry so how do we get to rivalry and like what does rivalry have to do with memetic desire it's pretty simple step so rivalry is like stage two of of gerard's memetic theory and it's like memetic desire is at the heart it's the fundamental nature of human desire so humans look to other people to understand what to want and we imitate their desires we want something because they want it that's an important distinction to make too it's not like we both happen to arrive at the same object randomly we arrived at wanting that object because another person wants it okay and it endows that object with some like almost magical sacred value like you can imagine the settlers going out to the west you got two guys that like come on nevada for the first time and one of them just runs over to a certain plot of land and is just fascinated with it and thinks it's just the best plot of land he's ever seen the other guy's got the whole state but because that other guy who might be five or ten years older than him is really good at what he does really thinks that this one is special because of that the other guy becomes fixated on it even though if he just turned around he'd have you know 100 000 acres to play with luke do you ever watch have you ever watched like uh babies like play like you know it's 12 months old or so to 18 months old um they'll be like sitting in a in a circle they'll be like piles of toys kids have tons of toys right all these toys and they'll pick one up uh and immediately the baby sitting across from them the little kid sitting across from them with all of these toys on the floor that they could pick from they don't want the toys on the floor they want the toy that the other child just picked up right that's what you're talking about this is the hardwired biology that's with us from like birth even before birth that's what you're talking about that's the rivalry i only want this thing because you have it yes i mean if you look at the classic girardian example of this is a room full of toddlers that have more toys than than any of them could possibly play with the minute one of the children picks up a toy and shows enough fascination with it without a doubt a second child will all of a sudden forget about whatever he cared about before and become interested in that toy and because there's now a second person who desires it there's definitely going to be a third kid and then the third kid makes it easier for the fourth kid to want it and before you know it they're fighting over the same toy and they'll have a hundred all around them now why did that first you know cute little girl pick up the red fire truck in the first place when she didn't have a model well it could be because like her dad is a cool fireman um so you know he's her model or it could just be because the color red like really made it stand out because all the other toys are dull right it's like why certain birds are attracted to certain flowers right so there could be some fundamental base like even a biological basis for that but once that happens the mimesis kicks in and medic desire just naturally leads to rivalry if you think about it you know because we're imitating what another person wants we've naturally made ourselves rivals to them in the sense that they're now an obstacle uh for for our possessing it um because we want the same thing so if the fundamental nature of human desire is memetic then there's some principle of rivalry at the very heart of the human condition especially because we normally don't realize that we desire things like this and we kind of just go through life perpetually um we're kind of like obstacle addicts okay in the sense that uh if somebody else doesn't want something we begin to doubt whether it has a lot of value so we kind of are always looking for people to to want things and that just causes us to to to have um you know to kind of constantly be looking for new rivals right and if we don't have one it's an uncomfortable place to be sometimes okay so we've established memetic desire i think we have a firm understanding of that we've talked about rival risk desire now here's the bridge from act one to act two that i think is important before we get into the crypto concepts that is this we now have this new technology that is called the internet um crypto is kind of act two on the internet we would say but act one in in and of itself is a communication protocol now we have social media we have this global communication platform we have influencers on tick tock and twitter and instagram and all over the place what impact did the internet or does the internet have on our memetic desires does it accelerate it is it like a steroid for them i think we're still kind of figuring that out and i would say the answer is kind of ambivalent i think it it it both helps and hurts memetic desire what do i mean by that well the internet has given us access to more models of desire than ever before um you know if you lived 100 years ago if you lived in a small town the total number of people modeling desires to you could be like 15 or 20 people like in your in your school now we have smartphones we have mimetic machines in our pocket that allow us to see like what everybody else is wanting at like all hours of the day um we have billions of models so in a sense it's amplified an exacerbated memetic desire because it's just all around us all the time and i think the pandemic probably accelerated it too as we were kind of cooped up um i mean i i scrolled social media probably more than i ever have and you know you see people different lifestyles and doing different things and quitting their jobs and getting dogs and you know moving to austin and all the in miami uh you know and it's like very memetically i might add in most cases um and it's like this amplifies memetic desire like never before is like have humans had access to so many memetic models and i don't think we quite know what that's doing to us i don't know if we have the i don't know if like the the the human development has kept up with the technological development right like like in terms of virtues morally speaking i don't think we know quite what it's doing to our desires there's a lot of talk about what social media is doing to us neurologically the dopamine hits and and and the addictiveness of it i don't think that enough people are talking about what it's done to memetic desire what it's done to the way that we desire the the flip side of that the one way that social media might be diffusing memetic desire even as it amplifies it is that we can now sort of distribute and defuse memetic rivalry across billions of people and bits and bytes and nodes so you know you can swap out models for another one very easily whereas before two people that were kind of in a memetic rivalry in a town they just go to a duel or something like that right um so so in a sense like the the the internet like you know like diffuses the tension all right it like diffuses the things that would have escalated to extremes right in the wild west or something now like the the the it's it defuses memetic violence is probably the way that gerard would say it because there's always another model and we can't we can't easily become fixated on one we just go find another one so it's this weird paradox and i think peter thiel has sort of described the technology in the same way like it's both exacerbating and also it's also a weird mechanism for diffusing um some of the the negative consequences of memetic desire like in in ancient societies they they just you know have to sacrifice somebody or something like that right to diffuse memetic tension with technology um we can do all kinds of things right you can you can i don't know you can cancel people you can go just go do you can block them you can mute them there's all different exactly and it's relatively quick and painless and then everybody moves on so i think it's it's it's both it's a double-edged sword hey guys i hope you're enjoying the episode thus far this was really a mind-expanding episode and really happy we were able to talk to luke about some of these subjects in the second half of the show we get into the subject of crypto punks after we're done parsing apart the biological relevancy to what luke is talking about we get into crypto punks and nfts we bring up our old episode on legitimacy with vitalik and overall talk about how market forces are largely an effect of memetic desire and all the other topics of conversation about how the crypto industry is impacted and relevant to the conversation of mimetic desire all of that is coming in the second half of the show but before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eath bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than 100 within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless so so this is really the bridge of where we are so we've got this thing that is baked into us biologically that undergirds everything it is the base layer of everything and that is memetic desire now we have this communication technology that amplifies mimetic desire propagates it for the good and the bad but certainly makes it digital as well this seems to us to be like act one of the internet but there's also an act two of the internet and this tees up the conversation around crypto so what we always say on on on bankless is like uh crypto is a technology that adds scarcity back to the internet in the internet the communication technology everything was abundant you can copy and paste every gif in jpeg but crypto is a scarcity technology going back to what david was saying and so if the internet as a communication prop protocol was about propagating our memetic desires crypto is about valuing our memetic desires turning them into property that can be bought and sold and so this affects money this affects markets nfts are an example of this collectibles as well so we want to go through all of those things maybe let's start with with money i don't know luke if you've given much thought to like what money is but we think a lot about it on bank list and we think um about you know like the the root level the the base layer of what money is a lot in crypto in general in fact like bitcoin is a project to kind of redefine reinvent money and it's built from the bottom up it's almost built through memetic desire why do i want bitcoin because so and so has bitcoin right what is money through the lens of memetic desire i think that money is probably one of the best ways that we have to measure memetic desire it's not that you know money is the exclusive measurement of memetic desire but i think that money is is probably the most objective one that we have and you know i don't know if i ever start some you know study for mimetic mimetics and culture someday it's going to have to focus on the markets uh and on in on the financial markets right um because it's just the best proxy that we have to like understand what's going on it's a way of keeping score it's a way to measure these things especially debt that is really interesting if you want to find out how much memetic desire somebody has look at how much depth they have right that's that's pretty good it's a pretty good uh pretty good indication right um uh medic desire that exceeds their their ability to uh pay for it so um i think that um there's some interesting questions around you know like what george gilder would say right that like you know money is basically a function of of like time um and i've given some thought to that i mean i i don't i'd be interested to hear you've had a few days now to think about this and i'd love to hear your perspective on it one of the interesting things with mimetic desire and memetic rivalry and i you know i think about like monetary maximalists and things like that is memetic desire very quickly um untethers uh things from any kind of objective criteria i guess that i mean that can be good and bad um but it can it can completely sort of like untether um uh pursuits from the thing itself right because the the the focus of attention begins to be the the rival or the model rather than the thing itself the things can be swapped out the relatively interchangeable what becomes important is is the rival now now whether the rival is the like the federal reserve system whether the rival is like an alternate cryptocurrency um i don't know but this is a fundamental feature of of like mimesis and memetic rivalry is that as it continues it usually is untethered uh from any kind of objective objective criteria and i find that pretty interesting so like trying to trying to separate or like i think mimesis falls on a spectrum i think i think it falls on a spectrum and that's a good way to think about it so looking at like to what extent um are things becoming super memetic and to what extent are they grounded in in something right like something real maybe that's just an understanding of like how money and scarcity and time value of money works or is it is there a cryptocurrency that's solely solely and mean and solely about marketing and that that to me is is really interesting luke you you said some uh words you had some word choice i thought that was really really interesting that reminds me of from a number of conversations i've had with bitcoiners and other people who've thought about money at a deep level you use the word measure as in money is like a very strong measure of memetic desire um and bitcoin proudly has a 21 million hard cap because it offers a measuring stick for value and it's it's supposed to have this really strong ability to measure the value of other things because it has this you know stable supply that never ever changes uh and then the other thing you talked about is that like the whole concept about money is that the object itself what that object is is not important it's more about the fact that other people want it so to me to answer the question of like what is money through the lens of memetic desire it's some random object that humans have collectively decided as to be the instantiation of rival risk mimetic desire in the first place as in money is the object that everyone wants because everyone else wants it and some monies are good and bad right like some monies can be minted by some central party and that ruins the game a little bit right because it's easy for one party to get their hands on money and it's hard for another and so bitcoin has been this exemplar asset that has actually specifically been trying to push out all use cases of the bitcoin blockchain that aren't using bitcoin as money um and and bitcoiners who have dawson talked about one of the flaws of gold is that you can actually use it in industry as an objectively useful resource and that's a flaw of gold not a benefit of gold in bitcoin we want to push out all utility out of the bitcoin blockchain that is not using btc the asset as money because btc the asset is supposed to be the instantiation of mimetic desire it's supposed to be the one thing that everyone wants in the world because everyone else wants it and because it's has this very flat topology there's no issuer it's just a protocol it's fair it's and it's it's a it's a game that everyone can play and participate in mimetic desire without having that game be like tainted or ruined by some sort of like central party that's mine that's my like lens of how i've added you know view of medic desire and money so bitcoin is the instant as the instantiation of memetic desire as the new object yeah so so that is fascinating and so if that's the case then i mean it's this it's an it's a relatively abstract thing then that has become the object so is it then you're is it important that there's a fixed that there's a there's a there's a max limit of bitcoin that can ever be mined does that then become important as a way of um either well i'll stop there like is that is that an important feature when it comes to the the memetic desire part i i think so and we can we can talk about many many cryptocurrencies follow this model but the bitcoiner narrative is that like the hard cap really puts the steroids into that game of rivalry it makes you really really want that that bitcoin because of its promise of scarcity right so if this is a rivalrous game where we are all trying to compete to get as much money as possible which is largely what most people spend most of their decades doing that game is really souped up when uh we are talking about a hard-capped asset there's a there's a law in economics called gresham's law where you spend your bad money and get that money drives on good money yeah uh uh no good money drives out bad money right uh and and so bitcoin has like a theoretical good money it's going to just have it's going to have the same like demand as money as other monies but people will want the bitcoin money more than like the us dollar money because the us dollar is being printed bitcoins not being printed and so the game of rivalrous desire is just stronger yeah so it's almost like a bet on rivalrous desire in a sense right it does it does better the more memetic rivalry there is and like i guess like you know that's a moral question right like whether that's a good thing um or or a bad thing right but it's certainly good for bitcoin there's no doubt about that i think what you know one of the things i think about is i i find people becoming a little nihilistic about money you know like when people can become extremely rich or extremely poor overnight and it doesn't seem to be sort of like tied to any kind of like real world you know value creation or something like that like and i've had companies i've started that have created a tremendous flash valuation and then like gone away overnight which made me fairly nihilistic about money for a while right like it makes it makes it hard for you to like put your hand to the to the metaphorical plow and like do the hard work when you know that you could like make a trade or invest in something and blow it up so i think that the relationship between um value creation and and new money creation or or the creation of value in the creation of money and the way that money is exchanged is is an important discussion i haven't quite worked it out yet but i think that the the cap of bitcoin i've thought about it in that particular context yeah i'm curious what you think about this too it's like so if you are like take the example of of gold right so um how did gold come to be a money right like just we don't know that's lost to history like there's no record of how gold like first started being valued by by humans right we have maybe some kingdoms that are you know based on and gold we have some records there but like if if if you were to think about it through the lens of mimetic desire does that provide a clue this is what i think about like you know cryptocurrency right so you know you turn on tv i you know i grew up with like um scrooge mcduck who's diving into a pool of of gold like it's cartoon when i'm young i'm older see rap videos and like we're wearing the bling we've got the gold chain it's all about the gold what's interesting about that is like gold is just a what is gold man it's just a rock like who cares it's it you know has some uh properties that make it difficult to duplicate of course impossible to duplicate but so does cryptocurrency so does bitcoin if if these rap videos and these scrooge mcduck cartoons started um projecting memetic desire in the form of like bitcoin or ether or some other cryptocurrency instead and that was imbued into our social consciousness like that could easily become a money and that's kind of what what like if you were to think about run through the thought exercise luke of how does a money become a money if it's not top down pushed from a central government right and it seems to me like the lens of memetic desire is kind of an answer to that question it's somebody buys it we've got rivalrous you know competition start talking about how much you have how much it's worth price goes up like this is a ground up new money being born a new asset being born and it's almost like a microcosm of what we're just talking about with uh with the nfts it's like and what's interesting to me is like you got act one which is the internet accelerator propagation right and now you blend that with act two which is we create scarcity we can value mimetic desire on the internet digitally and then what do you get well you get oh my god crypto crypto punks in five years created a a little gif that is now worth 32k each right and like how fast did that happen and why did it happen so fast it's because of this confluence of internet technologies anyway any thoughts on that um i think that mimetic desire as part of the genesis of why we have legitimate money at all is really fascinating right like money in some sense is a product of specialization like we need money to exchange and why do we want to exchange because we want what what somebody else has and why would we want what somebody else has if we weren't memetic in some way right if their if memetic desire didn't exist so i mean to sort of riff off of paul graham here when he says like well what you want is not money what you want is wealth like you know you could have if you had a machine that could make anything that you wanted and do everything that you wanted then you wouldn't have any need for money right it's like wealth you know it's like somebody that lives somewhere and and has everything they need perfect family and home um and they're not let's say they're not exposed to anybody else right so they have no memetic desire they have wealth right like wealth is wealth is what you want um and it's not always the same thing as your as as the money that you have right they're not always equivalent things like you could have a billion dollars and be in the middle of antarctica and you wouldn't be able to buy anything or do anything with it right i mean let's assume you're not on the internet right so like it wouldn't it wouldn't matter right it would be so like in other words you know paul says like wealth is what you want why think about this with memetic desire like wealth is what you want and i could be like wealthy and in terms of like i have everything i want i have my home i have my children i have all the food that i need if self-sustaining but i i look around and i see other people that want other things and through memetic desire i begin to want them we need a medium of exchange right um and that's why we need money right because like you don't want my you know two ducks and i don't want your two apples or whatever right so we needed something and yeah maybe why we landed on certain things was largely random um uh there's a whole connection to sacred here like like a lot of money that the earliest money was always found near temp like sacred temples of worship because one of the first reasons why people needed money was that they needed animals to to sacrifice and they needed to to buy the animals so the for it seems like in accorded to renee gerard the first systems of exchange happened for the purposes of religious sacrifice but we get totally sidetracked by talking about that um so so i think that memetic desire is probably responsible for the genesis of money i'm just talking off the cuff here but i think that that's probably a whole book that i'd have you know somebody left to write something maybe start with some sub stack posts uh you've got a great sub stack luke um link to that in show notes by those guys well let's talk to the let's talk about the next i think item that um relates very closely to crypto but also has obviously a rich history in traditional world which is markets because we talked about money to quote uh you know peter thiel again peter thiel says money is the bubble that never pops right and of course in financial markets we have all sorts of different bubbles that come and go and of course we have crypto which is kind of creating markets out of everything as much as possible at the speed of the internet let's talk a little bit about bubbles and markets like tulipmania or dot com com bubble or even read recent posts that that you authored about like meme stocks being kind of a a bubble are these all products of memetic desire is this why we are buying these stocks and these assets and taking part in these bubbles what's your lens on that i don't know if memetic desire is the sole reason but i i think it's impossible to understand the extreme volatility in any market without understanding memetic desire and i just look at like analyst after analyst on cnbc and these pundits and they're just like you know this is lacking in all objectivity this is irrational they hate it's like yeah it breaks their brains yeah and it breaks their brains and they're just like looking for just like this fundamental like analysis and they're never gonna find it right this is like what rene gerard calls the romantic lie um and and it's this notion that there's always a one-to-one or a direct line um like this rational basis between people and the things that they want where we're not rational i mean we are rational creatures but we're also memetic creatures and i think that mimesis trump's rationality like almost all of the time especially especially in markets like we don't live in a rational world we live in a memetic world and if like if if the guys in cnbc could just understand this um it would just make that make their lives a lot easier i think um because yeah i mean like gerard said that the stock market well i don't he wasn't really he died in 2015 so he didn't really see the rise of crypto he'd say the same thing about crypto he said the stock market is the most memetic institution the most memetic institution and you know he said like when alan greenspan uses like ridiculous phrases like a rational exuberance he's just that's just greenspan speak for like out of control like memetic desire and it happens on the upside and it happens on the downside and it usually happens faster on the downside even historically than on the upside like once people start abandoning uh everybody wants to abandon um because there's like some fear involved in that too so like i don't think that i'm not a memetic desire maximalist where i think like everything is explainable biomedic desire there's fear there's the fight or flight there's all kinds of things but i just don't think you can understand gamestop um meme stocks uh some of the crazy uh parabolic rises in crypto without understanding memetic desire because there are people that got in without they didn't know like a damn thing about gamestop certainly not about the fundamentals or about crypto but they want in because other people want in and then when you want in like the game then becomes to generate as much memetic desire as possible after you're in because you then profit from the new mimesis that you generate so in a sense it's like create a meme generate as much medic desire as you can and you know that's certainly becoming kind of the the game and some know how to play it better than others but without an understanding of a medic desire i think it's harder to play david has some gme why'd you buy david did you buy because of memetic desire oh i i bought it to stick it to the man um but maybe there's a uh mimetic so that's so that that's memetic desire that's called memetic rivalry man well what you just said we see a lot of in the crypto space we got the the chain link army we got the xrp or the the excuse me the link marines we have the xrp army the the cardano army even like the bitcoin maximalist and even to some degree we do this in the ethereum side of things as well as like we all try and like you know rewrite elaborate like medium articles or or subsect posts as to like my valuation thesis for ether or ether is a triple point asset ethers and ultrasound money chain links go into the moon these are all competitions for attention in order to trigger mimetic desire like these are all communities that have all and and one of the i recently wrote a post uh talking about these this frog this frog like meme you talk about with the traditional meme and the the chain link army they're full of frogs and they're very homogenous and that's really the the crazy thing about them is like there's this headless man brand this headless movement of all these frogs and they all chant the same chance and they all say the same things and they're just a very homogenous cohort of people that are all shilling this link token and it's this is completely aside from the fundamentals of the project like the team is building chain link and doing chain link things and the chain link army the link marines and this frog army is just this homogeneous headless brand of just like mimicry mimicry mimicry uh and it's one of the most fascinating like social experiments i think that this space has to offer yeah i mean like the the way that mimesis forms culture and and contributes to to group cohesion is is a whole nother aspect of all of this right like the foundation of culture through mimesis in crypto and politics in in towns and communities this happens all the time and i think that that's why you see tribalism right you know you see mimesis you know forming ideas and forming community um there's always an out there's a there's always an inside and outside uh you know and gerrard says you know this is probably too much to get into here um but he said that you know memetic desire always leads to some conflict that's revolved resolved through through some kind of a violence right so you know when i when i look at ethereum right it basically says there's a founding murder or some founding conflict in every sort of strong culture so in ethereum like maybe that's like the dow fork okay like i don't i don't know but that like it probably contributed in some way to like stronger like cohesion among the people that were on board probably more so than before so it's actually like a fascinating part of like girardi and cultural analysis where he says that there's always some kind of like founding thing founding mechanism that happened that resolves some memetic conflict that actually contributes to the social cohesion where other people are looked at as the rivals and it reinforces the group identity that kind of feels like a snake biting its own tail if we if we take that out and extrapolate that to the very very end uh because there's the the community becomes more and more coherent around a specific group or specific ideology and if that gets too concentrated it can start to just be too circular too fast um and i'm i'm also starting to speak off the cuff here but like what happens when memetic desire just goes to its nth degree to the logical conclusion like what happens then does the thing explode it's like what what what happens at the end of the of the logical conclusion of my medic desire well gerard's answer is that escape there's a scapegoat that the only way that the out of control mimesis that feedback loop um is resolved is through a scapegoat right it's like somebody's randomly chosen right in in in ancient cultures the way that that that it was prevented from imploding was to find and expel or or kill a scapegoat right so it's the idea that you know violent doing violence to somebody else saves us from the internal violence it's it's complicated um i i do think it's relevant to the discussion um i think we live in a culture that's like a scapegoating machine but we make little scapegoats right our scapegoats are usually not like we don't have extravagant rituals anymore but we we make little ones all the time so that's that's the last and most part of memetic theory is that memetic desire leads to conflict in the way that humans have resolved conflict memetic crises uh throughout history because i think you're right it is like a snake biting its own tail is through the scapegoat mechanism but the scapegoat mechanism only fuels uh just more violence and and more conflict so i think i think we can get off track with that but i mean that is gerard's answer to the question i just have a quick question for you this is like just some advice so people come into crypto and they're always like oh my god it's so tribal why is it so tribal and like david and i our answer to that is because humans are tribal and guess what crypto at the base layer is composed of humans but i have a question for you so a lot of cryptocurrencies many people would say in fact we would say bitcoin and ether are kind of competing for to be a money to be a world reserve asset essentially you could think of them as rivalrous in a way like what's your advice for these these communities to avoid conflict because i think in cryptocurrency it's like the aim of cryptocurrencies really to decrease humanity's reliance on centralized parties right centralized institutions we don't want all of the eggs in those centralized baskets that can control us and restrict individual community freedoms right but we also don't want to go to tribal wars one cryptocurrency versus another and yet there is this rivalrous thing which is like market cap like total value of the thing do i buy bitcoin or do i buy eth no you should buy eth because xyz um what's your advice for these somewhat rivalrous tribes is there a way to step away from that rivalry or is this just how it has to play out well i don't know what your opinion is on how how it will end um i mean i guess if you're kind of a maxillist like it has to end with one currency taking over and being like the global standard and i think that if that happens then i i don't see um i don't see any any way out like if the if the goal is for a currency to become like the worldwide adopted standard then i think that the conflict has to happen and will inevitably happen if however um and i'm not necessarily even saying that that's like a bad thing right it i'm not i'm not implying that that's bad i'm just saying that that's there's no way around it somebody has to win and and and the others will have to lose and there will be conflict along the way i think there's another scenario and again i'm not making a value judgment on it where there's a place for more than one and you know each one carves out and defines a specific purpose for for that that currency um to solve some specific problem so i i mean i'm kind of fascinated by like micro currencies like there's there's like places in africa where that that were like people have been like dropped coins and it's helped them create little micro economies and i think the the only way to prevent the rivalry is if you don't have the same goal and if if your goal is that everybody wants to become the new global standard then there will be if people can sort of define a specific use case and if there's room for more than one and they solve different problems um then then i i think then that can be avoided i mean this goes back to the way that peter thiel said he solved conflicts at paypal he made sure that you know people had clearly defined objectives and paths for and paths forward so like that was just on the human career level and i think the same is probably true on the level of currency like if you have like a one a specific problem that you're trying to solve that nobody else is trying to solve then you're going to avoid that if if you want to be the one true global currency then you're going to have to duke it out with you know with bitcoin and ethereum and you know i'm not quite sure how that ends that's that's an interesting uh approach because it really aligns with i think two kinds of uh approaches that people have when they come into this space like usually people come into this the crypto space and they immediately resonate with monetary maximalism and they're like oh yeah i'm a monetary maximalist i'm gonna i'm gonna purchase the thing that i think is money usually those people just decide that it's either bitcoin or ether and then that's the game that they play or there's like these uh what i kind of call poly chainers or or you know the you know many many blockchains many many tokens which goes a little bit closer to what you were saying in the in the latter half which is you know each token can find some way to instantiate its own value for its own purpose that's non-competitive with money and i kind of actually think that that's more or less the ethereum app layer right like we have the uniswap token which governs over the uniswep exchange we have the compound token which governs over the compound money market and these are i wouldn't call them currencies they are definitely not fighting to fight the whole monetary ima money token but they are building out something useful of value that that is what they are for and it's also still leaving the game of monetary maximalism to be played right and so um to some degree i think the concept of monetary maximalism is talking about the concept of memetic desire before people were even allowed even knew to to call it that but people generally had this gist that like there was going to be one single shelling point of money no matter what uh and i actually think both sides of what you just said are both happening at the same time like one is more or less the ethereum app layer these are capital assets that govern over protocols and then there's the money that undergirds this whole entire thing yeah yeah i mean so you made a one really good import point and it's that like everybody knows about memetic desire but most people don't have a name for it right we're just like naming giving something a name that exists and we we know that it exists and i think that the the app layer of ethereum is a really important thing because that solves the problem i mean i've talked to some some folks in the crypto space like i think at bancore for instance and there was this idea that like we're all going to be walking around with like 10 000 different currencies on our phone and like we walk in one place and you know we pay with this and there's real time exchange i just don't see that happening i mean i think like the app layer of ethereum is a far better solution uh than that and i think i think it's tackling similar things luke i want to i want to backtrack really quick because there's uh we we've touched on this uh this subject a number of times but i really want to just uh drive this point home we've talked about um how memetic desire is with us from birth like it's in our dna it's in our genes it's in our brain and we also talked about market bubbles um i recently read this book called devil take the hindmost which is basically a human history of market bubbles and my naive young self i kind of thought that there was the tulip mania there was the dot-com bubble uh and then there was like the ico of 20 the ico mania of 2017 and those are like the big bubbles that i know about no no no no market bubbles go back as far back as like recorded history as possible and to the point and i was talking to the guy that even recommended me me the book and i was like doing a little like debrief with him after i read the book is and i told him even again even before reading your book like it's crazy how market bubbles are just written into our dna they just seem to happen and like reading this book and listening to the stories of these market bubbles that happened in the 1400s and the 1500s and the 1600s they're the same story of the the ico mania in 2017 they're the same story of defy summer in 2020 like i resonated with every single part of the story like i felt myself part of that story and i feel like the only logical explanation is that because market bubbles are 100 percent memetic desires and the humans will follow the same path the same narratives over and over and over again because it's built into our dna have you thought about this yeah i mean i couldn't agree more i mean like so long before there was social media um people still look to other people to know what to want social media just exacerbated it right um and and before there were financial markets um there were still bubbles and all sorts of things they just weren't in in financial assets right there were like rises and falls in people's reputations for instance right in in all kinds of other things right so like the fun the point is that we're like mimetic creatures by nature we almost always like overshoot because the nature of memetic desire is is is to be untethered from the from any kind of objectivity eventually especially the longer and longer that it goes so there are bubbles in all kinds of other areas in life in politics in dating in fashions in in like in all kinds of things and what financial markets have done is just given humans a very easy way to see what already happens in everyday life all the time like that i just freaking bubbles in in high school right like you know like in in in with people so i think markets basically hold up a mirror to mimesis and hold up a mirror to our humanity and see the way that we are and it's not just like we're like that only in financial markets we're just like that all the time we have memetic desire that's super interesting i don't think i've thought about it that way luke that like markets are just a mere for mimetic desire and that markets there are markets for everything like markets even for ideologies or specific types of music or specific types of art or fashion um you also brought up in your book this concept of reflexivity right is is that also what we're talking about how if um you know a certain amount of people want a specific asset in a market and drive the price up then people see that price and they're like okay well price going up i better get in they pile in you you gave this uh example i think of of from your book of um tesla stock right and um i was just like visually picturing this and you said that when tesla stock was was pumping somebody went to the google search and they type in you know should i with like you know how google kind of autofills with all the suggestions the number one suggestion at that time was should i buy tesla right this is mimetic desire as expressed through google algorithms how weird is that that algorithms are maybe now programming humanity's memetic desires and yet this is the world we live in so yeah we'll talk talk a little bit about uh reflexivity then and how that applies to markets yeah well i mean the scary thing about the google example before i talk about reflexivity is like think about it what google did is basically suggest a question and suggest a desire to somebody before they even knew the right question to ask yeah it's not just that they suggested a question they suggested a desire buying their customers they're fanning the flames right they're absolutely fanning the flames so the principle of reflexivity was articulated really well by george soros in his book i highly recommend it the alchemy of finance and he talks about how financial markets are always reflexive and that um expectations shape reality and then filter like a a feedback loop right like investors expectations um affect their decisions we're sort of guessing what other people's expectations are which affect our expectations which actually cause us to make real world decisions in the financial markets which then change expectations right so one of george soros's you know first big trades was um basically taking advantage of this fact right it was a huge currency trade people were trying to figure out if a currency would collapse and by taking aggressive action in the market and causing some price action he changed the expectations that the currency would collapse you know so like we we can affect through our actions expectations which then affect other people's actions and reflexivity just means that we're that the market is constantly reflexive and never static it's completely dynamic right it's like two people on a trampoline like if one of them jumps the other person is going to have a force exerted on them which affects them and their movement so we're all kind of enmeshed in this web and what i try to do in the book is is connect that to mimetic desire saying like that you you can't be in a room full of people having a discussion about about anything without having your desires affected in some way you might not think that they are but desi memetic desire is reflexive especially at the level of markets i think the sk the interesting implication and perhaps the scary implication of this is memetic desire is like a it's like access having root access to the firmware of our brains and not just our individual brains but like our collective brains and what's scary about that is one thing if it happens kind of organically or naturally right and like the toddler likes the red toy because her dad's a fireman that's one thing right okay cool that was supposed to happen maybe but it's another when you have outside forces or third parties who know about this and are using it using this firmware level access to like program society and what's ultra scary about this is when they can automate it through the use of information technology at the scale of the internet using algorithms right so that google autofill example like guys that happens in your twitter feed in your in your facebook feed your instagram feed right and it's not even individual human beings that are programming the propaganda they've actually just taught algorithms to do this and a tweak here or tweak there can totally change the medic desire outcomes of a society that is some power that i'm not sure that uh like we are ready to to deal with and it's very scary to think of that level of power being completely centralized by insidious actors anyway this is like an implication i think of what you're saying yeah and people who understand memetic desire well that understand that this is a fundamental feature of how human beings come to want and desire things people can hack into that that desire and i think the big tech companies are already doing it i mean i think they understand the medic desire very well but we have to be aware of of this and like awareness brings some level of freedom and agency over it and the last thing that we want are a few sort of oligarchs and centralized government um pulling the strings of of medic desire i tell the example in the book about eddie bernays who's basically the the father of public relations and propaganda who used who basically understood memetic desire enough to engineer a campaign to get most of the women in the 1920s to start smoking because he gave them the right models of desire and they just didn't understand right that this that their desires were were being shaped and molded by somebody that understood that they just needed the right model and if they were given the right model that they would take up smoking right powerful very powerful so it's like if i was to start a cryptocurrency today imagine and i i went and i i paid like 10 or 12 really powerful models in the cryptocurrency space to to to get behind it influencers they're basically influencers right and then i and then i told them to just pretend that they stumbled on it objectively and spontaneously came to the conclusion right that this is a good investment while a thousand times right so this is the problem right like so many layers of of mimesis they're all underground they're hidden and we only see the surface right and so much of life takes place under underground deep underground and we've got to be sort of aware of that right and just like get under the surface kick the tires find out what's happening because desires are being modeled to us all the time and they're it's often disingenuous right like this is the name of the game for influencers yet people keep paying influencers a lot of money because it freaking works like you know luke we talked at the beginning of this uh show about how mimetic desire is kind of this chaotic neutral force it can have good outcomes it can have negative outcomes and also if bankless listeners have been paying attention to bank list they'll know that uh sometimes ron and i bring up the the straight up the topic of mindfulness and the importance and role of mindfulness as you as you go through crypto markets you know markets go go high we get euphoric they go low we get depressed being mindful really helps you navigate those waters and overall sam harris talks about this a lot with his uh waking up app and mindfulness and mindfulness meditation can really allow you to step back from your own psyche and actually start to like label mimetic desire you know and and the forces that are impacting your perceptions that you will forgot or didn't realize or are are are doing that and so uh the the an action item for listeners is to you know take another look at mindfulness because it is the thing that allows you to start to become immune to memetic desire when you want to choose to be immune from it and also allow you to tap into it and leverage it when it works for you and that brings us to i think our last conversation because we started off saying how you know there's good memetic desire and then there's memetic desire that can be used for evil we recently had vitalik buterin on the bankless podcast to talk about this concept called legitimacy and i actually think to some degree we're also talking about the same thing instead of instead of labeling it legitimacy we're actually now calling it memetic desire in that podcast with vitalik he talked about how legitimacy is largely only defined what people collectively agree to be legitimate as in there's no there's no basement or foundation for what establishes legitimate legitimacy legitimacy it's only in the psychosocial level the brain mesh network level of the humans that are around you things are only legitimate if other people other humans also think them to be legitimate and so this is in my opinion a memetic desire for good uh because what is legitimacy other than a good thing to have or a good property to have for something that is legitimate you see as like memetic desire as like a creation of legitimacy a creative force yeah i i i do i think that it absolutely is um like other people wanting what we want gives it a stamp of legitimacy so again um this can be good or bad um you know there are societies where child sacrifice has been legitimate it's been legitimized um it you know it's it's a fascinating concept right and i think um it's fundamental to understanding money it's absolutely fundamental to understanding so a lot of things about about social life um one thing that vitalik said i listened to the episode and i watched i i read the paper he basically says it's it's the outcome of coordinated effort and i think ascribes a lot of intentionality to it right we talk about game theory so there seems to be a coordinated effort to create legitimacy i think where gerard would differ from that when he sort of like looks at the way that memetic outcomes happen through crowds or through large complex systems that we often don't understand that legitimacy is often the product of uh non-intentional mimesis right like things that are happening at the unconscious level where something is arrived at as legitimate without a lot of like conscious thinking about it that is um that's just a tension that i would introduce into the discussion and i think we can we can introduce more or less coordination but gerard would say that oftentimes when uh when a memetic process takes hold it's hard to know who like the first mover was and who the who the real models are it's kind of like looking at the flock of starlings like which one is moving first right it's hard to know so i i'm curious as to like how that actual process works in the context of legitimacy in markets and in and in social life um i mean i don't have an answer i'm just gonna i'm just gonna throw out the girardian perspective on there and i think that the intentionality is good right i think that it's really good to have that but also in a decentralized ecosystem um to what extent are our things arrived on that might be the product of mimesis more than rationality so there's this constant interplay right between objectivity i do think that like just one observation on that luke is like i i do think there are a ton of hyper rationalists and engineers and cryptographers and brilliant people in crypto like that just don't fundally fundamentally understand why bitcoin is valuable as an example or why ether is valuable right like they just don't understand because i think they don't approach approach the space from a memetic desire meme theory perspective right like so and that can allow them to draw incorrect conclusions like why is bitcoin worth 30k right like it if you look at just the the technology level it's a peer-to-peer you know um transaction network and only seven to eight transactions per second i mean visa can do thousands already we already have something like that but why is it worth 30k i think it's because of this this hidden force of subconscious mimetic desire that sometimes the technologists and the people the rationalists among us the really smart people with huge cerebral cortexes like they kind of miss that piece of it well exactly and the smarter you are like the better you are at justifying things after the fact with all kinds of really smart arguments and like why i love crypto so much is that there are so many absolutely brilliant people that are thinking really hard about these questions i mean i got an undergrad degree in finance a while ago i graduated in 2004 i've learned more about finance in the last three years tonight than i have in my entire life because of crypto and i think i think a lot of people can say the same thing right yeah it's fun it's exciting and there's brilliant minds thinking about this stuff but legitimacy is really important to understand one thing i i pulled a quote from vitalik and i want to read it because this gets to the heart of what i'm saying he made i'm quoting him verbatim he said if people do something different they they i think they worry if they do something different they'll only create conflict and suffer or at least be left in a lonely forked ecosystem all by themselves right so he was talking about legitimacy and and like the fear that people have of like breaking away from the legitimacy and i would say that people would rather be wrong than be alone and and this social force of memetic desire and mimesis um can cause people to do things um they might think they're rational but people would rather be wrong than be alone and i think there's a powerful uh social mechanism at work there's fomo involved there's all kind of memetic desire involved but i would push back a little bit on giving legitimacy an overly rationalistic um like like explanation i think there are many things that we consider legitimate in our society that we haven't given a lot of thought about or that there wasn't some centralized planning system that that like thought about it i mean i believe in free markets okay and i think that like in in general like we arrive at but they're not always good things and sometimes we we step back and and we realize that through certain circumstances in an era or certain forces that were at work um certain things gained legitimacy that uh lose legitimacy a decade later and that is uh what we've been talking about in this entire podcast right it's like how mimesis like gives value to things and takes value away from things there's definitely an aspect of like another book you could write or at least a sub stack article for us luke is like generational memetic desire and how that changes things because that that is one thing we are seeing in crypto is like millennials and zoomers they're not buying gold man like they just don't value it the way their grandparents did but they are buying crypto but we've taken so much of your time luke and this has been super insightful for us i gotta kind of end maybe with with with this question is what's your take on this crazy thing that we call crypto like you've got kind of a i know you know about it right like you've been following the story all along you probably hold some crypto assets but you're not like deep into the culture necessarily uh yet maybe we'll be in the future um what's your take on what's going on yeah i want to be deep into the culture i told you guys before we went on the air the only reason i haven't been is i've been hard at work creating a book for the last couple of years and so i couldn't spend as much time as i as i would have liked or i would have wrote in a really shitty book um my take is that crypto is is uh and probably the most important thing happening in the world right now um from a geopolitical standpoint uh from in an economic standpoint from the standpoint of like human uh evolution um we're learning all kinds of things about ourselves right it's causing us to like ask questions like fundamental questions that you would think we would talk about more but they're so fundamental that we forget to ask them like what what the heck is money like what is money like most you don't learn that in school right it's just like you know people are because people grow up and they've just never asked like fundamental questions but like we're all asking the question right now and i i think it's a tremendously positive thing [Music] you know i'm i'm very bullish on ethereum um i think that i think that there's a aside from the exciting things that it could do to the global economy and to people's lives i think there's an educational aspect to this that's that's really important that's going to have spillover effects way beyond crypto so like crypto is not just about crypto crypto is about like what it means to be human and i think i i sort of as as somebody that's interested in like interdisciplinary questions i think that it will it will shed light on everything from politics to just social relationships to like the way that cities operate and those i think it's going to take us a very long time to figure it out but the the speed at which this is all happening is really really exciting and i'm just glad that now that i finally finished writing the book uh i can begin to dive in the way that i wanted to a couple of years ago and thanks thanks to your show and your and your sub stack it makes a little bit easier we're super excited we would love to have you come on down the rabbit hole with us let us know what you think um because you've got a exceptional lens on this stuff and it is interdisciplinary it's it takes philosophy takes so sociology it takes psychology it takes all of anthropology all of these things together is what forms crypto so glad to have you luke and what we want to do is we would love to have you on in the future after you take a tour down the rabbit hole you know six months a year and come back on let us know what you think of things but luke it has been such a pleasure having you on bank list thank you so much thanks so much for having me appreciate it i'd love to come back on action items bankless listeners luke did not write a shitty book he spent two years and he wrote a fantastic book it is called wanting the power of memetic desire in everyday life we will include a link to it in the show notes action item one is go download that on audible or something or go pick up a copy of it read it it's fantastic also subscribe to luke's sub stack it's called anti-mimetic this is a field guide to memetic desire we will include a link in the show notes to that as well risks and disclaimers ethan's risky crypto is risky d5 is risky so are bubbles so is memetic desire it seems like you could lose what you put in we are
