from out of your mouth today so let's get into it well like at the risk of getting a little ranty here um and i don't want to get ranty i was just thinking of the weekend david about some lessons i've learned on the journey like um you know so i've been in the space about six years um so not like super long you know i wasn't there at bitcoin genesis yeah you know so and i picked up a few things just from watching mistakes that i've made and being like oh that's how that works i shouldn't do that again right but also like watching mistakes that other people have made um people i've seen people flame out i've seen people quit crypto i've seen people totally lose it uh and exit the space prematurely and so i just offered seven lessons for crypto pioneers in the market monday post you want to go through these yeah yeah absolutely people like lists so yeah list lists are fun let's go to number one all right so crypto natives crypto pioneers we are definitely as chris brininski said the podcast we did with him exploring the infinite white space of this new digital country but we're also bearing the brunt of of danger here and so here are the seven things i um i i just want to convey uh to folks joining this journey the first is this crypto is in price discovery mode for the next decade at least price discovery mode for the next decade at least you know what this means to me david is there's no rush yeah like the ups and downs that we see on a daily basis and the crazy volatility and china slams the door or there's some hack on an exchange or there's some defy contract hack or there's some extremely bullish news it's all noise guys the market is figuring the space out the price is in discovery mode this is going to take decades you're early expect the market to be irrational this is going to take years to figure out and it's going to take years for the market to figure out even the things that you already know now so just be at peace with that just have a long-term orientation that to me is the most healthy thing that you can do as you're thinking about getting started in crypto yeah i i totally agree and you know crypto moves so fast so it's hard to keep a macro perspective when there's you know so many every single week there's something micro to pay attention to like oh paypal you know integrated bitcoin and then bitcoin pumped ten percent like but then that then you are paying attention in a very narrow way to what's going on one of my favorite um perspectives to take is and i can't remember who said this but like it was probably in the middle of 2018 2019 bear market i think it was eric voorhees who said this like we're not in bitcoin isn't in a one to two year bear market it's in a ten-year long bull market yes that is the right perspective and the one thing i i try and tell people who are you know normies who are trying to get their head wrapped around you know cryptocurrencies and bitcoin and ethereum is is they say like oh isn't it super volatile and like you know bitcoin goes up like 20 000 and then it crashes and i tell them i give them the metaphor and then like think of bitcoin or or cryptocurrencies like as a plant right and it grows out of the ground and you have this little sapling plant that's like six inches uh six inches tall and then next year come you come back and it's like four feet tall like it just grew like twenty thousand percent i don't know insert the right math here like so so like when people see that they're not used to those numbers showing up on the stock market right stock markets assets on the stock market don't go 20 000 but vc funds they are used to those numbers because they were able to get in before everyone else right and so like the the whole like bitcoin moved or ethereum moved like 500 percent in a year like that's just numbers that we're not used to but the world itself the universe is used to those numbers and we are in the middle of the universe figuring out how to price these things i totally agree totally agree and sometimes you got to trip out your psychology a little bit right because humans aren't meant to deal with this level of volatility but you know we do it to ourselves when we go and check our block folio 10 times a day right like i know people yeah we're like right i i know people in crypto who it's like to gain perspective you're having trouble with this stop checking price yep i mean you could check price quarterly this is a that would be enough if if it's true that we're in price discovery mode for the next decades uh so anyway perspective on that the second you ready for the second yep let's do it all right i have never seen a patient investor lose money in crypto never if you're patient you won't lose money if you buy and you hold you don't lose money over the long term i tweeted something like this out on on saturday and someone responded yeah like but what about uh the guy that bought eos or like the guy that put all money into i don't know some other coin which is like the fact that you went and looked for another ethereum or another bitcoin or another short-term project shows that you weren't patient that you saw somebody else getting rich you had fomo and you did a bad thing patient investors don't lose money in the space how easy is that right it's almost like fool proof just like it's really hard it's hard i know it's hard it's hard but like it's hard it's difficult but it's simple buy and if your time horizon is five to ten years it'll work out you'll be fine if you're not buying short-term stupid assets right yep yeah yesterday we saw the stock market pump on uh on vaccine news like it did something insane like 10 to 15 and then we saw a crypto uh sell we had a sell-off because people went into stocks right yeah and so like there's two market participants there's people at the base foundational level who are patient who are never selling who are have their theses and have placed their bets and then there's the people on top of those people that you know fomo into something every 24 hours right and those are the people making the market movements like the daily plus five percent minus five percent but it's the bottom substrate the foundation that really is the reason why we are in a 10-year bull market right and so be part of that cohort that doesn't fomo right just have just place your bets and sit on your hands crypto is a device for transferring money from the inpatient to the patient warren buffett said the same about stocks it's also true for crypto some of this is just good personal finance advice guys but it applies in a different way in crypto all right you ready for number three let's do it okay this might be um like some tough love for you guys 95 of you listening right now should stop trading and just hold you should stop trading because you're losing money relative to holding 95 of you are not good traders not great traders um and you don't have to be to do 10xs in crypto you can just hold if you don't want to spend hours a day developing your trading skills and competing at that level with like the sbfs of the world and our friends at three arrow capital like the desks that are doing this 24 hours a day and spending 80 plus hours a week on it like just don't you don't even have better in that game they are better than you full stop it's like it's great it's like everybody thinks they're going to be in the nba right yep and like to get in the nba first of all you have to have a certain like natural born talent and like physique and athletic ability and then you have to work really hard um percent of you shouldn't be playing that game at all you should just hold yeah i i would add one correlator onto this like sometimes you know people go to the casino even though they basically more or less intend on losing money like the casino's still fun so like if you are finding yourself compelled to do that separate your stack into two stacks two separate stacks heavily weight one stack to be your hold stack and then allocate like two to five percent some low number just to get your like gambling itched itched right just to do it just to say you did and then you can leave your whole stack if that's if you can't you know control yourself moderate yourself i totally agree with that and that is a sensible strategy david all right number four i am responsible for everything that happens to me in crypto repeat that to yourself i am responsible for everything that happens to me in crypto not somebody on twitter right not the builder who built the smart contract not the dude whose newsletter i read not the person whose youtube i subscribed to or the token that promised me the moon i am responsible that is an attitude that i have tried to uphold for myself in crypto because that is a growth attitude you have to take accountability for the decisions that you make in crypto you can't blame other people it's not helpful to your progress as a crypto investor to do that but david i see it a lot and whenever i see it um i see a mark of immaturity and like people when i've said this before people people say things like well you're just letting um you know scammers off the hook like no i'm not both of these things can be true i mean i totally reject scammers and people who are trying to take other people's money uh or you know hack and steal um but for you as an investor the best advice is to take accountability and responsibility for the decisions that you make in crypto that is how you'll get better yeah these systems treat users as admins like everyone who has an ethereum wallet that ethereum wallet treats them as admin as in no that the ethereum wall it's not going to do anything that you explicitly didn't say yourself that's why we are a self-sovereign industry that's why we have some of the core values of bitcoin ethereum bankless like you have complete control over your assets which means that if you lose your assets some you did something like you probably violated rules one through three in some particular way right yes uh and you know that i think that's really you don't get like empowerment and self-sovereign finance without also being responsible for your actions right yep or you see some crypto influencer tweet about something some token you absolutely have to buy yup and you go buy that right quote unquote that's how you get in to a token that's on you i mean should the crypto influencer influencer do that no that's a separate thing but the fact that you are jumping into a position that you don't know anything about like would you jump into an empty pool like i mean look down look at what you're doing before you you go and do it yep um i think that's what we're saying here all right absolutely number five you ready yep own more crypto than the financial experts recommend and doubly so if you're young some prescriptive advice huh all right wow yeah watch this let me let me uh let me say none of this is financial advice as always for disclaimers also see number four right but um i think that the traditional financial experts people cfas people who are financial advisors they are selling typewriter writers in the age of the pc right they don't understand this asset class and therefore can't give you good advice on this asset class so even the ones that are semi-pro crypto they'll be like yeah you know you you should take one percent of your portfolio and gamble with it um that's not enough right i mean i get like one percent okay it depends depends what your portfolio looks like depends what age you are it depends on your risk tolerance on these things i get that but in general i think the financial experts aren't going to weight you as high as you probably should be in crypto and i think this is most important if you're young like the one to three percent if you're young i mean is that all you want of your net worth exposure in your crypto it's not all i want where's the other 97 what are you doing with that you're buying boomer stuff boomer stocks yeah you're getting dumped on by the boomers so i'm not going to prescribe a certain amount for you it's like but it's probably more than your financial experts um the guy your brokerage is going to recommend to you absolutely if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways but a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and device producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well and like so anthony pompliano is a big fan of the phrase like get off zero right like he's going on the crusade of trying to encourage funds to just put one percent in just put a half a percent in and like part of the reason why that number's so low is because like you need a number to convince people right and so like like if you say like you need to put 15 of your portfolio into bitcoin well to the you know funds that people are talking to when they say these numbers 15 of their portfolio is like half a billion dollars right or it could be and so like in order to maintain legitimacy you as somebody who's going off and pounding like put one percent into crypto you need to be have a low number because any other number of that then that seems crazy but if you are the type of person who's like anthony pompliano who's saying like go put one percent into crypto anthony pompiano has way more than one percent of it's over 50 it's definitely over 50 percent you said it i've heard him say it yeah so like yeah so do do see what people's actions are not what they're saying yeah absolutely and of course he is talking mainly to like um funds and large pensions institutions on that one so uh all right this number six is a little spicy david you ready yeah i love it all right don't take crypto advice from someone who's never used uniswap yeah that's a great one that's a great one i i just think there there are a lot of like uh crypto experts vcs pundits thought leaders who talk the talk but don't actually use crypto like if you haven't used uniswap if you haven't taken out a maker loan you don't know what that is if you haven't used d5 how can you possibly have a strong opinion on ethereum or d5 that does not compute to me you have to use this stuff in order to be knowledgeable and to provide advice about it so this is a heuristic you could change over time of course but like right now if somebody is talking smack about ethereum or defy or all this stuff saying it never works and they've never used uniswap i call dude yeah yeah it's one of those things that you can only be bearish on defy if you haven't tried it right and i think the reason why you use uniswap is because it's kind of like the the nexus of all the other apps like if you're going from ave to compound you might have gone through unit swap in order to do that because for whatever reason right and so as a litmus test is you can almost can't use ethereum without using uniswap at some point in time so like almost it's almost to say like if you haven't used uniswap you almost haven't used d5 itself right yeah i mean it's kind of like what does unit swap require well it requires like you to self custody your private keys right so that's something you get familiar with the d5 wallet like metamask and you to make a trade that's it and if you haven't completed those checks you don't have a valid opinion to me on d5 all right number seven um this is something naval says a lot surround yourself with long-term people playing long-term games i think this is so important and i'm not just talking about people here um as individuals though that is also true it's communities it's projects it's also individuals but like those people who are playing long-term games draw those close because there's a lot of folks in crypto who are playing short-term games that you don't want to be around and they'll all say they're playing a long-term game so you got to watch their actions not their words on this but if you are surrounding yourself with people who i would say from an investor perspective i think somebody like uh chris brinski like that's a dude who's playing a long-term game like he's reputation oriented he knows he's going to be in this space for 10 years he's even instructed his entire vc fund to be that not a hedge fund trader there's like no exit right unless his lps are successful that's somebody who's playing a long-term game i think of like vitalik and some of the design decisions that ethereum has made as a project right they could have scaled much faster by taking shortcuts they're going through this like long arduous process of sharding and proof of stake because they think that they want to preserve decentralization and the neutrality of the network right that's another person who's playing a long-term game um if you surround yourself with those types of people in those types of projects and you yourself are a long-term player and keep your reputation intact as your strongest as your most valuable asset you will do very well in this space over the long run that's why i've seen everyone who's doing it yeah man i have i have so much to say about this and and i i can't remember it was a book i was reading where the author was uh illustrating uh the father at a kid's soccer game and you have one father who is like yelling at his kids score score score you know do whatever you need to do and then another father is like you know have fun right because there's two rules here like there's you can either play to win or you can get or you can play to get invited back the next time right wow yeah and that's what you are so as an individual who is learning how to engage with others and be friends with others the goal is to not win the goal is to get invited to play a second time and this is also true with trading right like if you just do decide to trade like you the goal is to always be able to play the game like don't ever position yourself that gets you cut out of the game uh and and this is something i tweeted out not too long ago where i said like you know there there are theses in crypto that are pretty decently defined and i think we've defined like the bankless thesis and the protocol sync thesis and the eth the triple point asset thesis and we haven't swayed from that ryan like and i'm pretty proud of what we've done here at bankless if any listener has knows of a time that we've pivoted from one of our theses let me know but i think that we have been on the same beating the same drum ever since this podcast started ever since this youtube channel started ever since you started the newsletter we haven't pivoted right and you know there's a bunch of other people in the ecosystem that just have not pivoted from what they think this crypto industry is about you know anthony cesano is one of them dc investor antiprosynthesis as many bitcoiners hate that guy he has been beating the same drum over and over and over again so you should surround yourself with people that don't don't change up what they're saying based on the times of the day and i didn't want to bring this up when we got into the state of the nation today but i recently tweeted out if your cryptocurrency project has a uh an army of green frogs behind it you should probably rethink your strategy because we need people that are playing long-term games and so you need real people behind your network right you need a real community of real humans not just an army of green frog so absolutely i'm totally aligned with this one play long-term games yeah i think what you're alluding to there in like i know you got like twitter mobbed about it um but i think what you're alluding to like i think what you're alluding to though is like reputation is one of the most important long-term games that we as human plays that play right and i think there is insane amounts of value in creating sort of a pseudo-anonymous account some sort of reputation uh behind it and you can accrue that over the time at the same time right like by putting your name out there um and by yeah right that is your that is your reputation that's your skin in the game that's a mistake and that counts for something too yeah um so regardless guys those are the the seven thoughts for crypto pioneers if you're on the journey crypto is in price discovery mode for the next decade at least be patient because if if you are i've never seen a patient investor lose money in crypto probably if you're listening to this you should stop trading and just hold remember that you as an individual are responsible for what happens to you in crypto don't blame others that is the key to growth accountability own more crypto than the financial experts recommend don't take crypto advice from who's never used unit swap and then lastly surround yourself with long-term people playing long-term games uh that's it right off right and i'm seeing the youtube comments uh give a big fat thumbs up to your list so nice job all right cool well good we we made youtubers happy green frogs don't like us but uh youtubers are happy we'll take that as a win all right david with that we should probably sign off we've covered a lot of territory today we'll probably chop this into uh some smaller videos for your viewing pleasure um it's been fantastic to be with you guys risking disclaimers of course is risky so is the internet bond that we talked about today so is bitcoin all d5 protocols are as well but this is the frontier we're glad that you're with us on the journey thanks for joining us this has been state of the nation what number david 32 22 22 22 22 all cause we're playing long-term games and we're doing it together happy binding guys
