[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan john adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is the episode ethereans and bitcoiners have an adult conversation that's the goal what do you think did we achieve it yeah preston pish is a bitcoiner uh and he's he's he often finds himself very much on the opposite side of the argument very much in the twitter sphere uh to and it's kind of it's very much emblematic of like the the bitcoin versus ethereum fights that you see on twitter and uh i think this episode does a very good job as as then when you get in front of these people and you look at them face to face and you're in the same room with them those those twitter fights do not represent reality at all this was a fantastic conversation with preston pish who is a very informed investor in the in the both in the legacy world and also now highly uh in on bitcoin and he's also a content producer and he's so that's always a fantastic time to get another content producer on the podcast it makes podcasting very easy yeah i always find with these conversations david that's like we agree on 90 of things right it's like we started there with all of the things that we uh agree with we talked about um fiat and late stage credit cycles we talked about many money printing we talked about the value of self-sovereign money and decentralization um and then we talked about some of the things we actually disagree on so that other 10 right so some of these famous debates uh proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake what were preston's thoughts on proof of work and our thoughts on proof of stake we talked about monetary policy because we can't not talk about monetary policy we got into a really interesting discussion because preston values scarcity to the nth degree he thinks that is why numbers go up for bitcoin well guess what there's some pretty extreme scarcity properties coming to ethereum in the next 12 months we had a good discussion on that um yo i think listeners will have to to um i guess come to their own conclusion on this um there's a certain element i feel dave and you and i have talked about this that sometimes whether you're attracted to bitcoin or ethereum is is more up to like personality more up to disposition and preston is kind of like our reminded me of the conversation most with lynn alton where she was just like yeah what you're saying could be true and i can understand what you're saying but it's still too early to me i want to see all the execution risk boiled out of this thing before i'm willing to give it another look but i will give it another look so i almost david want to uh bring back preston in 12 months or so or 18 months when ethereum has shipped even more and some of these major changes go through and and talk to him then and get his opinion uh from that perspective but all in all really interesting discussion i hope this is the discussion that listeners wanted again that conversation open-minded conversation between two groups that are more aligned than they seem but often appear so tribal on uh social media and maybe over the long term like as ethereum calcifies and as as bitcoin just chugs along hopefully we come together as a as a community rather than uh splitting further apart i i think you know if if preston uh you know comes in and the plan is for him to come and look at ethereum in 12 months time and see all that execution risk in the rear view mirror and uh according to what he said that he would be much more open to an ethereum with minimized execution risk uh and then and i that's more or less what lynn alden said uh and so maybe the the time for a decent amount of risk-averse cohort of people to come to ethereum is just not now now is the time for people who are willing to take on that execution risk and uh you might be that might be you as a listener of this podcast like maybe you you're cool with execution risk uh preston is not and he explains his rationale and he explains his reasoning and that's kind of like the core fundamental difference between a lot of like the the bitcoin um bitcoin only types of people absolutely guys i think you are really going to enjoy this before we get to the podcast we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the unit swap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of defy money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right bankless nation we are super excited about this next conversation with preston pish preston is an investor with a strong understanding of macra but maybe most relevant to today's conversation he's a bitcoiner that we feel like we can have a great conversation with and that's what you're here for is a fantastic conversation between ethereums and bitcoiners preston co-founded the investor podcast network number one ranked on itunes we study billionaires is what it's called he also hosts the bitcoin fundamentals podcast just an awesome podcast i enjoy quite a bit he is one of the leading bitcoin advocates and has a very firm footing in the legacy finance world as well preston welcome to bankless it's great to have you guys great to be here looking forward to this looking forward to learning perfect i'm so glad you said this because i think this is what listeners really want to hear preston is an adult conversation between ethereums and bitcoiners uh where they listen to each other they're not just rattling off talking points on on twitter they're trying to understand each other where maybe they share values where maybe the points of difference are and i hope that um we're able to have that today yeah absolutely you know where i think would be great to start actually for for bankless listeners who who haven't heard sort of your story a little bit is kind of how you discovered bitcoin and when you discovered it what about bitcoin resonated with you so i mean i was a lot of people that listen to my show know my my background as far as just being a warren buffett person and um they've heard the journey because we've been doing it for a very long time doing the show for a long time and um you know from it it got really strange where you know i'm doing these discount cash flow models and really kind of just a stock investor purely really nothing else the bond market never really interested me as as far as being able to outperform equities um we were studying ray dalio in particular and we were studying ray dalio's long-term debt cycle and we were studying uh just how he invests which is really kind of very unique and way different than the way that warren buffett invests and so that was for me really uh kind of a fascinating piece to it because here you have a guy who's pretty much a stock buffett is pretty much a stock investor um if you if you plowed into like geico and things like that he was doing a lot of fixed income stuff at very strategic times and you're in your typical like seven to eight year credit cycles but outside of that i mean it was really straightforward didn't really mess around with commodities definitely didn't really mess around with uh currencies other than just hedging currency risk from an operational standpoint within its businesses and so i start studying ray dalio and here's a guy who 15 percent of his portfolio around that that amount is purely dedicated to currencies and commodities you have pretty much the rest of his portfolio that's making up this mix between equities and bonds and not only that but he's levering a bond position and just like the whole the whole portfolio construction was just so different than buffett and then he starts explaining and and in some of his material he starts talking about these long-term debt cycles and i'm like holy hell what is this this is so different i gotta understand this and his performance was exemplary yeah um you know he blew up and i think it was like the early 80s but ever since that point his performance was just like you know similar to buffett's uh close to 20 percent kind of numbers i know in the 2008 2009 crash the market was down 60 and ray and in one of his you know more premier funds he was up positive like nine percent for the year and so um i'm looking at this and i'm analyzing it i'm saying there's something here i need that i'm totally missing from a macro standpoint and you come out of like the uh the value investing hardcore buffett uh style of investing in and the mindset is just ignore macro it's not even worth your time it's too complex can't understand it so just ignore it and just focus on the micro and do your valuations and try to find the the highest irr for internal rate of return relative to you know whatever stocks you're kind of looking at so long story short i uh i'm studying dalio and he has gold in his portfolio and i'm saying you know anybody in the bucket community is like saying gold is just a useless rock it's a useless rock that doesn't kick off any cash flows and so why in the hell would you own it well because buffett's rationale is is basically like if you want an inflation hedge preston go buy stocks right because that's an adequate inflation head so what are you doing mess around with gold yeah and he even gets into there's some really neat shareholders letters from like the early 80s where he because you know you go back into that time and you look at what inflation was doing back then it was you know 16 on the 10-year treasury and things like that in 1981 and so he has some really interesting comments about inflation is particularly with equities and how you want to own a company that has a lot of intangible assets and not tangible assets because of the turnover and the cycle rate and you're buying things that are losing value when you're holding a lot of inventory and just a really kind of a fascinating discussion so he he addresses it and it gets to your point um you know own that instead of a pet rock that's not doing anything productive so dalio changed the way i see that in a dramatic way like very dramatic and this is like all through our show right so like we're doing the show and like people can hear how like like our opinion thesis is changing our minds are warping and and it was like learning in a very public kind of way and um so in in short i mean the reason rey has gold in the portfolio like the basic thesis is really kind of for currency collapse or for like severe currency debasement it protects against that it's kind of the ying and the yang to the currencies and that's why uh commodities and currencies kind of have this inverse relationship inside of his all-weather portfolio and that's why they're equally weighted i want to say it's about seven and a half percent for each one of them um because his opinion is as as one's doing performing well the other would be not performing well and then he's trying to find where would i want to own when would i want to have the heavy weighted currencies and then which currencies would i want to be heavyweighted in in comparison to that to balance it out so uh long story short i'm sorry to keep kind of going on about it but in short gold made a lot of sense for currency the basement in the portfolio and then you know i'm a millennial barely a millennial uh some might argue i'm not but i think i'm right there maybe the last year of a millennial and uh you know gold made sense to me at that point and naturally bitcoin made sense as well and so this is in the 2015 time frame we did a show about bitcoin back probably first or second quarter of 2015. uh it's kind of funny to listen to because we're like what the hell is this who is the person that like how in the world can something that uh you know doesn't have a known founder possibly like set on a global stage and people take it seriously you guys are just figuring it out on the show yeah as you went on we were figuring out on the show but you know what was interesting is even back then uh and at the end of the show i tell people i took a position in bitcoin and the reason why i bought it back then is because for me it had such a massive asymmetric upside because of how sick and broke the traditional markets are specifically the fixed income market in traditional markets um you know i i was of the opinion back in 2008 2009 that nothing was fixed from that so as we went into the because you know i was i was invested in the market during that period of time and uh everything that they did from a central banking standpoint after 2008 2009 for me did not make any sense whatsoever i was like well this is a short-term fix right all the qe um and then they did more and then they did operation twist and now they're buying the longer end of the bond now it's normal it's not even that's right no one even questions it and so i'm looking at this and saying okay so what's the end game here like there's no way we can keep doing this without there being some type of repercussion and so come 2015 gold was starting to make sense i see bitcoin i'm saying i'm going to own a little bit of this because if this is if this would play out because i don't see the end state um this could become extremely valuable stuff um and the settlement can can take you know back then it was only you know every 10 minutes you could settle so that was that was a major challenge and kind of a setback at that point in time to own it um because of the settlement time and there was a scaling concern back at that period of time when we covered it and a lot's changed since but um yeah that's what got me in okay so i i think i see sort of your path here right so coming from from buffett right and then you absorb that world and your long-term time horizon all of the things like he preaches and says and then dalio is is all about the the credit cycles and you know what at the 70 to 90-year sort of cycles yeah and within those cycles somebody like warren buffett can be completely right and thrive yes but when those cycles change and dalio argues that we're in the late stages of a fiat credit cycle when those cycles change the buffets of the world can be really really wrong and you have to be ready for those stages so you saw that and i get that um what's interesting to me preston and you've probably been studying dahlia for longer than i have though is dalio hasn't yet fully made the connection to bitcoin and maybe that is the millennial in you coming out because he sees what's going on right with with you know like he's like you should hold the gold as a result you know non-sovereign wealth stores are your friend commodities gold these sorts of things but he hasn't yet connected that to the digital and i wonder at some level whether that's just a product of when he was born like the generation he didn't grow up with computers in the digital being a fundamental part of his life so maybe it's just harder for him to make the connection i know he was at the coindesk conference he's kind of coming around a little bit so he's maybe getting close and if anybody can change their mind on some something it's someone like dalio who's very rigorous very analytical but that seems to be the additional step that that you took is just jumped into the digital and i'm curious if you think that's kind of just a product of what the time period in which you grew up i i think the thing that's really kind of held ray back is he it appears through some of his writings that he has been very concerned about uh government shutting it down and just if if it really did start to run that somebody was going to come in and be able to stop it i think in your like you said he's down there at the conferences talking about he recently made an announcement on cnbc that he doesn't see the dollar continuing to be the global reserve asset just like stan druckenmiller um the other thing that he said recently that i think is uh what i feel like i've been screaming about for a while which is uh he he made the comment uh to the tune of like i'd rather have bitcoin than have bonds yeah and people on cnbc were kind of scratching ahead like everyone keeps talking about bitcoin versus gold but no one's talking about bitcoins versus bond what he's getting at is um if bitcoin starts to become the new store of value globally what does that do for debt in general and i don't think too many people can have connected these dots as to what it means for the impairment of debt because your interest rates and boy i'll tell you and i've been i've been saying this on a couple different shows what if these stable coin interest rates that that you can get in defy that you can get on centralized uh exchanges um i know when you go peer-to-peer on like a usdc token like it's like 20 percent right what if what if this is the big what if that i'm trying to propose and put out there to people what if that is the real risk-free rate right what if what if the cost of capital is double digits we won't even say 20 let's just say it's 10 we could say it's 5 because when you look at asset prices specifically like equities in real estate or whatever it all comes down to interest rates and if they're priced and i'll be generous and just say it's it's two percent or three percent today is where the equity markets priced but let's just say that the real risk-free rate is 10 like the amount that they have to come down the the equity prices have to come down if those stable coin interest rates are the real new risk-free rate i mean you're watching equity markets sell off by like 80 from where they're at right now in bitcoin terms in in in that new emerging global currency that is basically taking over from fiat currencies as we know it and so that for me is the big like really mind-blowing scenario at play globally uh that i just don't think anybody's talking about i don't think anybody looks at that as being like real risk-free rates but think about it like who's stepping in and saving anybody with these rates like nobody's yeah and that's what's interesting about crypto right so another headline on cnbc is always talks about the uh the volatility of crypto um but but but sometimes i wonder if like a crypto is maybe the more free open market maybe crypto is the last free market on the planet everything else is just artificially suppressed or like pushed down and certainly interest rates are so that has a an effect on every single other asset class and maybe like our world is the real world it's just like it back that's totally what a matrix mean like like we're in the real world cnbc is in the fake uh synthetic world and like we're seeing all of the raw volatility and craziness that is a free and open market i mean just think and that's totally how i feel but just think how insane it is for people to think that the 10-year treasury is not manipulated right like they're they're printing a bunch of money they're going straight into the bond market they're buying the bonds and they're shoving that cash into the system and they're clawing those bonds off the market which is either pegging the yields at whatever percent or lower and so now they're talking about yield curve control like uh it looks like the 10-year treasury's kind of cooled off but like if that thing got up near two percent they were going to step in they were going to do yield curve control which means we'll print whatever amount of money that's needed to ensure the yield doesn't go higher than two percent and we're just going to keep shoving it into the system and clone those bonds out of the market right that's manipulated that's not the cost of capital is not real at that point it's just imaginary land so i'm glad we're kind of starting this with um the things that we we all agree on right yeah like the reasons we're in crypto and i think we hit on two just just then uh as we went through kind of your background and introduction your story one is i think um all of us agree that we are in this late stage fiat cycle fiat monies are probably doomed and by doomed i mean i don't think it's the end of fiat but there's going to have to be a jubilee a reset a money printing event and i think we also both agree back to your back back to your comment that like money printing does suck because um a small group of bankers should not have the ability to decide who gets freshly printed money and when they could print it i mean that is an unfair uh we use the term often on bank less credibly neutral this is the antithesis of credible neutrality right a small group of individuals have controls over the buttons to print their money and they could they can print it however they want over the last 10 12 15 years it's gone primarily to the banking class and the wealthy right now it's maybe it's shifting to to labor but that's probably not a good system to uh to base our monetary system on so those two things we agree i want to get to a third that i think we agree on and that is this concept of self-sovereign money that individuals rather than faceless governments and banks should have more power in our financial system and for self-sovereign money to happen we have to have decentralization decentralization is necessary for anti-fragility is that something that you deeply believe as well preston absolutely yeah and then i'll also also follow up with uh some sort of belief that you know markets and monies should be out of the hands of top down control and more of a bottom-up emergent phenomenon um i think i think uh preston you you might also agree with that statement too yeah i think for anybody who believes in freedom and free markets and the power being at the lowest level within within the individual like which you would read in the constitution of the united states um i don't know how anybody could see it any other way right because what it does is it is it forces upon elected officials to make decisions reasonably they're not just going to go to war with another nation state when there's extreme repercussions for the cost the real cost that that it takes to do something like that and so when when money is free or i should say currency is free that whole incentive structure and that decision making that's being made at the highest levels gets totally warped almost like you know somebody who's on it who's on a drug how their brain and their their rewards and uh um penalties of their decision making get warped how important to you preston i'm curious back on this self-sovereign topic is the the peer-to-peer nature of crypto or something like like bitcoin right so like really high okay okay so let's talk about that because i feel like there are two elements of decentralization in something in a system like bitcoin one is like hands-off decentralized issuance right you're like no one has the ability to print the algorithm controls the printing of new bitcoin but the second piece of decentralization is anybody can transfer bitcoin peer-to-peer from one person to the other and it strikes me that some in the bitcoin community value one and not the other some value both some value one hot more highly than the other of course we have the bitcoin cash fork we all know like about that yeah but but the reason i'm curious too is because like some who only uh value the the issuance side of things might say things like oh it would be really great if we had like um a paper like a a a government fiat that was uh bitcoin backed right like a paper sort of fiat that that but like you've removed the ability to have the peer-to-peer sort of nature almost like a bitcoin standard but we're not necessarily using the bitcoin network itself how do those two line up to you is is the peer-to-peer nature of bitcoin as important as the hands off the issuance policy side you know for me that was this was just an argument that was much more of a debate back in like the 2017-2016 time frame i mean really anything before the bitcoin cash fork it was a big debate within the community but i would i would say now um i don't really see within like you know hardcore bitcoiner community i don't see that really kind of being much of a concern because um at the base layer you got your sound money your issuance hasn't been changed the security hasn't been compromised by like anybody can run a full node it's super easy to do um but yet you're still being able to to step into layer two with the lightning network and and conduct transactions instantaneously at sizes that make sense for the amount of fees that you're being charged so like if i want to send somebody 500 bucks on lightning it's it's not too hard to use those rails to do it um so uh you know i i don't really see too much of an issue in the space with with respect to that you know piece right now so preston i think that's our base right so like there's a lot here that we agree on right and and the last one being sort of self-sovereign money i might add um digital because neither david or myself or anybody who listens to bankless is really excited about non-sovereign uh physical assets like gold right i mean because we do skew more millennial we think the world is going digital like for sure don't bet against that i mean i just don't know how anybody in this day and age could think that we're going to go back to trading rocks and and paper currencies on top of that that makes sense to me either yeah so let's talk maybe we're going to get to some topics maybe that are kind of the crux of disagreements uh between the bitcoin and ethereum space and we have a few i'm gonna just like throw them out here uh as a table of contents we won't get on them now but i think one of the things we probably want to talk about preston is proof of work versus proof of stake in the trade-offs of those two things um another thing that seems important is uh monetary policy so fixed supply of bitcoin versus the security trade-offs that ethereum might make um the third is bitcoiners often don't think of eth as a store of value where ethereans do and increasingly do think of eth as a store of value monetary asset a money as we might say we should talk about that another thing i think bitcoiners and ethereans can disagree about is the importance of decentralization and when we say decentralization what aspects of decentralization like most matter and maybe that's less a disagreement and more sort of a a conversation or like a mutual back and forth learning um and then the last the last piece i'd like your thoughts on is um i guess the the the holiness of bitcoin right so there is this idea that hey bitcoin was first and when bitcoin was made it was made well and there's no need to tinker it with it right that that mean like hey i'm here to fix bitcoin like nobody fixes bitcoin it was it was made and you shouldn't tinker with it and there's like an offshoot of that which breeds i think possibly some maximalism at least we want to have the discussion of uh maximalism what that means to you so that's kind of a table of contents grab bag for the episode uh is there anything else on your mind you think we should discuss no i love that that list that works great well before we get into the first one which is like proof of work versus proof of stake i i wonder if we could clear up some misconceptions uh for for a minute do you think that there are any misconceptions that ethereans that people like looking into bitcoin might have about bitcoiners that you should clear up like one thing is um every bitcoiner i've met in real life has been like awesome like really cool really fun i mean david just i didn't go to miami but david just came back he's like i had a blast these people are great yeah the corners are lovely people they're very very nice in real life on twitter you can kind of find some nasty ones but and i've never met a mean bitcoiner in real life i think it's more of a function of just uh like when you're talking to somebody face to face you have this real like human interaction i think when you're on twitter i mean i'm just as guilty as the next person but it's so easy to like fire a shot um to somebody because it's not like it's it's virtual you don't even see a facial reaction right and i think it brings out the animal spirits and and that it's just so easy to fire these shots i mean there was one that i that i did today that i i wasn't you know if i i'm sure if i was sitting next to the person i would have been way nicer than just saying oh you're just i'm sure you're an academic from ivy league school or something like i said something like that and of course it wasn't like the nicest thing but um i think it's more of a function of of that dynamic than anything else i think most people are well intended um but as a human being there's gaps in everybody's thinking i don't care who you are like you're a product of your past and your interactions and the people that you've associated with in your preconceived notions and that's kind of led you to the place where you sit today so that's where i sit that's where you guys sit and there's going to be deltas in the way that we see things and so yeah um anyway what other are there any other misconceptions like one thing i think a lot of ethereums hear some uh rhetoric from bitcoin are saying eth is a scan a scam like flat out scam do you think eth is a scam um i'd let me let me put it this way i think that everybody who's working especially the engineers that are working on this are well intended i just think that um i think there's personally i think there's a lot of risk um technical risk moving forward with and not just ethereum but really kind of uh a lot of these other blockchains and store value uh smart chains that are out there um and i'm saying that relative to how i view bitcoin from a technical standpoint in the maturation of where it's at right now and you got to remember when i'm looking at all of this i'm looking at it primarily with a with a value investing kind of lens of i'm gonna buy this thing that i think is going up in value and what do i think the value what do i think that the the potential appreciation and value is relative to all my opportunity costs and then what are the risks associated with all those forms of investment right so i'm looking at it from that kind of lens um so when i say you know i think your question was do i think it's a scam um i don't think it's i don't think it's a scam i think what you guys are trying to do is create a virtual machine that's that anybody can program right i get the i get what you guys are trying to do i'm concerned whether not how do i say this but been in a nice way um you don't have to be that nice we could still be friends yeah no no but i but i think it's i think it does a huge disservice to to say i think people are scamming i think they're doing this i think people are well intended but i but i'm concerned with the longevity of this being able to be pulled off at scale over a long duration of time and so like that's another thing that i think is important for people to understand my thinking is like i'm looking 10 years out i'm looking 15 years out like what's going to stand the test of time and so like whenever i look at eth and i look at where it's at today as a proof-of-work uh you know blockchain and it trying to migrate to proof of stake and um you know then doing the sharding and everything else like it it is a enormous technical feat that i think is ahead of you and you guys understand uh the engineering of it way more than me because i just haven't invested the time because i see all of this as being risk relative to this other thing that i think is going to perform very well especially when you start talking about thousands of percent of return in such a short period of time for me it's just not worth my time to go and invest uh invest my time into trying to understand all the nuances when i when i think there's still so much risk to to be resolved there so i don't know if that kind of answers your question but no that that's really great and you you started when you were talking about when you found bitcoin you you saw that it was it mimics the properties of gold but with the asymmetric returns right and so maybe maybe trying to put myself into your shoes um you are saying why would i go and risk all of this asymmetric returns that i think is coming with something that has this like technical upgrade path so pressing my question to you is um most things that aren't bitcoin have some sort of like upgrade path like say for litecoin dogecoin all these like early bitcoin forks most things have a technical upgrade path uh and so like do you think that anything in the crypto space that has an upgrade path ahead of it is just kind of disqualified from what interests you as an investment for you personally no but uh from an investing standpoint i would rather see uh like all the fighters in the ring and watch them kind of devour themselves until it looks like a winner's starting to emerge and i know that sounds terrible because i think um you know i think a lot of people in the space really are trying to change the world just the space in general they're they're trying to get away from the jp morgans and they're trying to allow people to go peer to peer and i am all about it like all about it you're all about bankless i'm all about bankless i'm all about people taking the power back from the contillionaire uh system that we currently are experiencing because i think a lot of the social unrest we see in the world is a direct result of the monetary policy that the inflationary monetary policy that's been applied for 80 years um i think it like the the polarization of politics is a direct result of this um these policies and i don't think very many people are connecting the pieces together so when i look at that because you know let's say we fast forward five to ten years into the future um and uh all of this is really starting to take root you're gonna have countries that are still trying to uh prevent people from going peer-to-peer in lending and borrowing and decentralized finance and so um do i want decentralized finance to be successful hell yeah i do i think that uh at the end of the day and this is really interesting when you look at risk-free rates today they're completely managed by governments and and for people in finance they would find it laughable to think that a risk-free rate could actually be generated in a peer-to-peer market but i'm of the opinion that in the in the future like five to ten years from now that your risk-free rate might actually be rates that are generated in in the peer-to-peer market specifically because you can actually see the escrow and you can actually see the addresses between the the two parties taking place and so when i think about centralized financing like uh companies you know c5 today i would argue that they're doing these these baskets of uh balance sheet management between tokens and things i see that as more risk than peer-to-peer lending wow i actually didn't uh expect you to say that but we'll put that in the mutual things we agree about like defy hell yeah is what i heard you say like i mean some bitcoiners don't like d5 but you're not one of them um i i think that's probably a strong statement maybe maybe i'm out to lunch here but um i think i think that bitcoiners want defy but i think they want it on a protocol that is truly decentralized that no government entity could come in and um disrupt it shut it down whatever right um that's what they want and they want it to be in some type of technical solution that has a lot of maturation is what i would imagine but maybe i'm speaking for preston and not necessarily the bitcoin community but that's how i personally see it preston you said that you would really kind of just rather just wait for a winner to emerge right and wait for um really things to mature before you really get into what might be an investment outside of bitcoin and that was really reminiscent to me about kind of lin alden's approach towards ethereum as well she was like well it's a young technology you know hasn't really proved itself um but but i would say that ethereum has proved itself from everything below ethereum onwards right like ethereum is is six years old and a lot of bitcoiners kind of say gave very similar criticisms to ethereum in its early days when ethereum was just one or one or two years old or even the same criticisms before it was even born like technical risk it can never upgrade the roadmap isn't achievable and granted the biggest things about ethereum's roadmap are still ahead of it you know sharding proof of sake eip1559 but at the same time uh ethereum has attracted basically all of the the crypto economic developers that that really want to play ground to do research and development and then implement you know uh measured upgrades that we think are good for the protocol and we've as the ethereum network has actually gone through a large number of successful hard forks and successful protocol upgrades and so we have this you know growing track record of successful protocol upgrades meanwhile we have this immense amount of network effects on in d5 with peer-to-peer lending borrowing and lending applications uh you know options applications all these other financial applications and we are just not seeing that same sort of ecosystem show up on any other crypto network nor are we seeing any developers show up on any other crypto network and so my question to you is when you are looking for some winner to emerge out of this like you know battle to the death why why hasn't ethereum like take that box yet for you like what else are you looking for really the the thing that i have concerned with on ethereum is just this migration from the proof of work over to proof of stake and then also uh 64 blockchain uh you know sharding that's then going to be you know i think you guys are calling it 1.5 you know after the porting portion of it takes place um then on uh beyond that i would just say i have concerns about what happens from a centralization standpoint in five or ten years from now when you're under a proof-of-stake system because um and i'm sure you guys have heard all these arguments right but i'm just gonna kind of reiterate them because you know i i buy into this uh when you have a proof of stake system i think the exchanges are going to become pretty darn powerful for providing a service of staking the coins and then what does that mean for validators now my understanding is that under eth2 you guys are going to then have this mechanism that the validators are are getting randomly swapped between those 64 chains which might provide a really unique solution to mitigate some of that concern as far as the centralization of the validators but going back to my investing roots so anytime i'm analyzing a company and they're saying our free cash flows might look like this in the future or they might grow at this rate uh at a 10 compound or for the next five years i immediately put that more in the into the speculative bin than the investing bin uh because it's not something that's actually happening or present today and so that's although i i agree with you uh that eth has kind of proved itself as the biggest uh you know fighter in the space today it's under all these technical um circumstances that are all about the change right and so that that transition and that pivot for me is very concerning from an investor's standpoint now uh i'll tell you this something that i find really interesting so obviously i'm looking at the price action and i can see the performance over the last three months and ethan's done very well relative to bitcoin um and so i i obviously asked myself what's driving that why is that price going up and i would be and this is more of a question to you guys do you think that the staking that took place um back in uh you know december i think it was in beginning of december that people were able to start staking their their eth into the beacon chain uh do you think that that staking basically was almost like a having event as far as uh scarcity of coins that were then sucked out of the market which then made more scarce to drive up the price i i don't think so because the people that are staking no kind of there's this game with staking is like kind of no one wants to be first right like no one wants to be first through the door so there were some people i think vitalik was probably put some of his e through i think the ef made of like deposit a little bit of east just to kind of signal confidence and then some very early ogs uh put their eth first as well like the people that have been following the space and been waiting for staking uh and and what this has been verified uh decently well on chain is that a decent supply of the eath that went into the deposit contract was very very dormant eath like some of the eat that went into the deposit contract hadn't moved since uh the actual ico inception date right it would had been dormant for six years um and and uh at the time of speaking we actually have 4.5 of all eth in the deposit contract uh whereas there's 11 percent of eth inside of uh crypto exchanges and and with inside of the deposit contract that's like the beta for staking that's not even like you know full production of staking where everyone can go in and out and and as they see see fit right this is are you committed to ethereum because you don't know when we're actually going to merge and so like you're going to put your ether in here and then you'll get it back whenever we merge all right at some point when we merge the the uh barrier to staking gets really really low like consumer level hardware um even in with uh innovations such as staking pools decentralized taking pools like rockapool with lido finance the goal of staking is to allow everyone to stay inside their own homes and it's very much an anti-centralization vector whereas the staking on exchanges is always a concern and the way that the ethereum community has answered for that concern is by making it trivially easy to stake at home with and with even like only portions of the steak right you need to informally in the code you need to stake 32 eats but if you don't have 32 eth you can participate in a staking pool which is its own defy app right um and so uh the ethos of ethereum is to really offer optionality in staking right now the ogs went first and and that eth was never on the secondary market to begin with um i think really where where that price rise came from was some level of the market uh putting confidence in that staking will actually happen whereas you know if you ask people in 2017 2018 2019 some people started to believe that oh yeah proof of sake will never actually get here um the launch of the deposit contract plus the depositing of what is now five and a half million eth into the deposit contract i think was a signal of confidence along with uh we had parallel signals of confidence of eip1559 getting approved and with a date for inclusion which is sometime at the end of july i think that the big run-up in price was um some sort of skepticism narrative violation that's that's my take as to why the eth price ran like it how it did say that again skepticism uh narrative violation there there was a very much an anti-ethnic proof of sake will never ship eip will uh one five five nine will never ship and now that's that skepticism has kind of that that narrative of the skepticism has kind of been violated okay yeah so um is it i want to talk about the 1559 thing with you guys so uh you know my understanding is that the 1559 is going to happen in in july that's been approved did you say that it's been approved okay yeah by like rough consensus so everyone kind of gave the thumbs up and no one really gave the thumbs down so that's how we have consensus in ethereum and and how was and i i truly don't know so when you guys say that you have consensus i know with bitcoin so like we're going through the taproot uh you know upgrade and the miners are the first ones and then they all basically signal with the blocks that they're mining that they support it and now it's going to keep going through so for you guys how are you guys uh like how was the 1559 approved because i have no idea yeah there's this eip process and it's very very rough and it's it's purposefully informal in the sense that like there's no vote there's no vote counting uh because as a system we know that if we make a formalized governance process that's an attack vector right like if you lay out the rules then you tell the attacker what the rules are and you don't want to inform what an attacker would be attacker you don't want to tell them what the rules are you want it to be rough uh and so you know eips get proposed it goes through an all devs call basically a zoom call with all the core devs who work on these different client teams and loosely all the client teams are the people that are ultimately responsible of putting that improvement protocol into code and then actually updating the clients and the clients all organize and coordinate with each other and then there's some sort of like kind of community consensus process right there was this one eip forever ago called praguepow and the miners really really wanted it but basically no one in the community wanted it uh yet the miners had their sort of influence in the eip process the eip was proposed then the community learned that the eip was being discussed and like pushed back very very heavily and when i say the community i'm talking about people on reddit people on twitter people just making their voices heard people made a website at vote no on on progpow and you know it's all about it's much very much like a merit meritocracy as to who can be in these all-core dev calls uh you really have to show face for a long time and really prove credibility and clout and allow just like how kind of like bitcoiners really kind of rise to the rise to the top of bitcoin the bitcoin community based on their merits and contributions uh same thing with the ethereum core devs and the leadership people like you know step up as a leader and then they are uh rise up through the merit to their contributions and there's this rough consensus there's this famous ethereum like video in an all-core devs call where they people ask it came time to figure out if we were going to include this eip or not include this eip and the there was a you know please signal if you have anything that you if you if you don't want this thing included right and people were really confused as to whether they had consensus or not but people like oh i guess we have consensus let's move forward uh and that's and it was this very chaotic or like what i like to call chaotic organization way of moving forward and that's how we uh make sure that the community never gets pissed off when something gets included and that uh it really just has to happen by some sort of pseudo super majority but at the end of the day your your full node operators are voting with the software so whoever's running correct yeah whatever this is it's the same process it's a similar product different community but a similar process as uh bitcoin right it's like other chains other smart contract platforms they have like token vote governance right which in my opinion kind of embeds plutocracy into the system you have the most stake you the most tokens you have the most capital you get to say what the next upgrade is but ethereum's upgrade path works the same way as bitcoins in that like ultimately there's court dev teams they develop the software they push the software in ethereum's case there's multiple you know clients you can run bitcoin's case there's one client you can run um so users those that run the nodes actually get to choose what software you want to run and when the fork comes out they could choose whether to update or not so ultimately it's the it's the no those who are running the nodes that like decide all right that's that's the check imbalance on on power here so my question for you guys is when you when you migrate over to eth2 and you're gonna have four different types of full note or you're gonna have four different types of nodes which node at that point would it be the super full node would be the only one that like let's say there's a discrepancy between the community and you have a 50 50 split um which which full node is the one that is able to basically say this is this is truly the software we're running is that the super full node or okay so help me understand how that would work yeah so first off there's there's the when you say different kinds of nodes there's different client teams and there's different client softwares and so there's literally four different clients that will produce four different nodes that all can actually agree on the same state but what i think you're talking about pressing is you're talking about um yeah there's an archive node uh there's like a full node there's a prunes node uh and um the everyone who's running a node is running a full node uh there there are like light clients and stateless ethereum that's being worked on but when we talk about nodes we're talking about full nodes um now there's uh the difference between a full node and an archive node and a full node is something that is roughly about 150 gigabytes an archive node is that big one that like really scares bitcoiners multiple terabytes it's like multiple terabytes right uh and the difference between a full node and an archive node is an archive node is full node plus computation uh if you if you have a full node you can produce an archive node with sufficient computation but the full node has the full state of ethereum the full verification of every single transaction that that's ever happened and that's the the bare minimum thing that needs to be part of the network to achieve consensus and that's the thing that's like very very manageable as a piece of hardware and software yeah so we'll know it's like 250 uh gigs or something like that you can just talking to vitalik last night it was 150 gigabytes that's that's for the state and then you have to the history as well um so um yeah and but like an archive node is multiple terabytes but a full node you can actually sync in like half a day you know uh 12 hours 15 hours from a home internet connection um an archive node that's the thing that you really can't run at home that an individual can't run but those who run archive nodes are doing that for like faster queries a sort of thing to like power adapt for faster query response times it doesn't have anything to do with actually validating uh the network my question is more oriented to the eth2 than kind of what you guys have right now so like the uh super full node is that's downloading the the full data and the beacon chain and every shard block and every reference is that going to be needed for the consensus of the code or can you get away with like a top level node or a single shard node like like i guess when i'm when i'm looking at that and you're going to have these nodes that are like a single shard node that's a one piece of the puzzle and and i'm aware of like fraud proofs and things like that as far as them uh validating um these blocks as they come through but from a forking standpoint is really kind of the the essence of my question so if the community um let's say eth2 goes through whatever year we're in and um there's a discrepancy between the community as to a certain path and there's a 50 50 split in in the direction which one of those nodes are going to be the ones that are able to uh say well you have an opinion but this is this is truly what's being run here um which one of those would be the would it be your super full node is what i would assume well you said um a sharding node so when you are validating on proof of stake you are validating one one chart and the computation that is required to do that is just for one shard all 64 shards go into one single node so an ethereum two node is still a complete note of all the shards so it's not like the shards are like accidentally like splintering off into different directions in the case of a fork so there's still only like if you have if you're running in an eth2 client you're running the full ethereum blockchain and that again it's really just no different from from bitcoin it's it's a full node that carries the current header of of the the state of ethereum um and and the the the and you can still produce an archive node from that um but it's it's always the full nodes that um at the genesis of ethereum i'm not sure what the state will be if the state is completely wiped clean because we're back onto a new we're back onto a new blockchain and the eth1 is now just a shard on there um but it's tr it's truly no different it's just it's just the full nodes from the client teams and the design goal here preston is uh have the ability to run that full node from a consumer laptop that is like a necessary design requirement to keep this decentralized i just i guess and it's it's definitely a technical roadblock for me because i just it's it's not my forte for sure it's also not our forte so i just i hear that and i'm just like i don't know how that could i just don't know how that could be possible to run that on a laptop especially as you're expanding into like these 24 different shards and a beacon chain and everything else i just don't know how that technically could happen but i'm sure if i tweeted it i would probably get a thousand people in my in my uh comments section to tell me this and that and everything else it is worth noting that like we uh so historically this this history that frequently bitcoiners talk about ethereum with this with this consensus and node operations at the beginning of ethereum it was very much a concern like the the speed of of hard disks over stalled state drives really bottlenecked how fast you could sync up with a chain and that was a very big cause for concern because if you can't sync up with it with the leading chain with it with the latest block then well then at some point you'll never actually get there and you were only going to be you know trusting a very few centralized centralized node operators and now that kind of solid state drives are kind of the status quo and now that the hardware of the world is upgraded that's also been mitigated but also at the same time a brand new ethereum one client came out just a couple weeks ago called aragon and now you and that's actually the fastest ethereum one client for in for sync speed uh ever and i think that that's what ryan was talking about when it's in half a day and that also made hard disks now viable to sync the eth1 chain so not only like moving forward is consumer hardware just getting better and more capable of supporting ethereum but ethereum client teams are actually innovating to make ethereum more capable for consumer hardware so it's actually improving in both directions simultaneously so preston let's uh let's maybe move back to your question of proof of work and proof of stake but like i do want to establish that um i think there's actually a a shared agreement here that both bitcoiners believe that individuals should be able to run a full bitcoin node on consumer hardware so do ethereums like we do like legit that's the entire point if we can't run eth2 validators not the archival nodes but validators on consumer hardware the thing doesn't work other chains smart contract platforms run thing and data run you know hardware and high performance data centers that can't be the case with eth2 we want to keep this thing decentralized so we could you could tweet it out on twitter get a bunch of responses you can listen to ethereum researchers like justin drake talk about the cryptography magic you can be like us and understand maybe like 50 of all of those things but um that is the design goal and that is the value system but let's get back to proof of work versus proof of stake because you said you had some other problems with um with proof of stake so one i think is the critique that uh the rich get richer can you talk about that a little bit what do you mean by that um in short when i think about what worked historically before we even went into a digital space the reason gold worked so well is because you know it's really kind of hard to find an ounce of it in the earth's crust because of the distribution of it and whatnot and the amount that there is um so when you look at why gold served the purpose it's very obvious from a scarcity standpoint why and then you look at the work that had to be performed with a shovel or whatever in order to pull it out of the ground it it makes sense real fast as to how it basically achieved its value um [Music] when i look at uh you know and if we were just going to take it to extremes because i think that's the best way to to understand something let's just say that uh a protocol had a pre-mine 100 pre-mine and there was no work performed on the units that were created inside of it and let's just say that it had a cap and that no more were going to be created and they were somehow able to decentralize the whole thing and then just issue out equally distribute those those units out to everybody with no work being performed um you're in a you're in a situation there where it's going to be hard to uh say what the value of those units are if there's not some type of utility to that network for everybody to use and then the utilities going to just naturally you know provide whatever value that might be when i think about proof of work and how it requires energy expense in order to generate the the units before they're issued what what's occurring in that situation is a re-capital investment in the hardware in order to um uh let me put it this way if you if you bought a mining rig four years ago and i bought one right now i have it i have a bigger advantage or i can capture more coins that's rare that the new entrant has an advantage over the old entrant right so like you you came into it four years ago it's harder for you to capture and mine the coins than it is for me and i think that what that does and when you look at proof of stake it's a little bit different if you had first access to the coins you now have an advantage over somebody who's now just coming in that's trying to capture them and and employ them into the network so i think that that's it's basically like so if you so one mental model uh we use for for staking tokens is that they are like tokenized asics right so like what are asics these are this is hardware but it's capital essentially right it costs a certain amount of money um tokens in ethereum ether as a token is like a tokenized asic but i think what you're saying is basically like asics in the hardware world they depreciate and they get old and so yeah after four years it's going to be completely obsolete after one or two years it's going to be half as good as as the newest model essentially and so these these tokens essentially these asics kind of expire and bleed out of the system whereas in ethereum the tokens um are permanent right they don't depreciate is what you're saying you're saying that that maybe leads to some churn well you're the person who's mining when you're when you're mining you have to be a great operator to continue to fetch the newest issuance of supply in the in to remain competitive in the process of securing the network right only the best operators the people who can man i mean i i'm not a miner but um i can see how competitive it can get especially if you're if you're subscribing to the cycles you know the the four-year cycles and that there's these bear markets and things like that and how they got to manage their derivative exposure for their energy costs and all this kind of stuff it is extremely difficult to do that effectively and to stay in business like you have to be a good operator to do it and so what it does is there's an incentive to continue to increase the security of the network by by buying new hardware and not using old hardware because of moore's law and you're also pushing the coins into the hands of the fittest operators that are then uh redistributing them back into society but are aren't these fittest operators aren't these the ones that are the best operators that do have the best connections to hardware and supply chains and like so i david actually got into this space i know his story because you know we do podcasts together he got out of this space because he was mining ether uh from his living room he used to we sued podcasts okay bathroom we have the mining equipment behind him when we like would do this podcast right over there yeah um and that was in uh ether's early days when you could do that from home you could no longer do that because of economies of scale because you had to be an operator with data center with like well i think that actually talks to the renewable energy piece more than anything else like i tell people when we talk about the rich get richer piece right because haven't we just undemocratized haven't we just given this like power to those who have these economies of scale and we've moved it david can stake from his apartment but like he can't run mining equipment from his apartment so like is that less decentralized and less democratic if you will no i would i would probably in no offense to you david i would just say that if david was really hell-bent on being a great minor he and if that was really his his core business what he would have done is he would have gone and found cheap renewable energy in order to continue to do his operation but instead he unplugged his his rigs and somebody else took on that responsibility or they bought new hardware and then think about the distribution of those coins it's not going to him as a first mover advantage it's going to somebody new that's that's actually finding the cheapest and most uh you know clean energy that that they could possibly find i tell people all the time if you want to get into the esg stuff just go ahead and plug a mining rig into the wall and see how long you last well well preston here what happened was i got washed out i got washed out by people that had economies of scale like i was making the the ethereum blockchain super secure in the comfort of my own home enjoying a free heating bill um and and then i got washed out by other people that had the capital to invest in the economies of scale and what i always get hung up with with the uh the and when the individual gets washed out for the for the large capitalized entities with the economies of scale it's it's a centralization vector uh and so like not only does like the footprint of bitcoin become very very instantiated in the physical world but like those supply chains become a part of the security of the bitcoin network uh and that physical instantiation i think is is a risk factor and this this argument that like btc gets this churn from from bitcoin miners being hyper competitive ultimately it's actually just turns into cell pressure and the the what i can't get it what i what i just have a fundamental disagreement with is like proof of work is supposed to be a security mechanism not a distribution or excuse me blockchains are supposed to be secured not distribution they are they are supposed to be maximum security and it's a i think it's more of a moral argument rather than an investment argument as to that bitcoin mining needs churn right it's actually not an argument that bitcoin is a good financial investment it's i think it's more of a moral argument as this is what i think good money looks like so as far as the centralization piece goes so miners can participate in whatever pool that they want if you don't like how the pool is uh you know managing whatever you can leave you can take your your mining rig so i don't see the whole centralization piece the the part about uh the hardware being centralized or that there are only being a few producers i think that's a valid concern and something that um is a huge opportunity for anybody that wants to try to start moving production and things like that outside of some type of countries that supply a lot of the hardware i think that that is something that's worthy of a discussion but as far as the actual um like you're you were saying that it went to economies of scale type operations i would tell you that it went to locations that was getting really super cheap uh i mean you guys saw the whole volcano thing today where i mean that's that's where this is all going to migrate to is the whole esg thing for me is is really a huge misnomer because i think that which what we're finding and the reason why people that were doing it out of their house initially which was extremely inefficient are it's moving to the places where it is becoming efficient and uh and and great operators that are able to manage the process i'm actually compelled by that argument uh there's bitcoiners really pound that you know bitcoin is green drum and i tend to kind of agree with that side to the to a lot of consternation from a lot of the ethereum people that i hang out with um but the the uh also also if we if we i i do a podcast with uh christian corollas on um from bitcoin magazine bitcoin media and he goes so far as to say is like not only is bitcoin going to be green but he's bitcoin is actually going to put power back into the grid out of the demand for bitcoin mining right yeah but then if if that's true then there actually is no more churn anymore except except for the hardware costs but if you have zero electricity costs or even negative electricity costs the whole rich gets richer argument comes back to the people that was able to instantiate their perpetual mining farm with never having to sell all that much bitcoin because they have free energy or even negative costing energy i think where a lot of uh bitcoiners go down the path of like store value is is exactly what we have right now they're looking at it more from hey if you've got a bunch of money let's just say you've got 100 million dollars worth of ease and it doesn't really require you to have to do anything from this point forward to still have an enormous vote in the future of you know transactions and so and then the concern about exchanges and i know you guys talked about how in uh e2 you guys are going to make it's very easy for anybody to basically run a fractional piece of a validator which i think is is a good thing but at the same time you're not able to control these exchanges and the ease that they're going to supply for people that are maybe just buying eth on the exchange and they just immediately go ahead and stake it because they're lazy and don't really care about too much on the decentralization front it's i i believe that it's still going to potentially provide a pretty good uh centralization concern and there's no way to know right like maybe maybe i'm dead wrong because you know we might be years out from that becoming a reality but i think that when you look at proof of stake i'm sorry when you look at proof-of-work um it's like i mean really the full nodes are really kind of calling the shots on the bitcoin network i have no concerns on the centralization of bitcoin right and i think proof of work has done an amazing job at being able to provide one other thing that i would tell you that i think um a lot of people even in the bitcoin space might not agree with me on um i think proof of work actually is driving a lot of the price action of this entire space um because so i'm sure you're familiar with the labor theory of value um that adam smith you know is is famous for which is you go out there you perform some type of labor and then the cost of the units that are being harvested are a direct result of that most economists will spit on the labor theory of value and tell you that it's worthless i think in this really unique situation of bitcoin that it's actually valid and the reason i think it's valid is because uh it's commoditized and the hashing keeps going up so when you look at the hash rate and it keeps accelerating going up part of that's moore's law but i think the other part of it is just the sheer demand for the units and the work that's actually being performed and so if that's valid and that there's this i would i would look at it like if if we were selling wheat on on a corner of a street and the line was just getting longer and longer and longer for the wheat we could make the uh conclusion that whatever work is being performed back there and expended in order to bring it up to the table to sell it that there's this one-to-one kind of uh comparison for the amount of work that's being performed based on the the constant demand flow to consume it and i and i see bitcoin in a very similar ways and i think at the root of that is proof of work so as the as these havings occur each four years i think one of the reasons and i don't know if ethereum people laugh at this or not but i take the stock to flow evaluation very seriously and the reason why i do is because i think it's actually a representation of the electrical expense for the number of units that are now flowing and being dropped into the market and that's why we see these waves that happen almost literally down to the day for the bottoms the the bare bottoms and the peaks are almost exactly four years apart and i think that what's driving that is is at the engine of all that is this proof of work mechanism that's actually putting a price tag of the electrical expense for the number of units in the scarcity as it keeps ratcheting up every four years so you're a big believer preston that like the four year having cycles are super important and that that these scarcity shocks every four years are they have a material impact yes on on bitcoin cycles yeah and i think to be honest with you i think proof of work is is an enormous part of that can i just share the story i have no proof well i mean the stock to flow model right i mean i guess it's held up over time it's kind of that chart going up right um and where i think it's hard for ethereum because it's proof of work it's been proof of work since inception but where i think it's harder for that to be seen in the price of ethereum is that the monetary policy has changed um you know i've seen the chart of kind of like how it's with bitcoin it's so systematic like you know exactly what in the world is going to happen when it's going to happen and like i mean it's just it's clockwork balancer is defy's most powerful automated market maker typical

crazy to you at first because it does sound a little crazy the first time you're hearing it but i want to blend what we're just talking about with proof of stake and the next conversation which is monetary policy issuance policy because these things go hand in hand so right now the ethereum issuance is about four and a half percent annually i think it's like one and a half percent annually for bitcoin something to that effect maybe it's 1.3 something or something to that effect something close to that so bitcoin definitely has the supply scarcity uh advantages at this point in time but that may not be the case for long because there are two supply shock catalysts that are coming very quickly to ethereum and as you said like ethereum doesn't have this four-year cadence uh schedule an issuance it's issuance policy is minimum necessary issuance and when we get to proof of stake we need a lot less issuance to secure the network but let me run them both by you so the first is something you've probably heard about which is eip1559 press net you've heard about this i assume yeah okay so summertime what happens sometime june august an update is going to go through and this is in the regular ethereum mainnet eth1 as we call it all of the transaction fees a large portion of the transaction phase uh like hundreds like tens of millions a day at this point in time are going to start being burnt uh instead of going directly to minors right so this is this is kind of um like a a variable supply shock right but it's definitely supply shock so if if part of your bulk case for bitcoin is well it goes up because miners don't have as much bitcoin to sell this is absolutely the case with ethereum um because like a whole chunk of the supply rather than going back to miners is actually just getting burnt permanently and this is variable because it depends on block space demand on ethereum but block space demand on ethereum lately has been very high this could go up this could go down over time but it's definitely a catalyst so you've got that in effect that will bring down issuance a little bit like say a percent or so annually this will vary um the next supply shock happens when proof of work gets turned off so when ethereum's like ethereum talks about eth2 there's no actual monolithic eth2 that is like suddenly here at some level staking has already been active since december 2020 and eth2 is going to be implemented in phases all kind of an ethereum upgrade path there is really no eth2 there's kind of like staking is put in place and proof of work gets turned off and then later sharding gets put in place and that is what we call eth2 right it's all kind of ethereum and so what happens probably within the next nine to 12 months let's call it um q1 2022 is all of the the 4.5 percent issuance on proof of work may gets replaced by proof of stake issuance but the nice thing about proof of stake and there's a great podcast we did with ethereum researcher justin drake uh who goes into this is it can be much more efficient from a capital efficiency perspective versus proof of work so it takes a lot less capital at stake to secure the ethereum network in the staking economy than it does in a proof of work network so the the rough order of magnitude is like it's a it's a 10x improvement so issuance and proof of stake gets to go down to about one percent annually per year and that fluctuates based on how many people stake the more people at stake the more issuance on the ethereum network the fewer the the less issuance uh and that's all market driven and and completely open and variable so what that in effect does we have eip 1559 this summer starts burning ether right um and then we have proof of work turning it off and we get to this thing that sounds silly as a meme it's called ultrasound money which is just basically a play on words like it's sound money but it might even be negative issuance right if eip is totally maxed eip 1559 is totally maxed out we're burning more eath than we're actually minting on an annual basis we might get into the negative territory some years and actually have a negative issuance rate so from a stock to flow ratio right again you can't model all of these variables but you can start to put some financial models in place in fact like we've done some of that on bank list what would it look like in an optimistic scenario for block space demand what would it look like if 30 million eath was staked versus 5 million eat sticks you can get some parameters in terms of what this might look like in the future but it's absolutely going to mean if this is successful there's execution risk you talked about that in the intro but like if the execution risk is is mitigated put aside if this actually happens we're going to see a massive supply shock uh in eth and an ossified much more solidified uh monetary policy does that sound crazy to you like so that so so first off i think that this could be bullish for the price doesn't mean i'm going to buy it because of my concerns like i outlined earlier as far as the technical risk but as far as just the sheer shock of the lack of issuance going out i think it could be bullish for the price now where i think i have a concern for the use of the protocol so one thing that we've learned uh you know once we once we started having a free-floating currency the thing that we learned is that it created a major incentive between nation states to debase their currency in order to attract other currencies into that local jurisdiction so like if the dollar would debase itself and become the dollar would be get weaker what it did is it attracted the euro the yen into the united states and it was beneficial for for uh businesses because we were attracting all that capital into the country and then vice versa so then when the us would debase their currency now all of a sudden the europeans had the debase there so that they could suck the dollars and the euros back over into their into their jurisdiction because they had a weaker currency so what my concern would be is eth is trying to uh have this this protocol that incentivizes people to come and use and uh you know burn gas on their on their protocol in order to run all these programs and and uh decentralized finance and whatnot right like you got all this activity in all this utility that you're trying to use on on the protocol but my concern is if you start getting into this super sound money and you start appreciating the value of the eth what might happen is you might actually incentivize the use of using other chains basically cashing out the the appreciation and the value of the e to go over and spend it on another chain's utility which is then going to create this situation where you almost have like a currency war kind of situation between protocols so my concern for for a protocol that's trying to do decentralized contracts is that if the value of it keeps going up um let's let's just look at you know we'll go back to the fiat currency because i think it actually provides a really interesting parallel here if the value of the dollar starts getting really strong those products and services inside the united states people aren't aren't doing them anymore they're not they're not coming here to buy them anymore because they're too expensive would you have the same thing happen with the eth protocol if the value of the underlying inherent token that's associated with it is appreciating in value would you have to debase it to try to incentivize use i do think some people get tripped up on this and david and i have even had some debates on this where it's like uh there there are two different markets in ethereum as there are in bitcoin right so let me just flip to the bitcoin world right in bitcoin there is bitcoin the asset that is an asset it's a money it's a currency right but then there's this other commodity inside of bitcoin called bitcoin block space right and like there's a set amount of block space in every block right and the only way you can buy that commodity which is bitcoin block space and get your bitcoin transaction in is by purchasing block space with what currency with bitcoin right um so there are these two different markets um in ethereum there are these two different markets as well there's eth the asset and that price can go up and down for a variety of reasons maybe it's because people are listing this podcast and they get super bullish on eth right so price goes up but they're not necessarily block space does not necessarily go up along with the asset price block space demand goes up when people want to use the ethereum chain more so that's a that's a separate market for block space and eth as an asset now you still buy block space with eth that is kind of the the currency it's like it's like petra dollars right it's like you know uh oil is priced in in in dollars largely um and but but uh oil is the commodity here and in dollars of the currency it's kind of the same thing in ethereum so these are separate markets so if the eth price if eath price goes up by like a factor of 10 that doesn't necessarily mean anything for block space now many times these things are correlated because if price is going up then people are like well i'm using uniswap and so we're using more block space and we're using more transaction fees and i'll pay much more to get my transaction through to buy more eth and all of the other d5 tokens are pumping too so i'm doing more of that so there's correlation but these markets are actually different so i'm not sure that you get that foreign currency debasement problem what you could get though preston and this is kind of a bear case for ethereum is like the presence of all sorts of other layer ones and smart contract platforms or even layer twos and side chains or even binance chain for example people might say well now we have all of this super cheap block space so why would we spend so much for on ethereum block space right and if that becomes true then what you'll see is eth gas price full eth block space demand go down eath revenue flowing to eip 1559 and getting burnt all of that going down and some of that activity migrating to other chains what we tend to believe is like um the most economically dense transactions will ultimately come to the most decentralized and secure base chain somewhere like bitcoin right like there was a time in bitcoin's history where eric voorhees was doing satoshi dice and we're using like bitcoin block space for crazy things like things that we wouldn't use it for today because it's just too expensive today right but the most economically dense transactions stayed at some point in time you know the it might not make sense to even move ten dollars or twenty dollars on the on the bitcoin network it might be just thousands of dollars transactions it might be just a bunch of crypto banks doing settlement on bitcoin um something similar could happen to the ethereum chain in that only the most economically dense transactions will occur on ethereum less important transactions lower value transactions on layer twos or even side chains or even other layer ones or or you know binance smart chain so that's one way i might answer that so this is what i'll give you guys i i find it really interesting and i find that uh it's going to be demonstrative to all the other competitors in the space that are trying to do smart contracts for sure um as to whatever it means it's it's really kind of hard to know at this point do i think it's going to be bullish for the underlying price if the scarcity gets tighter absolutely um but it's not something that i think this is important like uh just me personally like i just see so much technical risk on the migration over to eth2 so i just kind of keep my hands off do i think it could outperform sure right like all those things i just uh i'm more than happy to to say those things it doesn't uh you know i i i find it funny when uh folks are like it's not gonna do it it's like well it it might do it and it's gonna be and it's not a big deal right and and if it underperforms so what um you know relative to bitcoin vice versa right um in general i think we've all learned that scarcity of units digital units uh is bullish for the price so um what you guys described um it's it's going to be really interesting now i think the the bigger concern of of the community is the timeline of this migration um you know i heard vitalik say not too long ago that he thought it was going to happen this year and then i just recently heard that it's now the end of 2021 and and like i just i know i've said this a whole bunch but at the end of the day i think the thing that i think a lot of bitcoiners um and i don't mean to speak for for the bitcoin community but i think the thing that frustrates a lot of them is they look at things and they say there's a lot of technical risk and when they're seeing conversations they don't necessarily see that and i don't think that anybody has to do this but i think it would i think it would benefit the the eth community if they were more upfront as to the risks associated with how difficult this is as to what you're trying to pull off as a bitcoiner that's how i see it right so yeah and those conversations do exist and and we've had um you know danny ryan justin drake vitalik on the podcast to very explicitly like go after those things yeah at the end of the day there is just some sort of disposition differential disposition between bitcoiners and ethereums and and bitcoin as an asset is fundamentally trying to be a risk-off asset which is kind of like crazy for uh if you if you go tell like somebody like uh like warren buffett that bitcoin is risk off he's gonna be like what um but no in the cryptos in the crypto space like bitcoin is risk off and so it makes sense that like people who resonate with bitcoin see the upgrade path the theory of ethereum rather than than getting bullish like me and ryan they get like oh they see risk they are rather yeah that's an opportunity and i think that that's perfectly described like so what you guys see is is like this upside and this really exciting like movement that's about to take place i'm looking at that and like wanting to run the other way it's it's not like any type of personality like conflict between the two of us i just you know i we just see it differently right we're just doing it through a different optical lens i mean i i understand what you're saying because like even when you first jumped into bitcoin you know 2015 or so like it was kind the project was kind of done it's pretty ossified yeah there's some things like lightning that's that's very true like so i know whenever i first got into it like uh mike hearn came out with a or this was like i don't know a few months maybe a quarter or two after i got into it for the first time and he was basically wrote his resignation of bitcoin and saying i remember that this thing's not going to scale like you got these transactions that take 10 minutes how is that ever going to be used and um you know spooked a ton of people and sure enough a technical solution emerged and so i think for for people like yourself you might be looking at where maybe the technology solution is is is there and maybe gonna arise and you're gonna do all these g whiz things to kind of tie it together and i'm i'm looking at it and saying that's too many things there's too much going on and like hey maybe maybe it'll get there and if it does you know i'll be more than happy to come and take a second look at it so it's just it's uh you know it's a little bit of a cultural difference between the the two different communities and just risk appetite i guess let me throw something else out at you which is on kind of a different subject we talked about proof of work versus proof of stake we talked about issuance um i want to talk about the importance of defy because you gave us a big hell yeah when we talked about like d5 and we are hell yeah on d5 too because this is the entire point of crypto in our mind like bankless so podcast name is like for a reason right yeah go ahead so for me first and foremost sound money is the thing that why i'm in the space okay much more so no central bank that's sound money basically yeah is uh exactly so when i look at the issues that we have happening in the world right now for me it comes down to like one thing it's the fact that central banks can step in and just debase the currency and manipulate the market okay we don't we don't have free and open markets today in my opinion like it's just completely manipulated and i think that sound money and like a unit of account that can be used by everybody in the world that can't be manipulated is the solution and the big the really big thing right here i think the decentralized finance is is a great thing that's gonna enhance uh banking to everybody in the world which is insanely important but if i was going to kind of put them in order i would tell you the sound money piece and kind of fixing the the central banker's ability to just debase everything it far out weighs the priority for me uh on what's going to solve all the issues we're seeing in the world right now i get it and i understand that prioritization so let me make this argument to you first of all i would say what if you could have both i'm sure you'd be like yes but also like we want both but also what if i were to say this i think you need defy or you won't get the sound money that you're actually seeking and here's what i mean like if we look at the history of gold the way they the banks put a stranglehold on gold was through centralization through custodying of the gold you actually had to bring your gold to a bank vault and deposit it over time those those banks kind of collected into the central banking system that we have today that is now controlled by the nation state was that centralization of custody that actually got us to the place that we are today and i see very much that unless we have a decentralized banking system not banks but banking right um then we could get to that same place with with something like bitcoin so here's what i mean i feel like a ethereum with uniswap for example the ability to trade without a centralized intermediary you don't have to give up your private keys at all right you don't have to put it in coinbase or gemini or binance or any crypto custodian you could just trade with any other asset right that is a trading as a banking service and that is decentralized the ability to borrow or lend these other money verbs in d5 without a bank right so rather than go to block fi where you have to give up your private keys which is great nice bitcoin crypto bank service nice service you could go to ave or compound and it's just code there's no central intermediary what do you guys think of huddle huddle because that's really popular in the bitcoin space and it doesn't have any inherent token but yet everything can be settled between the the peer-to-peer on the blockchain of bitcoin so with payments right what do you mean by with payments huddle huddle uh i mean uh well could you explain to me and so talk also the listeners what huddle huddle is so this is a website that's uh a defy that's peer-to-peer um you go to the website now my concern with with it initially was hey like you know anybody can go in in there and shut down the server of this website but um you know i had it explained to me by the person who created it that that you can still uh complete the contract with the other peer um on on the blockchain even if the website was down uh after the contract was initiated obviously um so it's a multi multisig exchange function yeah you have you have uh your own private key you know one of three keys and huddle huddle holds one of those keys in the event that the counterparty you know so i when i look at that then i'm saying hey this is being done today on a platform like that that doesn't have any inherent token associated with it um why why won't we have more of this in the future um why do we have to have this whole virtual machine with all these inherent tokens and like uniswap and you guys can maybe talk this in more detail but my understanding is that uniswap used to not even have an inherent token then all of a sudden they issued one which makes me feel like the founders that kind of stood it up wanted to basically get get their fair share of get their fair share of uh what they created um but for bitcoiners they see a lot of that and they say hey we have this thing over here that doesn't require any of that and that's probably where the future is going to end up going so i have a couple thoughts really quick on that so first of all any real defy on bitcoin is awesome is great in in in my mind right so like this is all part of going bankless so something like huddlehottle it fits that criterion i knew you could do some like basic smart contracts on bitcoin with multi-six and that sort of thing um that's all great like i hope lightning is super successful too right that is a bankless peer-to-peer transfer service like what i would say though is without the evm without the general compute i i had a friend in high school do you remember those uh ti 83 calculators oh yeah okay so like he used to love to program apps and like these crazy apps on the ti 83 calculator and i i would look at him and be like why are you spending time like there's no keyboard attachment he would literally use the you know number controllers to like actually convert it to alphanum like alphanumeric text and like program this thing i'm like why don't you just use a computer over here with a real screen and some java script and like build your program that way and that's a little bit how i feel like with with bitcoin is because it doesn't have the expressivity baked into the base layer you could do some stuff you can create some apps but you have the power of a graphing calculator when you could have like a much more powerful system and so it's not that these things won't exist in some form it's just that they'll be less powerful and so like the question is why hamstring yourself or like you know maybe it's okay for def for uh bitcoin to not be optimized as a d5 system in the way ethereum is yeah i think it goes back to my prioritization that i was talking about so like priority one like you have to have sound money priority two if we can do d5 let's do it and so why do we need to have that on the same base layer do we do we need to have it my argument is that we don't why can't eath bee sound money to you because it is non-sovereign it is digitally scarce right it has a similar governance mechanism as as bitcoin um i'm not saying eth has to be the only non-sovereign story value but why can't it be one as bitcoin is so a anything's possible b i would tell you that i just see the code base is just being so complex and um difficult to [Music] to audit i think is probably the best way to put it like when i think of bitcoin it's so insanely easy to audit what it is and what it isn't um that anybody can kind of look at it and and quickly come to the conclusion like hey that's that is not gonna have any types of issues when you start talking about something that's doing all of these things with 64 shards and like you don't necessarily have to run a full node but then uh there are some that like have the the whole archive and some that you know you're you're doing uh fraud proofs and you know erasure coding and all this kind of stuff like it's really insanely hard to wrap your head around all that for me personally i don't have my head wrapped all around it and so um you know we look at the el salvador announcement i really think that the reason that you have a sovereign nation that's now has claimed bitcoin is their their uh legal tender in their country is because it's so easy for them to understand it it's so easy for anybody within their country to run a full node um and i think you know that's today ten years from now maybe it's different i don't know but i think that that's that's one of the reasons why it's just so simple to understand preston i want to go back to this huddle huddle thing really quickly because i there's some very fundamental differences that uh from what i'm what i'm seeing uh with the explanation on the website versus what we're seeing in in d5 and specifically on uniswap uh it's it looks like it's a custodial uh uh arbitration service for two buyers and sellers of bitcoin right so you create a smart you create a multi-sig and so that's one transaction on bitcoin and the seller deposits bitcoin into this escrow multi-sig right and you're basically using this arbitration service to make sure that the buyer pays the seller the right price uh and then there's a payment for these bitcoins in the fiat world using actual like you know venmo paypal they say on the website buyer pays the seller according to the agreed upon method and people are asking for paypal chase banks grill nutella or some sort of fiat payment site like in in the legacy world and then when that payment goes through if it goes through as according to the terms of the agreement then the agreement has been made as a handshake deal on the internet off chain not on chain if that agreement goes through and huddle huddle a test and test this as the arbitrator says that yes this went through or the buyer can just do it then those funds are released this is very very different from just uniswap where it is one transaction in and out and it was trustless from the beginning and trust us from the end and you didn't need this like middleman arbitration service uh to to facilitate this trade have you ever made a trade on unit swap i have never so and i think this is important i've never used defy and the reason why i've never used d5 is it actually comes down to most of the money that i'm managing is through a corporate account and so um i can get myself into all sorts of issues where they would shut down my cash account of my business if i'm doing these activities these fine financial because the they would see it as financial activities whenever i'm not a financial business um and so and i think this is this is a major hurdle uh for the space in general because when you think about large amounts of capital it's nested inside of businesses with their retained earnings and and marketable securities that they could then be allocating into some of the space none of them will get get anywhere near this at the concern of potentially losing their cash account of whatever banking service they they still have to use today um to start doing some of these activities on an individual level i could be but i'm not um you know i just buy bitcoin and hodl it um if if i send you some some ether is that is that compliant so you can play around on d5 make your first unit stop trade will will that get you under the radar or will that will that is not that also not cool um i mean i could accept it on a personal level yeah but uh yeah i you should you should ask them for this is a good opportunity negotiating i'm sure there's a price of how much etherium they have yeah you know the space is really interesting to me i but again i just i'm not real comfortable with the maturity of it at this point and maybe and you know what maybe i'm missing a massive opportunity by waiting and as things continue to mature um and i'm fine with that uh i and maybe some of it's just my personal financial situation right like i don't have to go out and do these these fantastic things to really kind of improve my lifestyle or anything like that so i'm i'm as an engineer honestly i find the space absolutely fascinating i lack the encryption understanding and i lack the software engineering background to really kind of fully understand everything that's happening but i but i i will say this i understand how difficult it is especially in an open source kind of way to be able to manage all this where you don't have some sort of systematic risk that could potentially insert itself into the a protocol that does all of these things and that's my concern so us preston this has been a really uh cool conversation i think just a couple more things as we close but i i think listeners really like having um people from different perspectives on a podcast actually make their like the case of the other so i'm wondering if we could do like a steel man kind of argument here of like what's the most compelling thing to you about eth or like steel man the keith the case for eth for us and david and i will do the same for for bitcoin do you want to have us go for bitcoin first or do you want to no no no i yeah i love being able to shoot holes and kind of look look at things from the exact opposite lens so the thing that i would tell you that i that i find really interesting about your space is uniswap particularly um i find it really interesting that you're able to do this decentralized finance that you're able to um put liquidity basically in people the bitcoin space would you know they're going to cringe hearing this and i'm not saying that i promote this in any way shape or form but i find it interesting how there's been a solution that's kind of arrived to provide liquidity into something that typically would not have liquidity um and you see that through uni swap where you got these really obscure just total you guys would agree with me coins yes all right you got these really obscure coins that are that are able to to have liquidity applied to them um in a completely decentralized way i think it's i think in most cases it's a total ponzi um [Music] nearly most cases like all cases of these coins that have no utility whatsoever right it's just it's just a total scam but the fact that that this has been experimented with from like an r d standpoint in that uh what's the equation you guys use it's like a times k x times y equals k x yes this equation which is so simple and just so like generic is able to provide this amazing kind of uh um way to value these these coins that have no liquidity i find that as especially as a market kind of person just mind-blowing um so what does that mean in the future for so i'm not i immediately go into like equities and like what that might mean for like real stocks especially if we start tokenizing stocks in the future which i think is where this is all going to go and um once they get tokenized they have immediate settlement you're going to start getting into over collateralized lending markets as being like uh you know pretty much how all lending is done which i think is really exciting which i mean which i also think is going to blow out yield which is going to reprice everything and it's going to be a massive redistribution of wealth and so i think that at the heart of all that is going to be some way shape or form it's going to be decentralized exchanges whether it's unit swap i have no idea um whether it's going to be eth providing that or you know eos tron binance smart contract i mean cardano polka dot i have no idea i just find the space fascinating good answer there you go david you wanna do you wanna steal man bitcoin first i'm almost equally uh curious as to what you'd say oh no i'm so happy to have the floor right now all right so it's it's 1970 nixon killed the the gold window uh and all of a sudden the dollar uh becomes unbacked and all of a sudden everything kind of slowly slowly starts to go wrong uh and you know it's pernicious it's like the frog boiling the water but uh 40 years later we have meme stonks we have dogecoin we have uh kind of what what uh my pop crypto po pov crypto podcast co-host calls a clown world whereas nothing is real anymore uh and you know we we have these uh you have the nifty 50s that you know so they can only go up we have the the housing market bubble and i think financial markets just lost their grips on reality and not only did financial markets lose their grips on reality but if you if your money loses grips on reality you lose grip on reality right and bitcoin was the first thing uh since uh the gold standard since the dollar was on the gold standard to re-establish what is fundamentally real uh and not only is it fundamentally real but it's now it's digital and on the internet and it's one of the greatest globalizing unifying technologies that uh the world has ever seen gold since gold you know one of the reasons why gold was so uh adopted and and valued as a as a money was that it was equally distributed all over the world uh you could find it in every single continent uh and bitcoin and its online nature uh and not only its online nature but also its long-term orientation and why bitcoin needed to be a hands off technology from as soon as possible is because in a world with you know fake money and in a world with like uh you know assets that we we kind of play around with p e ratios but it's really narratives at the end of the day uh bitcoin was like the first real thing to have to force people in a long-term time horizon and it was a great like sobering event or like a waking up event for uh for the people that figured that out uh and for the people that became bitcoiners early on and everything about bitcoin is centered around that the proof of work the hard cap uh the focusing on on making the network extremely optimized just chugging out blocks every 10 10 minutes like like a clock clockmaker's perfect design and now we have this great model for what the future of the world can be with the values instantiated by bitcoin maybe that was a bit of a monologue that was kind of something that something a tangential that maybe it sounds like that's been brewing for a while yeah but but no no bitcoin is great bitcoin is fantastic i guess my my steel man is that um we don't need all of this defy stuff right so like the steel man for bitcoin is that all you need is that sound money at the base layer bitcoin can provide that um it will secure itself into the future and then basically these crypto banks will kind of do the rest so the block flies the coin bases and the binances um they'll be custodial at first but maybe they'll start to incorporate some proof of reserve type of schematic so you get some additional transparency and maybe that will be enough maybe um you'll be able to easily spin up a a bitcoin bank and that will be kind of the the banking layer and then as you were saying david like bitcoin just becomes kind of a wrecking ball and its meme and its brand just uh of digital scarcity just eats into bonds each and into all of the asset classes and you get sort of a a some state of bitcoinization right with this uh crypto banking layer on top and the whole defy thing becomes a niche and nfts and it doesn't fully work out um that would maybe be the the bull case for bitcoin in in my mind um and i think it's a good base case for crypto um definitely i like i think on bankless guys if if it wasn't clear for you we've always been bullish bitcoin we've just been more bullish eth and more bullish d5 but we've still been bullish bitcoin the whole time um preston that was a good steal man let's maybe end on this how can bitcoiners and aetherians how can these two communities help each other moving forward i was just struck by this before we came to record this podcast i just watched a u.s politician um talking about um how possibly it would be a good thing to make it illegal to go from bitcoin to fiat like anywhere and maybe a bunch of nations to band together and make this happen and i have to wonder if this is a response to el salvador or what this is a response to um i feel like we've always talked about the the final boss uh coming to crypto that's something that all proponents of self-sovereign money like want to uh fight and and want to keep at bay um maybe that's something that we can collaborate on as a crypto industry as bitcoiners and ethereums and and other crypto communities uh what would you say to that and what are some other areas you know at the end of the day i just i look at all of this that's happening as almost like an immune response like a global immune response to toxic sludge being poured into the into the global economy uh you know if you went to us into a pond and you just poured like this toxic sludge you're gonna get the the simpsons like three-eyed fish that kind of comes out right but when you look at how biology just naturally heals itself you'd see like everything on the side of the pond just kind of um you know starts turning like different colors but it's the it's working itself out it's solving whatever that sludge was that was put in there that was not natural and so i see the reaction of bitcoin being that i see the reaction of all these um other protocols call it ethereum and all the other ones that i named earlier is also uh being the experimentation of of uh just the natural evolution trying to solve the issue at hand which is all these issues that have come out of unsound money and market manipulation um when i look at how i interact with the other uh uh people in in various spaces whether it's ethereum or whatever um i'm i'm just as guilty as the next person especially like we talked about uh on social media of just kind of blasting out and being quite brash in the way i see things but when you're in person and you're talking to somebody face to face it you get a much more human kind of reaction between between people i know people in the bitcoin space will look at ethereum or anything else and just say scam it's a scam i'm i'm looking at it and saying i think that there's well-intended people that are really trying to solve something here that um see something from maybe a different vantage point or a different lens than than how i've grown up and how the things that have led me to the belief structure that i have right now which hasn't changed at all through the conversation or you know after the conversation um but i think being respectful of other people and assuming that they're well intended is probably the most valuable thing that anybody can do not just in this space but in general in society with each other uh and so you know i think that's probably the thing i'm going to take away from most through this conversation is just be a little bit more respectful of other people and to uh you know ask the questions you know at the end of the day i the first thing i said when i came on here is i want to learn uh your vantage point and i really wanted to kind of you know ask certain questions and you guys as well to try to kind of understand why you guys sit where you sit and that's where real value is created is through understanding other people's point of view so i think that those are some important things that we can all think about that's awesome preston well let's end on that note certainly some tumultuous time ahead for the world and we'll do better if we we stay unified on the values uh that that we all uh stand for um preston thanks so much for joining us on banklust it's been great to have this conversation yeah thanks for
