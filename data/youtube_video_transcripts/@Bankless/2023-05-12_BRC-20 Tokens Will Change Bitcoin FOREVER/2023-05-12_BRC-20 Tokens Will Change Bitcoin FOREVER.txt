Bitcoin culture has shifted the balance of power is shifting from the Bitcoin fundamentalists to the Bitcoin builders Bangla station it's Friday of May I hope you're ready for what David the bank List Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto say it with me which is always an ambitious Endeavor I almost forgot that line yet we persevere nonetheless into the Frontiers trying to make that a thing about always persevere nonetheless the frontier yeah nonetheless topics of the week we got meme coin season I've been sleeping on this one David but you tell me why it's important oh I'm not sure if I'm the man to do that but I will anyways uh crypto can we not find product Market fit well let's just go back to trading memes uh that was yeah that Meme was so powerful that even Bitcoin caught the coin bug this week uh leading to a change in the balance of power in Bitcoin culture which is actually a more significant topic that I do care about yeah uh and then lastly of the big news of the week uh even though there's so much more than this Brad Sherman has a hot take for crypto did you see this one run I did and you're gonna love it bankless Nation uh it's a perfect sound bite to encapsulate what's going on in our Halls of Congress these days when they talk about this silly thing called crypto and we're gonna get right to it guys but before we do we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at Swell this is a decentralized staking Network specializing in the staking of Eve David tell them about swell swell is a liquid staking provider that we know we know what these things are the LSD sector but swell is if what would you do if you built a LSD provider in the year 2023 so not only is it a brand new Dow to spin up to build a brand new staking protocol but it also hooks more natively into defies uh doubling up where you can get sources of yield from and so if you are interested in getting some extra both defy yield along with your e-staking yield swell is the place for you uh in their roadmap they have the thing that really gets me going which is DVT or AKA Squad staking as well and they want you to know that they have a voyage towards decentralization which is starting soon TM so app.swellnetwork.io Voyage or the link in the show notes if you just want to go click to get started yeah and one of my favorite things about this David is there is zero percent fees for stakers who stake now and of course um gas fees being high just means stakers get more rewards so yield goes up good time to uh to be staking these days all right David uh tell me about a good time or a bad time in the markets let's get to the price of Bitcoin this week uh we are experiencing Ryan as we recorded the saddest time of the week so far this week uh prices are the lowest at the time of recording Thursday morning Eastern time uh Bitcoin is at the low low price of twenty seven thousand two hundred dollars start of the week at twenty nine thousand four hundred dollars we're down 7.5 percent not not a great week because we lost all of our May gains huh we're back to April 23rd back to April yeah I'm looking at this on the Kraken Pro charts of course how about youth price is that a similar story or anything it is here down exactly 7.5 just like wow just like Daddy Bitcoin yeah so it started 1950 currently at 1810. well you know I'm gonna ask you what's going on and I think you've got some analysis here coming up David because uh I want your take on this a take on the charts but before we get there Bitcoin no news there how about uh crypto market cap 1.16 down to 1.1 does not feel great I remember a couple weeks ago three or four weeks ago you were like I'm ready to to start to be ready to wave the white flag on Triple digit Ethan I was like hold on this could be the middle of the Year top uh so far the middle of the Year top thesis is correct for three weeks in a row um yeah this one uh [Music] I I mean okay are you asking me do I feel emotionally nervous like almost never no are there reasons to be concerned yeah yeah there are reasons to be concerned yeah okay I'm trying to separate like I'm never nervous so like if you're asking me if I'm nervous like then the answer is gonna be no however if I put on my short-term hats like yeah there's reasons to be concerned what's the probability that we get to that triple digit eth again well as we've gotten so far the 7.5 lower this week has increased that probability by a comparable amount um I don't know how to answer that question but I mean we're getting there yeah I mean it's interesting because you know I was I I was like 60 earlier that that it could happen again that we'd revisit um triple digit and then that kind of decreased I think with the beginning of this year and we haven't seen the like the hits and further away from it right but this is but this is also the thing I was most worried about is that kind of that apathy season of the market um what's interesting is we'll talk about this later we're going to talk about meme coins and whether that's just injecting new blood or whether that's injecting recycled Capital um maybe we should talk about that in a minute but this number to me is interesting we're still above a trillion even despite this and Brad Sherman hates that number we'll get to that he actually named a trillion dollars in in the video quote they're going to play a little bit later but um tell me about the market news okay David why are prices down prices are down because liquidity oh first before we get there uh Ryan happy one year anniversary to the Terra Luna crash deploying more Capital study Labs that famous tweet that got treated up by dokwan that was one year ago this week so happy anniversary to those who do not celebrate this you don't say anniversary it's not a holiday well either way anniversary nonetheless uh okay so uh the big reason as to what is going on in the market this week um is that the idea has circulated that both jump and Jane Street which are big market makers have scaled back their Market making operations in the crypto world and so here is a tweet that went viral and it's showing a binance liquidity order book liquidity and you can just see the thinness of the order book in the narrow spreads right so the what we're looking at were very narrow snapshots of both uh bitcoin price um uh a long time ago uh in January of this year so not that long ago versus now uh and so the the order books are thin um in the in so like it doesn't take as much money to move the markets and we all have learned the lesson that when you pull liquidity out of the markets asset prices go down and so jump and Jane Street very big players um have been alleged I don't think guys we've seen a confirmation of this but they are scaling back their Market making operations as a result of regulatory fears uh and so when liquidity exits the markets uh it's easier to push price down it's easier to be fearful uh and they also are having their own cell pressure liquidity lack of liquidity is bearish uh and so that is the thing that has happened that that that's why the market seems to have entered a new phase lately the Market's behaving differently and people are speculating this because liquidity has been pulled out and behaving differently in that it's like more volatile or more like little bumps in the night send it spiraling and yeah positive emphasis towards the downside no momentum towards the upside any any uh positive price action just immediately gets sold off uh there was a there was a phase change in the market and it happened recently um and people are accrediting the exiting of of market makers to this interesting this this may be the apathy Market I was talking about earlier what is this showing us here yeah so this is a graph of liquidity in the market which is the blue line and you can see some events that have happened recently so the Silver Gate bank failure was uh followed by a large decline in liquidity of binance and binance Bitcoin to United to bitcoin to tether uh liquidity uh Then followed by um the binance cftc charge uh and then also a binance spot fees increase is what's indicated here but really it was a silvergate bank so this is a largely tradfi the crypto Banks um as uh who called them Gary Gensler called them the crypto Banks even though we use crypto Banks to call it coinbase and Kraken the Trad banks that service crypto customers all crash and win under and so these are the banking providers that also provide banking services to market makers and so it's harder to Market making crypto these days so liquidity is drying out of the system and so I treat this tweet uh everyone knows who's a bankless listener everyone knows that I'm a huge fan of SpongeBob bigger fan of SpongeBob than you are bankless listener uh and so this is the the water Sandy water uh he needs water like crypto markets we need water we need liquidity otherwise we're bearish so the state of the crypto markets right now is dry dry yeah right no liquidity we are bone dry right now which uh which does not bode well for price right there's not a lot of buyers um stepping in under this uh you know 1700 each price right yeah if you scroll down I give a little bit of an autopsy right and so one year ago Tara blew up 50 billion dollars six months ago FTX blew up 15 15 billion dollars Alameda a market maker ceased operations one month ago three crypto Bank fails this last week the largest bank failure since 2008 Regional Banks which do offer services to crypto the crypto industry uh are getting slammered meanwhile we are the operation choke point 2.0 choke point they're choking liquidity Gary Gensler is pointing a gun at us and I'm what I'm saying is like we don't get bullishness until liquidity returns and then the crazy thing right is somehow in the midst of all of this uh Pepe coin gets to 1.5 billion dollars that's all inside isn't it that's not real that's not outside money that's not new buyers playing around well we'll talk about that in a minute but okay I think this is actually a big story David I think this is a theme of the apathy Market it's bone dry and I think this is probably something we'll be talking about a lot over the coming weeks and months is when is the liquidity going to come back and how does it come back where are the net new buyers of our crypto assets that's the big question right now and I think that is the appropriate question at this stage of the market where like the worst news all of the kind of the like impact of SPF and Alameda and Tara and Celsius and three hours Capital that's all hit us and now we're on the other side of that and we're just like well we still don't have the use cases to attract new buyers and so it's quiet you know like that's what's going on the uh the trillions of dollars of latent Capital that's still out there which we need and we are doing Pepe coin [Music] you mean they're not buying this stuff huh no somebody they're looking at us they're like oh the cryptocurrency industry was needed to professionalize and come into the light and like provide good products and services they just created Pepe coin and Elon Musk is tweeting out about my ladies like yeah you know Daniel Gary genser is like excellent this is exactly what I wanted to see he's loving this right now um well let's talk about a good side of the equation which is holders are still holding holders I feel that very strongly right we don't have new buyers we don't have new liquidity into the market we have some indicators we're still here we're still here and what are we doing we're staking we're looking at on the screen here what's the story around each staking the numbers here the story around each staking round I'm so glad you brought this up glad you asked we are at an all-time high an amount of ether staked to ethereum that is awesome that is awesome how long did it take less than one month of time less than a month remember they told us remember they told us when withdrawals were enabled it was going to just like Creator like all of this staked eth was going to drain out of the system and we were totally crater and less than a month later we're already at all-time highs of steak to eat so that means inflows has exceeded outflows I was not expecting this so quickly I thought we'd we'd have a more sustained dip I mean I was bullish but I wasn't like if you told me like within 30 days we'll be at all-time highs again I've been like I mean three months maybe I could see that but I wouldn't I wouldn't gamble a significant amount of money that we will be at all time highs inside of one month so yes this is a bullish outcome of this the general ethereum Community member thought leader take was that like this is not a bearish event yes there will be a net outflow but it will quickly the Gap will quickly be um covered by net new inflow because of the risk off like that was the ethereum consensus and like that's what you said that's what I was debate with Jordy Alexander okay please go back to the Jordy Alexander David Hoffman debate and look at who and who made what points I'm sorry I you said you weren't gonna Victory lap I was supposed to Victory lap for you okay David won that debate I think Jordy Alexander the evidence is Jordy Alexander took down um Terra Luna the Terra Luna in his debate and single-handedly well everyone else thought that he got smashed because they're all lunatics yes but then you did a debate with Jordy on whether the ether withdrawals would be bullish or bearish right and uh jordy's thesis with a lot of eth would actually drain out of the system I think David wins this round but you so I'm gonna do okay so if you laugh for you I'll give a point to Jordy which is like the price of eth currently is marginally lower than at the time of the debate but I'll say all of The Ether price action is completely related to exogenous factors there you go but this is the point I want to make all the internal points about the ethereum network and about ethereum fundamentals the ethereum community has been right on the right side of History every single incident of drama about ethereum remember eth proof of work remember the eth overhang and and dump into the market fear-mongerers like uh remember like uh like I don't know every time any ethereum event has caused drama the people about ethereum who know about ethereum have always been right almost every single time there it is folks there's the there's the Victory lap but honestly I mean I can't like that's kind of right here's super Fizz here saying in 2020 the beacon chain launched that was December 2020 uh 2022 September proof of stake replaced proof of work the merge then in April of 2023 withdrawals from staking were enabled and now those who wish to withdraw completed the action that happened on May 7th that's when the uh withdrawal queue was emptied we started seat info flows again um pretty impressive to see it laid out in this timeline here's another equal Anthony cesano saying there are now more active validators live on the ethereum network than there were before staking withdrawals were enabled it took less than a month for this to happen eth staking is up only all time let's give that one a like yeah one of also perpetually correct about ethereum perpetually cracked about a theory I should love that you just said that right now he does another chart to convince him uh let's let's zoom out um crack can actually put out a great report this week on kind of this overall state of staking of course ethereum isn't the only proof-of-stake Network did you know this report is about staking that's an industry so some stats that I found interesting 288 billion dollars is the market cap of the top uh 35 proof of stake assets um so that's growing 49 quarter on quarter uh the value of steaks just for just for uh context 288 billion is a total market cap uh 220 billion of that is ethereum oh okay well there you go just a lot is you want to make sure ethereum gets its credit right yeah thankless solicitors no we don't give a theorem enough credit around here uh 68 billion dollars the value staked assets um 5 billion annualized staking rewards it's a pretty big industry at this point right it's the value of large is 5 billion yeah um that's 23 proof of stake is 23 of the total crypto Market uh cap I imagine that's a largely eat here's one thing that's interesting the the average yield is 11.6 and of course ethereum just use that way downward so other proof of stake networks are um rewarding are Distributing a lot more of their supply than either higher issuance I think there's reasons for that higher inflation yeah you could tell we're coming off of Justin Drake Monday episode too right because you know yeah we got some bullish takes this episode yeah you know let's switch though to the conversation actually just uh okay Ryan what do you think in the last um seven days what do you I think was the uh staking reward for ether in the last seven days are you talking about like uh annualized percentage yes analyze percentage Yeah well it's 4.4.5 make this no that was just from issuance that's just issuance okay you're talking okay 3.8 uh apy from issuance if you get add-only tips and also the Mev you come up to 6.6 on your eth it has been a great time to be a validator ah yeah that's uh that's definitely good that yield generated in each denominated returns is always quite nice um David this is a question I think that came off of our Market section last week asking about um I mean we're critical from time to time on the FED on Jerome Powell on uh interest rates here's a question from stevef.eath I missed the cutoff this week but my question for team Bank list for next uh weekly Roll Up is the following and I asked this with true respect for you guys uh thanks Steve you don't have to respect us though since bankless consistently criticizes the federal interest rate policy fairly is calling for a pivot what terminal interest you think the Federal Reserve should settle on so this listener is calling us out David and if you going to criticize the interest rate right you have to you have to say what you think it should be you have to say why what's what's your response to this um my response is like the only reason why I'm not calling for a pivot except my my portfolio is you you me as a human person who's living in an economy and lives in a society I am not calling for a pivot my portfolio would love a picture he wants to Pivot for his bags yeah uh what is the appropriate interest rate no clue God I do not want anyone Straub inside of the Federal Reserve I do not want Palace drop uh I don't have an opinion on this matter and so um I apologize for bankless listeners if it if we have given off the air of like we think that we are right about interest rates and that we want to Pivot we're just we're this is an industry and all you guys also have risk on crypto assets so don't pretend that you also don't want to Pivot yeah I guess I would zoom out though and I would say I I agree with that and I'm glad you clarified right so um a pivot is good for crypto bags is it good for society is is kind of a different question but um here's where I'd zoom out and I do have some criticism uh for the FED that I think is uh more more fair over the long run as you said David no one really knows what the real interest rate should be no one not even maybe God knows maybe God knows right so this was actually a point this was this was a point that was made by Edward Chancellor in our recording by the way guys there's an episode coming out with a financial historian Edward Chancellor it's coming out I think on Monday and if you want the more nuanced non-bag bias take on the fed and what they should be doing what they should have done rather than what they are doing listen that take but he makes the point that um no one knows the real interest rate of course that a hypothetical real interest rate exists but the best tool we have of finding out what the real interest rate is is free markets and we're in this mess because Central Bankers have distorted free markets so badly for so long and they've pretended that it's all okay and so I don't know neither did Edward Chancellor know what the actual rate should be maybe God does no human alive on Earth no AI on Earth knows this but we do know that the rates the fake rates over the last 10 years were dumb like real dumb I mean negative we went negative in in in uh you know some like zero close to zero percent in the US so I if I'm Powell I don't know if I can fix this and there there's an element of Powell I think you made this point last week where he's just a wheel in the Cog right this is the wheel of History what else can he do he's got that the hand that he's been dealt he's got he's not outside of the system he's inside the system so the criticism though is the system and the way it's been uh managed and uh the fix I think we're pretty like much more certain on this the fix is individuals need an escape hatch an alternative store of value like why would you put your money in treasury so why would you put your money in the dollar right so for the individual I'm like well crypto is a great escape hat for that and I think as a collective we need a check on the central Banker power as a collective we also need crypto right and it provides that escape hatch so that Central Bankers have less power um over the the future but again if you want the real perspective on this from a true Financial non-bag biased historian uh the episode coming at you on Monday it was uh it was one of my favorite episodes that we've recorded recently actually I really enjoy Edward yeah one of the reasons why the weekly roll-up episodes always goes along is because we find little rabbit holes to talk about and then I also want to talk about it so I'll give my kids so like the whole idea of this episode is that interest rates are a naturally emergent phenomenon so the concept of a set interest rate by mere mortals mere humans is not real it's fake we're arbitrarily picking a number when Nature Mother Nature or why you said only God knows what the uh ought to be interest rate ought to be it's like when we pick a number it's a we create a fake world and when we pick a low number we are create we are perpetuating that fake world and making it even Faker and that has been like my our entire lifetimes as Millennials we've been living in a fake world because interest rates have been low for more or less our entire lifetimes and now like we have to come to terms with that and so now we gotta jack up the interest rates to pay our debts that Society has been paying uh for decades prior to our even acknowledging other problem and so the release valve like you said is is crypto assets and so uh the only reason why the FED can create that fake world is because there's no Escape valve to escape towards until Bitcoin comes in 2009 and here we are in history there there's a Bitcoin that time not ethereum uh I'm proud of you David that's great speaking though of ethereum and being bullish on ethereum okay one last thing we got to go over it in the market section this was a fantastic report one of the best I've seen analyzing and predicting the price of ether David I know you haven't had a chance to read this but let me tell you I am so bullish I want to invite these analysts uh on and um this is a report put out by van Eck so analyzing ether from an Institutional perspective and throwing out price predictions based on the thing like based on total actually understanding the asset which is so bullish to me so they're doing they have a base case a bear case and a bull Case by 2030. okay and the way they are calculating this is based on ethereum's total revenue so it's 2.5 billion annualized today and they have a base case projection of 50 billion annualized per year by 20 30 right that's their base case their bare case is lower their bookcase is 136 billion per year and the way they calculate those numbers is from as we learned uh in our Justin Drake episode um congestion which is youth gas fees and also contention which is Mev and also this thing that they call ethereum security as a service which is the idea of using eth recycling eth they have restaking in this report are you serious yes yes and I just want to point out like of course this is good for the projection this is like this is not necessarily what the future like these numbers it's their job to produce these they got the variables right that's what I'm so bullish on it's not another stupid institutional analyst for it so you're you're actually just like I don't care about the numbers the fact that they got the variable the inputs into the models is like we're at finally at that point in the history yes that institutions are getting the inputs right they actually are understanding how to Value this asset class and it's taken like three to four years of education I actually feel like bankless has been a big place that is where we came from like but but this report gets it right and by the way it doesn't also uh include kind of monetary premium on top of this because I think you could argue that's very difficult you can't measure that but like variable I don't know if I'm an Institutional uh investor and I'm reading this report and I'm seeing these numbers so clearly laid out right like it just makes so much sense and it's not a meme coin style of like pull it out of your ass number uh anyway bullish on institutions analysts actually understanding this asset it's very cool I I am offended that their base case for ether in 2030 is merely twelve thousand dollars but then you made the point that they didn't add in monetary premium which is yes the right way to analyze that is it's a multiplier it's like how strong do you want the multiplier to be if it's extremely moneyless it's like a 10x if it's not very money is it's like a 1.5 x uh so then adding the money multiplier onto it which I think is strong yes very much that's the mean value of it anyway it's bullish on that we got to move on what do we got coming up next coming up next meme coin season my favorite season I'm lying uh Bitcoin Bitcoin catches the coin bug because the beam coin season was so strong that the virus has spread to bitcoin but uh you know how like uh when you you catch a virus and like you can actually like change it like can mess with your DNA that's what happened in Bitcoin this week Bitcoin culture is Shifting the balance of power is shifting from the Bitcoin fundamentalists to the Bitcoin Builders the the tribe that I resonate with I'm pretty sure you also resonate with yeah yeah so we'll talk about that as well and then Brad Sherman's got that a hot take like we talked about and I made a meme of him and so we're gonna talk about all of that and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors including Kraken our preferred crypto extra range for 2023 the people that made that staking report which you should also go check

it's meme coin season we're gonna find out what that means here's a question that bankless Twitter put out have you bought a meme coin in the past month I have not answered this question I don't know if you have David but why don't you tell us have you bought a meme coin in the past month uh if you scroll down you'll see my answer let me see oh yes you got a a gif of like uh a guy who like sheepishly nodding yeah you have so you have you are one of the d-gens here yeah I've bought two important yeah so what you say is um going to be given with with love or wait do you do you have bitterness that these weren't Your Meme coins that uh that pumped David no I just I'm just bitter that I'm compelled to play the game just like everyone else because that's the meta where we don't have to you could just it's fun you know you miss 100 of the shots you don't take you know I have uh ignored it so far but why don't you tell us what's happening so here's the first uh tweet we're teeing up here yeah okay so this is of course Pepe coin this this started off by Pepe coin uh launched uh the 16th of April uh 1.5 billion dollar market cap as of today hit 1.7 earlier uh 122 000 people wallets have traded Pepe at least one point in their lives um this stories for how these tokens just like rocket out of corners of the internet into billion dollar market caps are always inherently dark and uh dark also yeah just like uh hard to illuminate not not dark like evil but just like okay mysterious okay yeah I got it yeah they come from like I'm sure they start with like trading circles you know back Channel Alpha telegram yeah so someone like figures out how to make something catch I'm pretty sure that Pepe is just a freaking token and is just called Pepe there's no utility to this thing it's just like the Frog Cafe the Frog yes so like this this one token got minted and birthed and somehow somebody got the market to accept that this is the appropriate that correlates with the internet meme and now because it got to 1.5 billion dollars it now is so this thing is like sufficiently large and the memes and owners around this are sufficiently big and people have made sufficient amounts of money yet that this is now like doge is about the doge meme and pepe is about the Pepe Meme and now we have a new meme coin look at this chart David okay so you're telling me this thing was valued at uh zero zero it was value to zero zero of course yeah like reasonably when it got some liquidity uh I mean first kind of days of liquidity 77 million in market cap and this thing got to 1.8 1.8 billion dollars yeah so 1.8 billion dollars which is created out of no where uh inside of one month okay this must have minted uh some millionaires there there's always some winners from these Pepe coins here's a chart we're looking at top three dudes we don't know if these are dudes I will bet my entire net worth that these are dudes okay uh three of them made over 14 million dollars on Pepe and yes they did cash out that's why I was about that these are people exit liquidity okay so the number one uh profit tier of Pepe made a 9x the number two made a 14x number three made a 4786 x so they basically put zero Capital at stake and bought no like all the tokens at very little price and then managed to hold it all the way up imagine making 14 million dollars Justice I mean like it's part of this industry it's like yeah we have our new money printers and like yeah I guess this is like the logical conclusion of it and I do appreciate that this tweet says here's the Pepe profits leaderboard this is a casino like this is a leaderboard there are winners and losers here there are net net winners because there's 1.5 billion dollars of wealth that's now on paper um but it is a gang that people are playing yeah well here's the game and we could see kind of the the Peak at least so far unless this has a Resurgence was on May 5th at 1.8 billion dollars and now we're down to back down to uh 700 to 600 yeah 700 million dollars at this point in time so who are the losers yeah I mean people that have bought in since May 5th if you've bought since May 5th you are a loser yes sorry uh you bought too late sorry yes um in in this local time frame one of the coins that you uh because they're they're amazing there's yeah now now there's a Cambrian explosion of meme coins because it's meme coin season and everyone's like people got a 50 000 x uh where what's the next meme coin that also gets you at 50 000 X so now now it's meme coin casino what else is there I don't know I bought one of my friends sent me a contract a contract address on arbitrum and I didn't even look dude this is the next Pepe and you're just like okay I don't care I don't care I didn't look into it I'm like all right whatever I mean it's fine if it's a very small amount of money right and this is what people want to do because they're bored in the bear Market okay it saddens me when people like uh get serious about this and uh Gamble away their life savings but they're free to do that yep um what analysis are we looking at here uh okay so these are just more stats uh from Pepe so like I said 120 2 000 distinct wallets uh top five to six wallets listed here are all Mev bots so you want to know the real winners of the casino games Ryan because they paid some uh Mev to etholders and also um some gas yes if you don't know how to run an emav bot and well it's it's hard to say the eath holders are the winners here it's all they're always youth holders are always the house but right now Mev Bots are first in being the house um it's more it's martialed and also there's fewer of them specifically this one Mev bot um Jared from subway.eath uh if bankless listeners don't know who that is it's um it is the Mev bot that sandwich attacked winter mu um inside of it really yeah Jerry from Subway yeah Jared from Subway is up to some shenanigans on the ethereum blockchain yeah wow that's Jared from subway.eth and you can see it all all in chain here's a a story here that says in less than three months Jared reaped over 40.6 million dollars in Revenue with a profit of six million dollars so Jared from Subway ways just raking it in by running these Bots he's got to program them run them himself and and is making money on these these I guess Mev Arbitrage types of opportunities right exactly right so yeah total revenue 40.6 million dollars paid 34 million dollars in gas fees which is why if you pull up ultrasound.money the supply the burn rate of eth is just like cratering or it's going up the supply of ether is just like going down bigly because Mev Bots are paying such high fees to the ethereum blockchain uh and and so the 40 million dollars of Revenue has been turned into 34 million dollars yeah dude it's been crazy so ethereum deflation is at three percent in the last seven days which is crazy uh go to go to the seven day time frame do we did we break ten thousand dollars or ten thousand eat burnt per day are we at 70 000 this week almost we're at 67.8 000 okay uh so Jared uh from subway.eath the this Infamous uh sandwich attacker bot that is just printing cash 238 000 sandwich attacks um uh attacking more than 106 000. I get it Jerry's from Subway sandwich attack yeah yeah I'm just putting that together now sorry uh 98.3 of Jared's transactions are uh sandwich attacks uh and so um so the the way that this works is that they they uh somebody and the reason why this works is that these tokens are super illiquid uh and so this is why that this is a game uh is that there's of the one point or now I guess it's 700 million dollars a market cap it's like resting on like 100 like I think it was something like 20 million dollars of liquidity so there's only so much liquidity that's supporting this market cap and so since these things are really a liquid this is just a field day for Mev Bots because everyone aping into these things without thinking about it and not doing their price controls and not using Cal swap uh are getting uh like sandwiched by Jared sandwich by Jared uh and so inserting transactions ahead of these buyers to pump up the price and then and then he's selling the transaction the tokens right after people buy inside of the same block just printing money so he's doing this for Pepe obviously and then also he's got the wallet holds 800 tokens that Jared controls so he's just doing this for the entire ethereum casino and so there's this massive casino going on because of the shitcoin Mania that's happening and you're right when you say that the ether holders are the house but Jared from Subway's front running Us by doing Mev sandwich attacks which really he's the dealer at the table taking a cut yes so he is a rogue dealer that is under the table like moving cards around and then instead of the casino making money because the theorem is a casino the Dealer's making the money and though this really hammers home Justin Justin Drake's Mev burn why we need Mev burn because it's one guy is taking all the money for himself instead of Distributing it equally and fairly to all the ether holders which really imparts like why we need ammv we want the sandwiches to go to that yeah that's that's our Casino money yeah how dare you yeah how dare you I'd be a lot less bitter if that went to the Deep Purple you're pretty but you sound pretty greedy David because uh ethas burned a lot this week I mean that's been pretty good you can always burnt more like twice let me ask you about this do you feel like um moralizing about this are you kind of like uh meme coins are bad are you of the mindset that like this is what's wrong with crypto it's giving us a bad reputation now Gary Gensler has additional fodder and so does Brad Sherman and they can go look at these Millennials and their underwear living their parents basement training these meme coins around that's all crypto is good for end of story are you like are you mad about this or what's your take yeah you're you're tapping into my slight uh spiciness attitude today I don't know I don't know like I actually I don't think I don't think that's a wrong take Okay the reason why I'm in crypto is because ethereum produces coordination platforms and one of the byproducts of that is Shake coins and that's good and natural phenomenon I'm not going to moralize like you can't use my blockchain for your coins it's a little bit frustrating that this is like now my third bear market and the whole like funneling and capturing money and giving it to public goods and being able to coordinate around public goods and being able to produce like the Sci-Fi future of uh human coordination and flourishing is isn't like we're still doing the Pepe coins and so like there's a there's a reason why we didn't cover Pepe coins in our weekly live stream it's just like we've done we've done this before like we did this in 2017. we did this in 2021 like we were doing it in 2023 like how many times we're gonna go around the Sun and talk about why can't you be happy for people who got really wealthy here because there's very few of them there's a single leaderboard and we know who they are there's there's it's supposed to be everyone it's supposed to be a systemic level yeah not all boats all boats did not rise Pepe is not going to make the world us more sustainable I guess it is yeah I get it like I would say though one thing to quote you from last week is is ether money is a public good and uh this does go towards contributing towards the economic security of ethereum so there's that at least my overall take is that this is just noise and I don't care about it and I wish um it's a lot of noise it is noisy I know I I would love to be able to channel this out and just like we're building people are bored so they're doing this um I think there's some narrative problems around it but mostly this is just noise I'm not gonna hate on the internet for doing weird internet things I'm feeling funny today done well let's talk about uh the Bitcoin Community because bitcoin's kind of feeling funny as well yeah Bitcoin transaction fees are up in good news that's bullish because Bitcoin long term does not have a way to sustain the economic budget uh and the security budget of Bitcoin so transaction fees going up transaction Revenue going up is kind of bullish but why don't you tell us why transaction fees are going up uh the innovation of the erc20 has migrated its way to bitcoin so using the ordinals protocol we now have brc20s just because they're it's they're copycatting the name they're actually they're not like the erc20 token standard on bitcoin because that doesn't work you don't take the erc20 standard and put it onto Bitcoin via ordinals but the idea is that like yeah we're doing tokens on Bitcoin now uh so using the ordinals protocol we now have Shay coins on bitcoin uh and so uh it's it's more like the semi-fungible for the the people who like the deeper takes the semi-fundable erc115 uh token standard so uh fungible tokens but they're unique as well uh and so there is now a BRC token page there is now a unisat.io Marketplace so we have a Marketplace for tokens on bitcoin um the first token is ORD Ordy for ordinals and so if you want to access the uni stat Marketplace you first need to buy a brc20 with a unisat wallet and then you need to Mint 20 new inscriptions into Bitcoin ordinals and the beautiful thing about it so this is this is like the utility what does an already token do which is the first brc20 on the ordinals protocol it gives you access to the marketplace so it's like a token gated access to the marketplace and so the thing is like the crazy thing that this is genius Ryan is what they did is that in order to access the marketplace you had to Mint 20 new brc20 tokens and so in order to even enter the access enter the marketplace you had to supply 20 new tokens into the market so the marketplace can have it yeah you're not you didn't need to do anything with them you just needed to and so like what this did is this filled up the Bitcoin block space because everyone was minting brc20 tokens because they wanted to access the uni sat Marketplace and so what did that do it congested the Bitcoin blockchain it got people talking about it it went viral uh people shared it on Twitter it became a movement okay so brc20 the Marquee cap of brc20 tokens uh 537 million that's funny it was uh 700 million literally two hours ago when I made this I mean as you would expect that's 206 million and 24 uh over a billion earlier this week can I just ask real quick about the user experience of something like Eunice unistat that's me I haven't used it it but it doesn't sound easy this is not like metamask pay gas fee hit the button and swap I mean we really are maximizing the um capability of this TI-83 calculator here and people are getting really creative with it yeah let me say you can play Doom on the TI-83 calculator like there's a lot left to juice to squeeze I'd say actually okay well so um this is a tweet from Eric Wall this is a chart of what happens when somebody correctly circuits the Ponzi wires what are we looking at here and this is what I was talking about so these are uh all of the marketplaces of Bitcoin to ordinals or to swap ordinals wallet and then unisats and because of the UMass mint 20 brcs in order to enter the unisat marketplace it's just the by far the biggest one right it's crushing like Magic Mountain right so okay this is oh the unisat marketplace so this is Bitcoin this is Bitcoin and then okay the already token recently got listed on a centralized exchange now on gate uh so we have Bitcoin tokens Ryan there's tokens on bitcoin being traded on centralized exchanges which is I I never thought I'd see the day I think that's kind of cool all right so here's the chart of uh the auditory tokens you're saying yeah it looks similar it's not quite Pepe but you know it's got some uh 290 million dollar market cap also just got minted in like the last when did it when did that thing get started like in the last week that's incredible okay so Bitcoin Bitcoin yeah this is a Bitcoin denomination uh I mean that's bullish in a way but tell me tell me about block space demand so um yeah what are we looking at here so this is two charts of ordinal inscriptions so how many inscriptions there are made via the ordinals pro uh uh protocol uh and then also fees paid over time which is just like the highest Spike I've ever seen on on bitcoin so inscriptions just like one um uh creation of an ordinal creation of an inscription there was one day last week where um uh blockchain transaction fees on on bitcoin transaction fees um were larger than actual issuance which I'm not sure that has ever well here we go um daily fees can you share look at that okay so it's hard to articulate this for the podcast listeners but daily fees is flat and then it's just vertical it goes so high so quickly I've never seen a pair of a parabola like that and then this next right run okay this is this is a crazy stat this is a once this has never this is a new record for Bitcoin in its entire lifespan the amount of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be confirmed in the Bitcoin men pool at the highest oh my God look at this I did the one year it is has never been higher Bitcoin has broken its own record in how long has Bitcoin been around 14 years 13 years we have never seen more pending transactions in Bitcoin ever not even close because of ordinals what's interesting here so the the mempool is getting clogged basically so this means transaction fees on bitcoin have to be going up right yes and maybe we'll get to part of that story but this one uh observation here is if you want to be a smart contract platform you're going to have to deal with smart contract platform problems yeah that's kind of what this is right I mean we talk about Mev we talk about okay where did the the proceeds for crazy um congestion fees go do they go to minors they go to or do we burn them to someone else it's a same set of problems that ethereum has had to deal with because these are common problems to any programmable uh blockchain and with Taproot the implementation of Taproot Bitcoin became slightly programmable just a little bit just preventable enough so it's just starting to get these problems which is fascinating to me here is a tweet from binance we've temporarily closed Bitcoin withdrawals so the Bitcoin network is experiencing a congestion issue wow our team is working currently to fix uh uh until the network is stabilized it will reopen Bitcoin withdrawals as soon as possible I mean fees going up you know ten dollars to transfer a Bitcoin uh that's crazy here's the ordinals marketplace going crazy as well tell me about though this cultural change yeah that this has caused or like some dissent in the ranks of uh Bitcoin supporters what's uh what's your take on this so far so we have uh two main characters here I'll say uh the good kind of American main characters Eric wall and Nick Carter who are coming on next Tuesday for the state of the nation I'm gonna I'm so excited for that episode uh here's a meme of a dandelion a weed just growing out of concrete the concrete is Bitcoin maximalism the weed is Taproot uh and so Eric Wall is saying uh I'm gonna go that's a tweet Eric Wallace saying what happened today was the emergence of the brc20 asset class it wasn't an attack it wasn't a DDOS Taproot has just made it simple to productize the Bitcoin block space into any arbitrary protocol shitcoin trading protocols is an obvious buyer of that black space block space and so he's saying the expressiveness that that we've had on ethereum Smart contracts is being created on bitcoin via Taproot and then his next tweet is the uh look at me where we are the Hornets now it's the I'm in charge now meme except he's got the the Bitcoin wizard hat and the wizard beard because this is the these are the memes of the Bitcoin space and so this is like look at look at me we're in charge now hey Bitcoin fundamentalists who are like get your coinery out of our chain uh our chain is for Bitcoin we're in charge we're in charge now the builders are in charge we have two camps now again and this isn't the first time that that Bitcoin has divided into two camps Nick Carter wrote a great editorial uh piece about this and kind of the remember the the big blockers and the small blockers um that this was um back in you know the 2017 I think 2017 2018 blockchain uh block size Wars in in Bitcoin and basically the the big blockers went and you know forked off with Bitcoin cash they went another Direction and the small blockers kept Bitcoin block space uh smaller and kept it as a premium asset this is a similar split in the Bitcoin Community where you have the the hardcore I call them maybe Bitcoin Maximus or call them Bitcoin fundamentalists who just they just think that this kind of activity is beneath Bitcoin is Unholy why Thou shalt not hold any other asset but Bitcoin right so they don't like any of these these memes the Ponzi tokens they they hate it it's impure and then there's like more Bitcoin pragmatists I think it's maybe a larger set of the population like Eric Wall like Nick Carter who are like uh if we want Bitcoin the network to succeed we have to sell block space right that is fundamental and you don't get to decide right what the block space is used for the credible neutrality of Bitcoin just says it it just is and by the way this is actually a good thing for the Bitcoin Network because it's a source of economic sustainability into the future as issuance starts to run dry so these are the two camps that are kind of competing for cultural mind share right now right okay and like the crazy thing is is like even when you apply like Crypt Bitcoin fundamentalists Maxi principles Eric and Nick are still right and so here's an Eric tweet so he goes 90 of a lightning laser-eyed Maxis used Noster a centralized custodial lightning uh provider and it's just like you it's like a lightning Network which is deemed Holy by the Bitcoin maximalist except it's centralized and custodial which is insane and then he continues and goes 90 of magicians which is now the name of a tribe which is how you know it's good because it's got a name uh trading ordinals inscriptions using non-custodial trustless psbt Atomic swaps I don't know what psbt is so basically he's saying hey hey what ordinals is it's trustless it's Atomic it is non-custodial and all of the the the uh the holy narratives of Bitcoin which is you know lightning network is custodial and trusted and just like totally ass backwards so if you scroll down hit his next tweet it's so good uh he goes uh an IOU Bitcoin equals Fiat which is the custodial lightning the laser-eyed Maxis are the coiners and he follows again he goes we built a more trustless decentralized protocol for trading our horribly inefficient ordinal nfts and brc20 tokens in two months you're not even using trustless solutions to send micro payments after seven years all caps you failed oh it's so good it's so good I mean he's saying one set of users is banked and the other is bankless that's basically right that's our exactly parlance and then ameen soleimani follows up and goes I discovered this this payments problem it means solomonia was innovating on uh payment channels on on ethereum uh when we were trying to figure out how to scale ethereum he goes I discovered this five years ago when I tried to use ethereum State channels for my campsite he made his pink chain our work helped rule out State channels as a long-term layer 2 solution and each nerds double down on plasma which eventually became layer 2 Roll-Ups and finishes off saying good to see bitcoiners catching up to which Eric Wall responds LOL this is because um some bitcoiners are realizing that lightning which uses State Channel technology isn't all it's cracked up to be a lot of challenges with it right um what uh what is Michael Saylor saying should we play this clip I think we should play this trip Michael's hair has an interesting take so I think that well what happened with ordinals and nft crossed this Chasm from what was a bearish scenario to a bullish scenario if I was a miner I would be ecstatic I think that long term it there are a lot of implications long term the implication is there's going to be a lot of applications on the Bitcoin base layer yeah if I can inscribe a piece of art right an nft is kind of an art but I could also inscribe my last will and testament and if my last will and testament is moving a billion dollars from me to you how much is it worth to you to have that burned onto the blockchain and cryptographically verified yeah at least a billion dollars what you pay 20 bucks yeah 100 yeah here's a smart contract so there are interesting applications it's funny because so so obviously sailor is team um not team full not playing maximum he's he's totally okay with this but it's so funny to like yeah nfds are fine if they're on my blockchain and cookies are fantastic so our tokens if they pump my bags that there's some deep uh hypocrisy here I think among some members of the Bitcoin Community I don't see it in Eric Waldo or Nick Carter no um personally this is a tweet from Nick Carter now if Bitcoin could find a way to return this Capital to Holders instead of it being siphoned out by minor so of course all the transaction fees going straight to minors and then transaction fees lots lots of Revenue that was the smartest thing eth ever did frankly and I was skeptical of it eth of course burning right uh these transaction fees rather than Distributing them to uh to minors and stakers so I look man they're coming around uh Eric was says this is probably the funniest year in Bitcoin ever uh I agree and the laser-eyed Maxis are now the laser-eyed ringing Maxis and Eric wall and Nick Carter the people that I've always been aligned with and always thought were just like on the Pinnacle of what this crypto industry is doing are finally being uh have the foundation for them to stand on because they couldn't stand up to the Cyber Hornets without something like the ordinals protocol supporting them and and their points in their areas of emphasis I'm cheering Bitcoin on in this yes I I still think what's ironic because I still think never enjoyed Bitcoin more than I have in the in the last like month or so they're still kind of years behind on these things they still are going through their estate channels era dude I don't know if it makes me more bullish on bitcoin or not but it is uh it is fun to witness it's trending in the right direction that's for sure this is now a bullish Bitcoin podcast at least semi-ball semi-ball uh we need to get to uh the rest of the show Ryan and so coming up next is Brad Sherman's beautiful beautiful sound bite that will be imprinted in the crypto industry somebody should inscribe it into the Bitcoin blockchain so we're going to get to that sound bite as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask for all of the crazy crypto dragon that we use on the

he said crypto Bros make money literally by making money and they've made over a trillion dollars out of thin air they'll accuse the U.S government of making money out of thin air maybe we do but we're the US government there it is David all the way down you just said it it's like it's not okay when you print money right it's only okay when I print money yeah that's what he's saying yeah that's I I don't have another take that's that's all you have to say Brad Sherman has more takes six years ago the late great Robert F Kennedy went after tax evader says U.S attorney general today his son is slated to speak at a conference for tax evaders this is Robert F Kennedy Jr he is going to a Bitcoin conference in Miami Beach and this is Brad Sherman calling the attendees of this conference tax evaders conference for tax evaders it's a conference for tax evaders yes um what about you David that's great for marketing I pay my taxes and it's a big giant pain in the ass to pay taxes when uh you have unclear regulation and unfavorable regulation with respect to tracking these transactions um and I and almost everyone I know in crypto also pays their taxes and for Brad Sherman to just like blanket the entire industry and say anyone who goes to a like a crypto conference anyone who's in the crypto industry doesn't pay their taxes like what is this guy doing man it's insane man the the anti-crypto army of Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman are just a bunch of geriatrics dude this picture U.S government right now this is a clowns AI generated oh no that's a real picture actually that is uh photographed that's a photograph but this is not a photograph what are you talking about photos it looks just like it's not all right um Lido looks like they are enabling withdrawals uh finally it's taken them a while but but here we are what's happening I guess we can't say uh the withdrawals is totally over because lydo still needs to enable withdrawals uh and so on on-train vote going out today Friday uh that will go live if the vote passes on May 15th uh will allow for Stakes ether withdrawals out of Lido along with some protocol improvements as well uh and so light is getting a big upgrade but the big news is that if there is demand to it unstake from Lido people are free to withdraw from light out so we'll we will see if lydo can hold on to all of the Ethan it has and that's going to be yeah big area of attention next week another snow globe shaking event uh how about arbitrum they got some news this week about Surplus revenue from transaction fees in the Dow yeah this is really cool okay so very good tweet thread which we don't have time to go into but I will summarize it for you bankless listeners so all users on arbitrum one pay a fee of course when you transact on the network arbitrum just like ethereum has a gas fee this fee is split into two components an L1 fee that pays for the L1 gas that the arbitrary Network pays in ethereum to post this data and also a layer 2 fee to page for the layer 2 Network costs that layer 2 fee is split into two components itself one is called the base fee which is pretty synonymous with the base view on the layer one and also a surplus fee which is like profit on top of that just for prop making sure the profitable the network is profitable so the layer one gas feed goes through the layer one sequencer so the arbitrum sequencer fronts the cost of posting data to the blockchain for arbitrum and then the layer 1 base feed goes through to refund the sequencer for its costs so at the present amount the refund is about 6 000 ether so the sequencer costs 6000 ether and there is a 582 ether Surplus that the layer one fees on uh on from arbitrum uh a surplus that was not needed and so it's going to the Dow and so because the sequencer charged more fees than it needed a surplus of 582 each is going to the Dow now go back going back to the layer two fees we have the base fee which accumulated 1308 ether is going to the Dow and then the Surplus fee which is anything on for the congestion uh like if the model for this is is contention versus content contention and congestion this is base fee and surplus view but this is arbitrum terminology base fee 1308 E3 Surplus fee 1462 ether all of that going to arbitrum Dao so if you tally all of this up we're getting something like uh 30 and 400 ether ish 3332 ether going to the arbitrum Dao that is profit foreign what's the time period here don't no actually that's a good point what's interesting about this is the model for a layer two is basically like a value-added reseller of ethereum block space and so they're putting their value on it and then they're charging a profit and that's how layer twos uh retain profitability essentially now arbitrim is delivering this back to the Dow um very cool this is a interesting new model here here's the take from plenia um and actually economically sustainable protocol in crypto crazy talk arbitrum Dao netted six million dollars the cost of operation was 11 million dollars pretty impressive layer twos like arbitrum are profitable uh that's good to see sustainable economics in crypto when eip4844 comes in Ryan the it gonna cost real operation drops so big yeah yeah Brian's been busy Brian Armstrong look at all these photos in uh the Middle East here with Brian meeting with various folks what's the story here uh so this is the uh Brian world star Bluff collar strong arm segment Armstrong strong arm so what's what why is Brian tweeting out a picture with the minister of the economy of the United States United States Edinburgh Emirates he's also meeting with her excellent Excellency SCA CEO Dr Miriam I don't know uh somebody in the Dubai uh also the minister of state of foreign trade uh from the United State of uh Emirates and then he tweets out the UAE deserves a lot of credit for being Forward Thinking on crypto first dedicated crypto regulator in the world clear rule book published uh very clearly published business friendly strong customer protections really enjoying my visit so far Brian Armstrong absolute world star going on a world tour talking to officials in Pro crypto countries why is he broadcasting his world star Ness Ryan what do you think is the angle here perhaps it's like when you break up with someone and so you start like posting pictures of all of these amazing yeah it's kind of like that I mean Brian's Brian's like like look what you're missing I mean I am a us-based company entrepreneur these Regulators aren't crazy from these other countries and so he's making that very public I think that's the the signal here obviously there's some expansion reasons that coinbase is uh looking at the Middle East but I think that's a core message and why this is so public that's exactly right okay moving on uh PayPal has disclosed that it's safeguarding nearly one billion dollars in crypto assets half a billion dollars in Bitcoin 362 million dollars in each so PayPal has uh because uh for as a custodian is a billion dollars in customers crypto nice you know what they're going to want to do next David is stake something I'm pretty sure nice uh Elon Musk is tweeting about the ladies there is no meme I love you Milady tweet what does this do to the price of milady's David when I have not looked I can only imagine it is up cool so the story this week is uh milady's tweeting by Elon Musk and meme coins huh that's what crypto's giving us yep yep it moving on so apparently Arthur Hayes and suzu got some beef what are we looking at here this is a court document well actually I'm pretty sure it's just Arthur Hayes that has beefed with uh suzu so suzu has filed a restraining order against Arthur Hayes uh and so the order prohibits haze from using threatening abusive or insulting words and making any threatening abusive or insulting communication that would cause applicant harassment harm or distress and so uh three arrows Capital O's are there Haze um uh excuse me three O's a billion dollars in individual claims of which Arthur Hayes is some of that and Hayes has just been absolutely harassing suzu on on Twitter uh and so here's a bunch of tweets uh in that Arthur Hayes has that you know name a date time and location of Kyle and suzu I bet some creditors would love to have a chat with them followed up with a little birdie told me Suzy was in Singapore trying to keep a low profile I know you ain't broke Brock come and see Daddy and make amends I won't hurt I promise kissy face kissy face kissy face uh so because of Arthur Hayes's um posturing public tweets he has now a restraining order against suzu come on honestly came to me David these tweets look tame to me I don't uh the two times that we've done a podcast with Arthur Hayes he's been in gym clothes man I don't want him I don't want to owe him money I mean but like what are these guys doing I I don't understand unless there's more to it than just these tweets publicly I mean you've lost people millions and hundreds of millions of dollars guys like with yeah people are gonna be upset about that or fraud they may say means it's okay to lose people's money it's not okay to do it with fraud yeah absolutely uh here we go stripe expanding access to crypto on-ramp with a new hosted option you know what David stripe has been more and more supportive of crypto over time and of course they serve a massive amount of emergency through the payments API um it's used by Brave use buy safe used by one inch use by lens I think this is pretty bullish longer term for crypto adoption World coin and the Beloved orb finally has a mobile wallet so if you didn't want to put your eye into the orb you could still download the wallet on your phone uh and so World coin app is do I have to stick my eye into the phone no it's like into the app uh you know I don't think the app scans your eye it doesn't have the technology to do that uh and so um this is just a huge part of the world coin Tech stack which uh I've been learning about recently Ryan and it is it's a crazy Tech stack um I mean man it's an app it is this crazy Biometrics orb thing it is a layer 2 stack it is a token uh it is yeah I mean marketing is it a crazy company um anyways uh the app is out oh and that is a very core component of this whole thing it is the mechanism to which the Ubi part of worldcoin is going to get distributed I am undecided on world coin it's very I'm warming up here because I like I'm not I'm leaving the door open for myself personally it's it's got some strikes against it it's very much like a VC type coin um the whole it's called World coin David like what The Branding is the biggest issue about world coin but if you can get if you can suspend your disbelief the world coin story is pretty compelling I don't know yet of course everyone's like oh but they got your data but they actually don't and and it's really easy to cancel worldcoin for like the whole data thing but they actually don't got your data if you trust that they don't I'm at the point where I want to hear them out though um yes it like they're making some cool choices too right I'm building this as a roll-up is a cool choice not doing kind of an L1 chain and like pumping the price of uh World coin from the get goes like and I know actually well should we should we say so David is doing an interview with one of the founders of uh World coin and also Sam Altman who oh that wasn't it but I that is happening yeah so we are doing okay yeah we're doing a we're doing a podcast on worldcoin so we'll arm the bankless community with with some knowledge here uh from the source and you guys can make a decision on unlike whether this is good or whether this is uh some dystopian future here what's your Alpha I got uh breakfast with a DC Builder from the world coin project uh ZK researcher uh researcher at the world coin uh and so he of course brought the orb with him so we're gonna put the little oh god oh my god there it is do you stick anything into that I have not been orbed I did not stick anything into the orb dude see this is what I mean this looks so like the I've been thinking that this is like the worst thing about world coin is that they have this like dystopian sci-fi like um cosmetic layer to the whole system uh but like if okay they need to scan your iris and the and then they also need to layer on a bunch of other biometric stuff to make sure that you're not faking it so the crazy Innovation about the world coin orb is not that is just an iris scanning mechanism it's an iris scanning mechanism plus like 18 different layers of anti-fraudulent technology and so it's a bunch of other scanners as well to make sure you don't need Hardware like that and you need the hardware to look like something and it just turns out it looks like some yes like there's no friendly ways like what you what are you gonna do like try and turn it into a teddy bear that's like even worse right and so like they came up with the silver orb which I like it's like the the least bad version of how this works uh anyways one of the reasons why like me and other people are have come around slowly to worldcoin is that people like DC Builder generally beloved by the community did not need to be compelled by World coin uh but uh like I would call him incredibly neutral Builder that got a job at worldcoin and got compelled by the vision and there's been a few of those and so you know trusting that they are smart people who are making good decisions I don't know there's so many questions still though too including the question of Sam Altman he's already got some scary uh AI Tech yeah right like uh at least trying to solve for the problem that he's also creating maybe that's why I'm listening that's why I wanna I I am I don't know in information seeking mode I would say about this project speaking of uh solving AI problems ethereum attestation service launch a new feature a test and verify any type of document or file why do you need to do this because it's going to be increasingly hard to actually attest to the validity and originality of content on the on in the world these days and so with the ethereum attestation service you can easily generate a half of your content and let others verify against the hash to say you are the creator of this content as the originator quick news uh bittrex has filed for bankruptcy bittrex in the United States um good night sweet prince that was my first exchange did you know that was it really yeah never used bittrex it was basically also blockworks announced a big fundraise so this is the crypto Media company that uh bankless throws a party with every year a conference called permissionless which by the way conference yeah you can get tickets to right now um this is uh Yano we we got a lot wrong over the years but one thing we got right was our early thesis as crypto grew exponentially the industry's participants would demand better information and so they built block Works block works I feel like is a crypto media org that's doing a lot of things right like I'm a big fan of um Jason and the team over at blockworks and and Mike and what they're doing so this is a 12 million dollar raise on 135 million dollar valuation wow well done who knew crypto media companies right uh this valuable impressive uh we're actually we're doing our Twitter spaces with Jason and Mike the two founders of blockworks so two founders of Bank list two founders of blockworks we're going to talk about crypto media that's going to be sometime in two weeks from now unscheduled um but that's gonna be pretty cool so mark your calendars even though I didn't give you a date uh it's a really interesting conversation um yeah crypto media yeah I do too there's a lot of unique things about crypto that uh are difficult to get right when you're talking about media jobs we got jobs of the week here on the bankless jobs boards I'm going to whip right through them bankless Ventures needs an investment analyst internship needs a staff blockchain engineer and a smart contract engineer and Phantom needs a software engineer and a software engineer for front-end and mobile premium needs a web 3 product management architect lead dinero needs a smart contract engineer uniswap a whole bunch of jobs too oh my God I can't keep up with all of them but they're all available for you on the bankless jobs board that's bankless.palot.com jobs get a job in crypto David what do we have coming up next coming up next we got the questions from the nation is eigenlayer a threat to ethereum decentralization we're going to answer that one as well as the hot takes from crypto Twitter and of course the meme of the week which is extra spicy this week and we got a Moment of Zen which I think is the coolest marketing stunt has ever been done by a crypto exchange uh Kraken uh funded this guy to scam scam artists and so around for the Moment of Zen you know uniswap it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over 1.4 trillion dollars in trading volume you know this because we talk about it endlessly on bakeless it's you to swap but uniswap is becoming so much more uniswap Labs just released the uniswap mobile wallet for iOS the newest easiest way to trade tokens on the go

uniswap wallet today on iOS there is a link in the show notes this first question is from leaf on Earth is eigenlayer actually a huge danger for if decentralization you've given only the pause positive side so far but I found this article quite compelling he then links they then link to an article from Galaxy which is exploring Mev on eigenlayer pointing out the the dangers look at this of uh cross domain Mev and how that could be a threat to the decentralization of ethereum so David what do you think we've covered the benefits of eigen layer are we down planing downplaying the the negatives from it what would you say to this question yeah I think that this is pretty prescient and the I would say the answer is pretty clearly yes um is eigenlayer a danger for eth decentralization yes this is a big uh cause of concern of a lot of the ethereum core devs if you will um I know Justin Drake is interested in this uh I know dank rat is interested in this um and I wouldn't say it's just because of cross domain Mev and what that means is Mev across blockchains or across systems if you are staking on multiple systems there are mov opportunities that you would have if you're that are large if you uh compared to if you were just staking on one domain one one blockchain so that is one concern another concern is that if there's a bunch of networks that you are restaking your ether to the more networks that you reshake your ether to the more computational resource requirements are needed to do that and so if there are a bunch of networks that you need to resync to you have to have a bigger and beefier computer and then also there's more Mev opportunities if you are validating more blocks and so it's just tilts towards economies of scale and so something like Lido or coinbase who has a very large amount of ether staked are going to be able to have higher yields because they're being going to be able to restake and provide more services in a more professionalized Manner and be able to get more yields so people are going to be like solo staking I can't compete with coinbase because they're getting more yield and so they just stick with coinbase so yes I would say that is a concern I would say this is a similar level of concern that we felt as an ecosystem at the Genesis of Mev and then what did we do we spent three years to research to where we are now which are in protocol solutions that are on the roadmap to solve for this um so I don't think that this is a disastrous problem it is a problem that does need to be addressed and so I think leaf on Earth is very prescient and tuned in to some of the issues here yeah absolutely it's and it's something that we'll have to address over the years to come in fact you know our Twitter spaces we did as a follow-up episode with Justin Drake he actually brought this up yeah and uh he thinks that some of the mechanism mechanisms from our episode with respect to like Mev smoothing and Mev Byrne some of those same things can be at play in kind of the restaking Mev subset of problems so uh I think it's a it's a matter of like the cat and mouse game right Mev is a tricky solution and now it's it's kind of like migrating the moloch problems are kind of migrating to restaking and so what do we have to do as a community we have to plug this hole um maybe this is the last one we have to plug there will probably be others I think decentralization is not a one-time fight where you like design a protocol and you get it right it's um a series of uh things that you put in place over time to to correct for uh and and to propagate decentralization and to prevent centralization all right David let's get to what we're bullish on this week uh how about you my friend what do you bullish on uh there is this new project that has not launched but they've released a bunch of information about what they are working on it's called Nocturne uh and so this is something that uh swept the Twitter sphere by storm when they when they released their docs which is how you know that people are are tapping into this what is not sorry about documents huh I'm so excited about documents yeah so uh Nocturne is a layer one smart contract uh that is tapping into Innovations in the world of account abstraction to build a private bank account uh is how I would simplify that in a veritable word think of like Aztec as a layer two private Layer Two but uh private bank account on the layer one a private smart contract so privacy using zero knowledge cryptography as a private bank account and so you can put your money into this single smart contract along with everyone else but kind of like how tornado cash would pull up everyone but then you would still get to like be have your claim over your assets and then the smart contract manages it for you gives you privacy for people who are all using the bank account and that is privacy on the layer one seems so simple that don't know why people haven't built this yet I guess we just needed Innovations in uh cryptography and and your knowledge cryptography but this is something I'm excited about imagine having a private smart contract on the layer one that's what I'm both yeah because a privacy and crypto is largely unsolved I mean Bitcoin is a completely public ethereum is by default completely public and you know Aztec is trying to solve it in their their own layer too um but what about all of the other layer twos that we use in the day-to-day what about the ethereum mainnet right how do we maintain privacy uh so that's what this solves and of course tornado cash got recently outlawed for American citizens so um I mean the surveillance State ain't gonna like this one David I think I think that's a take here um but we'll have to see how this plays out yeah right uh I mean speaking of I guess the surveillance State we had a really interesting conversation recording either earlier this week that was not expecting I mean I knew that the recording was on our calendar I mean I wasn't expecting that um I would enjoy this conversation so much was with Rowan gray and this is a guest we had on three years ago almost and I don't know how to put this guy in a box like from a world view we don't know how to categorize him don't he's uncategorizable if that's a word he doesn't like crypto he doesn't love crypto and three years ago we almost had him on it in kind of a debate or some what we perceived as at the time anti-crypto legislation um we had a debate on kind of the merits of crypto versus what he's proposing I feel like he's come around now he has a healthy respect for crypto which is different but like he's not um it's not I would say an Institutional Republican or an Institutional Democrat um I don't I don't think you could characterize him as being right but calling him like left is not quite right either because he's not like a kind of the neoliberal type left but let me tell you what he's fighting for he's fighting for not a cdbc he hates the term cdbc Because he believes it's believed it's been co-opted co-opted by the central bankers and bankers in general he's fighting for a digital dollar an e-cash that preserves privacy at the base layer and is available for all citizens of the United States to give people who don't have Banks the unbanked basically a way to preserve a cash type instrument as we migrate to the digital economy because dollar bills are going away I mean like that's not going to be a form you can use and so in the absence of that you're just using like a c cdbc basically like right right now if you have uh dollars in your Wells Fargo account it's almost like a Proto cdbc right because these are really like dollar ious you can't control it I mean if if uh Wells Fargo wants to revoke your access because it doesn't like your political opinion or something like that um I mean they could send you a Dear John Letter for any reason right and so this kind of gets away from that and it preserves that that civil liberty and I guess what was interesting in this conversation David is um the common cause we found with him that I was not quite expecting it was almost like a an Olive Branch from the commitment holy Alliance which I think is an Unholy Alliance and uh there is some common ground he he isn't completely on board with everything that crypto is doing I mean he's much more um I mean he's much more David has called him status and that might be the right term for this he he thinks that the government is assistance yeah yes uh he thinks the government is a solution to far more public goods than I think you or I would say like we would say ethereum is a public good and he would say it's not a public good it's an open permissionless network right and that the public is the word for the state yes and yet even with all of those differences there's subcommonality here uh and uh I don't know maybe there's another way that we can influence um members in Congress and members of of government to actually uh support what we're doing here in crypto because we need some allies and particularly I think we need allies uh in the U.S on the on the Democrat side of things right um and where are those allies going to come from it's going to come from those who want uh to bypass the banks and preserve a digital private cash type money system as we migrate into the digital age crypto can be a part of that but maybe his idea of a digital Dollar in ecash is a part of that as well but there's an alliance in the making there I think that that's that's what I'm bullish about that was kind of uh an interesting conversation this week we have successfully teased three shows on the podcast including the fourth show that was the Justin Drake episode that we released last week man we're good at our jobs yes teasing other shows that's why you come to the roll up uh let's get to the meme of the week David this is uh Gary learning about a new term the term oh Gee let's take a listen oh great Gary awesome so what were the letters you said OD like oh gee thanks does OG stand for something I actually don't know original original gangster okay Original Gangster thank you thank you I actually love old Gary this is MIT Gary and he was actually good no it was um my how things have changed David we've got a Moment of Zen of the week I'm gonna fade out with versus disclaimers as usual but why don't you tee this up for us so there is this a streamer on Twitch called kit Boga kit Boga show uh he's famous for scamming scammers and so scammers will try and scam him and he will record that and turn it into a stream and then that's that's what he does he's a streamer that that like just sends scammers On A Wild Goose trace and so he's partnered up with Kraken and Kraken customized a live environment so it's on kraken.com but they made him a fake account so it looks like he is actually sending Bitcoins and so the scammers are in on it and then he just like messes with them and it's hilarious and so just it's first off this is a marketing stunt to buy Kraken and it's whoever came up with this idea is really creative and is good at their drops so Props to that person uh and this is hilarious so that is the Moment of Zen you are about to hear everybody wins except the scammers that's how uh we like things I never knew that scammers could be so vulgar Ryan they're rude they are rude they're not nice people they're not nice people who would have who would have expected this risks and disclaimers guys all this stuff crypto we're talking about it's all risky of course but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot this gamer thinks I'm about to send him a 455 000 worth of bitcoin but I typed the wrong wallet address why didn't you copy and paste might be you type something wrong ah there is three three dkp three GK where the B is coming from I I know I typed it right that was not the right address how could you mess up this badly I already mistake why did you do that yo why'd you pick a three it looks just like a b you did it damn it literally you are the most idiotic most dumbest most I've literally no words at the moment and I'm that much angry 450 000 are you serious right now you
