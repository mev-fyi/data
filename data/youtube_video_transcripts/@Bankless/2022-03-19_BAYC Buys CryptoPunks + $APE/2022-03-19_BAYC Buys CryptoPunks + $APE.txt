the biggest acquisition in nft history apes bought the punks david i don't know how you feel about that i'm looking at a punk in your background but hugo labs purchased all of the intellectual property from um from the crypto punks holders uh larva labs tell us what this means so for every nft project there is ip associated with it the ip for crypto punk was now actually not owned by the owners of the crypto punks it was still owned by larval lab so like commercial licenses was not something that you could do with crypto punks and so now yuga labs which are the founders behind board apes and mutant apes struck a deal with larva labs to acquire the ip and when they did they gave the punk holders the rights to their own commercial licenses for their punk so i can start going out and making merch and branding out of my crypto punk if i so choose let's talk about the token really quick yeah so yoga labs minted and airdropped apecoin this is now like the nation of the apes they have their own identity and their own currency and now they have to build out their world
