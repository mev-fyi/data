all the alt layer ones are down way worse than the rest of the market cardano down 65 solana down 81 from all-time high polka dot down 83 from all-time high avalanche down 78 from all-time high we don't even have luna on this thing because luna is literally down 100 i actually think that the death of luna this week really marks the end of the alternative layer one trait and what i think we're going to see is actually a return to some fundamentals and rotators will rotate into the next narrative as well and if the next narrative is stronger fundamentals i don't think they're going to be flying into bitcoin so much i think they're going to be coming to ethereum and then later to layer two so they'll rotate of course into fiat for a while into us dollars but then they'll come back and they'll say okay what's going to return fastest in crypto is it going to be ether bitcoin and i would put my money on ether because it has d5 it has nfts and it has killer economics coming up especially post merge
