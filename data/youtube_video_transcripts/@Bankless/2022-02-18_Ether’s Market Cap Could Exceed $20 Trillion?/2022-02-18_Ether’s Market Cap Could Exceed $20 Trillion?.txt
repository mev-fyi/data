ether's market cap could exceed 20 trillion dollars in the next 10 years frank can you explain to us why this comparison is justified and how this kind of lends itself to why ether's market cap might exceed 20 trillion dollars you know if you have a global financial system built on top of ethereum the native currency the the most secure form of of currency on that blockchain you can obscribe at some value of some monetary value and you can do it almost similar to how we did it for bitcoin and we don't break out a specific number here but you see uh like el salvador is uh adopting bitcoin for example and that's an emerging market in the same way ethereum is being adopted by nfts and that's its own emerging market that gives value to to ether so we're we're kind of you know seeing this hybrid between a global development platform that earns revenue from the economies built on top plus value to the token as being the native currency in that economy
