ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com gemini is the world's most trusted

bankless i'm doing a really good ryan 2021 has already shaped up to be a banger year for crypto and we are just four days into it so much has happened in the last few weeks and i'm pretty sure that trend is only going to continue into 2021. we are seeing so much innovation happening especially in the realm of algorithmic uncollateralized stable coins that is a brand new field that we are exploring today here on the state of the nation with dan i have a ton of questions to ask about how these systems are built how they're designed how they are maintained and how they maintain the peg how they maintain security uh so it really should be a really interesting conversation and i'm excited to see what happens in this world of uncollateralized stable coins in 2021 yeah i have probably just as many questions as most of the folks listening and watching today so it'll be it'll be good to talk about them as usual guys if you're watching this on youtube live you can ask questions as we record this of dan uh or ourselves we'll try to get to those questions as we can we've also got some new stuff going on in the nation david as usual so we just released another episode with vitalik where we talk about three of his um articles basically are actually two articles and then we talk about the the the launch of eve 2.0 fantastic episode that came out monday make sure you catch this i make it a habit of listening to every single vitalik episode i can uh oftentimes listening to it multiple times because they're just so deep and uh interesting david any takeaways from that one every time we talk to vitalik i just learn so so much and i often listen to the podcast back even though i was there when we recorded it i listened to it again because vitalik is just so incredibly precise in his speech that he often packs so much punch into a single sentence that i don't really always grasp it the first time around and so listening to it a second time or sometimes even a third time has always been really really uh really really helpful for for me being precise in my speech is something i definitely aspire to and it's a skill that vitalik has uh not that vitalik has mastered extremely well both in speaking and in writing i'm quite impressed by it overall and the episode that we recorded with him it goes through his why proof of stake article uh which is came out in november really really timely especially for people that are staking their ether on the beacon chain or intend to stake into the future or just have questions as to how ethereum came to be where it is today in the design principles and the design ethos behind ethereum and behind proof-of-stake vitality does a great job laying down the arguments for proof-of-stake the thesis and theories and ethos behind proof-of-stake why it was chosen and why it was incorporated into ethereum and then we also get into his uh his other article concave and convex dispositions which kind of actually does a really good job helping me formulate my uh theories as to why this space is so tribal and vitalik categorizes uh or offers an explanation is like people are tribal because of these different dispositions and how they think and he characterizes them as convex or concave disposition so understanding how kind of like the cards have fallen in the crypto space through that lens has also been really helpful for me absolutely we also just released a new weekly nft newsletter so if you're subscribed to bank list you can also subscribe to this token so uh digitally scarce uh art uh items um virtual worlds this sort of thing all in sort of the metaverse we think that's going to be a huge investing theme and crypto theme and d5 theme for 2021's want to keep you up to speed we'll include a link in the show notes where you can subscribe to that as well lastly we've got chris dixon who is the uh the manager of the andrew and horowitz crypto fund he's coming on the past let me see tomorrow right david so we're lining that up that will be released the following monday so catch that next week of course you get it early you're a bankless uh subscriber premium member but i'm really excited about that episode with chris david any any thoughts as we go into that episode next week yeah chris to me is somebody that gets it uh he had to talk uh about the different price cycles the hype cycles of crypto which we know that these that's how these things happen uh and so i think i'm focused on asking chris okay we are clearly moving into a new cycle how is this cycle the same but also more importantly how is it different like why will this fourth cycle of crypto be different what will be the new things that come out of it um is are there any is this just going to be another bubble or are we actually going to be able to sustain some of the growth uh is this bubble going to be map marked by speculation like all the other ones or is there something are we able to build foundations this time that we can stand on to make sure that speculation turns into you know real products real use cases i think we're definitely seeing that with bitcoin bitcoin is no longer a tool that is only used to speculate some people actually do use it to save their cash rather than just number go up because the dollar is being distorted uh and so that's definitely a huge theme that i think we're going to talk to chris about um but he also is very much a uh into the world of the technology behind bitcoin and he he his line is that i am not a um blockchain not bitcoin person but i think he does see a lot of value in blockchain technology quote unquote as well as all these other technologies you know social tokens um social tokens d5 you know the whole gamete right and he thinks that blockchain and software can really extend into the whole rest of the world and i have that belief as well i think that you know if you can do something in the in the legacy world you can do it something better using crypto using cryptoeconomics using the blockchain i think that conversation is going to be really valuable yeah very cool all right before we get into the main event the main topic with dan i've got to ask you the question we always stop david this is the first time i'm asking you this in the year 2021 what is the state of the nation right now david the state of the nation this week is validated we are validated as a nation obviously when crypto prices go up when the market goes up when the market agrees with you you feel validation about your investments and it's very nice to feel that right like imagine if we had like the bankless podcast and we were just like talking about all these things going on like unisoi balancer you know defy staking yet all of the assets stayed the same price for years on end that would be unvalidating uh that would be very bad but instead the opposite is happening like assets are going up in price people are getting into the ecosystem people are starting to uh see the value in d5 i see the value in bitcoin see the value and staking and really just inc start to incorporate that into their mental models we see both both negative but also positive regulation come out that helps protect this industry we saw that with the occ comptroller news yesterday um and then and then also i think what else is being validated is i i know you believe this as well ryan and i definitely believe this is that the design space for options for just building anything on ethereum just the optionality of building stuff is being explored aggressively and that's what we're seeing with algorithmic stable coins which is the conversation of that we're going to have today but the point is like if you can build something on ethereum is going to be built and we are seeing the constraints around uh building stuff being removed and we are seeing things being built more and more and more and that feels very validating to me i've always been a believer of the exponential growth of things being built on ethereum i think that new layer of exponential growth is in the world of uncollateralized stable coins and that just the fact that these are working or so far you know so far working uh is is validating i believe that to be true and i'm really excited to get into this conversation with dan shortly here yeah i totally agree man and i totally resonate with that word validated i would even say you know use the word like vindicated to subscribe it i felt like there are really three three components of a thesis that we've been talking about for the last two years one is of course bitcoin and that got validated in 2019 and in 2020 the the second is defy and that totally found product market fit in late 2019 and early 20 you had breakout successes like uniswap and of course you know d5 summer and the the birth of these d5 capital assets so you know check mark there another thesis uh validated but the third piece has always been this well eth will accrue value as a um a native d5 reserve as part of the ethereum economy and historic value in the same way bitcoin is and it's finally we're finally starting to see that happen david it's like ethan has woken up so um validated on all three of those points that's how i'm feeling right now too that's a good that's a good word for the state of the nation all right david we should get right into it so want to welcome dan elliser who has been on the show uh a few times before in fact he was our first guest before defy summer he is now starting a fund of his own called nascent that will come about soon and heather knew a bit about what's going on with uncollateralized stable coins we'll define that in a minute dan good to have you on state of the nation how are you doing sir i i'm doing well thanks for having me guys uh i'm not on video yet so i don't know if uh bring me on yeah we're just looking at uh dan's profile shot right now and uh we're about to uh live stream there we go there it is how's it going dan good to see you man good to see you guys too all right yeah so it's this is uh this is a fun topic thanks for having me on it's always always a pleasure to chat with you guys and really explore what i think it's a very exciting the last time we had yuan was right before this whole event that we called d5 summer so i'm wondering what's going to happen this time if we have dan on is there going to be some kind of explosion in uh uncollateralized points right after this conversation i'm not sure what to expect i don't i don't think we're front running the explosion i think the explosion already has happened is happening um so you know there's that very cool well you you have to do uh help us catch up then a little bit and um but before we begin i'd love to actually hear because you recently made a transition to nascent which is as i understand kind of your own fund or something that you've co-founded can you tell us a bit about that yeah yeah so i you know i spent five years at ideo and i helped start up ideo cola ventures there did a lot of early stage investing in d5 and crypto more generally and then a few months ago um kind of beginning of september left ideo and started this new fund nascent with my partner josh felker we we're focused largely on d5 but really we think of this more broadly as an open financial system and we do both early-stage venture but we also are able to be more participatory we have the advantage of utilizing proprietary capital and so we don't have to spend time raising funds or managing lps we're able just to focus all of our energy all of our time in understanding the ecosystem in supporting our portfolio companies and really understanding how things play together because we don't want to just be investors i think a lot of funds are structured where they're either doing a lot of trading or they're really doing early stage venture and that's about it and so there are a few funds that i think are doing a fantastic job a framework peripheral a few others who really do both and so we're we're really trying to be in mold where we use all these d5 calls i i was a personal user and really that's upped my understanding of the ecosystem a lot but we're now looking at this six seven figure positions and movements and so that really gives me a different lens through which i'm evaluating all these protocols and thinking about where are the gaps in the ecosystem what's useful slightly better in these situations and i really think it lets us bring another layer of helpfulness to the companies and protocols that we work with super cool we've been preaching uh masters as users from the very beginning so really cool to start a capital pool around that dan that's very exciting dan it's very appropriate that your fund is called nascent because that's exactly what how i would describe these algorithmic uncollateralized stable coins it seems to be a very emergent field that is very very recent just in the last you know maybe couple quarters or so and it's very experimental as well and so i think it's perfect for for somebody like you that tends to see things before they come because they are deep in the weeds and then also are willing to get their hands dirty and get into the protocol be active participants so let's talk about uh the the the ethos and theory behind an uncollateralized stable coin and ryan if you want to bring up the stablecoin trilemma document just so we can get our listeners grounded there's this famous uh stablecoin trilemma where there's three different designs of stablecoins we have fiat collateralized like tether or usdc and that to spin up a fiat collateralized stablecoin is just trivially easy right you just put fiat into a bank account you issue a token on a blockchain and then you claim that if the token the token is redeemable for the fiat and that's that's pretty trivial and that's the fastest the fastest stable coins that have gotten out the door right that's the the biggest market cap then we have crypto collateralize which is a little bit harder but still more or less the same principles right where instead of having a fiat and a bank we have crypto in a smart contract there's a little bit more technicality there we need to over collateralize these things because of the volatility of these assets um and there's there's oracles and there's a little bit more complication but generally a very solvable problem that i think has been solved you know we saw dye come around in december of 2017. dies like three years old now it's been pretty decently battle tested um and the benefit of dye is that it unlike a fiat collateralized uh stable coin it's it's nation state regulation resistant right like it kind of exists independently of of the the physical landscape of the world it just exists on ethereum it doesn't have any real world dependencies more or less but then there's non-collateralized stable coins which um don't have any collateral behind them as the name would suggest and are very very new and um you know almost they we almost had basis back in 2018 as with the project that really pioneered this but basis didn't work out too well um maybe dan you can uh maybe illustrate for the listeners why are under collateralized or non-collateralized stable coins so difficult to spin up because would you would you say that these are the most difficult of the three of the three categories these might be the most easy to spin up and the hardest to make work so uh you know this that that um diagram you showed uh i i think right it goes to hasee qureshi from dragonfly he wrote that piece that really really influenced my thinking on stable coins and on the design space here i think that was from 2017 or 2018 and uh you know dye has been this kind of decentralized beacon that we've all been able to rally around the space and very fixed and i think we we often those of us who really focus on decentralization and transparency and openness have not loved the fact that tether has been such a massive force in this ecosystem and so i do think things like usdc step in the right direction but this on or under collateralized you know point on the triangle has been underexplored and i think there have been a lot of very valid critiques of basis back in the day of you know there were some really good kind of uh pre-emptive takedown posts talking about problems with this model and my my sense of time was like yeah i was i was very much also kind of bitcoin maximalist land at that time and like you know none of this stuff is gonna work uh but but my impression now of the space is that there's a very good chance that that that is just very hard um and that getting to these under under collateralized really coins is is nearly impossible maybe it is impossible uh one of the things though that i think is not quite right is when we look at the initial proposal around basis that never launched but there's over a hundred million dollars in capital uh to support this and the vast vast majority of that ended up getting returned to investors and they didn't spend it so you know credit to them unlike a lot of teams that raised a lot in the 2017 time frame they actually said nope we're not going to do this we're going to shut it down and give all the money back to investors so kudos to them for making that decision but the plan was never to use that to buy big houses and lambos uh the or or to hire a massive team it was to literally this kind of backstop fund so it was not necessarily collateralized per se but it was to provide this uh deterrent from trying to break the peg in these ways because they're saying there's this massive 100 million dollar fund that is sitting here ready to be deployed to support the peg should that be necessary and i think that that's where we're seeing some of these things move with empty set dollar planning to move that direction with v2 uh you know frax has uh another kind of partially collateralized thing honestly yam which i was involved with um originally was something that kind of came from the same idea where it took the um the kind of rebasing mechanism that we're seeing from ample forth and said well what if we start putting some capital behind it to dampen the the downsides uh so so there's a lot of design space here and we'll go for all these different things but what what is really exciting here is the ability to create uh potentially right something that can be long term stable and decentralized and be much more capital efficient than something like dye yeah yeah yeah so so can we talk about that dan said so that is let's zone in on like why non-collapse right it's part of that that dilemma so we have fiat collateralized we've talked about that lots on bank lists right it's not bankless basically it's sort of a product of the existing banking infrastructure and then we have this thing called die right and that's grown to its credit over a billion dollars lots of collateral in there um and but but the problem with it some of the critics will say it's not very capital efficient right it's very difficult to kind of grow the supply of dye versus something like fiat collateralized so is could you zone in for us on what the the value of a non-collateralized uh stable coin would be is it those two things it's both bankless decentralized and also highly yeah and so one of the one of which is with maker and and again i'm a huge fan of dye but one of the challenges with it is that we've seen there's this massive demand for usd pegged stable coins and die can only grow to the extent that there are uh folks who have capital that they want to take leverage on and and so that inherently means that you can't grow the supply of dye faster than there is demand to borrow against other assets that are supported through that capital pool and so uh that just inherently caps it and so by having something where it need to be uh fully or in the case of dive really over collateralized that allows the supply of the stable coin to match the demand for stable coins um and i don't think that that's really a it's not a huge problem that things like ust and usdc are kind of 100 percent well usdt who knows but like in theory 100 collateralized with dollars in a bank account the problem is that they're in a bank account rather than on chain and as soon as you go on chain you can't really have it just like perfectly a percent collateralized you need some other mechanisms to bring stability because if that peg and that collateralization is fully important then you just you're not giving yourself any and so you need some kind of algorithmic system to help provide stability and supplement the collaboration for the collateralization to potentially supplement that kind of algorithmic factor so they kind of work in tandem um we need algorithmic forces not just reliance on the ability to seize and liquidate collateral well why leave it at percent why not lean a little bit more heavily on those algorithmic components and say that the collateral is almost sec is secondary to that i think what people struggle with and this is also foundational is um the question of what actually backs a you know uncollateralized stable coin right so it's very clear with tether we know what we think we know what backs tether some dollars in a bank account i hope fingers crossed right we know what backs die you can see that on chain right yep completely open we can see all of its collateral any one time but what in the world backs the value of a stable coin that has no collateral backing it yeah i think uh well what backs the u.s dollar right it's it's faith ultimately it's it's faith and so the the goal here is with these stable coins for them to work is people need to believe in the mechanisms and they need to be given very good reason to believe in the mechanisms that it will stay very close to one dollar and there there's a lot of reasons to believe it won't right and we've got a lot of evidence for these things diverging pretty significantly from a dollar almost the up and down side and so that's not great right but what i will say is uh a few of these things have actually stayed a lot closer to that shelling point around one dollar than uh i would have expected a couple years ago and so that to me is is a great starting place but it needs to get better and if it can't get better these things are not going to work okay so i think there's a lot of design space to think about how how to make that work and one of the things that um you know i when i first ample uh you know i read it was called something else originally and they had a white paper for it a couple years ago i thought this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen um and it launched i thought this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen and then people started piling into using it i was like whoa okay so clearly there are very powerful you know these reflexive mechanisms that are going to drive up the market cap the problem is it can also go down but okay well then this powerful magazine for driving up the market cap actually expanding this again to supply up there that's really useful for bootstrapping so could you modify the mechanisms once you get above a certain point to dampen the reflexivity on both the upside and inside and that question was what originally led to the idea of yam was okay if on the way up you're building up a collateral base that effectively pulls a floor up with you then you know maybe that's a way that you can dampen it and now that didn't that didn't play out so um we there there were some some problems began with some bugs um and we saw you know what can happen or it doesn't work and then the community there yam is actually i'm very excited about what's been happening vm since i think brock and trent and the rest team over there have done an incredible job but the decentralized community around it decided this is not a stable coin and they actually just recently removed the rebasing that was inspired by ample entirely uh and and now it's really this kind of community dow saying we've got this treasury how we manage it how we build more things very cool but very different but the idea this the original seat of the idea there was thinking along these lines how do we take these powerful financial incentives to strap a system but also have them in a way where they can be modified in a way so up to some love then make it harder for it to drop down they can grow at a more reasonable sustained pace uh to serve the needs that people have that they come looking to do a stable coin for so dan i want to talk about the continue the conversation about the design space for under collateralized stable coins because there seems to be a lot of overlap and you've touched on it just a little bit now to say that they are uncollateralized i think is not completely accurate the collateral is just in a different place right with a with a collateralized stablecoin the cash is in a bank with a with a cryptocollateralized stablecoin the collateral is in a smart contract and with an uncollateralized stablecoin the collateral is as you alluded to is the faith that when there is time when when the time comes for there to be buying pressure there will be buying pressure and i guess that it's collateralization via faith a little bit because uh i i think there's the mechanism there is is faith i think calling a collateral uh is a bit of a stretch in terms of what people realistically think of as collateral um these things absolutely to be very clear they can 100 death spiral and go to well nothing in crypto ever goes to zero zero right people will trade you know penny stocks till the end of time it's right like but it could effectively go to zero for any of these things and so i think that's a very important thing to look at is right now is these things are are highly speculative um i think there's a lot of interesting design space to be explored around making them a little bit less speculative one of the things though that i i think we shouldn't lose sight of is speculation isn't necessarily bad i think people need to know what they're getting into but i think that it can be a very powerful mechanism to get things up to a level where they can be broadly useful okay so so let's let's talk about um let's define the why uh stable uncollateralized stable coins are so dangerous and i think that will kind of ground us behind like where the buying pressure comes in at to me the the reason why uncollateralized stable coins can get really really dangerous is because they can get out in front of their skis right and this goes back to the issue of uh who can who can mint new stable coins right with the collateralized method it's the protocol if it's maker dow or if it's the bank if it's circle but with an uncollateralized stablecoin the protocol can also issue freely as anyone can just like the federal reserve can freely mint new coins that's not where the restriction comes the problem is the protocol cannot revoke supply and that's where there needs to become some some strategies and so there's different strategies for how each different algorithmic stable coin revokes or takes away supply away from the market if there is uh a a price that is under one dollar so maybe you can kind of go into the different strategies the tools that these uh under collateralized coins have available to them to incentivize the removal of supply of these uncollateralized stable coins when the time comes that these things are below a dollar yeah okay so in in all the cases of these these different kind of algorithmic and under collateralized coins there's the same mechanism is above a dollar print more and that creates selling pressure push it down easy not hard the problem is like you said on the downside how do you get it back up so the original uh kind of senior share model that basis was was planning to do and never launched um there is the you know the the usd pegged stable coin and then there's a share um like base shares or whatever and then uh the holders of those base shares will receive the inflation right so they hold essentially shares in the system they get new dollars printed to them and then they can sell those to bring the peg back down but that's why you hold the share when it's below the peg the idea would be that you would have these bonds and people could burn their uh kind of cash tokens for bonds that when the price returns above a dollar they can then redeem those and get the full dollar so that's that's the the basic mechanism there um with empty set dollar uh or so before we get them to start there there was one though that kind of came next let's let's kind of go almost in chronological order as we're seeing the evolution here so uh the idea behind ample fourth right was everybody gets it right if you hold ample and we need more apple to bring the price down everybody gets more ample and then how do you then get the price back up well below a dollar everybody loses ample and so that's you don't opt into that it just happens across the board and while i'm very impressed by the kind of insight and psychology around the creation of this what's called rebasing mechanism there i think psychologically it's really hard and technically it becomes impossible like i i don't think apple is ultimately going to work as a stable coin even if the mechanisms around this the kind of the economics of it did work on a technical level it doesn't um behave like a standard erc20 token right the fact that the balance can changing uh without the user doing anything it just breaks everything and so they've had to create their own whole like kind of elastic finance they're calling an ecosystem around it and when you break defy composability in that way it it creates all sorts of problems and i think it just makes it really hard even if you somehow achieve more or less stability it's gonna be really hard to take advantage of that composability that is such a strength in this ecosystem so getting to your point there dan right so like you say ample fourth the risk is borne by all ample holders all animal holders have it um you know they all contract to kind of get the price back up to a dollar and that has led to a lot of big swings but these new designs these different designs they have kind of different classes of risk taking yeah so so that's the initial senior and share model with basis that was the different classes right you have the stable coin holders then you have the kind of shareholders and that has been then ported forward now with with basis cash has more or less implemented that that same design and that is nice right you avoid the need to do anything if you want to hold just that that kind of stable coin piece it may not be stable but at least the amount of uh individual tokens you hold doesn't change unless you opt into buying a bond um now what empty said dollar did that i think is very interesting and you know full disclosure we have a meaningful position in nascent in empties that dollar but one of the the insights there was saying what if we just package these together in a in a single token so that the way that you receive inflation is actually depositing your esd your empty set dollar into the dow and staking it and by staking it you can earn a share of the of the inflation or by providing liquidity into the esd usdc liquidity pool that's another way that you can earn part of the inflation and uh there there's some of the criticism for that is that well how are you ever going to have something stable that's inherently speculative in nature and the flip side what got me excited about this saying wow let's recognize the fact that early on people really just want to speculate with this and so to be useful as a stable coin you need to be integrated across the ecosystem you need to have beyond different lending protocols you'd be in different amms and so if you want to have the liquidity have the integrations let's have it be on this coin which oh by the way over time if the mechanisms work should become less speculative more stable and then you've already got these integrations across the ecosystem i think the challenge with things like basis cash is people are really just interested in kind of the number go up piece and nobody's really wanting to use the the stable coin piece as a stable coin and integrate that it's really just there they're kind of leaning into the farming aspect and i think that's hard and one of the things that uh you know pointed out there are a lot of games to be played a lot of money games to be played around this around all of these different designs and a lot of teams are leaning into that and what i got excited about mtc dollar for was the ethos where um unlike the other communities that i've been a part of this one really is focused on let's tamp down the growth let's let's grow at a slower more reasoned pace right the the first fork that i saw the empty set dollar was you know dynamics that dollar that just was a straight fork off they tweaked a few variables but it was really just a fork um and i love the expectation you know good on them but like man they like took all the breaks off and kind of went full the gen and kind of like lean into going like super dj okay great you can do that but i i think there's a really important element here around community around ethos and belief that this is something where yeah you can absolutely step on the gas we're playing with very very very powerful tools here but if you want this to be long-term sustainable and successful you need to move slowly and intentionally and there's there's certain things you can't control you know apes are going to ape and you can't stop that but what you can do is you can try to put dampening things into place to make sure that to the extent possible growth is more or less in stride with interest and adoption of the of the protocol so at the beginning of this conversation you talked about how like um you were you are more accepting of speculation and aping right like that's as you think that's an important part of projects right and i totally agree like if there was no speculation around bitcoin we wouldn't have bitcoin right and something like bitcoin speculation is inherently good like there's almost no such thing as bad expectation on bitcoin and that's where algorithmic uncollateralized stable coins are very different from the other protocols that we've seen where rampant un uncontrollable speculation will actually end the protocol right because as you were as you were alluding to if you only have a gas pedal and you don't have a brake pedal you know that's great for bitcoin number go up if you don't have a brake pedal on an uncollateralized stable coin and you only have a gas pedal you will crash because at some point the whole the whole design ethos around this thing is that there will be a devaluation of the asset below the peg and that's when you need the brakes and if you don't have the brakes at that point you're in trouble and so i do think that you know another project that i think is is worth there's a couple other projects worth mentioning here uh so one is fracs um and they've started off as when it was you know essentially fully collateralized to partial collateralization over time i think that that makes a lot of sense as something to to play around with as a design space to explore um i i think there are some elements of how it's being created and how it's being used that make me a little less comfortable but i think overall the idea of starting more collateralized and moving telescolado is a very reasonable place to start um i think you know often they positioned as like they were the first and everything yeah they got into market but have a lot of people have been kicking around these ideas as i mentioned you know with the games initially thinking along similar paths um another one that i think we're talking about is rye uh then from reflexer which uh they've got a an early version i think launched and people can play with it and it's not pegged to the dollar right it's it's entirely uh kind of self-referential with the stability mechanism that they're using i don't want to get into it too much because it's very complex to be honest i'm not going to do the best representation of it but the idea of having something that is entirely algorithmically governed uh and done so no mises human involvement around governance uh and just tries to essentially dampen volatility significantly i think is super interesting and i've seen a number of these projects esd included that have talked about at some point potentially transitioning away from pegging to the dollar and doing something that is more crypto native because i think as anybody who's spent time in this space grant you know the dollar itself may be our reference point today but you know i think we're all all kind of like looking out for at what point are we no longer going to consider the dollar itself to be stable and we're going to want a clean way to transition to something else that is really inherently more crypto native and so i think we're going to see more projects i would expect taking a similar approach where they're thinking about how do we get something that is volatility dampened and may peg to something other than the dollar over time dan there's so much there that we want to unpack i also want to ask about where oracle's come into this and also your opinions as to whether this is like a winner take all market or win or take mo most market we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these sponsors and then we're going to get into some of the deeper conversations behind uncollateralized stablecoin so stay tuned and we'll be right back synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith d5 visa card monolith is a one-two punch of both an ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your ethereum wallet everywhere where visa is accepted when you swipe your monolith visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet it's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life monolith also offers on-ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defy so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to and your deposited money goes straight into your non-custodial wallet so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of d5 behind it swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in d5 is at your fingertips go to monolith.xyz and sign up to get your monolith visa card today all right guys we are back with dan elliser and stay the nation we are talking about uncollateralized stable coins dan where we kind of left off we were talking about some of the projects here i want to get into empty set dollar in a minute but something that that um keeps going on the back of my mind to sort of set context for everyone you mentioned the term money games that we're playing with these things uh and dave and i have talked about bank lists like playing is very much a money game ether is very much a money game any uncaused monetary asset is a money game i would even use the term ponzi game for these things right it's it's kind of like a pyramid scheme where there's benefit to being first uh and you receive the the upside of that like putting on your bitcoin maximalist hat for a minute right you said you used to wear one uh put that on for a second so a bitcoiner or maybe a a really strong ethereum might say damn what you're trying to do is impossible you're gonna invent all of these like ponzi games without any um upside or benefit to the world some early people get rich right but like the only way to get uncollateralization and some level of stability some level of stability is to become highly liquid a reserve global asset that's what i think some bitcoiners might say what um what's your response to that did you used to think that and now your mind has changed i think that uh there there certainly are elements here where uh you know that you can see that right where we're real early people do very well if this works i think that's good incentive for getting it going the idea is that this can't be a ponzi scheme right and i think one of the great things about what ethereum has done is because it'll transparence all in chain nobody um essentially steal funds from others everyone exactly what's happening people can choose to play the game or choose not to up to that old gear if these things are going to work to a place where you go down obviously can't go up at an insane pace forever um and so i think the important thing is as these things if any of them are successful to approach close to maturity the locus of the game being played has to move from being growth to about petability and so even things one of the reasons why uh tether and ustc are able to keep such a tight peg is because it's really easy to arb that back to the dollar right if if you know tether is trading at 101 somebody who's got you know the ability to just go wide funds in and just arb that difference down immediately and that's the thing that the that's one of the problems with dye why die has had trouble being as tight of a peg is there's not this like instant arb ability uh for professionals to come in and arbit back to a dollar and so for any of these algorithmic under collateralized uncollateralized stable coins work long term the loss of the game needs to move from how do we get it a little bit above the dollar so that like we all print more money for ourselves and it has to be okay how do we get the incentive to of push it down once below push it up but keep it very tightly around the dollar and uh a big piece of that for something like empty color is around faith that it will that people see it go through these cycles and see the cycles get less volatile and shorter and that there's more faiths people are willing to help push it back up rather than saying we need to get like a 50 discount or whatever in order to take on the risk that it might never come back up maybe we're comfortable with a 20 discount a 10 percent does kind of five percent discount a one percent discount you need to get that range that people are willing to play around tighter and tighter over time and how do you do that is it the algorithm the precision of the algorithm itself or is it the mechanics of the protocol or is it the liquidity and like underlying faith of the backers what how does that happen in my view it's multiple things one is there needs to be the mechanisms need to be really strong and i i will say very very clearly i don't think empty dollar has a hundred percent the right mechanisms today there are certainly challenges with the kind of coupon bond like system uh around this where they are highly risky i don't think price well i don't think the redemption process works pretty good it looked well enough it's gotten it back to the peg three or four times already um but everybody who's active in the community looks this says we need to do some fix this year and scott lewis and will price and some others are working on a proposal uh for a a kind of an overhaul of that coupon system and it is more like a bond some with a zero bond i think that's a very worthy thing to research and it may end up being something bst will transition to if the community wants to do that but there's also been fixes to the coupon system to improve it um each cycle is getting better and better and that's a piece the other piece is just the fake piece right longer than it rounds the more times that it goes below and the returns or goes above and then returns the more faith people have that it will do so in the future it's you know the lindy effect around this right the more times that we see the longer it survives the more times it does the thing that everyone says it's supposed to do the more people believe it will continue to in the future but it's that combination of faith and actual like technical economic mechanisms together that will hopefully enable it to stable over time so the there's an article i wrote a while ago in the in the bankless newsletter that talked about um ethereum as a protocol is designed to work in the most adversarial conditions ever right the protocol is designed to work like full stop and the more that people have faith in that protocol working the more monetary premium accrues to ether that's that's the claim that i made and i think that is all very similarly true for uncollateralized stable coins where you can make the system work and once the system proves that it is working then you get this premium of of this this benefit of the fact that people know that it works then you get this benefit of extra liquidity because of the faith that people believe that it will work then people are more willing to buy sooner when the when the value of the token drops just a little bit below a dollar because people know that you know it's going from 98 cents back to a dollar people are willing to take just two percent of that arb rather than like they see it at 85 cents it takes a lot more faith to buy something at 85 cents to get it all the way up back up to a dollar than it does to 98 cents but the only way that you get that benefit of a premium is if you prove out over time that the protocol is going to operate under the worst possible conditions is that is that about about right i think that's that's a very fair statement right um it's it's the same reason that we're kind of seeing similar things play out with like bitcoin and ethereum today we're like it's even though the price has gone up you know you know hundreds of percent in the last year it's in some ways less risky for for people to buy it now because it's it has all this kind of existence proof and more people are piled in and it's it's easier to buy at a higher price which is ridiculous right because rewarded so much more for buying a lower price but there is this risk reward trade-off and and it is a factor in these stable coins as well so dan um what let's maybe look at uh your example of of empty set or esd of not from perspective and look at performance so i've got coin gecko here just showing me a chart of um the price of empty set dollar token called esd right which is this on uh collateral bitcoin one of them we've been talking about and this is over the last 90 days and over the last 90 days we could see some fluctuations at the start of it starts at about a dollar and one cent and then that's at the beginning of october and then sometime in late october it stays steady uh we get a spike and all of a sudden it's 2.29 and now in um later in october we get a spike down and it's 50 cents uh and then we get some flat line you can see this chart anyway there's some ups and downs it seems like there's a range of it it it tends to gravitate around a dollar but it ranges up over two dollars and sometimes down to 50 cents so it's fluctuating around stability what can you say about this chart is this the protocol is at work how how is this uh stable doing so far yeah i think it's it's doing all right you know i'd say anything that went from literally zero six like didn't exist six months ago uh to something that is you know now at you know what 400 mil market cap or so um right that that's it's it's grown a lot um but that it's done on the basis of somewhat range bound right and i would say the goal here is to get it into the the dial like range or better um you know if you can stay within you know five percent or so the peg is where you ultimately want to be hopefully even tighter to like one percent but right now early so so speculative i think that this is reasonable performance and some of the mechanisms are being tweaked to hopefully allow it to not uh skew as much on the upside right one of the elements of the v2 proposal is to have a price whether it's a dollar and three cents a dollar or ten cents something like that where anybody can always mint as much as they want at that price to effectively create a ceiling on the price and the idea is that the the usdc or ether whatever would be spent to mint would then be in a reserve where if the price falls below uh you know a certain threshold 97 cents 90 cents whatever it is that that reserve would then be used to buy back the esd and potentially burn up and hold it who knows but that you can actually create this uh kind of secondary stability mechanism and create these these boundary conditions around it that can tighten over time and so i think that is a very promising direction i'm i'm very encouraging and and uh encouraged by the discussions around that mechanism and effort to start moving towards implementing it so i'm putting my my in the shoes let's say i'm an esd hole wanting to use this for utility purposes as a stable coin right that's ultimately what we want to use stable coins for it right so i'm looking at the chart this chart and i see okay i've got you know hundred dollars worth of esd um you know and and i hold that and you know next week maybe that that good dollars but i know if i wait seven to 15 days or so it's gonna restore back to a hundred dollars maybe the following week it goes down to fifty dollars uh or if i wait a little bit longer it's gonna ratchet back to a hundred is that kind of the user experience or am i misunderstanding this no so so one of the things that you're missing is this is not like ample where it goes up and then it contracts down and like the full amount right so the idea is that on the upside right was going up and was above the peg um people who had staked their esd in the dow or were providing liquidity in the in the unispot pool they were receiving more esd and so they had more units of esd now when it drops below the peg let's say that you know you had a 100 est and the market cap you now you know are gonna have a roughly double the amount until 200 esd um now if the peg goes down to you know dropped to low down to 50 cents yeah then you've got 100 but assuming it's above 50 cents you're still you have more dollar value and more coins than you initially had um and so one of the things that i think is really important psychologically for maintaining the peg here is it doesn't have in my view the same crazy downward reflexivity as something like ample fourth because so forth when it's below the peg you've got the double pane of both watching the value of your holdings go down and also the number of units is contracting too and so that's just like creates this gut-wrenching thing we saw it with with yam before the rebase was removed i think you know anybody's held ample has like been through that and seen that as well um and and so i think that this just psychologically uh does a lot better right from if you're looking at this from an investment standpoint really market cap is is the thing that matters much much much more so than price but uh when you want this to actually be a stablecoin and when people are looking at holding it uh the fact that it doesn't take supply away from you on the downside unless you opt in to buy potentially get more upside from getting that discount uh you know that that opt-in element for returning it back up to the peg i think is very important so you're saying dan that i've got if i hold the cnn's the utility stablecoin user i don't have downside right it can't drop below a dollar no no no no to be very clear no yes you absolutely do have downside the price can certainly drop below a dollar if you have 100 units or 200 units you will never have fewer units than than you did the price can still go down right right yeah well you can have more on the ups above it you could end up with more if you're staking them right but you'll never end up with you'll never yeah you'll never you'll never without taking action you will never end up with fewer units and so i think that is an important piece again there's no floor this could go to zero um but um or you know or it's like you know bitcoin if it goes it goes to like you know one cent i'd buy all 21 million bitcoins right like whatever um so same principle here it's never it's never gonna go it approaches but it can approach very very close to zero um so not saying there is a hard floor or something on this anyway what i'm saying is that uh when it goes up and more is printed uh those who receive that printing you know now have those have that inflation they have those additional units in their wallet um and if they lose interest lose faith and decide to sell they absolutely can drive the price down lower but if people want to hold it because they believe this is going to be useful it starts becoming more stable they start using it as a stable coin great that's the goal right the goal is to get this to be something that is widely used where you know my you know ideal future statements d um is that esd becomes boring people should be excited about it they should not be looking at charts about it any more so than like you know we get excited when like a bunch of usdc or ct is like on chains like oh wow that's clearly stable coin demand is up nobody really cares hopefully esd could at some point become like that where the majority of people using it just pays zero attention because it is staying so close to the peg and that there are professionals who are arbiting it in both directions um and maintaining that pay making money off it like great like there's i'm not against people making money i think that there should there always needs to be some kind of prop motive around this uh to maintain the peg but hopefully that profit motive shifts from i want to just hold a lot of this and see number up to uh i'm gonna make profit by actively participating in the peg restoration process so okay yeah go ahead run oh no you go ahead david i was to turn the conversation to oracle's but i think you want to uh talk about market cap first yeah yeah so i guess that's the perspective of of maybe someone who's holding esd but um what what does it look like from the perspective of someone who's taking the the speculative risk uh in the system itself right so this is a different chart different than price this is market cap of empty set dollars which it looks like this is um you know um basically total price multiplied by the supply right yeah and then what i'll say is again this is not a a uh uh beginner 101 uh vegan to play i think that's one of the reasons why um basis cash has seen a lot more forks is it's like a lot more in that whole yield farming vein and with like the the forked yam ui uh and people kind of understanding how to play this as the performing thing one of the things that throws off this chart is the fact that uh some of the units get removed from circulation they get burned for coupons and so uh that also then reduces the market cap further so it's not it's not exact it gets you know ballpark right direction but as you can see here right it peaked around 600 mil uh market cap and it's currently around 400 mil um and so yeah that is a pretty significant decline and uh and it could drop a lot more it could go up a lot more you know it's it's anyone's guess on this i think that you know to the extent that people do want to speculate this is not one that people are going to try to make it easy for you to ape into this like do your homework do your research understand it um and uh then make an educated decision on whether to participate or not to participate um i i think that's that's what i try to try to emphasize to people so for those of you at home this is an advanced money game don't just like yolo into this don't eep into it that's what we're saying none of this is financial advice but i i want to be clear on what like basically the speculators how well they've done with this so this looks like 90 days ago this is just done 100x in terms of price appreciation so we had 4 million market cap around that 90 days ago and now we're up to 400 ish cap is that right yeah that's that's right um and so there's yeah that's that's been uh there's no reason this couldn't fall back to five million it's right breaks right absolutely you could fall below five million who knows right but um i think that's that's one of the things that's been appealing has been the fact that it has has grown very quickly um you know it was sitting up high on the coin gecko like yield farming yield list and so um you know that that brought a lot of more attention into it and people kind of joining joining in but honestly my my preference is that this thing i'm talking about you guys because i want people to understand these things understand the differences but my preference is that this grow at the rate that it's grown um and that none of these things grow at astronomical rates i think hopefully they will grow a little more in line with the interest right i think you know up into the range of um kind of like a mid-tier market cap coin here and so i think that that's that's kind of you know an okay place to be um i do want to see it grow obviously over time but you know if this you know next week or double the market cap that would make me very uncomfortable um because i think it's very unlikely that there is double the traction double the the real interest in this a week from now um i think you know going going this project is worth zero or with five million dollars this is you know worth 500 million in some ways that to me more reasonable it's like i think there's a lot of potential behind the idea but going from like you know 500 million to a billion or five billion whatever like that would scare them right relating everything yeah i don't want to see it grow overnight in that way they talk about the you know the the investment like staircase up elevator down but this is elevator up and elevator down very well right right bottom basement yeah but i think hopefully but that's what we've seen though interestingly right is that we have not seen the the straight elevator down um and and we have seen a bit of an elevator up i don't like how much of an elevator up i wish i wish it were um a a staircase moving more towards like kind of like a conveyor belt type situation where it like just becomes a lot smoother and more more muted in both directions um and we'll see if if the community can navigate it in such a way that that is what happens maybe to finish off this conversation as to why the dynamics are like that when ryan showed the market cap it showed something like 5 million to 600 million down to 400 million unlike other crypto assets that are like bitcoin or ether or whatever uh you there was no one that actually just purchased an asset and held it and then experienced that exposure right the only way that you had that upside from 5 million to 600 million down to 4 million is if you were taking actions every step of the way to bear the risk every single time uh empty set dollar dropped below one dollar and i don't actually think it's possible for someone to even actually have direct one-to-one exposure to the market cap of empty set dollar is that right ish um you know if you're if you're staked in the dow you're going to get your share of rewards outside but as we've seen for a lot of the early holders if they're not participating in the coupons and taking on that risk or participating in the lp and taking taking on like essentially putting up additional capital they're getting diluted out right so like the the empty set squad the kind of him founding advance the first epic and receive the first 100 est as a reward um their ownership percentage has has dropped significantly over time because they've just been holding a stablecoin because they've just been staking it right so like that they had tremendous growth right i think you know i think they're my understanding is somewhere around like 10 or so of the supply but like that's that's come down from like upwards of 20 or initially 100 but uh that comes down because all they're doing has been just taking it and so i think that is very healthy that you know people who are just long-term holders get some growth but they're diluted out if they're not taking on additional risk taking additional action i think that's very healthy and that's not something that you necessarily see through the basis hash like model right where if you have a fixed supply of those share tokens and you have the same ownership you're always going to have that same ownership and so i think that that that to me doesn't feel like the the system that we necessarily want for something like this i think the idea that gradually over time you know we improve the decentralization of ownership and it becomes flatter ownership i think is one of the major uh positive factors for empty set dollar because if this does become kind of the the digital internet dollar then hopefully it is very widely dispersed dan would you say that the price of pre or the supply appreciation of uh that's a funny phrase supply appreciation of the of the of mg set dollar does that cut that that largely comes from people purchasing esd so that when the time comes for them to stake it or to buy bonds and burn it to get the bond that they have the tools to be able to do it because you can't get the senior edge you can't get the upside if you don't have esd so you have to purchase esd so that you can be prepared to burn it when it comes time to get the senior age and that actually increases the price of the token and therefore the supply of esd is that right well actually let me let me uh put some nuance on that so the the way that you can receive uh yeah the senior edge is to hold esd and to stake it or to lp with it uh so yes that that requires if you don't have any you need to buy some to be able to do that um the problem is people do that over the peg and it drives the price up and it's not good to have that reflexive upside so hopefully it gets sold back down very quickly um the the ideal thing from a systems perspective is that people buy in below the peg so to discount to a dollar which has the dual effect of giving them the ability to capture some senior age when it goes above a dollar but also pushes it closer and almost makes that more of a self-fulfilling prophecy and so that's the goal and then the the other piece is this coupon system where you can burn and there's currently i think it's like a about a 54 premium so if you uh you know burn uh like a dollar or one asd you get like one uh you get like was 2.1 coupons ish um right how much can be redeemed for hd in future but they will expire potentially in 30 days if you aren't able to redeem them right and so you're taking on risk but that's a way that you can get a lot more reward as and so the coupon incentives hopefully not that existing esd holders then just burn for the coupons and hope the price goes back up the idea is that there should be now kind of like if you burn your esd for coupons and do nothing else and the price is going back up you're just gonna lose all your iced tea that's you you go to zero like sucks to be sucks to be you so the idea is the incentive is then okay you can do that then if somebody else doesn't push the price back up you better step into the market and buy some more esd to get it back up to ensure that you can redeem those coupons and you don't get zeroed or as a new entrance you come in you buy yes tomorrow where it's currently trading below a dollar burn that to get like a premium premium from the cools and you know that that becomes uh kind of a reinforcement mechanism to drive the price back up so um these things play there's different kind of risk return profiles for taking different activities but again like i said this is not like a basic beginner thing i do not recommend people who are interested in this to play the coupon game unless they're very very aware of what the the trade-offs are associated with that um and there there is that reliance though on net new buying to push it back up to a dollar if there is not any net new buying and there is net selling it does not return to the peg needs to be net by return to the peg uh and so that's one of the reasons why i think it's very important that this not grow too quickly because if there is not interest enough buying pressure when it comes below it's just never going to get back up right so just everyone needs to be very aware of that think about the different dynamics as they participate in the system so the fantastic thing about uncollateralized stable coins is that there's no dependencies on other assets right like it doesn't die depends on ether and uscc and other things that back it uncollateralized stable coins don't have that vector but both vector but both die and both uncollateralized stable coins have oracles are there any differences between an uncollateralized stable coins oracle and an oracle that supports dye or are they largely the same the same set of problems uh so one of the things that i loved about the design for est is the way the oracle is done is it uses an eight hour time weighted average price pulled from the uniswap esd usdc pool wow and so that is a really hard work goal to manipulate and it works because you don't need instant oracle price for liquidation for something like maker now right like the fact that it's weighted over eight hours is fine we want to be robust to manipulation more than accurate in in an exact like block or an exact instant and but this is a risk in my view is that it is um reliant on usdc esd unit swap pool where the central foundation in theory could freeze all the usdc in that pool and therefore it's censored and so i think the likelihood of that is relatively low but certainly with some of the um you know actions we've seen from some government agencies recently like i think it is not a zero risk thing and so one of the things that has been discussed in the esd community is well could we take advantage of the unity dc keeps it very bad and actually incentivize an esd eath pool which would be incredibly censorship resistance and then combine the t off the esd eth pool with the usdc pool which is a very deep liquid pool and if the center foundation wanted to like the center formation is like not going to nuke the ufd in the ether usdc pool right if they do that like they're done they're done so right like ustc is done if they're gonna they're gonna do ustc unison pool and so that would give esd a level of protection where it's like you can't nuke our pool without nuking everything and how are you going to nuke the esd eath pool like you can't like that that is about as censorship resistant as it gets um so i think something like that but then you lose the advantage a you've got now trading from usdc and dsd you've got double the transaction fees um you also are incentivizing an lp pool that is not in theory a stable to stable pool there is more impermanent loss involved in llk for the esd eath pool so i don't know if that switch is going to happen but i think the fact that you can make this more resistance um when using ether as that really censorship resistance asset in the pair like it's so cool that is possible and that's what gives me real hope for these assets is not that we want to reference um you know something that is censorable like usdc but it's the fact you can actually find a way to reference it where it's useful but not be dependent on it in a way where you need it to be there for your system to function so just one observation oracle problem is actually a much smaller problem for empty set dollar or algorithmic stable coins than it is for uh crypto collateralized stable coins it sounds like that's a much easier problem to solve with much more solutions at hand yes if you're implemented in the right way right because you can use the am based oracles we've seen a lot of people using mm oracle's in dumb ways that'll blend to hacks but i i i think it's really hard to because like an eight-hour t-wop on something that has millions of dollars often ten millions of dollars in liquidity that that is something that's going to create oracle problems one observation um it's kind of been a recurring theme definitely in bankless since we've been exploring all of this is you know people ask the question of well why is this the first time we've seen empty set dollar like why didn't you two years ago or three years ago it's really interesting what you said there i mean a lot of this has only been possible with the money protocols that we have now right so first of all we had to have this thing called ethereum of course and then we had to have this thing this money layout called uniswap uniswap had to build up enough liquidity uh and v2 had to ship so we get this time weighted uh like average so we can have an oracle and now we see the birth of algorithmic stable coins like it's this this um like tech tree almost that had to be built uh for us absolutely into this place right it's like why didn't we have this three years ago it wouldn't it wasn't possible three years ago we didn't have the we didn't have the technology absolutely and so i think you know one of the the the hardest things i think about being in this space as a builder and as an investor is understanding timing and the dependencies um around all these things right there's so much stuff where um you know look back at stuff 2017 and like say that stuff was so ridiculous and yes most of it was but there are some things that failed in 2017 or you know on bitcoin failed in 2015 2013 whatever that it wasn't because the idea was bad it's because the timing was wrong the the necessary ecosystem components weren't there yet and we're not or we're not mature enough yet um it's it's the same way the internet right that you know the the big examples of like the dot-com boom found i was like pets.com and webvan and then a couple decades later we've got uh uh we've got you know chewy.com and instacart it's like the id the the concepts were not wrong it was just the timing was completely off the all the other things that needed to happen in the in the ecosystem in the world had not happened yet and so i'm super excited to look back at ideas and it's it's hard for me because i can be like okay i've saw that didn't work saw that didn't work right and constantly i remember okay well it didn't work then why and is that reason that didn't work still valid or had the ecosystem grown and changed in such a way that maybe it's valid now or maybe it can work now or maybe it'll work a year from now or two or three years from now i'm not sure and the timing right is really hard uh it is so energizing to work with teams that are willing to try these crazy things um and are are building without you know this this is the the new global financial infrastructure that we are privileged to be part of witnessing and helping to bring into reality and i i do think that there is something in this space and uh and maybe it's empty step dollar maybe it's it's one of these other things that exist maybe it's one of the things that have yet to watch and you know we're actively looking at um other things that are are doing different approaches in this because something here i believe is likely to work maybe it's not this cycle maybe it's in a future cycle but i think the promise is so great and the potential is there that i want to try these experiments because there there is massive massive benefit to the entire ecosystem if it can be done and done right dan well i can think of no better person to be at the helm of the ships during the the direction of uh algorithmic uncollateralized stable coins so thank you for for providing that service to to the ecosystem uh it's it's the start of 2021 and this seems to be a very promising year for the growth of uncollateralized stable coins maybe you could give us some of your predictions your goals your aspirations for the ecosystem around uncollateralized stable coins for this year yeah so i i'm hopeful that i think there was an earlier question around like is this a winner take all market like no the same way that like you know we collateralize centralized stable coins is not a winner take all market i think there can be multiple ones that gain significant market share um so i hope that we expect we will see um some of these at least briefly across the billion dollar uh kind of circulation or billion dollar market cap around some of these things um i i think potentially a lot higher uh i think we will see some absolutely implode and go to near zero uh what i do think we will start to see is we'll start to see more integrations where the it does become viable to use a flat curve like amm for some of these things because they show that they can stay close enough to a dollar over a long enough period of time that it makes sense to have that flattened amm curve uh i think that we'll start to see some of them cream esd got added to cream recently so so it can be borrowed and lent there wait to see stuff like that that's advancing um i'm i'm actually very interested to see how some of these things will start to work across different layer two solutions or potentially other chains too but i'm more interested in in the layer two solutions and uh i think there's a different challenge set with moving algo stable coins into layer two solutions versus something like usdc which you can start you know minting them directly in the l2 uh so i think we'll see some experiments around that uh you know i think we're gonna see uh more experimentation around games to uh essentially incentivize people to maintain the peg tightly less around growth and more around tight pegs and there's another project that that i've been working with called fey that is experimenting with this idea of protocol owned liquidity uh and actually having a lot of essentially lps directly by the protocol itself um vincent tightly around that dollar uh it's an approach that i haven't seen anyone else do something similar to that so i'm excited to see that get live i think for all of these things right there's this interesting dichotomy between what works in theory and what works in practice and i i've someone recently stated somewhere on twitter like it's the stuff that works in practice but not in theory that's the most interesting um but i think you know bitcoin is like that ethereum is like that and so there may be some things like that in this algorithmic stable coin space that could be really exciting uh outside of algos stablecoin that i'm really excited about like i said l2 adoption uh i'm i'm very bullish on um uh a big fan of the the op i'm an investor in optimism and think the optimistic roll-up approach is great i think some of the advances on zk roll ups have also been very impressive and excited to see some of those um getting more usage too and uh something that's really i think gonna come to the fore and is still below the radar for a lot of people is uh what used to be referred to as minor extracted value and now there's an attempt to trans translate it and call it uh maximum extractable value uh so it can be done by validators of all sorts not just you know proof of work minors and uh i think people are not generally aware of how much uh these games are being played right now in the mempool and how much value essentially being lost uh to users in the defy ecosystem versus you know essentially these arbitragers who are taking advantage of their superior technology in both mining and mental monitoring and so we're going to see that get more democratized this year people are going to recognize it as a problem it's going to be talked about i think you know in similar ways to impermanent loss is talked about where if you're active in the ecosystem you at least need to be aware of the risks and costs and dangers with it and more more teams will be trying to build protocols that are uh mev resistant at the very least so i'm excited to see that play out as a new trend and again i you know always keep coming back to it um that's kind of like super fluid collateral thesis just maximizing capital efficiency i think andre is doing some really uh i think sir has some really cool stuff that they're going to be doing in their v2 that moves in this direction ave has been doing some fantastic stuff including unicycle key shares as part of the kind of lending and borrowing system as well uh just more and more capital efficiency is i think gonna gonna allow this whole space to keep moving forward and the i think leverage is in some ways the skyward but really uh let the ecosystem grow a lot more but make it a lot more useful because you'll have much deeper liquidity trying to trade you know borrow lens do options do various derivatives uh all this collateral is going to kind of come together and come out of a handful of pools that are going to be super super efficient and we're it's taking a little bit longer than i thought but i think 2021 is going to be the year where everything is super fluid by default that and then also paired with a bunch of new money and new users coming into the ecosystem 2021 is set up to be a bang-up year for crypto probably our biggest ever dan thanks for coming on state of the nation and helping us learn more about uncollateralized stable coins i've already learned a ton so so thank you for your time and i appreciate you coming on and giving us your thoughts always pleasure guys thanks for having me all right guys risks and disclaimers of course i have to say this is risky so is crypto so is defy so are uncollateralized stable coins guys we're on the frontier but this is the frontier of the frontier so be careful with these money games are headed west it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on another episode of bankless the nation
