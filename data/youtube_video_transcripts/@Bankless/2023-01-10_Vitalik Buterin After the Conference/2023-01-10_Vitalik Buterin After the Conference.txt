what does vitalik do after the conference day is over and the sun goes down generally have been trying to have like fairly quiet dinners and go to sleep fairly early yeah I don't know I yeah I'm realizing like I'm definitely not a fan of the late night stuff possibly because I'm just like totally out of energy from talking to people that like I don't want to do any more of that yeah is it draining to be at a conference where everyone is hounding you absolutely yeah yeah how have you managed this have you learned to juggle this realistically just like try to be aware of when I have the energy for this stuff and like when I don't hide I don't know it's probably better to hide than to just go out anyway and have some risk of accidentally being mean to someone
