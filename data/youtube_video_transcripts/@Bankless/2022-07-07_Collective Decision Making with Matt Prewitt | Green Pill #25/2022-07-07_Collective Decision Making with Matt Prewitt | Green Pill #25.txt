hey hey coordination on today's episode of green pill we have matt pruitt from the radical exchange foundation matt's the president of the radical exchange foundation he's a research partner at amentum which is a crypto focused fund um and is thinking a lot about power concentration in the world matt has a background as a litigator and is now working in the radical exchange movement and on web 3 type mechanisms in order to leverage radical markets using markets in new places to create more pluralism in the world so um that's just this incredibly lucid thinker and we go really deep on some of the ideas in the radical markets movement and the radical exchange movement primarily quadratic voting which is a special place in my heart because get coin grants is built on on top of quadratic voting and then we also go deep on harbinger taxes so if you're into those mechanisms if you're into using markets in new places then this episode is for you coordination without further ado

pretty good thanks so great to have you uh can you tell us how you got involved in radical exchange and what radical exchanges sure um radical exchange is a non-profit uh that coordinates a global network of people who are interested in uh making the institutions of democracy and markets better and we've been sort of a um [Music] i would say a crypto adjacent sort of civil society organization uh since we started up in um i 2018. say a little bit more about radical exchange in a minute but you know uh how did i get here um uh i think unlike a lot of people who um found the way to radical exchange over the years crypto was actually like my path to it um so before i was doing what i'm doing now i was uh i was a antitrust litigator as a practicing lawyer for most of the 2010s and um [Music] uh i was basically doing like plaintiff side antitrust work and so the way i try to describe my career arc is i've been thinking about the problem of power concentration uh for a long time and i was initially thinking about it through the lens of the lens of law uh but i've also always been interested in technology uh grew up in the bay area and sort of have watched the you know um multiple waves of of um technology business stuff and um uh at some point i basically kind of got this illusion with my ability to like litigate away the kinds of problems that antitrust law is supposed to solve and started thinking about how to kind of get into the next wave of new technologies to use that to create more enduringly interestingly distributed power structures uh so that um you know and ethereum caught my eye in 2015 and uh i basically just got really really interested in you know um a lot of what you know you and and others have have been thinking about for for many years now which is how to use this technology to build distributed power structures um i sort of quickly realized um you know i expressed that interest basically by trying to build little things and you know trying to sort of instantiate different sorts of decision making systems and stuff uh with smart contracts and through that kind of exercise realized that in order to make this work in order to build the kind of distributed power structure that is like the exciting possibility here we were going to need a better understanding of mechanism design we were going to need to get the whole like uh get get the incentives right in great detail with great sophistication so i plunged down the whole of mechanism design the rabbit hole of mechanism design and found the work of glenn weil who's an economist who's been doing lots of interesting work on voting systems and much more as you know for for many years and um uh [Music] got in touch with glenn uh realized that we were interested in a lot of the same love the same things a lot of the same kind of um ideas for the direction of of technology and politics and started radical exchange foundation in the wake of the book radical markets coming out in 2018 to sort of uh rally some of the energy um that that that book had unleashed around you know people are interested in in in in [Music] sort of yeah like reforming political economy right so um that arc it sounds like you kind of went from litigating the kind of problems that you're interested in creating a dent in the universe for to creating markets for solving for those kind of problems is that a good summary or would you push back on that at all i would push back on that a bit i think that um i kind of view the um i like to think of both democratic systems and markets as instances of a larger category of thing which is basically like collective decision systems or you know uh just kind of like scaled systems through which people work together and deal with complexity um so i've actually i think that the dichotomy between um [Music] uh like democracy and markets is is a partly real and partly false they have there are meaningful distinctions that people are pointing to when they make that distinction but at the same time there are uh there's a there are ways in which both are trying to do the same thing uh so yeah i would complicate the right distinction okay great well you know i should note that um i feel a deep alignment between radical exchange and get coin uh git coin is built on top of git coin grants which is built on top of quadratic funding which is actually a fork uh derivative of an idea coming out of radical markets so i'd say that we're bringing some of the web 3 developers to the dance and y'all are bringing some of the mechanism designed to the dance and just feel a deep reverence for radical exchange and the movement uh because of that can you tell us about the movement i mean i guess i'd love to hear about the radical exchange movement but also the the primary mechanisms and themes that you all promote sure um so there are radical exchange chapters around the world which are uh groups of people who get together to to talk about um the sorts of ideas that we work on and the sort of subject matter of of of mechanism design and and democracy and plurality and pluralism and all the kind of stuff that we'll we'll get into a little bit more but um yeah there's a uh a really interesting sort of multi-disciplinary open um network of people around the world who are are into this and which we support facilitate through radical exchange foundation and this can mean you know like meet-up groups and discussions and professional networks you know or it can mean like uh bringing these ideas to local politics or bringing these ideas to the organizations that that we work in and when i say these ideas so like all right what is it what are we talking about um the uh so the book radical markets had um had a couple sort of banner um concepts in it which uh which we've really you know moved built upon and moved beyond in many ways but i think it's still kind of useful to understand these these two things to to get the dna of of radical exchange foundation and radical change in general and the first one is a voting system called quadratic voting and the second one is a um a plural property system or a partial common property system or basically a way of like better sharing property that that we has no there are there are many sort of variations on it which all have their own names but we we often call it uh salsa which means self-assessed license is sold at auction uh sometimes we call it um uh in the in the book radical markets it's called cost uh and uh um as you mentioned it's also called you know another label for this general family of ideas is uh harburg harbor taxation um and yeah as i was mentioning like so this is this is a way of essentially rethinking property like transcending private property moving beyond private property coming up with better ways of figuring out uh who um who within a community should have the kind of possessory interest to a piece of property and where the benefits of that property should should flow maybe they shouldn't in other words maybe they should those benefits can be more widely distributed than only going to like the quote-unquote owner so this is the kind of um thrust of of this way of thinking about property um and quadratic voting is a you know um a better way of making uh group decisions that i can i can talk more about but well i'll i'll pause there those are the sorts of um that gives a flavor for how our work um uh is addressing both sides of this democracy markets um constellation right totally yeah i i i think that what's so interesting is this is this is the heart of what we're doing in the web 3 space is the intersection of mechanism design and markets and collective decision making and i think that y'all are kind of on the forefront of of that so um i guess i guess i'm wondering uh should we go deep on some of those mechanisms i think we'd go deep on salsa we could go deep on quadratic funding and why those are important or we could talk about the values that we're trying to evoke when we design these systems kind of choose your own adventure what do you want to what do you want to say next let's go a little deeper on uh quadratic voting and salsa um i think it's kind of useful to have both of those in in mind and um and go from there totally yeah sounds good uh let's start with quadratic voting then yeah so the way you think about quadratic voting is um it's just a way of making a decision better it's a way of like restructuring a voting process and a ballot um and the way that it works is pretty straightforward it's that you have a if you can imagine that we're making a decision on a range of issues on a ballot instead of everybody just voting sort of once on each issue on the ballot we might instead have a budget of like voice credits that we can allocate between the different issues to indicate how strongly we care about the different issues so if you care more about one issue on the ballot you can put more voice credits on it and effectively vote more times on it but the relationship between the amount of voice credits you allocate to it and the number of like counted votes on it is is quadratic is not a simple linear relationship so this is how it works it's if you want to vote on something once you allocate one voice credit to it if you want to vote on something twice you allocate four voice credits to it if you out want to vote on something three times you allocate nine voice credits to it so it's you know fairly simple twist on on uh on like a system that allows you to you know a fairly simple twist on multiple voting basically that that lets you express stronger or weaker uh opinions and what it does the interesting thing about it is that it is that while it while it lets you express a stronger point of view on issues that you care about more strongly it in effect imposes a very high cost for doing so because if you decide to vote three times on something that cost you nine voting credits which means that you know that you could have just voted on it once for one voting credit instead you chose to vote three times that that cost you eight more which you could have allocated to other issues so you have sort of like way less say on all the other issues if you decide to express a strong point of view on on any particular issue why is that a big idea that's a bigger idea than it might seem at first the reason it's a big idea is that it it allows voting systems to take in information about how strongly people care about different issues without encouraging them to uh express a very very strong point of view on every single issue so kind of puts into balance the incentive to just um uh the incentive to yell at the top of your lungs with the interest of giving everybody uh an equal say and it's basically like you can sort of think of it as um causing each voter to like internalize the negative externality of trying to yell louder than other voters and by putting these different incentives like in balance the idea is that it's incentivizing people to be honest about how strongly they care so so that you're not you like the the idea behind it is that it's not encouraging you to think strategically or to like game a system it's it's actually the incentives are set up so that the the way to interact with quadratic voting is just to just to think honestly and seriously about how much you care uh about the different issues relative to one another and express that instead of like you know trying to you know manipulate the outcome by going all in on something and sacrificing other things you really just want to like just be honest about how much you care yeah i think one of the things that you and i have talked about before is how to take democracy and and bring it into higher resolution or like high bandwidth democracy and what i love about what we're talking about here is that i think about we're not just expressing the direction of our preferences but we're also just uh expressing the degree of our preferences which to me that maps as like higher resolution input into a democratic system the ability to map how much you care about each item seems like an innovation to me yeah absolutely like um i mean the audrey tong has talked about this and um used the metaphor of bandwidth for democracy to great effect and which i i i love right that the the way that we traditionally vote is super super low bandwidth we send like a couple bits of information every couple years um and uh it's fairly understandable that if that's the only means of expression that democratic systems are taking in i peop either people are going to feel that they don't matter people are going to be disenfranchised people are going to get frustrated and disillusioned with the process or our efforts to influence the democratic you know system are going to spill over into other areas of life so taking in more information through like now there's a lot there's a lot to be said about you know deliberation and stuff like that too which is you know you need to have a healthy deliberation process to lead into a healthy voting decision process right and you don't you never want the voting and the decision to displace the deliberation and the kind of question structuring but sometimes you need to get down to breast tax and make a complicated decision and having the best possible tools to do that is is a way of keeping democracy healthy so i that's what inspires me about it too i mean this is this is a way of of um of bringing forward institutional processes that enable everyone to to have a say and and you know hopefully like basically keeping democracy vital in all different areas of life not only in government but in all of the other spaces where democratic decision making has an important role to play right so this is actually the mechanism that uh git coin is built on top of uh bitcoin grants we have a matching campaign every quarter and we match contributions from the crowd and we use quadratic funding in order to do that uh quadratic funding is just an implementation of quadratic voting where the voice credits are actually the dollars or the tokens that you spend and um i think it's just really neat to think about the evolution of quadratic voting to quadratic funding and how they're sort of complementary to each other i don't know if you have anything to say about quadratic funding but i just wanted to connect to the audience that that's something that we're deeply connected to at get coin yeah you said it i mean you know quadratic funding is a is a basically an implementation or a instantiation of quadratic voting in which the you know donations are like a form of voting and um uh it's an incredibly powerful way of funding public goods which is another you know really really deep issue in the structure of democracies and the i think the evolution of quadratic voting into quadratic funding or the sort of development of the idea into that new space is a really powerful thing and an example of how this this sort of this thing of sort of uh quadratic voting kind of taps into a very deep pattern in uh how we could better structure our institutions which is that we could devise mechanisms where our expression of power internalizes the externalities that it imposes on others right and i mean that's that's what quadratic voting is that's what quadratic voting does and um by devising systems that do that we we can make systems that are higher bandwidth we can make systems that have a higher informational throughput that have you know take in more dimensions of information from people and let us let us scale let us function together as a society without you know collapsing into collapsing into autocracies or or um other like you know non-democratic uh um forms which we sometimes collapse into when we when we uh try to scale without the right tools so yeah i think it's a really beautiful mechanism um and i just am very thankful to be in locked in this i'll call it a dance between uh radical exchange and glenn and you who are kind of like building some of these mechanisms and there's a group of us that are more i'd say practitioners people who are taking this and putting into practice i'm running a brand called bitcoin grants actually i'm not running it anymore the dial is running it but i'm involved um and there's this kind of like this loop between theory and action experiments and then results that that kind of loops back from there and it's just kind of been this very virtuous cycle to be working together on this so looking forward to continuing to experiment with this mechanism in the future and uh i i think that we have some some ideas that have been coming out in the future about how to make this mechanism more plural and uh i i'm curious if we want to go into go into that next why is pluralism important how could we uh how could we advance this mechanism in the future yeah um there there's a um so the the one of the most exciting things about these sort of institutional innovation ideas um is that they can they sort of open the door to a design space uh in which our institutions could not only be more democratic but also sort of more more pluralistic more sort of like um you know local and nested and interpenetrating and interacting as opposed to you know speaking you know kind of impressionistically moving a little bit away from the sort of monolithic universal power structures into more localized lower to the ground complex interpenetrating community based basically power structures and um uh you know i i think that i mean to me that that tracks a vision of the world that is uh that is attractive to me right in which different different kinds of values are um are embodied and instantiated and constituted in lots of different democratic communities and um a lot of our recent work is is sort of oriented in that direction oriented in the direction of of um [Music] making things like quadratic voting and hardworker taxes or salsa or partial common ownership um and quadratic funding and um and much more including you know soul bound tokens if we want to get into that taking these kinds of governance patterns and institutional ideas and thinking about how they can how they can open the door to a uh uh you know deeply democratic and also diverse and plural and complex structure of different powers that you know so uh that's very i was very abstract but that's you know that's kind of the world that uh that we're trying to build um um yeah i'll i'll pause there we can you can pull off yeah well you know i think that um we're gonna have we're gonna have puja and glenn and leon on the podcast uh in order to talk about soulbound tokens decentralized society i think we'll go deep on that mechanism with them in fact maybe i'll drop this episode in that episode together because i think they're deeply complementary but um you know i just think that this idea of pluralism is is really the exciting thing to me a social philosophy that recognizes and fosters the flourishing of a cooperation of diversity of socio-cultural uh groups and systems so basically it seems like we've kind of got this this idea that uh diversity creates anti-fragility and this pluralism of different mechanisms is kind of the institutions that we want to build in the 21st century uh so i just want to pause and like i feel like i'm kind of like sipping like a or like wafting a fine wine right here when we talk about pluralism we kind of talk about the direction that we want to go there i don't know if you have anything else to say about about pluralism but i've been reading a lot of glenn's writing and i just think it's it's kind of a beautiful idea uh yeah yeah totally i mean i think that the uh there's so much to to say about it um one is just that um i think that one thing to say about it is you can understand a lot of the you know difficulties that our societies have faced over the past like couple hundred years as related to the problem of kind of um uh shoehorning everybody into one-size-fits-all sort of power structures that often put people pretty far from power and that you know kind you know assume a very high degree of individuality and don't really provide tools for people to participate in the governance of like closer to home type institutions that are really important in in life like you know communities and and uh churches and um uh civil society organizations and you know all these local government all these kinds of like layers of of power and government and connection um are they are really where the action is they're where the you know the the meaning is and people participating richly and meaningfully in these kinds of power structures is like we need that as human beings we need that as human beings as individuals and we also need those sorts of uh institutions to be healthy for the macro society to be healthy um and we've ended up in this place where it's like everyone is focused on the same node of power like everyone's focused on the supreme court or the un or the whatever it may be right we're all kind of fighting over the same uh nodes and meanwhile the you know which are important i'm not saying they aren't but you know but meanwhile like the other uh um uh institutions are like hollowing out and being eroded right you know where people are not as engaged in local government as they probably ought to be they you know um civil society like of the kind that um you know um like alexis de tocqueville eloquently described you know is uh is is uh floundering right you know unions are suffering right unions have just gotten weaker unions are a good example i think this kind of like um uh mid level of of associative organization um and uh so there's just a whole cir there's a whole sort of like layer of society that is like become a ghost town and by building better systems of governance and better systems of like sharing property better systems of collaborating in small and medium-sized groups and you know allowing people to commit to communities in new ways and participate in them in richer ways um that uh yeah that holds the promise of a more of a more pluralistic healthier society you know at the kind of micro level and at the macro level right yeah i think we're in this moment of change in which the way democracy has been conducted in the past is the way it's not going to be in the future and it just seems to me that we're in this kind of transition from the industrial age to a more information age and we're looking for these more high resolution digital ways of expressing our signals um and maintaining that loop of the consent of the governed the consent of the govern being the only legitimate basis of governance and um i think that it's a it's a moment of great opportunity but also of of great peril um and so that's why i'm just it's what gets me up in the morning is is working on these democratic systems and trying to uh experiment with what democracy will look like in the digital age so um i think the the key point i take away from the pluralism thing is that uh by having a pluralism of mechanisms for funding our commons and for civic life in the 21st century we don't put too much burden on one uh one mechanism and having a plurality of you know futures where say there's salsa and there's quadratic voting and there's retroactive public goods funding and probably a dozen other mechanisms that i'm not even aware of give backs is is kind of that diversity creates an anti-fragility um and so yeah i think there's a big there's a big opportunity ahead and getting involved in the radical exchange movement i think is how you get involved in that dance of the creation of those mechanisms and the dreaming of of those mechanisms so you're really at the epicenter of it um i'm curious if you have anything else to say about uh about pluralism i'd be i'd be i'd love to dive in on salsa or harbinger taxes next but kind of curious where your head's at matt um yeah i mean well one one thing i'll put a pin in the then let's go let's talk about um salsa and harvard taxes is that um okay you know one of the i think one of the kind of like anti-pluralistic influences on society uh in recent you know centuries but also in decades in particular is is probably is the influence of um basically like the global economy right so i mean one of these highly universalizing institutions is um is money and so building governance institutions that um that enable people to uh to participate in in meaningful community structures and um uh um govern essentially you know assets and and uh not only assets but norms and um things like that in sort of in a way that is in ways that are like a little bit a little bit like have an umbrella around them vis-a-vis the global economy is um um is really is a big piece of this um so right so is it like the globalism and the scale being disconnected from local people and their local values is is that kind of the crux of it you think um yeah that's one way of putting it and i think another way of putting it is that um is that when everything is fungible into like the same yardstick you know be that the dollar or the bitcoin or or the you know bundle of currencies you know when everything can be you know readily transformed into that then that one yardstick becomes this this sort of um the language that everybody has to speak in every different context and um creating creating contexts creating local contexts of governance of community institutions or management of assets in which that is not the language that people need to speak is i think important to revitalizing our society like at the deepest level so you know the thing a lot of the things that you know do still kind of work are things that are um uh are things in which you know the language of money isn't the uh isn't the soul language spoken um and um uh distributed uh technologies like you know blockchain technology and and and similar and create they they create a design space which we haven't yet fully occupied we haven't yet fully explored for uh for creating new kinds of institutions and power structures that that don't just run on the same that don't just speak exactly the same language as every other institution that first and foremost speaks the language of the of dollars um so yeah there's a this is a um i'm gonna give a talk about this uh in a in a in a month or so there's a there's more to more to say about about what i'm thinking about how all this relates to like uh money and local currency but so it's nice to say i think there's a there's a huge uh um a huge design space opening up for community currencies and and local local economics that um that i'm quite excited about right well i'm really jazzed about that world you know if we believe that the globalism and the commodification of everything into this one global money is the problem then having local community currencies in which you can have your own sort of um economy that's based off of your own set of values then i think that that's really a way of creating these i don't want to use the word bubble because that sounds like it's going to pop but almost these lit these sort of like safe places where you can have currency that that is relative to your own values and that's i can see why that would be really powerful in a world in which we've kind of got global values and local values together so looking forward to that talk and exploring those ideas yeah um yeah exactly and bubble is the way i think about it is i kind of like the word membrane i mean bubble is not a bad word necessarily but you know it's it's like the other way of thinking about is like layers of an onion i mean our lives are always characterized by sort of layers of an onion things things that are more things like more global things that are more public things that are you know uh things that are entirely private and things that are in between and um we we've lost that in between layer we're all just like we've gotten into a world where we're all individuals trying to uh surf the unsurfable huge wave

truly building the battle station for the crypto world check out opera both on mobile with android and ios apps and on desktop too i feel like i'm leaving this episode so open-ended and it's because you have such a depth of um of of ideas about mechanisms of design and this space and i'm kind of hoping that you're going to lead us through it a little bit so i'm sorry i'm just asking totally open-ended questions here but uh yes let's switch over to two harbinger taxes and i want to know how those sort of support the world that we want to build as well where to begin here um let me explain some of the background ideas first and then i'll kind of get into like uh mechanism design stuff about how to instantiate these sorts of values so um i i think that a a a good way of a good point of entry for this idea is to think about land to think about the value of land and like private property and land the way that uh if you think about just land so leave aside structures and improvements and that and you know all that kind of infrastructure and all that kind of stuff for a moment here just think about land the way that um unimproved land becomes valuable the way that it becomes gets more valuable over time is basically by virtue of the network effect of people on it and near it interacting and generating a society right so if i have like a um uh the you know if if manhattan island was empty and i owned a piece of land on manhattan island it would be worth way less than uh then it's worth uh now and the reason for that is not that there's anything not that it's more arable or that the you know river is whatever it's uh the reason it's the reason manhattan land is worth a gazillion dollars instead of a few dollars is that it's um is that there are tons and tons and tons of people around every piece of land on manhattan or you know interacting in this rich rich interconnected society creating culture and doing economic exchange and all of the amazing beautiful things that uh that people do um and so with the the consequence of that like the the uh the the sort of troubling insight that that leads to which was first really clearly articulated by a 19th century economist named uh henry george is the idea that um that the owner of a particular piece of land uh is not responsible for most of the value of that land right it's not that now if you build a if you build a building on a piece of land then sure you add you added a lot of value to the land but if we even if we just control for the building there are massive variations in land value that are only attributable to these like network effects of people interacting which has nothing to do with anything that the owner of any piece of land did this is a funny thing this is a serious problem this is essentially like a very very serious problem with the way that that private property works and therefore with like you know one of the most important institutions in our society um yeah totally and i just like i've never heard you articulate this before but it just makes so much sense i mean you've got sort of like public action and public network effects and you've got privatized gains for whoever owns that land um it's it kind of reminds me of our internet culture where you've got these kind of tech giants that uh have these network effect based business models and that's how they create exponential growth i know you wanted to stay focused on land so maybe we'll stay there but uh it did remind me of that a little bit uh no that's exactly that's exactly the right connection to make i mean this this this pattern of sort of basically strong private property interests allowing uh owners or speculators or or whatever to capture value created by networks that they didn't build basically um you know that that pattern runs throughout our our society and it's something that it's like something people don't like to look at it's it's a it's a huge problem and um it's a problem of of uh of justice uh it means that you know the gains from economic development and technological development are are too concentrated and are falling into the wrong hands and it's an efficiency problem because it means that the people who are creating value in society who are you know um uh living their lives and building businesses and creating art and whatever you know making manhattan awesome uh uh you know and or making a social network vibrant or whatever people are participating in these networks they're not getting um uh you know they're creating value that that uh that doesn't end up empowering them that ends up empowering other people um now uh so it's a justice problem it's also an efficiency problem because if you could fix that if you could basically kind of re-uh redirect the stream of value creation back into the uh back into the pockets and back into the people who are interacting and creating society they would be they would be not only better off but also better incentivized to continue their pro-social ways right you know to to continue to continue to create art and continue to participate in society and continue to engage with their neighbors in a in a in a productive beneficial way right so kind of you know you can you can see like resonances here with the whole sort of nimby uh thing right there's like you know there are incentives that aren't there for people to be like good neighbors and productive members of communities that it would be cool if they were there in addition to being more fair um so um so okay so like that's like that in the context not only of land but also in the context of as you're saying digital networks and really anything that's the problem that salsa harbor taxes partial common ownership the the thing with many names um that i'm about to describe uh tries to tries to address so uh i'll um wanna pause the beat there to give you a chance to uh stop me or i'll just roll into it yeah scripture yeah i i'm ready to roll let's get into harbinger taxes let's let's hear about it okay so picture picture this and let's stay in the context of land even though this does not have to apply to land uh it's just a it's just a way of sort of making it concrete so that you can think about the structure imagine you own a piece of land um and um uh or sorry let me rewind and not use the word own because what this is this is essentially a way of rethinking ownership um imagine if you possess a piece of land and uh um in order to uh and there's like basically sort of like a property tax on on your possession of land so in order to continue to possess the land you need to pay the pay to community um uh something this is an acknowledgement of what i was just talking about right this is an acknowledgment of the fact that you know private exclusive possession of something like this uh is um uh is essentially it imposes a negative externality on the network that that gives the thing value it enables you you know your your private possession of a piece of land enables you to exclude other people from the land um and uh and that's why property taxes you know that's that's the idea of what property taxes are trying to sort of deal with so you possess a piece of land you have to pay a property tax on it property tax is calculated as some percentage of the um of the value now imagine if instead of uh um some assessor using some formula and you know saying what what they think the land is worth you self-assess the land so you say you basically self-declare i think that um you know my my continued possession of this land is worth uh a hundred dollars then your your your property tax is then calculated as some percentage of that self-declared value now the obvious issue with this is that then everybody has incentive to under declare the um the value so what imagine the following sort of twist in our institution design here uh whatever you self-declare the land to be worth is also a declaration of what you would be willing to sell it for so if you say if you say a hundred dollars then if somebody comes to you with a hundred dollars you you have to sell it it's like a it's it's like a sell offer as well as a um uh assessment and um uh so what that does is that that gives you an incentive to you know not to not lowball it but to um to set declare a high value so that uh so you can continue to possess it if if indeed you want to continue to um to possess your interest um and uh uh now there's another sort of uh layer to this which is then you know the question of how do you sort of set the right uh the right tax here so if you imagine um if you imagine that a tax rate is very very low imagine like imagine that the property tax rate here is point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent right then no matter what i actually think my uh my uh land is worth i'm going to declare a super high value and just pay a really low tax and continue to continue to possess it similarly if the if the property tax is really high if the property tax is a hundred percent then i'm not even going to want to possess it i'm going to declare a low value and just let somebody else have it and get it off my hands so the question in this in this sort of mechanism design institutional design problem is how do you sort of set that tax rate at a level where people uh will honestly self-report what the possession of the land is worth to them if you can do that if you can strike that balance so that so that these self-assessments are essentially honest self-reportings of what possession is worth to to a particular you know person then you can um uh you're doing a few interesting things first of all you are ensuring that the that the most efficient possessor of any particular asset is going to be in the possession of that particular asset at any given time um and and second you're going to maximize the uh the the tax revenue i'm calling this tax revenue but it doesn't have to be like a government tax you could just think of this as like a like a fee in a sort of a private institutional design you know set up um the um and that's cool maximizing that tax revenue is cool because what do you do with that the idea would be that you take that tax revenue and recycle it back into the network of people who are creating the value of the underlying asset so in the case of a piece of land in manhattan the network of people creating the value of that asset are the people who live work play travel to interact with uh the vibrant society of uh of manhattan so take that take that um take that tax revenue and use it to re you know uh make people's lives better create public goods build more infrastructure egalitarianly support the whole you know social structure and so what what this is is this is a shift of mentality away from a traditional private property mentality right the idea this is this is a way of understanding something like land or some other kind of uh or or you know um exclusive possession of a uh digital social network or whatever it's it's a way of re-conceptualizing exclusive possession of those kinds of things as as like the stewardship of something on behalf of of a community but which nonetheless used you know leverages the power of markets and distributed intelligence to uh to to um to do it efficiently right and to to kind of have have an efficient owner of any particular asset there you can sort of tweak the dials here to to uh ensure that uh investment in assets is is incentivized at the right level um and so this is like a this is kind of a pattern institutional design pattern that lets us think about power sharing in a in a deeper and more powerful way than the kind of you know uh absolute medieval uh i own this plot you own that plot uh you know um mentality that you know we've inherited from from hundreds thousands of years ago right what i think is so elegant about this mechanism is how it uses markets and collective intelligence to balance both both sides of the equation so you've basically got the ability for a market to to take any specific piece of property at a certain price which incentivizes the owner not to price it too low um and then you've got the sort of like taxes which incentivizes the the owner not to to price it so high and it just seems like such an elegant mechanism that doesn't have any sort of it seems like bureaucrat on you know like assessing your your property tax or you know it's leveraging markets um and it's leveraging the people that are closest to the system in order to uh in order to balance it and i think that's one of the most elegant things about it um i'm i'm wondering you know are there any examples of this being implemented and how how is it going uh what is the future of of experimentation with this mechanism yeah so there's like there's a group uh matters lab matters labs which is doing an experiment called the space right now which is a very cool um and uh high profile experiment with uh um with salsa mechanisms where it's kind of it's a bit like a it's like a pixel map uh where you can um uh people can um purchase um uh uh essentially purchase different parts of a pixel map and and you know collaboratively create a um collaboratively created image you know which you can think of as an analogy for you know collaboratively collaboratively creating a a society through you know land flowing to different owners and stuff the some other interesting really interesting examples are using it for uh um advertising space and and um i'm also quite interested in using it for for art um so just to give a just to give a sort of a quick flavor of what these are and there's been there has been uh experimentation in both these areas as well um you know uh advertising is the is like um you can kind of think of advertising as third parties unilaterally staking claims to our attention or or whatever right you know you know by kind of claiming that that space in our attentional bandwidth they're imposing negative externalities um on on the network of people around them a little bit like private land ownership so um so you could think of of um so so you know a mechanism like salsa might be able to might be a much more efficient way of allocating um uh allocating possession of internet ads or billboards or or whatever whatever it may be um uh there's also interesting applications in in art so for example one big problem with art is that you you know i make a great painting i sell it to a smart kind of like early stage collector they sell it to one other person a few years later it sells for a good jillion dollars and i only got the you know um 300 bucks that my friend paid to me for it right that problem is a function of of this kind of uh outdated absolutist conception of ownership that salsa allows us to create um to tweak the dials of of of asset possession in ways that would enable uh creators to have a stake in those ongoing um movements of value um the um yeah i mean there's kind of there's really like uh no limit to this i mean i i could i could i could i could basically like you name the sort of area of like asset structuring and i can i can give you an interesting application uh for salsa natural resources are another one but one thing i'm really excited about right now is is basically the the ecosystem of of um of uh like um uh blockchain based you know digital assets like non-fungible tokens that are structured using using um using hard burger taxation or salsa and partial common ownership is really really developing so i i think that we're going to see a lot of interesting uh structuring of digital assets using this mechanism in in the coming years and that excites me in and of itself it also excites me because i think it's going to open a lot of people's minds to the idea that a a different way of thinking about ownership might be better than the familiar way of thinking about it that we um right that we you know were taught as children yeah nothing like seeing something in practice i think to to really get an idea um planted in your mind and i think that smart contracts in web3 and nfts are kind of the perfect place to be experimenting with some of these mechanisms smart contracts can manage the setting of the price of an asset in the purchase of an asset and the implementation of the payment of the creator of the artwork so it just seems like a very elegant efficient place to be experimenting with hardwoods or taxes so yeah curious to see what experiments develop over the next couple years and one more can i give you one more um i'm i'm excited about um i'm excited about seeing um uh this asset structure um used in the context of local governance and or like community currencies and stuff like that so you could imagine a you could imagine a community currency in which uh the community of people using the currency has assembled a like a like a trust of shared assets and then they basically use the community currency to divide the possession of those shared assets between themselves uh use under this sort of salsa system so now you can start to imagine like a community of people with its own currency you need to have some of that currency to get possessory interests in the shared assets of the community and those shared assets in the community are being managed using um uh using salsa or harbor taxation so they're being managed very efficiently they're generating a stream of uh sort of a maximized stream of income which is then being recycled into the whole community whether or not you you know have purchased possessory rights in in those assets so um uh so yeah it's you know and you could also imag you could even imagine city governments doing this right you could imagine city governments um accruing portfolios of uh of let's say commercial real estate um in their own cities and uh um allocating it through salsa um and uh but you know they could manage it in something like like an urban wealth fund for example right they would hold these assets manage them using a sufficient system generate a stream of income that would be used to fund public goods in the city or even just you know directly compensate people in the city through some kind of uh ubi like thing i think they're they're it's easy to get that wrong but it's also you know it's a useful pattern to have in mind uh uh as a way that this sort of thing could be redistributed so um uh yeah i mean i think this is um uh this is very unfamiliar like the sort of patterns of thinking about ownership that this uh interacts with are strong and persistent which makes it hard but um but i have very little doubt that um that this way of thinking about um asset sharing and asset possession is gonna play an important uh part in the next decade of of technology and and society in general yeah very cool um i think that we're we're over time i was just messaging you that i think we only have a couple more minutes so i think it's good time to start zooming back out and um talking about the ecosystem that y'all are building um i'm curious if there's it but before we do that i'm curious if there's anything that i didn't ask you that you want to say matt um no that's let's uh let's start zooming out okay great well um how do people get involved in the movement say you're a smart contract developer say you're working on d5 and you want to get involved in building some of these mechanisms associated with rather with radical exchange what's the best way to get involved um one good way of getting involved is to shoot an email to chapters radicalexchange.org and we will do our best to plug you into the network um so there's lots of smart and interesting people around the world um who are thinking about these things and looking for ways uh looking for other bright people to collaborate with on projects or looking for you know opportunities to to to try experiments and we view it as core to our mission to to help help build those connections like we we really um have a um uh uh basically the radical change resources is really uh a rich network that anyone can can get involved with um so uh email us chapters radical exchange.org also sign up for our newsletter and join our community calls we do a community call first wednesday of of each month which is open and a good way to kind of uh um put some faces to names get to know some other people who are um spending a lot of time on this work and um um uh yeah i mean our our entire philosophy is essentially to uh create network effects you know create create gains that we're not capturing and help you know give opportunities to uh to to others who who want to contribute so open door yeah amazing um and i can attest to the quality of the radical exchange movement and network i've been to a couple of y'all's events the one in detroit the one in denver selfishly i hope you come back to colorado soon um and i think get coin in many ways is built on top of a lot of these ideas and also looking to help other entrepreneurs and and people who want to build meaningful stuff for the world build on top of your ideas so a big fan that and looking forward to working forward and working together in the future thanks so much for coming on the podcast man likewise thank you for having me and thanks for all the great work that you have done and all the great work you're going to continue to do yeah likewise [Music] you
