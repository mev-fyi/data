we're just barely scratching the surface of what paul app can do in the future imagine that the chicago bulls or the dallas mavericks use poep and every time you go to a game you get a po app now because the blockchain is public you can see who the most loyal fans are and you can start segmenting your customer base based on how many poeps they have there's also token proof that can validate whether somebody has three of the co-apps or five of the co-ops and that applies to live music and a lot of other use cases so i think that's super powerful i'm imagining you're also thinking about this as being used like to get into a maverick game or into a beyonce concert 100 but there's more to token proof than just events imagine that somebody like sephora wants to offer a discount holders of boss beauties or world of women because we know what you're holding in your wallet and because you've registered that wallet with token proof we can suggest that that promotion is available to you and when you go to a sephora we can do the token verification there before they give you the discount
