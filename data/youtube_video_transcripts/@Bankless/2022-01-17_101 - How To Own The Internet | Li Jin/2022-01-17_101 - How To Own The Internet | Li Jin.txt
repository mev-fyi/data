that can be the basis of entirely new types of jobs and income that hadn't existed before online welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode talking about the ownership economy the creator economy both of those things a few things to take a look out for the first is the creator economy versus the ownership economy what is the difference between these two terms we go through it with legion second the original sin of the internet what was that sin what did it cost us third four things that will actually fix the original sin and usher us into the ownership economy number four the web three renaissance what that is what that means number five how crypto can actually fix wealth inequality legion gives her opinion on how that could be the case how we might come up with a fix for some of the wealth inequality issues and finally number six what this means for you how to set yourself up in the ownership economy how to be your own boss how to take advantage of the web 3 renaissance that is coming all of this unpacked on the show today david what were your thoughts on this episode gosh lee jin is such a clear articulate thinker and she really does a very fantastic job of taking us from the very beginning of this story at the dawn of the internet while the the founding people of the internet we're really thinking about what happens next now that we have this internet thing taking us all the way to where we are today and then also extrapolating extrapolating into the future about what it means to create content on the internet and i think one of my my favorite things about lee and her interest in the creator economy in the in the owner economy is that she's she's very pragmatic she wants to see creators and creativity blossom and that is her goal her goal i don't think is really to get crypto to take over the world she sees crypto as a means to an end for what what she wants to see in the world which is inspiring creativity and everyone being able to be their own boss by unlocking and unleashing their internal creativity colonel that we all have inside of us she's not like you or me and we're like um you know we are focused on crypto and we want crypto to take over the world she wants creativity to take over the world and she sees crypto as a viable way to get that done uh and i think she even she hints in this in the show that she used to be very very pragmatic about intersecting like here we can use web 2 for this and we can use web 3 for this but she said she's recently capitulated and it says that it's only web 3 here on out and it's actually through web3 that we can fully unleash crypto or excuse me fully unleash creativity to its maximum degree in a way that we've never seen before out of humanity yeah absolutely i think that's a great insight i i also think this is this is almost the sister episode to our episode with chris dixon uh where we went through five mental models of web 3. um and i think this is a mental model the idea of the creator economy their ownership economy is the mental model that uh all bankless listeners should have locked in their brains for 2022 because once you understand this you start to see different areas you can invest in your time your money um your skills your jobs and and the world kind of opens up um web 3 and crypto really is going to usher a new type of economy it's going to create a new business model for the internet and we tap into all of that here so uh stay tuned for this episode as always like subscribe review if you're

bankless nation i'm super excited to introduce you to our next guest lee jin she is a co-founder general partner at variant fund previously worked at a16 z her thesis i think the thesis of variant fun writ large is that next generation networks will grow faster and bigger because they are owned and operated by their users this is called the ownership economy web 3 as you can imagine crypto as you can imagine has a huge role to play here she's also a writer on substance fantastic writer by the way and a hobbyist painter legion welcome back to bankless it's great to have you on again thank you so much for having me guys it's a delight to be here i think last time you were on you're on a you're on a panel and we enjoyed that panel so much we're like uh we've got to bring lee back to talk about the ownership economy in more depth the creator economy and actually i want to ask you that question do you like the term creator economy or ownership economy better when you define this thing uh so i think those two things are actually slightly distinct they're overlapping it's like a venn diagram there's crater economy non-ownership economy version there's crater economy ownership economy overlap and then there's other ownership economy stuff that is outside of the greater economy well i like that could you get into the detail there so creator economy i'm imagining is um well yeah why don't you describe the the venn diagrams for us yeah sure so the creator economy is really this um this economy that exists online marked by this proliferation of individual content creators who are uploading user-generated content and monetizing that in a host of different ways and essentially ever since uh like as for as long as the internet has existed there have been creators on the internet ranging from people starting blogs and posting on forums to today you know posting on youtube making podcasts like we are right now and the way that people have monetized their independent creations have varied over the years it really used to be banner ads and then programmatic advertising and in the last couple of years i think the resurgence or the increased attention the creator economy has gotten has really been around the potential for direct monetization of one's audience spanning from writing a subscription newsletter to starting a patreon to starting you know any sort of like direct fan monetization type of business um and so the creator economy has been around for i i would say like over a decade um and it's gone through multiple phases in its history which we talked about on the panel with cooper and jesse um and i think we're right now in the third phase of the crater economy which is that they regard themselves as independent businesses in in and of themselves in their own right um they used to be people who helped other businesses to grow by selling sponsorship placements or doing advertising on behalf of other brands but today i think the mental shift that a lot of creators have made is that they they think of themselves as businesses and brands as as individuals as personas and where that starts to overlap with the idea of the ownership economy which is the idea that all next generation internet products and services are going to be owned by their users and go through the progressive decentralization playbook is that i think there's really this convergence where um there has been the broad recognition that creators have been responsible for creating a lot of the value on the web 2 internet but have not really been the beneficiaries of that value creation instead it's gone to the owners of the platforms that they're working on so um a creator on youtube or create on facebook etc they aren't earning income on the side for sure um and they can find external ways to monetize their audience but they haven't been owners of the underlying platforms that they're posting content on and actually contributing value to um and that comes in the form of both economic ownership as well as any sort of governance rights and so we're really seeing this overlap in this flourishing of the creator economy and ownership economy today um wherein people are having the conversation of well creators should actually be owning more of the value that they create they should be the beneficiaries of the value creation that they're doing and they should become just as other users in the community owners of these platforms too so the creator economy then obviously predates crypto but was maybe uniquely enabled by the internet we'll we'll get into that but is the ownership economy is that sort of a product of um of crypto and how does this term web 3 do you think relate is are web 3 and the ownership economy part of the same you know would you bucket the ownership economy under web 3 or do you think it's its own thing following its own path and trajectory that's just related somehow yeah we have this internal debate all the time among the variant team as to what all these different terms mean crypto web 3 ownership economy how do we diff them and where are the boundaries i think frankly like it's still such a nascent area of technology that no one can really say conclusively what is one thing versus another and the terms have sort of taken on lives of their own um my personal uh feeling and the way that i personally define them is i think the ownership economy is actually a bigger like umbrella um phenomenon in which users and participants of platforms are becoming owners and there was a web 2 version of the ownership economy in which companies were trying to utilize um traditional equity and legal structures in order to give ownership to their users that was like the weak form of the ownership economy and the strong form of the ownership economy is enabled by crypto and tokens which represent ownership um and then as for web3 i think most people are using it synonymously with crypto but i think the ownership economy is is bigger than all of that lee in order to fully explain the creator economy and the ownership economy we're going to take a second to go all the way back to the dawn of the internet but before we do that can you just explain or illustrate the arc that i think exists with uh the trend of the creator economy you already illustrated a little bit where creators used to create for others and now they are creating for themselves and then you also think there's another phase coming can you just summarize the trend of the creator economy kind of where it started and where it's going and what the general arc what it arcs into over time absolutely um so i described the creator economy in terms of different phases and the evolution of the phases that we've gone through over the past decade or so so creator economy 1.0 um which was the very the the dawn of the creator economy i think of as existing as long as the internet has existed um so initially people were uploading content online um they were doing so on their own independent websites or blogs that they set up and then as the social network started to come out people also utilized those for content creation um so so in those days i would consider everyone to have been a content creator as long as they were posting content but it was very nascent in terms of the economy piece of the content creation so there were creators but less so an economy actually happening creator economy 2.0 i think was really the burgeoning economy around people who built up fame and influence on all of those channels so gradually you had people who accumulated audiences by posting content on the internet um and they were kind of like digitally native celebrities and this influential class who we typically refer to now as the creator class then began to receive monetization um usually in the form of advertising or brand sponsorships so they monetize the eyeballs and the reach that they got from their total audience and that was a game that really rewarded reach and scale um and and now we've shifted i think just in the last couple of years or so to the phase that we're in now which is creator economy 3.0 which is this phase in which creators are no longer just conduits for selling other people's products and plugging other people's businesses and brands um but instead are regarding themselves as the brand as the business and they are trying to monetize their own persona in different ways um and they're doing so increasingly by using lots of different tools and platforms that have flourished in the last couple of years um all really based on direct monetization of their super fans so that's that's the phase where and now uh creator economy 3.0 which is creators as their own independent businesses i think nft is actually i would bucket under that third phase of like it's uh it's another tool in the toolkit that creators are using today for direct monetization of fans where i see this all going in the future is eventually um the next phase of the creator economy will be the dissolution of boundaries between who is a creator versus who is an audience member and so it becomes much less clearly delineated the the creator versus the fan and instead it moves towards this world in which creators co-create with their audience and they're all part of a community that is helping to drive value back to the collective output that they that they put out and in that world i think everyone um is compensated with uh you know a reward proportional to how much value they drove to the community um and i call that uh evolution from the creator economy to the community economy um and that is really the the supercharged version of the creator economy and where we go that's really cool from from the individual creators to entire communities and creators co-creating with their fans and fans creating with uh with the creators as well um this is super interesting and i think that that definitely dovetails into the the ownership economy as well because that provides maybe the underlying alignment or incentive mechanism but like i don't wanna we jump ahead of ourselves yet because this has almost been like a tease so far of everything we're going to unpack in this episode i think i want to go back to a post that you uh wrote recently a fantastic post called the web3 renaissance the golden age for content and let's go back as david was saying to like the founding of the internet uh and there was this essay i believe in 1996 i guess this was a little bit after you know the the internet came on board but this famous essay from bill gates entitled people have probably heard this phrase content is king right you've heard that meme propagated around and bills gates said at that time in that essay one of the exciting things about the internet is that anyone with a pc and a modem can publish whatever content they create from the for the internet to thrive content providers must be paid for their work the long term prospects are good but i expect a lot of disappointment in the short term you go in your post on to unpack that but can you really put us back in the shoes of bill gates when he wrote that in 1996 what did he see in the internet at that point in time and why did he expect this disappointment in the short term are we still kind of living in that disappointment talk us through that sure so firstly i would say uh when this article was published it was very very early days of the internet this was 1996. i think globally there were like 30 million users total on the internet today it's like 3.5 billion um so at the time it was less than one percent of the world population so this was very very early days also i would just say that at the time i was five or six years old and so i was not an active internet user um i was probably playing with barbies or something and so a lot of what i know about that era is not from my first hand experience of using the internet but rather from reading and talking to friends who are older than me more mature than me um but regardless so i think putting ourselves into the shoes of bill gates in that era the internet was really nascent um it was nascent in terms of user adoption not to mention the revenue element of you know what existed in terms of businesses on the internet um at that point in time people really regarded the internet as this kind of like toy or interesting novelty but didn't really see a viable place for businesses to get built in his article he outlines that right now the internet is predominantly used by businesses to drive purchases offline so you kind of give a tease or a look at like your offerings and wears and then hopefully some of those users go offline and purchase your magazine or your book or your content thing it's kind of the internet is a static catalog idea it's not really dynamic you don't really interact with it so much yeah exactly it wasn't it wasn't dynamic at the time um and at the time yeah there were very few options for actually collecting payments or monetizing users directly advertising was also really early um he states in the article that advertising might be promising in the future but today the total amount of advertising revenue that's being collected on the internet is nearly zero and so this is this is really the basis for why he predicted a lot of short-term pain in terms of content creators online was because it there was just very little there there was very little users there was very little monetization happening and so he he had this optimistic view of well the internet is really powerful hypothetically because it's permissionless and anyone can go online and post content and the barriers to entry are much lower and i think that has proven out to be true like we have had this flourishing of content creation on the internet everyone can become a creator um but the second part of his prediction was was that there would be there was it was challenging to actually make money from being a content creator on the internet and i think that was um true up until we saw the web 2 platforms and the aggregators who obviously were very profitable and did make money from the content creation that they face facilitated but that revenue uh ultimately a large portion of it did not actually end up in the hands of the individual content creators so bill gates it's a disappointment that he predicted he wasn't just predicting the frustration that we often talk about today with web 2 platforms he his predicted disappointment was coming just from the fact that there was no internet there was no money flowing through the internet in the early days of the internet there was just as as ryan and you said so you know static pages just to disseminate information there was no uh passing of credit card information or not not even to mention cryptocurrency so like being a content producer in the early days just had it was only intrinsic there was no any extrinsic value flows is this is this is all correct yeah that that is my understanding from what i've read is like at the time there was basically like two types of businesses that actually worked on the internet one was e-commerce amazon got certain in 1994 and the way that they accepted payments usually was someone mailing them a check and then getting mailed the product so e-commerce was happening so physical products and then there was porn and then beyond that there was basically nothing else people were very reticent in those days to enter their credit card information onto a web page and it was also very difficult on the supply side for publishers or web page creators to even accept credit card payments and so direct payment was really not a thing advertisers had not yet moved online and so the whole landscape of revenues online was just very very early so from the perspective of this early days of the internet the pl web 2 platforms facebook youtube etc was probably actually um viewed as probably a very good thing that if that if they could have seen that on the horizon because these things these platforms made it very easy for content creators or easier for content creators to actually monetize themselves in the first place would you agree with that statement i would agree with that statement i think that in the early days of these web 2 aggregators or platforms they were viewed in a much more positive light both from the consumer perspective as well as from the supply side perspective of the content creator so on the consumer perspective i think the early days of the internet were marked by this belief that like the internet is this really overwhelming place and it's awash in this like sea of all sorts of different types of content and i like as a user i can't make sense of it there's like headlines from the new york times at that period of time where people are calling the internet this overwhelming sea of websites that like can't possibly be navigated search also by the way was really early in these days um and so i think on the consumer side like the aggregators played a really important role in helping consumers to make sense of all of that information putting into one place having an algorithm that ranked it and surfaced up what was most interesting and help users to basically sift through everything that was out there and then on the content creator side i think in the early days the challenge was like okay i've published my blog online now what like how do i actually get connected to audiences and end users um there's not really there's no google yet um search engines don't really exist the internet had all these like closed ecosystems like aol and msn how do you actually get connected to end consumer that was really difficult too um let alone you know the difficulty in those days of like setting up your own website and getting your own server so i think the dawn of the web 2 platforms was actually a really positive thing it it was regarded as really um enabling the vision that bill gates set out which was facilitating this flourishing of content creation and making it possible for people to reach the people who would connect with their content yeah i'm really blown away with uh by by this um you said in you know 1996 bill gates concern in the contentious king article is that there's not enough there's not a business model for content creators like he saw the potential but he's like there's no way for them to make money there's no way for individuals to find them as probably the the more one of the more elder millennials uh on the on this podcast i do remember when facebook actually uh came to my university i was like it was the coolest freaking thing ever like facebook is here okay now we have a way to like socially connect with our friends and peers this was like a rev a revolution in the internet right it's like all of the the microsoft's in the world they were kind of the the old guard of computing but like the facebooks and google this was the uh the revolution this was giving creators an aggregation point a connection point to their audience creating a business model for them uh and uh it's so funny how quickly that happened right so you chart like 10 years from 1996 to 2006 and then you have the beginnings of facebook and you have google and you have an underlying business model of the web but something from that point on a little bit after maybe like turned towards a a dark path right and now um the googles and the facebooks of the world aren't necessarily perceived as our friends i'm wondering if you could talk about this because this is in your article as well lee the original sin of the internet i think this is a a term from uh mark andreessen if uh if i'm not mistaken um can you tell us about the original sin of the internet and why that led to the outcomes that we have today maybe the business model that the internet operates on today yeah sure so the term the phrase the original set of the internet i it's from um this fireside chat that took place a couple of years ago between mark andreessen and katie hahn who are two of the general partners at a16z i think they were talking at one of their crypto regulatory summits about crypto and the future of the internet and mark was talking about his experience building netscape in the early days of the internet and he calls [Music] the fact that browsers did not incorporate payments natively into the browser he calls this the original sin of the internet um and he said that this they tried to do this but conversations with banks and credit card companies didn't go anywhere and so they sort of gave up on embedding payments directly into the browser um and this is the original sin he says because it's created all of these downstream problems that we have today that stem from the fact that advertising then became the prevalent business model online because it didn't require payments um and and because of advertising you have issues around privacy and data collection and uh the misalignment of incentives between all of these content platforms and what users actually want to see um and and so uh the way that he frames it is it it stems really from the fact that the internet didn't have this native ability to transfer value and i think it was a really interesting conversation uh and he goes into a few implications for you know what could have happened otherwise if payments had been built into the browser he talks about how there might have been this parallel transaction system outside of the hands of a few centralized gatekeepers he talks about how it would have been you could have had aligned incentives between the platforms and their users and then he also talks about how maybe the internet economy would actually be much bigger if there had been this direct payments model instead of just advertising and i think um when i when i probe into all of these points through the lens of the creator economy i do think that things would have turned out really differently had there been payments from day one because essentially like the trajectory that we took with the creator economy wherein um as you recall like in phase two of the crater economy everyone was basically acting as a conduit to sell other types of products and to show other brands and help other companies advertise their their wares like i think that really skewed um a lot of the incentives of content creators themselves they had to grow their audience to be as big as possible so that they could actually monetize to a larger extent they had to make their content really aspirational and make people feel like they were lacking something in order to drum up the desire to purchase um and yeah they had to go for reach and skill and in order to get that you kind of have to create kind of like vanilla surface level mass appeal content versus niche in-depth like passion driven content um and i think you see that across the internet where it's it's impacted the incentives of these content creators and as we know incentives drive everything and so you have social networks that are full of content that is really mass surface level shallow aspirational it results in people feeling bad about their lives and what they have and a lack of real expert driven or passion driven type of content creation i find this part of the conversation fascinating because it's an interesting thought experiment to go back towards the dawn of the internet and talk about if we had only included payments natively in the browser what could have been what what utopia did we accidentally miss by not uh in integrating that that in in the early days of the internet but i'm wondering if we might actually accidentally be being naive about uh other problems we might have also missed because if we had incorporated native payments into the browser i'm not technical enough to understand how this might have worked but my um a worry that i have is that if we had just done that well then we might have actually set up up um intermediaries payment intermediaries that we actually couldn't really predict today because it didn't happen and so i'm my my question to you is um is the native payment of the internet is that have could that have even been possible without crypto or is crypto really the secret sauce that unlocks the truly native internet payment means that actually does allow the creator economy to fully unpack and so do you think that we actually did as a society accidentally miss a grand utopia or do you think really it needed to be crypto at the end of the day regardless yeah it's really hard to explore the counter factuals since they never actually happened but there were i mean there were definitely a number of attempts to um facilitate transactions over the internet there was a protocol um that a bunch of different companies and browser companies were also working on called set set protocols secure electronic transaction um which was this protocol for securing credit or debit card payments over the internet and they needed to partner with a whole bunch of stakeholders like merchants issuing banks credit card companies all the browsers etc and so they never really got any traction um but regardless of that like i think hypothetically i'm not entirely sure if we could have bypassed the web 2 internet if we had just only built in payments into the browser i think that is perhaps a little bit unrealistic and the reason why i say that is if we look at the state of the internet today it is much easier to accept payments on the internet like any sort of publisher or content creator or person who sets up any website can much more easily accept payments now credit card penetration is also really high in the us so let's just say like it is actually very easy now to facilitate transactions online and yet we still have all the problems of the internet that we're facing now we still have all these like walled garden platforms that control a bunch of user data that we can't pour out of um we still have content creators who are going for scale and reach and so i think like the the the internet evolved in the way that it did for a number of different reasons not just the business model i think like it needed to be aggregated because it was a huge wild west of all of this type of content as mentioned like and creators were craving aggregation so i think the aggregators needed to emerge whether like the aggregators whether a different monetization model for the aggregators would have changed the type of content that they surfaced or changed the way that they built their algorithms i think that is a possibility but i still think we would have had the centralized businesses that emerged during the last decade because frankly that was what consumer behavior gratitude gravitated to and so could we have just leapfrog from internet 1.0 to web3 um i think that's a little bit naive yeah it's it's definitely hard to know and to go back counter factually is is almost impossible they were in the early days there were a ton of benefits to i i guess this uh this economy that we created including onboarding so many people at uh very low costs and distributing it to a wide audience we often talk about kind of uh the aggregators as sort of the you know the the evil ones and i think that that that story has been told many times on bankless but i'm super curious about what uh what you just were talking about with the creators that have arisen in in this in this type of internet era um you know that quote uh show me the incentive and i'll show you the outcome right and it strikes me at craters today it's very much it's mass produced right it's like they're all competing for these little bits of attention that people find in the internet and so we get mass-produced somewhat shallow creators all competing for attention this is kind of a perverse incentive system in that it's not necessarily the the best or the smartest uh content that gets rewarded it's kind of the lowest common denominator type content my favorite example is like you ever see and p uh people who uh like crypto shows will see you ever see your favorite crypto youtuber and like the goofy faces they make in thumbnails it's always like this like like like like this like let's do that i'm screen capping that well we will now for this one so it's like it's that's perfect example and why do they do it it's because the system the algorithm in place is incented towards you know attention right and so they have to make this goofy surprised face in order to get uh clicks the other outcome of this too is like creators don't really own anything it's the aggregators that own everything and so like uh bankless youtube channel like we don't own it um youtube could to platform us at any time like we don't own our twitter presence we can't export that file there's all sorts of weird things outcomes that have come as a result of this and that's why i want to get to like the second piece of what you wrote because i think what you are talking about is a transition that is happening in the creator economy and to the fabric of the internet from this business model that is solely based on attention this attention economy that we have right now to something that we were talking about earlier which is the ownership economy and the ownership is not just for creators that's a piece of it but it also strikes me it's for community members and you outlined four different ways we get from the attention economy to the ownership economy i'm wondering if we could go through these four right now lee does that sound good yeah that sounds good to me i'm gonna so uh throw these out there and kind of list them and then we'll strike them off one by one so the first way we get from the attention economy to the ownership economy you talk about the introduction of digital scarcity all right digital scarcity it's like nfts as an example of that that's number one the second is uh patronage so that's supporting creators actually becoming an investment and not just this act of altruism patronage plus is patronage plus okay justice yeah and we'll get into what that means the third is new economic models these are programmatic programmable economic models and the fourth is this idea of dows and community ownership so one two three and four we'll go through them all let's let's start with that first one okay and this is where maybe crypto enters the story a bit more the introduction of digital scarcity how does that take us from the attention economy to the ownership economy lee right so up till when the blockchain was introduced and crypto there was no scarcity uh in terms of digital content like everything could be reproduced there was no concept of the original or the canonical version of a piece of digital content and that really undermines the ability for creators to be able to sell things sell digital goods and content if there is no scarcity if everything can be reproduced this is why we got um a ton of pirating in the early internet days when uh you know people were just trying to transpose the offline monetization model to online and sell like cds on the internet or movies on the internet like that the marginal cost of reproducing that is zero and people could just therefore pirate it copy and paste it and download it to their own computers and so the the fact that the blockchain enables um there to be scarcity dynamics introduced to the internet is really powerful for creators because all of a sudden that means you shift from selling this fake version of scarcity there's a lot of like faux scarcity products i i bucket them as faux scarcity because they're trying to like create scarcity but like the forces of the internet are just trying to undermine that so like a faux scarcity model would be [Music] pay world content or creating um or they would proxy for scarcity with their time they would sell their time i.e through consulting offering one-on-one consulting or doing personalized cameo videos or something like that because because time is the only scarce thing that you have to sell on the internet um and so we move from that world where they are very limited in terms of how they can monetize to being able to sell scarce digital goods or nfts and tokens social tokens and so when you have scarcity that introduces supplier power in this case the suppliers are the creators and so they're able to monetize um through this new economy of scarce goods in a way that was never possible before and um this you know ties into a piece that i wrote a couple of years ago around the 100 true fans thesis and how you could make a living off of far fewer fans than you needed to before if you could manage to monetize them to a greater extent there's a few things to unpack there i want to come back to the 100 true fans thesis and your idea there but before we do so you use this term faux scarcity okay and this is what some critics think nfts really are it's like right click saveable foe scarce things but you're saying that nfts and actually like the digital properties of nfts are actually the thing that's real scarcity on the internet uh how can you make that claim like how do you defend against people who are like that's also faux scarcity i mean anybody can mint an nft and i can right click save what uh what's what's your feedback there well i think this is it gets quite philosophical in terms of what's real and what's not i think real is in this case we're talking about things around which there's social consensus and so for nfts there is a digital record of ownership on chain that everyone can agree is the canonical version of that piece of content whereas faux scarcity is i think a world in which there is no social consensus around which version is the original or edition number one two three etcetera and instead people are trying to proxy for scarcity by imposing yeah paywalls that you hit upon and have to unlock with a credit card or um saying that there's only going to be 100 versions of this sold for an e-book or whatever but you know in reality they could generate many more and there wouldn't be a way to tell whether yours was one of the original i think this uh same energy comes out of bitcoiners who are very proud about how easy it is to audit the bitcoin supply that's one of the features of the bitcoin blockchain is it's super easy to run your own node and it's super easy to audit who owns what bitcoins and that same energy can apply be applied to nfts um the nature of an nft when it's minted on ethereum or any other smart contract blockchain comes with a very very specific address that cannot be duplicated or replicated or faked uh and and so then uh lee it's going to what you're saying where there is some sort of social agreement as to what is the real nft but as soon as that social agreement happens it's extremely easy to verify which is the real nft because if i i have a crypto punk on my wall and i can absolutely verify with complete ease that i own the real crypto punk to that even though somebody could take that same jpeg minted brand new nft and have a same nft of a new jpeg but i have the real one because it's as simple as copying and pasting a string of letters into you know something like ether scan and verifying it and so that's something that could not have been brought about before crypto just the ease of verifying the true ownership and so sure while there is plenty of faux scarcity with nfts we can spin up new uh infinite new numbers of nfts that doesn't dilute just like how we can fork bitcoin 10 000 times that doesn't actually dilute the value of actual bitcoin just wanted to add that color in there would you add anything yeah i i agree with that completely and and the reason why you're like canonical crypto punk or whatever has value is because people acknowledge that it is the real version they can inspect you know ether scan and see that this was minted by the original creator or whatever and there's consensus around that um and that just had never before existed prior to crypto um there was no consensus over which version was real like if you downloaded from itunes was this the real one or did you pirate it off of you know some torrenting service or whatever another way that i um i'm starting to describe this as using the analogy from economics is crypto introduces a digital goods economy when there had historically only existed a digital services economy so in the real world we have both goods and services that go into the entire gdp um over time over the decades america has shifted to more of a services economy wherein more people are employed in services versus goods manufacturing but goods still represent a huge portion of gdp something like 40 and the distinction that economists place between what is a good versus what is a service is that a good is something that is tangible that you can return you can exchange you can resell to other people you have property rights with goods versus that's not the case with services and so moving that to the internet um version so historically uh i think a lot of a lot of internet based businesses and creators have had to monetize things as services when they would actually be more naturally monetized as goods but because there were no property rights they had to actually create a service around it so an example of this would be software as a service instead of selling software as a license it moved to the sas model because that was actually the like the more feasible monetization model same with all types of content like we've all shifted towards streaming content versus buying content and downloading it because there are no digital property rights prior to crypto and so historically it's been really challenging for there to be a digital goods economy it's primarily things as a service and like content as a service movies as a service music as a service streaming and what's exciting is now there can be a digital guts economy because there are now digital property rights and so the implication of that if we go back to the real world is that there can be that can be the basis of entirely new types of jobs and income that hadn't existed before online and i think the topic of digital scarcity internet native digital scarcity just leads right into what we were hinting at earlier with patronage plus because i think you need digital scarcity in order to have that plus side of patronus plus can you elaborate on patronage plus and how digital scarcity is involved absolutely so everyone's familiar with the idea of patronage it's existed for as long as there have been artists like it's really just the concept of you want to support someone you feel affinity for this person um you want to contribute and financially support them um and this has been a model online for a while in the creator economy there's tipping you can go to any sort of live streaming app there's digital gifts that you can buy them or you can subscribe to someone's patreon and support them but the underlying motivation has always been altruism fans don't really get all that much in return for tipping someone besides maybe a shout out or they get to unlock some extra piece of content but really i think the primary motivation behind patronage is um a softer type of motivation it's altruism it's the desire for status it's the ability to say like i you know really care about this person and i'm a better fan than you um but the plus in patronage plus really refers to the fact that there is a tangible benefit to the fan from supporting the creator and that takes the form of a financial benefit potentially if the thing that the fan decides to purchase let's say an nft appreciates in price and the fan is able to benefit from that price appreciation so you go from this world in which the motivation for supporting a creator economically goes from altruism to this actually like self-beneficial rationale and i think when you move um from one motivation and introduce this new motivation it actually dramatically increases the potential number of people in the world who would actually support creators not that many people are willing to just donate out of altruistic purposes but everyone is interested in making more money or mostly everyone in the world is interested in making more money it's funny think of that as like a scalability technology right it's kind of the difference between like if there were only non-profits versus you know the corporation right nonprofits can scale but they have some limitations and a corporation i mean our world is composed of all sorts of for-profit capital formations right it's kind of the difference between non-profit and something that is for-profit yes exactly i want to take this opportunity to jump down a quick rabbit hole here because when you're talking about uh you like fans get to purchase an nft or maybe some sort of token that loosely resembles some sort of vehicle for upside this is when we get into the conversation of right sec regulations and this is the conversation i think that we're currently having in the crypto space with our frustration at some of the securities regulations not just in the united states but also abroad where some sort of creator just being doing their creative stuff expressing their creativity issues some sort of token and then that might just accidentally be a security because it has the potential of upside in it um lee can you kind of just unpack the difficulties of really unleashing the full potential of the creator economy and the securities regulations that hinder it so i would definitely say that i'm not a securities law expert um so my understanding is today in the offline world a lot of the creative work that people do treat as investments are not actually regulated as securities so things that we would buy like collectibles or merch at a concert or even paintings those are not securities i think where it does start to come into question is when people are expecting to receive a portion of revenues on maybe like an ongoing basis or they're marketed in terms of you can expect a return in the future um and in that case uh i think it potentially could get classified as a security um which would mean that you know investors who purchased these things would have to be accredited um or they have to be registered with the sec and i think that would just be um yeah tremendously challenging for the entire space and limit participation to a very small tam of consumers um so i'm i'm really like of the camp that i think we should increase opportunities for as many people as possible to build wealth and to um participate in the ownership of assets that will appreciate and value that is the whole um reason for the ownership economy thesis and so i i really hope that we can still treat all of these content creator products these digital the digital content as akin to merch or collectibles we teased this a little bit um but why don't why don't we dive into it in the topic of patronage plus still so um there's this idea that all you need is a thousand true fans uh to kind of you know spin up a business or or kind of become a become a creator uh but you have a thesis that maybe you need far fewer than that maybe an order of magnitude less so maybe a hundred true fans can you explain that concept and how that relates to patronage plus absolutely so my piece called 100 true fans was published i think in 2019 or so very much inspired by reading kevin kelly's original a thousand true fans post which he published almost i think more than ten years ago um so kevin kelly's piece he he was a wired editor and he was writing this i think in 2009 about how the internet is going to be really great for content creators because it means that you don't need to be a mass famous celebrity you actually just need a thousand true fans in order to make a living because he was doing some back of the envelope math if you could get a thousand fans who pay you ten dollars per month and cut out the middleman which the internet enables you to do then you can actually make a full-time living just being a creator with that small fan base and i really loved that idea and i took it a step further in order of magnitude further and said actually all you need is 100 true fans because if you can have 100 people say paying you a thousand dollars per year um then you can make a full-time living off of that and earn you know a hundred thousand dollars and the recipe to do this i outlined was um comprised of giving fans more than than just appealing to their altruism it really needed to be about fan benefit rather than creator benefit and so creators needed to give them content or community that they were unable to find elsewhere um appeal to fans desire for status and feeling special um like fans were willing to pay those kinds of amounts for results or transformation like there were all these different components that i listed out of the 100 true fans playbook but at the time nfts had not really taken off and so i put this thesis out there and when nfts took off i i was like oh my god this is this is what enables a hundred true fans for many many more creators because the powerful thing about what's possible with nfts is that um you can basically like segment all of your fan base fans are very heterogeneous like when we look at our follower number i think that number is actually quite meaningless and instead we should think of them as fan segments where you have the super fans the casual fans and then the i forgot what i called it like it's like active fan and then passive fan um and there's going to be a segment of people who are willing to pay a lot who are willing to really pay anything and are really price insensitive as long as it gets them a closer relationship with this person that they have a ton of affinity for and so nfps enable that kind of price discrimination and being able to charge up to the fans full willingness to pay and therefore enables much more powerful monetization of super fans so there's a number of dynamics in the web 2 world that i think really get in the way of that 100 true fans model i think the most obvious one that comes to mind is that spotify for example treats all streams by all users equally and so you know one stream um from one person is going to net some artist uh one tenth of a penny and the spotify doesn't differentiate between a casual fan that is just listening to a song via spotify radio versus a hardcore fan that only listens to the same band day in day out and is willing to die for that that band that they really really love spotify doesn't enable any sort of segregation with this sort of behavior uh and so what you're saying is that in this whole patrons plus model we actually have ways of allowing fans to express a 1 000 a year or ten thousand dollar a year interest in a specific creator and allow that that one particular fan to differentiate themselves from somebody that is just randomly stumbling stumbling upon uh another artist through like you know a radio mix or some sort of you know random curation algorithm that we see all the way throughout web 2. uh am i on to something here yeah i think you hit the nail on the head the way that i usually describe it is like fans are very heterogeneous and they all have like different willingnesses to pay you can like maybe plot it out and sort of envision there's like spikes in the curve of how much they're willing to pay for something and existing web 2 business models that are advertising based or i guess even subscription-based business models that basically just charge a flat price what they do is they flatten that entire variation and so instead of charging everyone up to their full willingness to pay instead everyone is monetized the same as each other um every eyeball is fungible every play is fungible and what you have as a result of that is the inability to charge these super fans but also on the superfan side the inability to express your fandom in a way that would distinguish you from other people out there so it's not only leaving money on the table from the behalf of the of the creator but it's also leaving creativity um on the table as well the creator could have created more had they had a more viable monetization path than just whatever spotify does which is you know using the least common denominator of what people will pay yeah exactly uh the example an example that comes to mind which i think really paints the picture for this is um a company that i invested in or we invested in a variant called sound which is a music nft platform um when i checked with them a while ago they had just launched and they had done seven drops so far with pretty small indie artists honestly and they had all sold out immediately in under a minute um and the revenue that each of like that these seven artists collectively generated was equivalent to the streaming revenue that would have been earned if they had gotten 21 million streams 21 million streams for seven artists is like mega famous level that was not the case for the initial artist that launched on sound um but because they were selling nfts and this you know was denominated in eth and the sale prices were relatively um high or yeah i think it was like a a collectibles level of um price point um as a result of that like they didn't need to be super famous in order to be able to monetize effectively and not only that the example you just gave is that the the artist actually gets to know who those fans are especially when we talk about using this through a crypto platform where you can go look at the address that holds your nft whereas spotify you don't get the email addresses of your listeners you just it's a black box but with nfts and with you know traceable uh transparent blockchains you actually as an artist have a direct connection towards who the hell is it paying you ten thousand dollars for your song or whatever uh and so that identity aspect is i think also very very empowering towards the creators yeah that's definitely true i think there's a lot of potential there we still obviously lack a lot of the infrastructure to make use of that sure identity in terms of being able to message and reach out to them and tie it to uh you know their public profiles that might be out there but i agree that there is a lot of potential there if you're going bankless you

the same time [Music] leverage your wealth without the risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself [Music] what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp are you winning some okay so this is such an interesting conversation because what we're actually talking about here is ripping out the the guts the business model the internet and replacing it with an entirely new engine and when people uh hear the example that you gave of sound and these these artists selling you some of them will dismiss and say oh that's just like the nft bubble or they got lucky or something like this but i think uh what what we're doing right here lean the way you've laid it out is it's like very methodical like you can see exactly how we're going to cross this chasm from the attention economy to the ownership economy and we've only gone down i guess two of the trigger points right so the first is just by way of recap we've got this new digital good product so crypto invented digital goods and we can now sell them on the internet the second with patronage plus is all supporting people who are supporting creators they actually become investors so your fans become investors that's the second now let's get to the third so this is new programmable economic models that sounds like a bit of a mouthful but tell us what you mean by that how is this going to transition us from the attention economy to the ownership economy right so this this third point gets to be a little bit more future facing and i would say it doesn't quite yet exist but we're i think we'll get there and i think a lot of people are building in this direction so what i meant by new programmable business models is um essentially like today a lot of content creation is collaborative all sort of content that we create draws upon past information sources or inspirations that have led us to create the thing that we're creating and yet none of that revenue is flowing back to all of the sources of inspiration all the people who perhaps contributed to a piece of work and so you can imagine that eventually in in the future once um more of our content creation moves on chain and all work becomes tokenized that people can draw on this universal content library to mix and match and remix in order to put together whatever they're putting together and by attributing it back to this universal content library perhaps all of those different um contributors to that piece of content could also be economically rewarded for their contributions so you're starting to see um i think this is like a pretty futuristic idea that a few writers have have talked about you're starting to see i think like hints of this being implemented when you look at the splits feature on a few different nft platforms so an example of this is like on mirror uh writers are actually splitting the revenue that they get automated in an automated way between really like any one of their choosing but usually people who collaborated to piece or proofread it or edited it or whatever and then i think on foundation as well as a creator you can split the revenue that you earn from nfts as well as secondary sales with other addresses and so the vision that i was really laying out here is this world in which everyone becomes linked both in terms of content creation um as well as the economic reward for how they're being compensated for that that's fascinating shared reward so in with the mir with the mere platform for example if we you myself and david we co-authored a piece together right and we we listed that and somebody bought it for you know say three eth and we were all you know splitting into third or third a third we'd all receive the proceeds from that and that's something that's the the the um the ability to partake and share in some of the upside of these digital product products in new economic ways and probably to program them in all sorts of interesting ways in d5 is just super nascent that hasn't fully been tapped into yet yeah i agree and i i think this is this is really powerful because this behavior has been or this kind of like splitting of revenue and um taking the value that you get and giving a portion of that to all of the influences and contributors this has been a pain point in the web 2 internet for a while um i hear from youtube creators that it's challenging to you know sit down every month calculate like their adsense revenue on a video and calculate like how much should be split to every single person who collaborated with them on that video and that just compounds over time because you're earning revenue on a continuous basis and yet the platform really treats it as like a one channel one creator one revenue account model um and then there's definitely like a huge trust component to trusting that the person who has the login credentials to that channel and that adsense account is going to actually properly split it with you and represent accurately like what they earned um and so yeah i think there's there's lots of issues around um revenue sharing and attribution today that i'm hopeful blockchain can be part of the solution for okay let's talk about the fourth one and i think we sort of alluded to this when we were talking about some creators starting to co-create with their communities with their fan base and the fourth one is dowse and community ownership so talk about that how's that going to usher us into the uh ownership economy from the detention economy right so this is really the the future of the creator economy as i mentioned is the community economy it's this world in which we shift from creators creating content at their fans or for their fans to a world in which they're co-creating with each other and everyone is driving value back to the community in some way that could be you know commenting on their posts retweeting things amplifying their content leading uh like marketing efforts or or whatever it might be i think everyone in a creator's community is actually driving value in some way but they're just not getting compensated for that work and so this fourth point was really around um moving to this community ownership model in which everyone becomes part owner of the community that they're in and their membership state can be tokenized and represented on chain we're seeing this with daos where every member of a dao is actually part owner of the dao itself and stands to benefit from all of the revenue and the value that they create i think creators are going to implement this model with their fans and with each other and drive value back to this community treasury and share it with all the people who created value for them that's fascinating are you seeing any examples of this like uh you know our story around the banquet style has been somewhat of an example where um you know we um we just sort of you know seeded this idea of some people in the bankless community kind of starting a dow and now they're off and dave and i barely participate right we're not active uh participants in terms of the day-to-day governance but with this this vision of like let's go make the world bankless now this dow has spun up which originated as you know fans of the bankless podcast and the newsletter and they're creating all sorts of things like their own podcasts um their own like uh educational centers there's like a bankless university spinning up and the community is doing this completely on their own and it provides david and i a way to kind of scale the bankless movement and start the vision and let the community take it away so we've certainly seen that are there other examples that you can point to around communities co-creating with their fans that you like yeah absolutely um so yeah i think bank list out is actually a really great example of this kind of community driven content creation model i think there's other experiments that are running that are really fascinating kyle shaika who is a i think new yorker writer started a publication about nfts and he crowdfunded that by selling nfts and airdrop tokens back to those crowdfunders and the idea is that the crowdfunders would then have a stake in the publication and have an incentive to help with content creation or amplification of what gets published um i think even something like um nouns dao could be thought of as a creator community ownership sort of organization wherein all of the values being driven back to this community treasury everyone who has bought husband is able to determine what that treasury is going to be used for they could use it on different initiatives to support the ecosystem to publicize the work that they're doing etc and then i would also point to this musician who recently um has done a lot of really successful nft drops his name is daniel allen um he is a really active um participant in the web 3 community he's a music artist um i think a couple of things to note about him he raised a crowdfund on mirror a few months ago in which he raised um something like over a hundred thousand dollars in eth through selling nfts the plan is to then airdrop tokens to all of those nft holders he's also done a lot of music nft drops in in recent weeks and so all those people are going to also have tokens representing their membership stake in this dow and then going forward you can imagine that everyone who has ownership in his community is going to be that much more incentivized to contribute to his success potentially create content themselves and rise up as creators in that community so i think we're we're really early days but um i think this like community driven model is what i see as the future because otherwise we are recreating this world in which creators are essentially the new platforms and fans are the people who are creating value but not benefiting from their contributions and instead i think the the realistic state of the world is that everyone is contributing in their own ways to the success of all the projects they're involved in and all the projects that they patronize and they should have ownership in that i want to integrate all of these different components that we've been talking about in this new creator economy web 3 world we have significantly lower barriers towards creating with coming with increasing financial rewards to creating and we also have a changing creative process where it's not it's no longer just the creator towards the fan but it's a it's a uh bi conversation where uh the creator creates something the fans uh then also create and respond to that and then it's a it's an iterative conversation of creation between the creator and the fans so when we when you put this all together what what comes out of this what is the resulting impact upon society are we getting a boom of art and creativity is this the road map for a brand new renaissance of human creativity what is the what is the long-term impact of all of these new paradigm shifts that are seemingly all happening at once i'm really optimistic about the future of the creator economy i i titled the blog post the web 3 renaissance so clearly i i think that we're due for this period in which um many more creators can flourish and make a living and many more fans can also benefit from the contributions that they're making so i think we go from um the state of the world that we're in today where in there's about 50 million creators in total and the entire market size of the crater economy is estimated to be something like 100 billion dollars to a world in which everyone is earning some income and ownership through their contributions to the internet so everyone becomes a part creator like i think literally every single person um who uses the internet is a creator in their own unique ways i think what changes in the future is that they're able to financially benefit from that so i i very much see um like yeah another renaissance on the horizon that will be enabled from that i think um people might think that i'm quite optimistic and maybe too optimistic or utopian but i really do think all the foundational elements are there and it's really up to us and all of the builders in the ecosystem to make that vision a reality this is not the first time that a guest on bankless has predicted a renaissance one of our general community's favorite uh previous episodes is episode 63 the crypto renaissance and uh historian josh rosenthal takes us through the argument about how uh the cr with the technologies that are specifically enabling enabling crypto are the same iterative iterations of technologies that enable the original renaissance so taking it taking it on uh taking it for granted that a renaissance does actually come do you have an opinion as to the magnitude of such a renaissance in comparison to the last one that happened in the 1400s are we thinking smaller than that one equal to that one greater than that one it's a ridiculous question but i want to ask it anyways well actually i think this is the third renaissance people often talk about the new deal as the second renaissance the new deal in the post-depression yeah exactly in the u.s um that has been informally dubbed as the second renaissance because that was a period in which uh the government essentially paid the salaries of a bunch of artists and creators to go out there and create art for the public or create documentaries and write books etc so sometimes that is described as the second renaissance so if the if that is the second renaissance then we're headed for a third and i think it's going to be bigger than the prior two combined because this is now reaching internet scale this is happening online versus the prior two internets were bounded to irl they were scoped geographically they had geographical boundaries very few people could actually participate in terms of patronizing artists in the first one and then in the second one it was like you know tax revenue being fed into supporting artists um as part of like a government plan and now i think we're moving into with this third renaissance the difference is that everyone is able to participate as both a content creator as well as a patron patron plus um and so like i think it'll truly be internet scale a renaissance at the scale of the internet is something to be optimistically bullish on if ever i've heard it no one's ever accused us david of not being optimistically bullish though so that's how every bankless podcast goes um lee now that we've kind of uncovered your mental model for the creator economy and the ownership economy i'm wondering if you could uh you take us through some implications here maybe in in some of your uh recent tweets that that we picked out and we really liked um the first is a a something you tweeted the passion economy is the what the ownership economy is the how what do you mean by that yes so the passion economy thesis which i spearheaded when i was working at a16z a few years ago and started writing about a few years ago is this idea that new platforms and tools could help people to earn an income from their individuality the idea was monetizing individuality by leveraging their creative skills or their non-commoditized knowledge um and packaging that into different products and services that you could sell online um what i meant by this tweet the passion economy is the what the ownership economy is the how is that i think the ultimate vision for for me and for a lot of folks in the space is we still very much want to realize a world in which people are able to do what they love for a living and achieve financial stability through doing that um but the how of how we accomplish that is rather than just giving people income in bits and pieces here and there um from these platforms that they're contributing to instead they become the owners of the underlying internet products and services so i think by giving people ownership that really turbo charges how financially empowered they are and so the ownership economy is the how of how we actually realize the vision of the passion economy you also said this the biggest opportunity of our time is to reconfigure the relationship between capital and labor to reconfigure the relationship between capital and labor what do you mean by that and how does that relate to our discussion that was quite a controversial one yeah um so what i meant by that is um [Music] so economists divide up the um the share of national income into income that is derived from labor i.e working like wages salaries tips whatever versus income that is earned from capital i.e things that you own that earn a return for you this could be factories or real estate um whatever it might be capital income and the trend over time in developed economies has been that the capital share of income is growing and the the labor share of income is shrinking and what that means is that people who have existing resources existing capital are just getting wealthier and earning more versus the people who are working for their living and so the implication of that is exacerbated income inequality because that means if if you have more to start with you'll actually be able to outpace and earn more than the people who are just working with their time for wages and so what i meant by this tweet the biggest opportunity of our time is to reconfigure the relationship between capital and labor is i think that that dynamic is just fundamentally broken a world in which what people have is a bigger contributor to their wealth than what they have to actually contribute with their energy and effort um i think that forebodes really badly for our society and just puts us on a path to even more extreme income inequality and income inequality that'll be exacerbated through multiple generations too um and so what i hope to see is that we basically make them one and the same people who are contributing labor are able to earn capital through that effort through that work um and so people it becomes indistinguishable uh that relationship between labor and capital and i think that is the vision of crypto by the way is that people can not just buy ownership of potentially valuable assets with their money that they can actually earn them by participating in these new projects and networks why was this controversially uh because any time you talk about capital and labor um those two words have actually become quite touchy in society yes so i mean marx wrote a lot about the relationship between capital and labor and how capital owners um and and laborers were stuck in this perennial struggle um this power struggle where capital owners people who like own factories and all of the means of production they could exert that ownership and get laborers to essentially bend to their will and to work on their terms because the laborers only had their labor to sell they didn't they couldn't make the end product on their own and so this idea of class struggle between capital and labor and like his prediction was that ultimately like labor was going to overthrow capital um and we were going to have this classless society i think the words capital and labor are just kind of like hot-button words now because a lot of people assume that i'm talking about like class struggle and class warfare and abolishing capital period um but instead i think what i'm describing is something that is net new and hasn't been possible before there's a frequent conversation in the crypto space about whether or not crypto fixes wealth inequality wealth inequality being perhaps the biggest problem of uh our current time um at least definitely up there in the top three or so i'd say uh and this the answer to this question definitely should be nuanced um crypto does not solve the current state of wealth inequality at least in my opinion uh there's we are not redistributing wealth uh there's nothing about bitcoin or nothing about the spinning up new l1 that fix wealth inequality old capital can just buy the new capital and retain their capital but i think how crypto does solve quote unquote solve wealth inequality is that it generates platforms that are balanced that don't tilt towards what you are talking about where capital begets more capital faster than labor but gets more capital and i think one of the reasons why people like you and me are are so about crypto is that it actually starts to really blur the lines between what labor and capital actually are and so we are actually starting to integrate these things and so while we cannot which crypto is not going to have some sort of jubilee where the ledgers are wiped clean and wealth is redistributed it's still it's not going to fix the current levels of wealth distribution it can prevent them from getting any worse and maybe if you're even more optimistic than that it can actually start to re-orient and rebalance the distribution the discrepancy between labor and capital do you have any thoughts on that i have many many thoughts i mean i this is a big part of the reason why i became a full-time crypto investor before before um before october of last year i had sort of been investing both in web 2 and web 3 businesses and sort of straddling both worlds and i made the decision to go full-time crypto because i felt like this technology evolution presented the biggest opportunity in my lifetime to help address income inequality and so i wanted to bet my career in this direction because i was frustrated by frankly by the platforms and services that were being created in web 2 that to me represented kind of incremental band-aid solutions on the current problem like on the margins they were helping creators become slightly more empowered or you know export a portion of their fans to an email list or whatever but it was very marginal and i wanted to harness a much more powerful toolset for this mission um so what drew me originally to crypto was this potential to create more fairness in the world and to mitigate um to mitigate income inequality and so to to go back to uh your question around like does crypto solve income inequality i i agree it's a really complicated question and i think the answer is really up to us to shape the devil is in the details in terms of how we actually implement these token distributions and how we design all these networks um it's up to founders to decide how much of their token networks go to the community versus goes to investors and the team it's up to founders to decide whether their token supplies inflate over time and create the potential for newcomers to benefit um versus tilting it towards the early adopters and so i think a lot of this is within our control that's the wonderful thing but i think for the first time ever we have this new and powerful tool set to actually yeah reconfigure the relationship between labor and capital that's incredible if we could pull that one off um you know this crypto certainly gives surface area to to form our people and provide surface area to far more opportunities uh and maybe this is um kind of the the last tweet we we brought in that that kind of links to what you're just saying lee which is if you are a creator first company you tweeted this your cap table should reflect that seems like that's kind of what you're saying if you're really a creator first company then creators should own part of your equity part of your capital is that what you're saying precisely precisely basically if if you're a founder and you're beating the drum of creator empowerment and being creator first the number one most powerful way to do that is through giving creators ownership and ownership decomposes into both economic rights as well as governance rights but at the end of the day giving ownership over to creators is the most impactful way to actually enable and empower creators and it's interesting that in this tweet i said your calf table should reflect that i've now obviously pivoted my focus to token tables and i i think this also applies if you replace cap table with token table i think the challenge with calf tables is that they're heavily regulated um as under the current legal framework and a lot of founders were kind of um really limited in terms of what they could actually do with their equity and how many people could own their equity and how many creators on their platforms they could actually distribute that to and so i think tokens are this more powerful tool through which to actually um distribute ownership to many many people it is funny and sad how uh regulation can act actually exacerbate uh wealth inequality very very much what we're seeing with the credit investor laws and you know another topic for another day but this is maybe my my favorite part of the conversation where we get to turn a little bit of the theory into practice uh and talk about what someone the average person listening to this can actually do with this information to better their lives and to put themselves in the in the flow of this new trend this ownership economy creator economy trend and it strikes me that right now crypto has too many speculators maybe like we we have too many speculators in proportion to the amount of creators and entrepreneurs that we have and i think there are massive opportunities for creators and entrepreneurs in the future that are completely left untapped at this point in time right so we've talked enough in crypto circles about all the opportunities for speculators but i love how this conversation really positions uh the value proposition towards somebody who's trying to create something new and earn income from their community somebody who has a who has a community and can create a fantastic community and some of these digital projects uh products so let's talk about this and get actionable what is your recommendation for someone who wants to plug into the creator economy or the ownership economy today what sorts of things should they do in order to find themselves at the at the center of this renaissance rather than at the fringes or kind of out in the cold there are so many different ways to participate it's almost like too many ideas to list but i'll just bucket them and and quickly suggest a few options so i think for anyone who finds themselves with a special skill or creative talent my number one answer is to actually try and participate in the ecosystem as a creator to try one's hand at being a creator this is what i did when i started be being an investor in the ecosystem is i actually started creating content on the internet and if you know even if you're not that successful as a creator it definitely helps to cultivate a lot of empathy with other creators out there so that brings me to my second point which is to engage in the ecosystem by supporting creators and supporting creators can take a lot of different forms it can be financial support like buy stuff from creators buy their nfts um buy their tokens like join their discords join their dows but if you know if someone is financially limited i think there's other ways to show support as well you can use your social capital to help amplify their work and help them get recognition and there's also ways to help educate and bring more creators into the web3 ecosystem i actually think this is a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to get involved in the creator economy is to learn about different crypto platforms and projects and help actually walk creators through the process of getting started there and so and then i would say lastly is to either build a creator-focused company or to support them as an investor or a user there's so many amazing projects that are getting started today all across the creator economy and ownership economy there's new music nft platforms new visual nft platforms new tooling platforms that help creators to give their social tokens more utility and so you could work for those companies help contribute to them or help start something new that you don't see out there the a lot of people come into this industry and they take one look at it and they say well i can't code so there's nothing i can do what would you say to these people uh i would say to those people that there are a lot more jobs that are in demand in web 3 outside of coding and recently i published a tweet storm about this topic this exact topic um the first tweet was like seven steps to get into web3 for non-technical people and so there's a number of really sought after skills just to list a few of them one is community building i think every single one of my portfolio companies is hiring for a skilled community manager someone who's able to manage socials connect different people in the ecosystem drum up excitement this is like a really like in-demand scarce there's there's very little great candidates who um are in the ecosystem and everyone is hungry hungry to hire for this position um i think people are also really hungry for uh folks to engage in governance to propose like new governance proposals to engage in the forums to drive some of these protocols and projects forward i think there's also a new job that hadn't existed before in the form of working on tokenomics a lot of these projects are still in their early days in terms of running the progressive decentralization playbook and are looking for guidance and support in terms of determining who gets the airdrop and like what's the criteria for that and how to design their tokenomics so that is definitely an opening and then um i would just also say that like all of the other like you know traditional non-technical roles that had existed startups still exist in web3 so design project management like being the glue person in some of these communities like just managing like follow-ups and getting everyone to move forward and agree on a set of action items that is so valuable um product management like a ton of web 3 projects are now looking for mass adoption and to reach like normal consumers and so usability and design really matters and so skilled web 2 product managers are really in demand so anyways there's a huge gamut of different um jobs out there for people who want to help build the creator economy in web3 we started off this podcast with this very prescient quote from bill gates saying content is king uh and i would just like to double down on that because no matter how awesome web 3 is you need to have good content and i think this new creator economy this ownership economy is really meant to be able to amplify one's skills at producing content more than it is to be able to just you know put money in the hands of everyone and i think what i'm particularly bullish about with the future of crypto future web 3 the future of the creator economy is that uh everyone has some sort of kernel of creativity inside of them and it's up to the social social structures the platforms that we use to really unlock and unleash the creativity that's inside of of everyone so that's what i'm bullish about for the future of the passion economy lee let me ask you this this closing question um so we're recording this at the start of 2022 and i think last year was a fantastic year for the creator economy and the ownership economy just the uh the surge of nft interest we saw alone was enough to to make it an incredible year what do you think 2022 is going to bring for us is this going to be a big year for the ownership economy and then like what do you what are you most looking forward to in the in this year and then the years ahead i think that it is going to be another banner year for the creator economy i mean i think every year is that is the case because the creator economy is just on a tear and in general i think the backdrop of this is that there there's a generational shift in how people are thinking about work and how they want to earn income and more people are gravitating towards being able to be autonomous and independent and doing the things that they want to do more flexibly and that's driving huge adoption of the creator economy across the board and so i don't think we're going to see any slowdown in that because that is an underlying human motivation that is prevalent all around the world in terms of like specific themes and predictions for 2022 as it pertains to um maybe some specific uh areas that i'll be focused on in the crater economy i think um i think more creators are going to explore uh web3 native ways to monetize and add that to their toolkit hunter walk had a really great post about creators being multi-sku like most creators are multi-sku they monetize through a variety of different business models and different types of products i think this will be the year where a lot of creators go from watching and waiting to actually participating and jumping in and so what that means is a bunch of new nft platforms as well that cater to different types of nfts and different formats of digital content so whereas last year was really all about collections and really revolved around visual art and that happened on openc and foundation and super rare i think this year we're going to see more musicians participate in nfts so there's a bunch of different music nft platforms that have emerged like catalog and sound and arpeggi and there's communities like water and music and song camp and i think photo nfts are going to be another big trend this year where photographers are able to be more successful with their work and that's happening i mean that's happening on foundation but that's also happening on new platforms like quantum and then i think this is also going to be a year of experiments for web3 social which is really a foundational element for the creator economy because it determines how well or how successfully creators are going to be able to connect to audiences and vice versa so i think we'll see more social experiences that are built with an eye towards exposing people exposing users to stuff that's happening on chain that they might not be aware of that is interesting to them and so a project that i'm keeping my eye on in this regard is called context which is this nft focused kind of social network or social feed there's another interesting one called backdrop which is really focused on dows and what people are doing inside of taos um but yeah web3 social is a theme that i think is really fascinating too absolutely so much should be built so much to look forward to up only for the creator economy is what legion is predicting uh in the years to come thank you so much for spending time with us this has been absolutely fascinating and i i know
