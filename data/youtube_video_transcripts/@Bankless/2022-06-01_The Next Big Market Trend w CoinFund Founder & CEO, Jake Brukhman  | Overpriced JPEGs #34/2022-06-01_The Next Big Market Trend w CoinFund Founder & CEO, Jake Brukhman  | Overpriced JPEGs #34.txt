[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i am joined today by jake bruckman who i had the pleasure of interviewing actually fairly recently at permissionless in a panel with with several others about how nfts are changing and shaping culture and we now have them on the podcast today he is the founder and ceo at coin fund which is a blockchain focused investment firm it's been around for seven years yeah it's gonna be seven years in july on july 1st wow happy happy anniversary coming up thank you thanks for having me carly and uh you also helped to seed and raise uh you're gonna correct me on how i phrased this but mediversal which is a sort of a subset of what you do and that it focuses specifically on nfts and the metaverse do i have that right jake yeah um well mediversal is one of our portfolio companies but it's one that we very actively incubated accelerated you know we feel like this is a team that we work with you know almost on a daily basis and certainly a weekly basis as they um kind of dive into the nft space and we always think of them as our nft arm or strategy great and investment company is that how is that what it is think of it as a venture studio for helping you know corporates ip owners brand owners projects you know traditionals crypto natives to bring nft strategies to market and also build a portfolio of nfts kind of from from doing that and from the secondary market i want to talk to you about how you and or metaversal think about valuing nfts i think as we're seeing this bear market hit it's like that's a big question that's on my mind is like how do we value this asset class but let's before we get there i want to i want to dive into the macro situation with you again you've been in crypto for seven years you've been through all the bear markets you uh and and while coin fund is not exclusively a like venture fund you certainly make a lot of venture investments and that's a subset of what absolutely what coin coinfund does we hear a lot right now about the venture market about the slowdown everything's drying up liquidity is drying up valuations we're way too high how are how is that impacting you how are you seeing that impact the kind of private crypto blockchain company market great question so i i mean i think to to kind of frame it you know we we talk to our institutional investors every day and we definitely are getting the sense that um you know they feel that there's a a bunch of like macro environmental changes that are coming out there in kind of the broader economy it they feel very bearish they're also observing um correlations between crypto and kind of macro factors and they're making the conclusion that it's you know it's also um going to be like a pretty tough time for for for crypto markets as well now remember crypto markets are you know you can broadly also separate them into liquid markets these are all the high cap assets and other tokens that are out there trading on 24-hour crypto exchanges and dexes but there's also the private equity markets where founders are raising money from um you know venture capitalists or crypto funds like like coin fund and those markets actually tend to move slightly differently so i think i think one thing to say is um it's true that we've observed some correlation crypto um but that correlation isn't isn't like well encompassing right if you look at nft gmv nft revenue you know this actually has been much less correlated to macro factors than like bitcoin or ether and you know if you wanted to build a portfolio you know of assets that were still like a lot less correlated uh to the macro environment i think you could in crypto i haven't run that analysis on what those assets would be but i think you could and also generally like correlations between different areas of crypto you know it used to be that everything was like super correlated to bitcoin but now you know we have like defy space nft space web 3 space is really moving according to their own logic and their own cycles of building and stuff and so there's a lot less i think correlation than there was in the past to bitcoin in general um when i was at when you and i were we're at permissionless right um did you feel like permissionless was a bear market conference no no when i went from there to vcon and it i actually i literally tweeted a picture of me at those conferences saying what bear market yeah exactly so what i think what we saw at permissionless was first of all it was like probably the best conference of the year that i've been to very healthy mix of institutional people investors founders technical people but the subject matter wasn't like overly technical it was a good environment over in palm beach right and so um it really felt like there's more capital in space than ever for venture there's a bunch of traditional vcs coming in finally taking crypto pretty seriously there's more founders building than ever on the back of that capital or the future promise of new capital that's being raised um there's more web to people than ever coming in and lending expertise to taking you know um applications to market to the consumer right like these are folks from amazon and facebook and google who have experience you know building applications scale experience with ux experience with mobile you know really like starting to get into the consumer side of crypto and this is very new we've been investing in infrastructure for the last decade you might say um you know in the blockchain space and so i would say that like i'm much less bearish than my average institutional investor right now on crypto markets and well of course i'm i'm seeing sort of the volatility in the liquid markets but um you know and in private equity markets you know we could still see impact um but for the most part none of the theses have changed for a lot of these projects startups networks um and yet they're pretty cheap so you know if you're a manager coming into this market now with a new fund which a lot of folks are you have a bunch of cash and this is a great time to go in i mean coin fund was founded in 2015 in the depths of a terrible bitcoin bear market there's like nothing going on in crypto bitcoin was between 200 and 400 for two years 2015 2016 and we had like one year of you know ico boom and then january 2018 everything crashed and then for for a year it was just painful bleeding and then in the early you know 2019 folks were starting to think like hey maybe maybe bitcoin is going to come back and it started to and then boom it crashed again and there was a bear market for another year and then 2020 it started to come back and then in march of 2020 chronovirus crash happened you know it was like devastation yet again so we had a you know two-year plus kind of bear market but what i will say is those were the moments when we as an investor made some of our most impactful investments like in that 2018-2019 time period when things were so hard and a lot of companies couldn't raise a dime and assets were very cheap and liquidity was low those were the moments when there's an opportunity to position in the best projects they're going to come out of that environment you know in the next cycle and that's that's kind of how i'm feeling about where we are now this is a a lot of people say this is a bloodbath i say this is an opportunity best yeah oh i i feel it i mean i think the vibe around the crypto space is actually better than it's been for the last several months and i have the at the risk of i guess like being the meme like i want to build something you know like i'm like it feels like it's a really fun time to just kind of get serious and and dig in it sounds like you are saying though we're are you seeing like are we seeing private crypto companies kind of marked down from where they last were able to raise for example and your feeling is well the strong ones will come out even better because of this i you know i definitely feel like investors when they negotiate with founders they'll you know in an environment like this they'll make that case they'll say hey you never know what's going to happen six months from now or coming into this bear market and so therefore your valuation should be lower so i think just like on a negotiation basis like we do see a little bit of pushback but founders aren't starting there right like the average seed round has been 30 million for the last year and a half and you know most most of these rounds were at that stage like we see between 20 and 40 million and that really hasn't moved you know in that time so again we might say like hey it's just that the bear market hasn't gotten around to you guys yet um but i really you know i'm skeptical that we're going to see like a ton of impact there living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfts without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect pro-apps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded magic mask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 and then in the super liquid or the more liquid assets call it and these more nfts things that can be traded on exchanges are we bouncing along the bottom here or do you think there's further to fall when you say that like what metrics are you thinking about i'm thinking oh well this that's get this gets into actually a tweet of yours that i love i would say floor price which i think you made the savvy point that floor price has nothing to do with price that's an offer to sell but you know in terms of i don't know board apes i don't know what it's at the latest i know it dipped below a hundred but like 90 eth is that whatever it is at like are you think those kinds of the prices that we're seeing or what people are demanding they be paid for their their assets will that will that stay so so you're right that i and i've tweeted a lot about this um over the the last year or so but i i think like floor pricing is just like a terrible terrible metric of what's going on in ft space i mean i think like my my core metric when like when someone asks me like what what's happening in nfts is gmv right so if we pull up let's see we could do this right now if we pull up kind of like the 30-day what we see is that we're you know in the last 30 days we've generated something 3.3 billion uh of gmv and nfts can you define gsm folks i think i actually made you do this on the panel as well all right uh gross marketplace volume right so just the number of sales that are happening like in the nft space and so what's the re like one of the reasons why i um i talk so much smack about um floor pricing is that it's the kind of statistic that could be going down but the overall sort of health of the space yeah and overall activity could be like very much going up and that statistic won't tell you that um and so this is exactly what we're seeing right like you're making the point that that four prices are dropping for certain series but i'm making the point that look our 30 month volume is 3.3 billion and that's not less than you know in most of the months that have been in the last year or so right and if you if you multiply that by 12 right you get something like close to 40 billion which is still in kind of this range that we've been saying like nfts are run rating depends on the day but like 30 to 60 billion of of annualized gross marketplace volume and that's like you know almost as big as the whole global art world right and that that doesn't that doesn't seem to be going down even though like ether and bitcoin have been falling dramatically over the last you know several weeks so i guess that's the question do you think that will go down or do you think this is you know activity will only go up from here and we're in sort of the the lulls of the space i mean like on a medium to long term time frame i think the marketplace volume of gmvs is going parabolically through the roof is there gonna be volatility to it short term of course um but i don't again i don't see it like dropping as much as uh you know as stocks are or as or as big uh big cap crypto assets are i think that's fascinated me i i did i would not have predicted that i thought i thought nfts being a newer asset class were going to be hit the hardest when whenever the bear finally came so i think i'm still trying to like understand why why it has felt as good as it has with you know with equities going so poorly that's right so and actually so we were going through some like deeper stats on this yesterday with the with the analyst team at metaversal medversal and what they actually showed was the uh at least on ethereum like denominated nfts on ethereum the ether denominated volume was in fact dropping but the the number of like units flying off the shelves is dramatically going up and and what that is actually saying is that like it's not that people are stopping to trade nfts like like that's not what the dropping volume means what what that combination of statistics means is that people are preferring cheaper nfts in in this market they're feeling like oh this is like the time to get a great deal right and they're going into kind of like cheaper items you know with the with the i that you know six months from now 12 months from now whatever it is that they're thinking that those items are going to come back each denominator they're going to make a fantastic return and so this is another example why like you can't just rely on like one statistic like to tell you what's going on you know because again gmv might be dropping but consumer behavior like might be just changing in some ways that are very bullish well and we're seeing not just cheaper assets we're seeing cheaper chains right we're seeing i think uh magic eden the marketplace on solana for the first time ever exceeded open c in terms of daily volume do you have thoughts about where this nets out for other all ones perhaps i know metaversal has invested in funds across multiple chains and coin finder as well yes how do you think that plays out as we maybe emerge out of the bear market someday well it's it's really cool like like a very high level right it's really cool to see that um solana has sort of emerged as you know a major like alternative venue for uh nft trading and what we also see is that solana nfts are they tend to be like cheaper as you as you noted um but if we step back and say you know how does this all play out did this one chain win you know the nft world or something like that you know our thesis is very specific here uh you know we think we're in a general trend where there's a lot of change you know the market is almost unrecognizable since 2019 when people were saying like you can't bet on an alternative chain ethereum's got all the developers and they have all the attention and they've already won and it's totally like useless to you know to even compete and we went from that world to a world where investors participants engineers founders are increasingly like able to choose alternative chains for financial reasons for technological reasons for strategic reasons and so we now live in a world where the number of chains is a lot and it's it's going to keep going up and when you have a lot of chains that creates a lot of demand for interoperability technology right you want to connect the chains together now what's also at the same time really interesting is that interoperability technology is maturing and sort of going to the next step in this in its state of the art like sort of as we speak right interoperability has been focused for the last you know forever has been focused on essentially like moving tokens between chains like connecting chains together moving tokens but what we're seeing now with companies like um you know layer zero abacus and others is that we're going into more of an omni omni-chain situation what does that mean well these new interoperability technologies they're more general they're they allow like cryptographic messages essentially to be passed between different blockchains and what you can build on that is sure token transfers but also nft transfers also being able to read the state of one blockchain from another blockchain being able to call a method on a smart contract in another blockchain from a different blockchain and what does that all amount to omnichain assets how many chain assets are tokens or nfts or other assets that like don't live in a particular chain they live on all the chains and what that does is it alleviates the customer the mainstream user the newcomer from having to think about like what back end am i on now we say like when you know when you're driving a tesla you're not thinking about like the data center that's required to fit the ai model that's you know driving your autopilot for you right consumers don't think about that so it's it's really odd that like crypto consumers should should have to think about that as well and what this omnichain interoperability technology does is it sort of encapsulates kind of the back end allows the mainstream user just focus on like hey i'm buying nfts i'm buying like i'm doing business here i'm not thinking about what you know data center i mean um and and the choice of of blockchain is still relevant just not to the consumer it's relevant to the engineers for the people who are making the technological decisions of how a particular app should be implemented or how particular uh decentralized network should be implemented and it's similar to like startups making the choice between like aws and google cloud or in some sense right and web too like you don't think about that when we're using you know this platform that we're on right now how do you keep up to date and and determine what you are tracking at any given period of time in this space given that you have eyes on like everything across blockchain which is really just massive um we have a team of 34 people that works full-time in blockchain and it's still not enough to cover it yeah and do you do like just from a tactical how you run your business perspective unless you're giving up trade secrets like how do you bucket the departments do they evolve as the like do you have like a team that's thinking about interoperable chains or like how do you structure your team yeah it's a great question um so we have or we're about to have nine people in our research team there's four partners at coin fund uh managing partners who who are doing deals so that's what 13 people kind of exclusively focused on investments across all types of crypto opportunities um and historically what's been really interesting about our team is that they have worked across venture and liquid analysis right like if you go to wall street that is very unusual you don't have you know people who are you know trading public markets and private markets and it's like the same analyst but in in blockchain it's almost like you have to be like that right because you're making early stage venture investments but those investments are in decentralized networks that have a token very very early in their life cycle and that token becomes a publicly traded asset like much quicker than private equity becomes public equity back in web 2. um and and that being said you know i also think that we over time are definitely specializing like we have several analysts today who spend like disproportionately more time doing liquid crypto liquid market analysis we have other folks who are very very focused on our venture discipline which is series a and series b and this is a little bit more you know it's a little bit slightly diff different discipline than early stage venture because now we're talking about companies with revenue with product market fit uh potentially right it's a lot more um uh it's a little bit more modeling heavy it's a little bit more like we got to analyze the ebitda right so it requires like a little bit of a different set of skills than early stage venture where we're talking to teams we're deep digging into the text we're making calls about like is this project viable we're assessing the timing of you know of of companies and so in summary you know we're starting to see people specialize across different areas and the coinfront team is very multi-disciplinary right we have people who come from finance from investment banking from computer science uh we even have like biochem so you know we we tend to try to cover uh the different areas with uh what's a diverse team i wanted to ask you and i said this too before we hopped on like what has been you know in your seven years which again is a lifetime to have been in crypto investing like best performing you know investments worst performing investments i i don't think you can speak to coinfund specifically for any number of reasons legal and maybe otherwise but um kind of broadly what do you see performing well what has performed well what has what has underperformed in your time i would say you know like if you know our strategy as an investor especially as a venture investor is to be thesis and trend driven right so what that means is we have a really good understanding of the technology and the mechanisms that are being built in the space we are therefore able to identify the trends that are most likely to happen like like if you look at um you know i know we talked about this on our panel of permissionless but i wrote about the nft pricing problem in january of 2021 right so that's about a year and a half ago and only now are you know are the companies that are doing pricing like upshot deep nftvalue.com nval.com you know and others they're coming to market now right so like what we're really good at at coinfront is saying listen we think like this is going to be a trend in the future it hasn't arrived here yet but we want to be really cognizant of that early we want to talk to teams in those areas early we want to find the best teams and we want to position for those trends kind of like coming to fruition and becoming big and that's what we've been good at so you know obviously we're like in 2015 super early to smart contracts to ethereum to alternative blockchains that were doing smart contracts we invested in pokemon in 2017 right as one of you know as as a statement almost that like we're we we see a multi-chain world coming up in the future um you know we were pretty early to defy um kind of in in q3 or so of of 2019 we're one of the earliest investors in the nft space i saw nfts in 2016 uh and then crypto kitties on the day they launched in around thanksgiving 2017 we became dapper investors in 2018 and pre-cedars of wearable in 2020 and you know co-led or led a number of other rounds in nft financialization companies like upshot later on right and so you know the most successful investments that we've had have been the ones where we formed a thesis early we did we did our work we positioned well and that and the mission-driven founders of that vertical you know drove that vertical to success i have so many questions of course i've got to ask you what trends you see upcoming what your next kind of bets are here but let me ask you this and maybe we cut it out or not but um that feels like a very macro style of investing right you see a big trend and then you can find companies within but obviously uh there's so many a company can get the be riding the right trend and totally  it up is there are we early enough that generally speaking you've seen if you're betting on a company that has seen the trend properly they're going to succeed simply because it just is so early and it's maybe not as fully competitive as the space might one day be that's a great question so i definitely think that you know you can be too early and being too early can kill companies like we i remember we were looking at a um nft marketplace um you know late 2017 early early 18 and i know i think openc started also in like mid to late 2017 if i'm not mistaken but um you know it really wasn't something that people were paying attention to in the market like nfts were not a thing there was no vcs investing in nfts or even dreaming of investing in nfts and like there were marketplaces that very well went out of business even though openc achieved this incredible success so what was it about like open c and other companies like that that that really made it work well i actually think it's mission driven founders i mean if you look at if you look at the open sea founders you know to their credit they had this incredibly strong long-term view that nfts um were going to be a thing at some point and i and frankly i i shared that view um and to their credit what what they did was they they just built for that and they started building in 2017 but it wasn't until what i guess like february 2021 that nfts really like had a huge inflection point and started doing like real kind of global global business and so from 2017 to 2021 it's almost like five years i guess or four years um where you have to be a mission driven founder and kind of go for that for that thesis and go for that vertical um and you know that is to say i think the combination of a mission-driven founder and the correct thesis is a powerful combination because those founders hang in there and they you know they make sure that at some point um that vertical is a success so what are the trends that you're betting on these days yeah absolutely um nft financialization so as we spoke about it legs in in permissionless and just to recap that's the idea that um nfts are kind of a financial infrastructure for digital content you know non-fungible goods maybe even uh real-world assets that are non-fungible like real estate um and the financialization of those things means that we can create a bunch of financial services um that can do finance on on that asset class and that starts with in my opinion it starts with really incredibly well-working price oracles like what upshot is building and that primitive of reference pricing enables nfts to be collateral it enables short selling it enables um indices it enables like uh exchange of one nft for the other and really like a whole suite of these like financial services nfc financialization is a huge trend it's it's starting to ramp up now um the other area that i think has a lot of activity right now but not it's not like in the headlines it's a little bit under the radar is really like how much technological development has happened in web 3 and when i say web 3 i say it as a technologist i when i say web 3 i mean you know the stack of networks and protocols and standards and frameworks that enable people to build truly decentralized applications right so you know at the bottom of that stack is storage and computation these are things like file coin and ipfs right it's also um things like live peer which are helping people to transcode video or things like a cost they're doing more general competition then you have this middleware layer in web3 which has been already being built up for a number of years so the middleware layer enables uh engineers and developers and founders right to create products on web3 you actually put data into it to compute things in a decentralized way and these are things like the graphs which is doing indexing ceramic network which is allowing people to store business data polywrap which is creating apis that web 2 developers can use you know to access blockchains and protocols through a standard kind of programming interface um you know many other type of things and then all of those services they get aggregated together right like when we think about as an engineer like when we think about using aws as our backend what does that mean well we we log into the aws console and we see storage and computational services we see database services we see domain name services right and that suite of services can also be implemented in like using web3 protocols you can do all of those things and i call that dws right decentralized web services one of our portfolio companies that is working on kind of this problem of bundling up um kind of different backend services from centralized to web3 is called socket supply and they are you know they're doing like really interesting work in terms of bridging the gap between you know web 2 and developers and web 3 and in the future it could be maybe as easy as you know just changing the end point of of a web 2 app and then suddenly your data lives in a decentralized network and this becomes like an entry point into web3 where these apps can enjoy some of the advantages and features you know of what web 3 has to offer and finally um like that's kind of like where we are we're sort of in this middleware infrastructure phase but we're also starting to see decentralized apps on top like we see merit.xyz is being like used as a bit of like a decentralized medium or sub-stack quite often in the crypto space we see orbus.club which is a decentralized social media uh platform like twitter decentralized twitter we see lens protocol which is building a social graph upon which other social protocols can be built and you know we that's because we now have enough infrastructure in web3 to actually build these things and have them work reasonably well in you know in in a user-friendly way so so web3 you know it's still pre it's kind of massive hype cycle like we saw it with nfts and in 2021 but we will get there and we're making incredibly fast progress on you know that suite of services i feel like we've had cycles in the industry and tell me if you agree with this where it's like you develop kind of the back end infrastructure the tools that developers need you know and then and then you go through a cycle where it's very front-facing building and you're building for the consumer and you're building on top of those tools that were built first and then and then you go back to building the tools it sounds like almost we're entering a phase where both building building both can be happening at once because the market's mature enough do you think that assessment is right it's absolutely right you know we've been investing in infrastructure for for a very long time there's still a lot of infrastructure yet to be built yet to be invested into yet to be invented um but we as i said like with a we're seeing a lot more of these experienced sort of consumer tech founders coming into space um and we have enough infrastructure to actually take you know some of these apps to market like when i think about d5 right um d5 is full of technology already like there's there's dexes there's borrow lens there's derivatives there's all kinds of d5 primitives but those primitives have not been taken to market in a form that most mainstream users can can can use on their phone right and um you know one of our [Music] founders in our portfolio he was the ceo of coinless andy brownberg recently started a company called echo where you know this is a really highly usable mobile app where you can connect your bank account move some dollars over into your app and then earn like a an apy on on that and of course it's coming from d5 but you never you never have to interact with d5 yourself right um and so we need like a lot more founders to like take defy to market in those ways build up some great brand trust with consumers so they know it's safe to put money into these apps and really demonstrate some of the power with which like defy services can um you know can compete with with traditional such services i'm just like writing down names of companies that i now need to look at during this whole time if folks see me writing i'm just like oh ceramic socket supply um i heard you in another interview and i you know it's funny i think it was from like august of last year which it feels like what what's even relevant still from august of last year with the speed at which this space moves but you you outline various categories that you're you look at and i think it was like the infrastructure category i wrote it down as creating liquidity category though i don't think that was exactly how you had phrased it marketplaces getting ip through the door and getting them tokenized and then like buy side companies like collecting nfts investing in nfts uh would you say that's still sort of like five categories and that's five that you're where you play would you add that list would you amend that list at all i'm not sure exactly which podcast you're looting this is delphi digital it was an interview you did with delphi this is like the one 150 minutes yeah yeah 150 minutes event without nfts with jake yeah you weren't saying it in any sort of overly formal capacity but it just gives me a structure because i would like to dive into a couple of these with you now marketplaces we talked about and some of the ip stuff so sorry and you're asking specifically like in the nft space or just in general crypto i think in general the places you play in would those feel like the categories you're interested in i think i think if i were to categorize it just be across kind of like the things that i see as crypto native verticals so those would be d5 nfts web 3 dows and you know kind of like a like everything else bucket which we call infrastructure but that could be you know that this could be decentralized networks like the graph providing infrastructure but it could also be companies like block daemon uh which is a very traditional lee structured sas uh providing like node infrastructure for for people who uh who want to run nodes and blockchain networks and so so those are kind of like the the five categories usually i think about okay all right well i'm gonna uh still i'm gonna use these ones you mentioned in the style five podcast just as a way to dive into some topics not not to say that these are your categories so talking about marketplaces here i think it's interesting i think coin fund and or mediversal um have invested in you you mentioned you were an early investor in wearable i think you've met invested in a company called metaflex which basically is is i think olaplex olaplex it's a solana uh kind of shopping it said metaflex on your website it's it's built on metaplex which is a protocol for oh oh oh i still got it wrong huh even even the metaplex version i said i have it written as metaflex got it metaplex but but yeah it's it's basically tooling for folks to be able to build shops you know backed by solana nfts and i think you're seeing wearable i know launched this year i think with with meta angel sort of these um like white label marketplaces for different projects feels like overall it's a bet on many different marketplaces and like marketplaces are going to be a commodity so why not build the tooling that allow individuals to create niche marketplaces is that the bet you're making talk a little bit about how you thought about marketplaces absolutely yeah so my marketplace kind of thesis is that you know like what we've seen is uh openc again in a very mission-driven way you know bring nfts to market they really like helped to take nfts to early mainstream adoption but they've done it in this model which is a classical marketplace model it's like an amazon or an airbnb or an uber or something like that right like a two-sided marketplace um and as a matter of fact that strategy was very successful right like today open c volume is over 90 of of probably like overall ethereum you know ethereum network kind of gmv but my thesis is that that state of affairs is completely unsustainable i think monolithic marketplaces will be decimated by this more shopify type of model and let me explain like why i kind of think that so one one reason is that this is this is not an amazon this is not a web 2 situation right like when you're talking about like web 2 marketplaces you're talking about people who own their own inventory and in nfts this is an open protocol and marketplaces do not own the inventory what they can do is they can create an interface to the inventory that's open public and permissionless and they can compete to be like the best attention seeker the best place where everyone agrees to go to transact you know the best user experience or something like that but ultimately marketplaces can't be you know in nfts can't be as sticky as like amazon is in web 2 because ultimately someone can build a better interface and compete you away that's much harder to do in in the amazon context because it's much harder to replicate all these warehouses international warehouses full of goods that i could just sort of steal and take away wouldn't the analog more be like an ebay though where it's a market maker between a it's a marketplace in between a buyer and seller absolutely ebay is also a two-sided marketplace where a lot of sellers and buyers have agreed to to me um but here's kind of my point what the marketplace model relies on is this like is this peer-to-peer model to create liquidity in other words everyone in their mind has gotten this idea that in order to have a liquid nft i got to find a counterparty you're gonna find a buyer we gotta do a deal and we gotta transact in one of these marketplaces you know sort of one one on one and i just simply think that a lot of people will be very surprised that there's a lot more efficient uh ways of creating liquidity for nfts and my thesis is that like one of the ways you can do this is through reference pricing if i have a machine learning model which tells me the price of all the nfts out there the fair price what i could do is i could start to create automated smart contracts where people can just transact and buy and sell enough teams with smart contracts or they can create liquidity around their nfts through issuing loans again in an automated fashion and what that does is it relieves me of having a marketplace model in order to have liquidity and so here's what i think is happening i think like people have realized that nfts are exchanged just like token exchange is going to move into decentralized protocols and we have a number of projects out there that's confirming that trend we have wearable protocol we have zora we have reservoir protocol we have holograph we have metaplexan solana and even openc just the other day launched seaport which is a decentralized protocol for nft issuance and exchange and so if nft issuance in exchange is moving down into this protocol layer what do you think is the next step well obviously you do that because you want to give people an api a backend that enables them to run their own marketplace and having that kind of um dedicated marketplace vision makes a lot of sense because nfts are art but they're also in-game items but artists don't want to be in the same marketplace where their art is sitting next to in-game items we've also seen nfts for real estate we've seen nfts for biotech the experience of buying real estate should not be the same as the experience of buying crypto native collectibles and so you need a different kind of interface a different kind of marketplace to serve those different use cases and so if we believe that nfts are going to be applied broadly to all of these different asset classes like real estate like stock photos like movies like music you know and so on and so forth then we realized we need a bunch of different marketplaces that give us different user experiences to to traverse those markets and of course those marketplaces are going to be built on these protocols like wearable protocol like zora like seaport and so on and so carly we're heading in a world where six to 12 months from now there's going to be an explosion of white labeled or dedicated marketplaces whenever a new series comes out that marketplace is going to live on their website whenever a new artist launches something you're going to be able to like go on their personal nft marketplace and you know and transact and the thing is like there's not a ton of consumer behavior in the market today yet where people do that but it's gonna start to become really obvious that that's where we're going when people start building more and more and more white labels on these um on these protocols as we mentioned wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flow tazos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft traders wearable has a variety of nft features that set it apart from other nfc marketplaces they have a native messaging function allowing you to dm your friends or haggle with sellers they also have a mobile app on ios and android with a built-in nft portfolio tracker tool so you can easily check the value of your digital art portfolio wearable is built on the wearable protocol a multi-purpose open source and community governed nft protocol that helps build products and services across the nft ecosystem including white label marketplaces tailored to specific nft communities so go to wearable.com and start discovering and trading nfts putting in floor biz to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces needs robust financial reporting performance analysis and the peace of mind that they are compliance ready gilded's nft ops is a one-stop financial reporting solution for growing nft platforms gilded has developed

nifties and poap trust gilded to automate complex reporting workflows visit gilded dot finance bank list to learn more so this is fascinating i want to ask though do we need to disentangle two pieces of this because it feels like there's almost two theses in this one is the decentralization piece which i think is really interesting like like the nft world starting to model the defy world more and that makes sense that you have almost like automated market makers i mean that gets us into how do you determine fair price which i really want to ask you about but that so that makes sense to me but there's also this question of and then also across these different verticals whether it's to your point real estate versus art versus gaming assets do those all need to be different marketplaces or is there like a super a decentralized superstore network effect thing by having them all in one exchange i feel like i'm more persuaded by your argument on the decentralization piece than i necessarily am on that there there won't be sort of a superstore where you know you can go to get an item in any of these verticals well i just find that it's it's really um it's it would be a really difficult problem to take the wide variety of asset classes that nfts could represent and again my example would be like fonts and you know titles to your car you know i find it like i would find it like very surprising that people would want to transact in those two dramatically different asset classes on one website using the same exact interface and so inevitably the interfaces have to be different right like for for cars like we know we know the check boxes and the you know the sliders that we would need for cars like is it electric what color is it what brand is it how much does it cost um you know and it's really sort of like a like a shopping experience but if you're also presenting art that's not necessarily the experience that you want you want to you want you know a beautiful website you want it to represent your brand you want to be stylized for for for your brand um and it's not necessarily a tool where people move sliders to find the thing that they want it's more like you're connecting with people in an artistic level right so just the the deeply different kinds of experiences that are there in these two asset classes motivates us to think that like the stores the the you know the shops that we're using to browse them will be very different and it's just natural that in order to facilitate that a lot of this activity moves into kind of a back end layer an api layer or protocol layer if you will and then these experiences are sort of built on top that's how these architectures tend to generally work your font example is so fun to me i have a good friend whose partner is is going to school like you know basically becoming one of these people that creates new fonts and i had no idea what an incredible process it is to be somebody who creates a new font and how much money these companies pay for like you know bespoke fonts and so it's it's a hilarious example that i don't think many people actually really realize the market behind fonts and uh fascinating uh to think about it in an nft context which of course it ends up making a ton of sense in an nft context because it is a digital good at the end of the day by the way i love the i love the font example and i can't wait until people in nfts are doing people are using nfts more for fonts because like the font industry as a whole is not that you know it's not a huge kind of like attractive space for investors but i kind of feel like if you put that creation of fonts onto the centralized marketplaces it'll actually like really democratize the creation of it the creators will be like more better compensated it'll create like a much like an explosion of great fonts and it'll be cheaper you know and i think it's like a very positive thing that could grow kind of an unsexy market into really a very interesting market yeah gosh i i'm unfortunately i usually don't have hard stops on when i do these interviews but i have a relatively hard stop so there's a whole thread i could go down on that but i'm going to save it we'll definitely have you back on because i i do want to go down the how do you price these things and i feel like there's uh maybe two categories of that that i want to ask you about mediversal the fund uh in bought now number nine um and i think that's an interesting case of um you know how do you determine to make that bet and to bet on noun number nine when you don't have a ton of historical data you've got a brand new kind of asset in some ways and then when you talk about these protocols or whatever they are that are that are going to be determining fair price of nfts are they just looking at historical value are they able to quantify intangibles like the community like how do you deal with pricing in that context and then how do you determine what you are investing let me try to quickly cover and i can i can go a few i can go a few minutes over but um i just wanted to make sure we had time for this i think this is a bear of a conversation i know that and this is a big topic and we really could spend you know a whole a whole uh episode on pricing um but essentially so let me talk about pricing in general so for companies like upshot and deep nft value they've really emerged saying like we think machine learning is the best approach and by the way if you rewind back to a year and a half and read my article uh it's called appraisal games and nfc liquidity problem i really describe like a ton of different ways that pricing could happen you can have auctions you can have sales you can have derivatives derivative implied pricing um you can have like various on-chain games actually one was was released on twitter yesterday um there's a company called abacus which is doing a similar thing right there's like 14 different ways that you can approach that problem but machine learning is kind of coming out you know the most practical way and it shouldn't be a surprise machine learning is really good at taking like quantitative factors and like learning about the right solution to you know to your problem and so machine learning inputs can be you know historical prices historical asks they can be social media following they can be like who's the creator of this series and and you know how are they like regarded or like what do they themselves buy in their wallet right like there's all these like quantitative factors that you can figure out whether they are significant factors in price now what like what are these pricing mechanisms like trying to do well they're trying to get away from floor price which is this like really rudimentary kind of statistic it really this statistic really loses a lot of information about what's happening in a series again your for price could be crashing dramatically while smart money could be buying up mid or high priced items in that series like and huddling them like crazy and you'll never know if you're only watching the floor price when you apply machine learning pricing what that does is it captures like all of the information in all of the series and maybe even like outside of the series like in the case of social media and then tries to basically come to and there's a few different like philosophical ways of thinking about this but it basically comes to like kind of a fair price that like the item like should be and most people would probably agree that that would be a fair price and of course that's based on like the rarity traits of the thing if it's a collectible again it's based on how the market um kind of like values those traits it's also really interesting because you know someone gave me the example the other day um of the fidenza right so the fidenza is a generative art series and art blocks and what's kind of interesting about fidenzo's is that you can have the same kinds of parameters like the same kinds of rarity traits but visually one of the things one of the outputs could be like very stunning and the other one could be very plain and so how does a machine learning algorithm like determine you know sort of like the aesthetic value of a work especially if they don't have past pricing information like fidenzas are very expensive so they transact a lot and that's like a really interesting question and and i think that problem can also be solved with machine learning if machine learning can start to take into account like what the pieces actually look like right anyway so my whole point is machine learning is coming out to be this you know kind of best way of doing it so far um and um you know like what what what is so interesting about these about this approach is that when a couple of reference pricing oracles come out there and get installed in the wild people will start to look at those prices and over time customers will will start to trust those prices they'll start to market make against those prices and they'll start to basically like believe that those are the prices that are real and so in a way you know it's a it's it's a little bit of like a loop where which teaches people what the prices are and the people kind of confirm it um so that's on pricing and then on on nouns and i'll try to be like super quick now yeah you know on nouns i i think nouns are and by the way i'm now number four full disclosure and so i definitely um had a hand in suggesting to miniversal that this is an interesting series but but one of the reasons why i think it's so interesting is because it's not just about the art it's also you know very much a governance system it's a dow and it's very much a financial opportunity because this dow takes the revenue from the daily nouns auctions and gives it to nouns holders to govern right and so one thing that really sets the nouns project apart from other projects is that if you own a noun you have a governance right um over a certain piece of that treasury actually i run that around that number a couple of days ago and that number is approximately like 73 ether so if you if you get a noun you kind of like governs about 73 ether words of the treasury it doesn't mean you can take that out and you know keep it for yourself but it means that you can help to allocate approximately that much ether and so if you're buying a noun at 45 eth but you're entitled to govern like 73 years you know some people might think that that is a you know that is enough of a spread there uh to warrant like a good deal um and so you all paid a lot more than 45 though if i'm not mistaken um so i paid 45 east for now number four it was actually the second cheapest noun for a very very long time um but then later on in the hundreds or 200s or something people bought nouns for like 25 so cheaper than mine and then you know but but to answer your question carly right like one of the how do we value nouns well that there's a very quantitative way of valuing nouns it's like what is the net present governance value quote unquote you know of like the future cash flows that you could affect when you own this asset what's so interesting on the machine machine learning piece of valuing things i mean i i think it almost speaks to the discomfort that that i that i feel a little bit and then i'm sure others feel which is you're saying you'll have this machine that can tell us what it's worth because it's really hard to to know whereas if you're in a traditional if you're warren buffett you're looking at price to earnings ratio and free cash flow and these sort of very quantifiable numbers driven metrics that we just don't have for these more intangible assets so then we we kind of create these other metrics which is just fascinating in and of itself and i'm personally really interested in what we're seeing happen with nfts whether it's coinbase casting board apes for their trilogy series or you know as we see nfts now start to enter into licensing agreements and and potentially be revenue generating in in different ways like how that then could get factor into pricing right like okay you've got a board eight that has a a tv deal and brings in x number of dollars a year from their tv deal and now that's also a saleable asset though so you know i think there's it's gonna be so interesting to see how we price these things moving forward last question you talked about gmv quite a bit here are there other metrics that you look at that you think um we're not talking about enough as a space in the space as a whole yeah so like in in terms of nft pricing sure or nft yeah nft nft metaverse that world yeah yeah so absolutely you know i think you got to look at gmv i think another trick there is that that gm that global gmb now lives across many different blockchains and so you know if you take that into consideration you'll you'll be getting better data um you know that i mean floor prices are not irrelevant they're still relevant right they they are a summary statistic and what might be going on with with the series and and sort of speak to like trends especially if you're following four prices over time like give you good information um there's other summary statistics like median price like historic sales um there there's probably like a bunch of you know nfc traders are much better at this than me but i suspect that like like there are now um metrics like secondary metrics that you could calculate for example you could go to a series and you could say okay if i take the number of units and then divide it by the number of holders like what number do i get in other words what's the average number of units per holder and i kind of sense that like like based on my experience like series that have that where that number is like less than two is generally like very like highly distributed like relative to the different series of markets and num and series where that number is like above two or even three are like very very concentrated so it's kind of almost a measure of like decentralization uh or distribution of a series and i think like the more widely distributed nfc series is the more likely it's going to do better right so that could be like a secondary statistic that you use to assess health and things like that yeah number of holders awesome well jake thank you so much again we'd love to have you back on because we we didn't get to fully traverse all of the topics we could traverse here um but i'm so glad we were able to make something happen we did cover a lot you cranked it out you know we were able to to cover a lot of the time we had thank
