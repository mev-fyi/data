welcome to episode 5 of state of the nation what we're doing today is talking about what's happening in crypto like we do every week we relate it to big picture stuff and then we drop some insights and action items today we have a very special guest with us we'll surprise you with who it is in a moment we've got three or four topics to cover that are most relevant for the bankless community just as a quick reminder we do this every tuesday we release release on youtube then we also release it in podcast version on wednesday so make sure you subscribe both to youtube and the podcast so you're catching up on that um the first question i always ask when we kick these things off is the same david hoffman what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation is hedged and this is going to reveal some of the topics that we are about to talk about but it's a mixed bag we have all-time highs in stable coins on ethereum and we also have all-time highs in banned addresses of those stable coins on ethereum we have all-time highs in the valuations of defy tokens and then we have absolutely all-time highs in flatness for both ether and bitcoin right so there's a lot of there's there's a tug of war going on between like really bullish sentiment and really worrying sentiment uh and so the state of the nation is hedged all right so when you say hedged right so um like crypto prices highly volatile doesn't feel really hedged what do you mean by hedge david yeah i mean there's this there's this tug of war going on between like d5 is people are super bullish on d5 chain link just roared up to eight dollars uh one of our one of our sponsors ample fourth just just went from a 10 million dollar market cap to 130 million dollar market cap uh and at the same time like you know in the macro environment btc and in and therefore ether are largely correlated to what from what we can see are largely correlated to uh the legacy markets which are largely correlated to coronavirus uh and what with the impact that coronavirus has and so there's there's these two different forces at play and they are pretty much at opposites of each other yeah i was thinking you know one other area where hedged against is basically nation state actors nation state kind of politics the banking the traditional banking system we're not so much hedged from a financial perspective right we still feel the volatility that reverberates through the the bankless alternative money system but we are hedged against uh certain things from a censorship perspective right and i think that's going to be one of the topics that we get into today the actual listing of specific bank type stable coins so we'll get into all of those topics we've got three or four for you and a special guest but before we dive in we want to talk about our bankless state of the nation sponsors the first that i'm super excited about use this wallet all of the time is argent so our argent to me is the best ethereum wallet for d5 it's the one i'm using if i'm on mobile it's got easy access to your favorite d5 protocols like ave compound pull together qyburn token sets plus you can access it with wallet connect this is secure easy to use it's a smart contract wallet so they add some additional features like social key recovery so you don't have to remember a 12 word 24 word key phrase they've got over 20 million in locked assets uh so there's you know increasing lindy effect being poured into this and best of all it's a bankless wallet so it's non-custodial so go check out the argent wallet download it if you haven't start experimenting in d5 that's argent a-r-g-e-n-t dot x-y-z to find out more ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum that the bankless community absolutely loves it's a place where you can go and deposit assets to take out a loan and one of the best things about ave is it allows you to pull out a stable loan where that interest rate doesn't shift under your fee which is a really important tool for thinking in the long term both as an individual but perhaps also a business in addition to these stable interest rate loans they also have a flash loan protocol which allows developers to get pretty creative with what they can enable their users to do a flash loan is where you can borrow infinite amounts of whatever is available uh for zero collateral so long as you pay it back inside of the same transaction inside the same block so things can get pretty crazy there's a lot of creativity untapped that we haven't really got into there yet so developers you are absolutely encouraged to go try and leverage the ave flash load flash loan protocol check them out at ave dot com all right awesome so now let's introduce our special guest because the first topic we're going to talk about is where is the inflation and we brought on someone i think is particularly apt to talk about that he had a very successful meme last week and that's nick carter from castle island vc uh we've had him on the podcast before and and uh david's about to do his video dj stuff and beam nick in as we speak um so uh nick are you on yet i'm here here i come awesome i'm bringing in nice work david uh the magic of technology so nick you had one swimmingly yeah it was perfect it was flawless so nick um you had a super successful meme this week not only are you a uh incredible writer in the crypto space and thinker and also a venture capitalist but you sir are a meme artist to get 10 000 likes i think that's what we're at right now on on a meme is no small feat uh in in twitter especially when we're in this corner of crypto um and i want to actually show the meme you put out because i think there's um there's a lot of truth in it so i'm going to pop that up on the screen and then we're going to walk through that but nick why don't you tell us like what what is the inspiration for uh this meme that you created you said you said i think the top of your post it says i've held off making this for too long yeah oh man well thank you for congratulating me on the meme success you know all the things that people congratulate me for that's one of the most important um so yeah you know the the story behind the meme you know what can i say um uh the truth is actually i i think i had a fight with my girlfriend that day and i was feeling kind of down in the dumps and i was like you know what's gonna perk me up like a real like uh serotonin boost or whatever the the chemical is yeah from getting like a zillion impressions online wow and uh i'm not even kidding and uh you know like i just knew that if i used the american chopper template like people would like it because it's the funniest template out there yeah yeah and i also like i want to talk about inflation because like inflation is such a it's it's like the subject of so many like debates where people like talking past each other and like they don't agree on common terms and so i was like all right i'll do the inflation american chopper template which is a very obvious one um okay so like i feel like even explaining the meme takes away the humor i know i'm gonna do it anyway all right all right well we'll walk through it panel by panel but i'm sure you know people who are listening to this have seen the american chopper meme um a funny story david and i when we were uh doing like a review for this and picking up topics uh we spent about 15 minutes doing that before the show preparing uh so a lot of time invested in these shows for prep work but we honestly didn't know where the meme came from like i knew it was a reality tv show but um had not seen it and it's like an ancient meme this is from like circa what was it david like 2003 or i don't know when the when the meme came from but the video the episode came out somewhere between like 2003 and 2008 so like it's very very old tv show yeah so we watched that we watched the clip by way of research and to actually like um the guy with the handlebar mustache is just yelling at the other guy for not showing up on time taking too long of breaks and overall just being like a lazy worker and then the other guy says it doesn't matter because i still get my [ __ ] done and so that's what they're arguing about it's a it's a classic boomer versus millennial i think uh trope you know what was funny here is that i kind of inverted it because the millennial talking points are being done by the old guy and some people are like how come the old guy is the one that has these like newfangled opinions on inflation and the answer is that i thought the old guy looked cooler so i wanted to make him the hero of the story he's definitely the hero all right so let's take this uh frame by frame that's the beauty of it like you can sympathize with either guy yeah so like this is this meme has wide appeal because like it's like the blue dress or like the silver dress or whatever like you can pick a side yeah exactly all right so that's right so handlebar mustache guy in the first panel he he goes he's yelling at baseball cap guy and he's saying the money supply is growing faster than the economy which necessarily means that inflation must be occurring so he's making the argument for inflation right is that is that a one-to-one like if this then that um analysis like if the money supplies go is growing faster than the economy then therefore inflation is that just rock solid or or are there nuances it's not rock solid yeah so like i'm i'm also making fun of the debate itself in the meme right so i'm like parodying this inflation debate specifically um like i'm laughing at myself right because i make these arguments and i'm acknowledging here that they're kind of stupid as well okay so handlebar mustache guy says that you know what we should go maybe through all the panels first so so people get like uh because people will be listening to this on podcast they won't have the visual in front of them um handlebar mustache guy makes makes the claim that money supply is growing and therefore inflation exists right baseball cap millennial says cpi that's consumer price index demonstrates that inflation is low and stable despite monetary issuance that's when things get heated handlebar mustache guy goes financial assets have been bid up to record highs and valuation there's your inflation kind of a drop the mic moment then shares start flying millennial goes assets like stocks and property are capital goods which consumers don't need to buy and so aren't indicative of qe driven inflation tvs are cheap right uh it continues now handlebar mustache is getting really angry you can almost see the spittle flying out of his mouth as he make in this last panel and he says offshoring and tech are deflationary so tvs are cheap but goods that cancel on insiders buy like property education healthcare have been bid up alongside issuance and demonstrate its inflationary effects so i said that in a relatively monotone tone but um this guy is clearly yelling the last panel right so it's the it's it's the classic we're not like inflation is happening because money supply is increasing side of the the argument the other side is saying cpi isn't going up therefore inflation doesn't exist so yeah what's your take like like who's right in this meme nick well clearly i sympathize with handlebar mustache guy okay for sure which is why i gave him the last word right like i didn't let baseball cap guy get another word in because there's more to the debate you know what would it what would a fifth panel be um what would a response be um probably a rehash of like the the third panel yeah so this seems to me like it this devolves right into a subjective discussion as to what should be involved with the cpi or not like do yeah does real estate does property capital assets like in investments do they belong uh in to be included in some sort of inflation metric uh yeah i think the fact that perhaps that they're not is indicative of why there's wealth disparity yeah so this is really a meme about like how you would measure the impact of the injection of new money on society and you know a lot of people think it's very contrived that the government produces the metric which is used to measure inflation which is like suspiciously always pretty low even if it seems to us like we're young dudes you know we are renting in urban centers or buying property anyway you know like so we're young guys we um are experiencing the effects of property call it inflation or like appreciation and property values and urban centers um we know what it's like to have student loans and um there's a significant delta between the cost of an education now and median incomes in this country so you know if you look at these more comprehensive metrics in terms of the things that you actually need to buy to have a fulfilling life that's not just the price of eggs you know and these like consumer purchases that's bigger things like education um and arguably financial assets like financial assets are how people save for retirement in this country and if the price of financial assets is very high relative to their earnings which is the case today you're frozen out from saving so you don't have the ability to build like a financial portfolio that's going to shepherd you towards retirement so that's really the broader point here is that the price of financial assets does matter it's it's you know it matters to the middle class in particular because uh the way that they build wealth is through home equity and through owning a share of uh you know the s p 500 and if these are effectively too expensive for people to actually get a toe hold into that wealth generating and savings process they're going to be frozen out and i think that's a really big part of the reason why there's so much strife in the u.s today is because people feel that they don't even have the chance to get on that ladder in the first place it's not worth it to get a white-collar professional job because you know you have to take exorbitant rent you know in downtown to live there you know you don't really have a chance getting a down payment on a house uh you're coming out of school incredibly indebted so people just feel miserable and they feel that they're totally frozen out of the system and to me that's the real effect of uh you know asset price inflation uh call it inflation called something else we know that asset prices um have massively run up in the last decade and i think a lot of that is attributable to quantitative easing um you know i mean that like if you want to take issue with one thing you would try and maybe take issue with the causality there monetary issuance and asset prices but yeah that's effectively the crux of the debate so bitcoiners love the phrase bitcoin fixes this and i think the way that they would apply that that line to this is the fact that like the cpi if we want to have a fair money the cpi of a money should include all things like the whole world of all prices everywhere ubiquitously and the only way that you would ever get that is to have a money that is outside of the control of any one individual person because if we want to take a malicious perspective on what the cpi is the cpi is just a tool to re re-price out or move certain assets out of the purview of the average american right so anything that anything that uh you know anything that is capital right anything that returns wealth to its owners just we just price that out of what money is uh and so i think this is why bitcoiners will be like bitcoin fixes this because bitcoin is something that the cpi of bitcoin is just the whole world just all assets and goods everywhere equally is that a fair take yeah i would say bitcoin quote-unquote in theory fixes this in two ways so one it's like a good stable measuring stick so the issue with the dollar is that the dollar is like really measured against other currencies i would say like forget like consumer goods like if you want to measure the strength of the dollar you measure it against an index a trade-weighted index of all the other currencies but those currencies are also being uh effectively inflated too at like a consistent rate so you don't have an absolute measure of like the purchasing power of the dollar you have a relative measure and that's relative to all these other inflationary currencies so you're not really getting a lot of reliable information out of that right then you have to return to things like gold you measure things against gold which is like what austrians like to do so bitcoin you know is is fixed right so um the supply is fixed so in theory the price of bitcoin contains more information than the price the dollar um the you know the second way the bitcoin quote-unquote in theory fixes this would be it's a new monetary good as opposed to the existing dominant monetary goods in the us which are property and capital assets like equities those are the main ones the dollar is like you know people don't hold the dollar for savings purposes for good reason so it's kind of like been demonetized uh as a savings device um but so you know the way that like bitcoin and like cryptocurrencies potentially help alleviate this issue as far as like young people that are entering their or in the midst of their careers like us is it's an alternative savings device which hasn't been bid up like crazy by the boomers and the central bank money spigot and so it's like you're getting in on the ground floor instead of with equities you have to get in at a price earnings ratio of 30 which is historically double the average so that's that's the other way so if if you know cryptocurrencies really monetize i wouldn't say they have yet um writing that monetization wave you want to be in now so it's it's more the maturity of that asset matches our career trajectories as opposed to you're buying the top if you're buying property or equity in this country that's just the fact of it you're buying like the top in kind of a generational sense yeah so the idea of the the cantalon effect is is basically those closest to the money spigot get the benefit namely those that are uh holding assets that the money spigot essentially rewards so those are you know s p 500. i um we're actually we're having ben hunt on the podcast later this week and he talks a lot about the uh kleptocracy right the oligarchy that is basically pillaging the the us right now i um read something over the weekend there could potentially be between 20 and 28 million americans u.s citizens evicted uh over the coming months so 10 million over five years was um the great recession numbers in terms of eviction uh 20 to 28 million yet at the same time we have peak nasdaq price right um what i don't understand right like i understand why the fed's doing it right they have kind of their their set of instruments and so they've got their their hammer and their screwdriver and they use those instruments um but the rest of the federal government uh do they not see that this massive inequality these people that are getting left behind whether it's millennials or god god forbid gen z right or whether it's you know the middle class essentially they're going to be pretty pissed about this like doesn't this i mean end in some kind of a revolution you could think of crypto as one tentacle of that revolution but there are other revolutions uh as well like what are the 2020s gonna be like i mean is this just all gonna bubble to the top i mean i think actually and i don't want to delegitimize like the protests that we've seen already but i think part of the anger does have to do with this exact phenomenon uh in addition to like the obvious like racial inequality component that's part of that so i think part of the reason people are so outraged right now is because they feel frozen out and they may not understand you know mechanically and really precisely um how and why like what the mechanisms of their destruction are but i think they just emotionally understand my hopes of getting of entering and staying in the middle class and being upwardly mobile are now worse than they've pretty much ever been at any point in american history right um millennials are the first really downwardly mobile generation and i really do believe that it has to do with asset prices and our kind of demographic shift and the fact that we've stacked on so much debt which the bills are going to come due and it's going to come down our generation and i think if we get a revolution my guess is that something's going to change um hopefully it's peaceful as opposed to like the french revolution or something um if they got if if uh if all we got was a crypto revolution that would be the best case scenario right because that would be bloodless that would be certain goods get demonetized and other goods get monetized uh and there's winners and there's losers but that would be effectively peaceful transition i'm not optimistic that that's all we're gonna get right um i think and you ask like why congress or the government isn't acknowledging this i would say as far as the fed is concerned there's tremendous inertia in central banking it's a you know intellectual development there is very slow um and they have a specific mandate which they're in their opinion they're trying to meet that mandate um so i'm not surprised that there's been a slowness of reckoning there well nick you actually had fed uh fed chair members right or federal reserve representatives like respond to this meme uh members of of regional feds yeah so like st louis yeah david olfado who's um part of the st louis fed um he's he he retweeted the main he's like yeah this is like not a bad discussion actually oh he retweeted it yeah it's funny because like it's accessible and it really captures um a debate which has been rumbling for a long time but um i guess the debate never gets conveyed in meme format so this this is new um but yeah you know like i think with congress we actually are seeing the beginnings of a transformation and this understanding that uh income and wealth inequality is extreme and asset prices are uh partly to blame for that um or they're at least a manifestation of a fairly broken system and we're seeing a rebellion against capital against um even property rights um and an embrace of um effectively like proto-socialism you know aoc is probably the best representative of this doctrine uh of course that's maybe not the that's not like the mechanism that i would endorse to deal or reckon with the situation but that's i think a symptom or a reaction which is is gonna get louder and louder uh but yeah congress also the composition changes slowly and you know um populism takes a while to to make its mark but um you know you could also say trump's election was also partly reaction to this um you know big part of his platform was re-controlling american jobs um it's it's precisely this financial system that we have today with the dollar's primacy which led to the offshoring of those jobs in the first place uh so we are seeing reverberations in the electorate already my guess is that uh 2020 the election also continues on that trend i think we'll have a lot more millennial congress people i i totally think there's like this um bubbling energy at the bottom of all of these there and we see it arise in so many different ways and one of the ways that we see it arise is the fact that this meme in particular blew blew the [ __ ] up right and so that to me that illustrates that same energy that like elected donald trump or is pushing uh aoc into into a power not not power yeah power um yeah and so like no she has power she's one of the most powerful members of congress people just don't realize it yeah absolutely right and like we are giving her that power because of this energy right and the energy that got people into the streets to protest and i totally agree with you it wasn't necessarily a a black lives matter protest it was a anti-state protest because the state is the institution that is keeping the powerful elite the way that they are which then manifests itself as like a racial issue at the same time and i i'm coming and one of my questions for you is like to what degree is the what is being described in this meme that the cantelon effect to what degree does that basically define the current issues of across the world is it like one of the biggest economic forces that it defines the current state of the world or is it just one force among many like what measure does the cantalon effect really just create the reality around us or is just a part of the puzzle well um the cantalon effect is a very useful term in terms of precisely defining uh source of inequality but the main thing that's really happening in the world is we're on year roughly speaking 40 of a fiat fully fiat regime and the we're on year 40 of the global reserve currency being a fiat currency which is the first time really um you know previously the glo the global reserve currency might have been the pound but it really was gold right and so we finally severed that link to um to like genuine matter and we moved on to this world of really complete and total abstraction and we've seen lots of financial crises the modern central banking doctrine hasn't made our financial system any more stable if anything it's become more unstable in those 40 years and i think we're really at the terminus you know we're the system is clearly degenerating in front of our eyes and the world is reckoning with the dollar being its reserve currency there's lots of sovereign currency failures happening right now and um emerging markets really actually the whole world is completely overloaded with debt uh which which i think you know that these debt levels are now at a place where they can't really be reckoned with without a devaluation or default right those are your two tools you either say you're not going to you're just going to start up not repay the debt lark argentina or you can just debase the currency so the debt load becomes much lower in real terms which is how more developed nations basically get rid of debt loads and what that is a default is a transfer of wealth um away from debtors um or actually in favor of debtors right so i think we are gonna see jubilees here we're gonna see wholesale currency devaluations to me that's the most politically amenable way we'll get out of this situation as opposed to austerity um so yeah i do think that you know the king's law effect is a precise definition of an important concept which people don't pay attention to but the really big trend here is that we're at the end of a kind of a macroeconomic super cycle and there's a huge amount of pent up energy and it's going to be unleashed in the next decade and it's going to be amazingly destructive in particular to middle class wealth yeah absolutely great great weigh-in on that as you can see uh there's a ton of thought behind a simple meme like that and um nick um thanks for sharing that with us it's been great to have you on hey do you have a few minutes to stick on stick around and actually talk about our next topic because we're going to talk about stable coins you have a few minutes of course yeah sorry there's sirens outside is my guess but yeah of course yeah awesome all right well david we should do uh our second round of sponsors and we should then we can dig into the next topic so i want to tell you guys about diversify is a decentralized exchange it's a professional grade exchange so that's high fee high speed low fee it's private it's deeply liquid the way they do that is through some roll-up technology so it's kind of a side chain that's also secured by the ethereum main chain my question is why use a centralized exchange at all we are starting to get to the place with solutions like diversify where dexes are as good as centralized exchanges they also have a a token called neck which is nec which is a perpetually deflationary token so they have a buy back and burn schemes alert in some ways to make her these guys had the original liquidity mining token back in in 2008 but what you have to do is go check out their exchange the user experience is phenomenal remind you a lot of coinbase or binance or kraken that's used today that's at diversify.com we will include a link in the show notes our next sponsor is ample fourth ample fourth is a token a sound based money experiment which i i particularly think is is rather interesting uh so it's very much like bitcoin in the sense that it's non-dilutive so when you own a share of the ampliforth tokens you are guaranteed to be owning that same share of all of them however the amount of ample fourth tokens that you own will always change because the token tracks a dollar and so where the price of ample fourth is inelastic the supply of ample forth is completely elastic uh and so they are spinning out their their geyser system which is a kind of a yield farming mechanism uh in in hopes to distribute and spread out the ampl token to as many different holders as possible so if you are interested in participating in the geyser incentive mechanism you can check them out at ampleforth.com all right next topic guys nick we're glad you're still hanging with us and that that's this this is uh we could talk more broadly about stable coins nick and you you put out a fantastic white paper about that that i'd love to get to but first we've got to talk about the main topic issue which is the crypto dollar ban hammer so usdc got its first band hammer uh one address was blocked so inside of the usdc smart contract all of these tokens essentially are smart contracts on ethereum um coinbase and it's affiliated bank banking partners through the center organization have the ability to um blacklist certain accounts right so they can essentially say hey this eth address is involved in behavior that breaks our terms of service suspicious and they have detailed terms of service of what kind of they they deem block worthy they haven't yet executed a blacklist move until this point in time but they did last week um what are your thoughts on that guys i guess maybe uh start with you nick is this is this kind of to be expected is this kind of a like um you know um this is what everyone signed up for crypto these are what bank staple coins are this is sort of to be expected or is this something uh more sinister is this a reason to think and look more closely at crypto native coins like bitcoin and ether uh and even stable coins that are more algorithmically derived like a like a die yeah great question i think obviously there's a clear hierarchy in terms of the counterparty risk and just the there's more ambulances out here uh in terms of the quality uh of the settlement quality uh and the ownership characteristics in these assets and crypto native assets are at the very top and then stable coins which are derived from crypto native collateral are obviously better and then these fiat back stable coins are the most convenient but there's enormous embedded risks one of them is that you your account gets frozen um i would say that the blacklist isn't you know surprising really to me i don't think to anyone the big big question is can usdc actually remain on this blacklist model because if you think about it the blacklist model is actually incredibly progressive when you compare it with something like paypal or venmo you know a few analysts have pointed this out uh jp koenig in particular uh pointed out that you know those stablecoin issuers have a relationship with the people creating or redeeming the stablecoin but they don't really have a relationship they don't really have an ability to track or monitor everyone else now they might claim they do you know like with the chain analysis and stuff but like fundamentally your ability to do that is limited right um especially as like anonymizing smart contracts get created for instance uh so so you know you actually have an awareness of like a relatively small share of the network activity which is much it's much more similar to a genuine digital cash standard than uh you know then well it's basically the closest thing we have to a digital cash standard in the world today so far regulators have sort of indicated that they don't want that to exist so the fact that fiat back stable coins using a blacklist as opposed to a whitelist model actually exist is kind of amazing to me uh and i think that'll be the big big fight you know in the next year or so with fatiff and the stablecoin issuers and the banks basically can this relatively low encumbrance model actually survive yeah that's that's a fascinating thought process and you know the interesting thing uh i'm sharing my screen now is that that you can see in kind of the crypto world somebody put this together on analytics website called dune analytics which is basically going to track the banned usdc addresses over time so just as nick was saying um with a stable coin like usdc uh coinbase is not identifying all the individuals there's no aml kyc for every individual eth address that holds that asset that would be more like the paypal paypal or venmo model that we have today once you've entered into the usdc ecosystem essentially you have kind of free rein to send it whatever address that you want without any identity being linked but they do have this ability to essentially blacklist certain accounts and freeze it and this one i think how much was it um 100k maybe yeah 100 usdc um and you can see it right on chain so you can see as this happens so that adds a level of of transparency to the playing field that we didn't have before they can't freeze addresses necessarily in the dark um they have to do it in the light um and other other staple coins have done this too so usdc or usdt tether has done this this is the eric wall tweet um almost a million dollars of usdt has been frozen previously so 22 ethereum accounts that's this year so it is going on um as we speak but but as you mentioned nick it is um it is a different model i don't know what jp's thoughts are who you mentioned i almost get the sense when i read some of his work that he's like hey um you know the government should kind of look into this and maybe close some of those loopholes because it's not fair i don't know if like what you think but um it feels like that would be certainly a hamper on the banker staple coin industry if it was squeezed tighter from a regulatory perspective totally and you know if today you have de facto anonymity if you're using a fiat back stable coin you you there's like a small risk that your transaction or account will be frozen but there have been millions of transactions with tether and usdc i don't know how many exactly i'd have to look at the number and how many of them resulted in the freezing now compare that to paypal you can get your paypal or your venmo account frozen if you put like cuba in the memo field of a transaction right if you say cuban sandwich there's a risk you get frozen so the the level of discretion and intervention from the administrator's side is many orders of magnitude more in the in the in the paypal uh system as opposed to if you have backstable coin so and honestly i don't think blacklisting hundreds of thousands of addresses is a scalable thing at all so to me the blacklist model is fundamentally different and it's much more like a digital cache standard online and uh we'll see if it can survive i mean opinions might differ on whether it should survive or we should have that anti-fragility proven out for the for the less fragile systems like dye or just you know native crypto units in the first place um i think it's basically the number one kind of battle to follow over the next year i think there are two big uh two big points to bring up here one of them is one of them is that i i don't think it's possible for us to go to a whitelist model because the cat's out of the bag like pandora's box is opened like turning usdc from a blacklist model to a whitelist what model would cause so much havoc right there i don't see an elegant solution to doing that uh there's catastrophe it would be catastrophic both for individuals and for applications on ethereum that are legitimately using usdc in a in an i mean i'm not a lawyer but in my opinion an over the uh an appropriate way right and so and and just trying to unravel that there's so much diffusion with usdc like what are you gonna and there's over a billion dollars on ethereum like what are you gonna do you're gonna just you know revoke usdc from people that you don't even know who they are one of them might be me one of it might be my company um how i don't understand how that and so and at the same time there is the expressivity of do you need this address blacklisted because i can do that for you like we do have solutions at the table which i think will appease the regulators yeah the the mechanism of turning it into a wireless model is is not clear to me i mean i guess you could cancel redeemability for all but a select few and then people that know that they wouldn't pass the strong kyc or whatever would then have to sell it at a discount basically but it would be yeah amazingly disruptive maybe that happened ironically i feel like our greatest crypto's greatest defense against this is getting traditional banks uh more deeply involved so jp morgan starts issuing its stable coin directly on a public blockchain network like ethereum right well now you've got big finance who are starting to like and they've got a powerful lobby obviously we're just talking about the cantelon effect um that seems to be a strong defense it's almost kind of the defense that the internet had it became so damn useful right and big companies and the broader economy became so dependent on it that cows out of the bag and governments nation states could not block it for fear of getting left behind other nation states that leave it open and free yeah i think you're absolutely right and i agree like it was quite easy for the government to kill e-gold uh or libya reserve back in the day i'm not saying those are perfect analogs but that was easy because they had like 100 000 users max and the stakes were much lower but if you're talking about you know thousands of american businesses that are using these systems and potentially millions of americans and you're going to try and just bring down the ban hammer for systems that have lots of legitimate use maybe some illegitimate use too but lots of legitimate use you know they're just fundamentally an alternative settlement rails um we're kind of reaching a threshold here where it's going to be very difficult politically to to effectively destroy these systems like as you can't really put the toothpaste back in the tube kind of thing so maybe that's how we we kind of win rights in the internet domain is you know we demand the right to have um genuine uh genuine digital cash standard which does not exist today there's no digital equivalent to cash which is dollars nominated uh that exists in the financial system there's nothing with a settlement quality of real cash um so it could be that this is how we win it just through the sheer force of numbers mm-hmm that's why and you know part of the bankless nation we talk uh very much about not needing banks not needing crypto banks as a path for to the future but that's not the full story is because i feel like very much we do need them as a bridge um particularly now to legitimize the industry and to essentially provide a heat shield to the nation states um so i you know i have a somewhat a divided opinion myself on that like um i don't love the blacklist that's not like crypto anarchist that's not super um super bankless but at the same time we need crypto banks as a bridge to fiat and to embrace this tech if we want the wider movement to succeed sorry david you're going to say something yeah at the very least the technology that crypto offers us offers us like a weapon right it offers us a check upon banks and so the mere existence of open permissionless protocols is is what created this in the first place and that kind of brings us to the conversation of die right so we had a hundred thousand dollars worth of usdc revoked i don't know a lot more of tether that was blacklisted anyone who got tether blacklisted from them or uscc blacklisted they're not going to use that product again they're going to use die probably as the most permissionless censorship resistant stablecoin crypto dollar that that's out there right and the amount of that got blacklisted versus the total supply of dye is significant right there's 190 million die out there and what got blacklisted was like 500 000 almost maybe a million dollars and so i i think there's also going to be a conversation coming between like users of usdc versus users of thigh because illicit users of usdc are going to be pushed into dye and i'm worried about dye's branding as like why are you using dye bro like just use usdc like what are you what are you doing what are you up to like what what what is your transaction's history even look like why why do why do you even need to use die uh and so i'm kind of worried about like the nation state stance towards die because they're pushing all the illicit activity out of usdc that's a really interesting point i think it's paul stork talks about having meta privacy so as you like not only having privacy when you transact but having the notion of transacting with a specific system not being considered to be illegitimate because it's primarily used for illicit purposes or what is perceived to be illicit so that that's a great point about potentially not having meta privacy when you die i don't know if you guys have read the fatif uh report on the quote unquote so-called stable coins yeah it actually makes for pretty interesting reading um so i definitely recommend reading it to get a sense of what regulators really think about this stuff and they do directly contrast die and uh fiat back stable coins or not die by name but they implicitly refer to it um and so-called stable coins and what they say is yeah decentralized stable coins are very hard to regulate in any way but they're they basically say they're not as worried about it because they don't think that they're going to grow as large as fiat back stable coins but they do say that that's like kind of a strategic worry that they're like monitoring and that kind of thing so they totally acknowledge the difference in in decentralization we'll include that um report actually in the notes today because it's a fascinating report and i think one of the few i've read from a a group like that that actually understands the distinction between these stable coins they totally got it yeah yeah i don't know if we want these people to be the sophisticated ones about it right yeah they get it yeah and they're advising you know the g7 and um central bankers um around the world so it's uh it's fascinating nick um this has been absolutely phenomenal to to have you on i want to do uh one more plug so nick and castle island put out a phenomenal paper a white paper on um stable coins this week last week that you absolutely have to check out and in fact there's a i'd love to chat with you about this maybe sometime in the future nick um the entire section that that you guys put together on a new dawn uh for free banking um so we will include that a link to that white paper in the show notes and look look through the whole paper but in particular page 21 and 22 and 23 are where you're going to find um this kind of model of free banking from kind of the scottish archetype to crypto banks to the things that defy is is trying to do with with systems like maker um just a great rage so um make sure you take a look at that and and well done nick that's a great paper i don't know um how you guys find the time to put all this stuff together but it's great we appreciate it an important topic so i we wanted to bring attention to it and also translate it to a language that non-crypto people would understand so as you can tell it's kind of actually meant i mean it's a great reference for crypto people but it's also really meant as something that outsiders could dig their teeth into and understand hey wow this crypto phenomenon's interesting there's um this enormous parallel financial infrastructure which has been built out and is being used so i wanted to introduce outsiders to these practitioners that are basically indicating this as a financial infrastructure as opposed to just a mere asset class yeah absolutely we did a great job of that um nick it's been phenomenal to have you thank you so much for joining state of the nation today thanks guys take care david uh how much more time do we have sir uh we are hitting the 50-minute mark okay well that's a bit long yeah yeah good stuff to talk about lots of stuff to talk about you know what um maybe we should just kind of cut it off now you think um and uh leave some of these other topics we're going to talk about yep put them in the backpack put them in the backpack we're going to talk about the coinbase ipo i guess in short guys um coinbase is looking like they are going to ipo at some point maybe this year even we think that is extraordinarily bullish for uh for the entire crypto asset class legitimacy legitimizing people people love shovels people want to invest in shovels and coinbase is a shovel and having that being available on the public stock market is super legitimizing and it'll just look very well around the rest of crypto yeah i think it's going to draw the eyes of wall street certainly also even just the transparency alone so you know when they they publish quarterly earnings reports in 10ks and those sorts of things they're going to have to list out all of their annual sales how much bitcoin how much each they sold it'll be phenomenal to have that so that's big and i think lines up with our you know thesis of this is 2016. you know that there's a lot of things building that could explode at any point in time the last thing we will include a link to our first bankless nation drop so this is a community drop with the bzx token don't have time to get into it today but we'll include a item in the show notes and for your action items list if you want to dig a little bit deeper into the bankless nation all the things that were going on there's this thing called a bankless token badge that you can pick up uh become a subscriber pick that up and you can start partic participating in bankless governance national governance items and uh there's actually going to be a token drop to nft holders token holders that is coming i believe sometime today or tomorrow we actually don't have control of that they basically the issuers themselves look at the list and they see the value of the bankless nation the community and they're like we want your engagement we want your governance help and they issue tokens to our uh two nft addresses that hold the tokens so it's a pretty exciting development i think this is the first maybe community drop that i've seen that is really member based yeah i think there's a huge rabbit hole of conversation to go down and i do hope at one point into the future we do talk about that but part of the vision of and why we call this a bankless nation it's because it has its constituency right so you the listener are part of the bankless nation and so uh i think as a political force the bankless nation is cohering together slowly and we're just we're rallying the troops and giving ev getting everyone into the same room so that our voices are louder together right like we all want to have we all deserve uh participation in the greater ethereum ecosystem and as a result all these applications with the this is the vision the applications will arise and look to tap into the power and influence of the bankless nation and they're they're going to do that with these sort of token drops these governance drops to the bankless badge holders which is why you should get a bankless badge yeah you definitely should and you know it's exactly we said david and the reason this is so important is because god bless the vcs god bless the crypto banks we don't want them as the primary and only shareholders in governance decisions for our d5 protocols right we want individual retail users like you to be involved in the governance process that's how we decentralize and the protocols want that too they recognize that that's key for their success so i think this is a win for everybody we're going to wrap it right there action items today you've got a few reading assignments so read the crypto dollars report that nick carter put out with castle island we will include a link to the show notes also check out the bankless badge drop we'll include a link to that as well uh david wrote a fantastic article last week david um you actually um did on on the channel too you have a a audio recording of it with with you reading it you want to give a tease on that yeah so take your pick if you like to read or listen maybe because you're listening to this you are a listener uh so you can go to the bank list youtube and check me reading out that article to you or you can just go straight to the bankless website and get the article in word form it's called uh the global public goods and the protocol sync the protocol sync is a theme that you have heard many times on this show and we really pull back the layers as to what that thing actually is what is at the bottom of the protocol sync it's an it's a meaningful question and i offer my answer to it so check that out all right that's it from us that was episode five the state of the bankless nation is hedged we are hedged against nation state politics we have an alternative money system we have an alternative economy and we are headed west thank you so much for joining us
