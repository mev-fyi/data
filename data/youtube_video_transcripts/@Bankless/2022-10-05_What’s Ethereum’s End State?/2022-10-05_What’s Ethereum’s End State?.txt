how would you describe ethereum's end State what does ethereum look like and what does it deliver for the world just having a well-functioning global cryptocurrency is a huge amount of value by itself especially valuable to what people outside of the first world ethereums ethos from the beginning right I think has been to insist on a few particular values but otherwise not have its own picture of like what specific things it brings to the world but weave that up to the ecosystem and lots of different groups to create their own Vision ethereum being the substrate for Dao's index mechanisms that do other things so identity is one of the biggest examples what can we create some kind of more decentralized model of identity you know could we actually do the whole blockchain based social media thing I don't think there is one vision for what ethereum could do I think there's many different Visions once ethereum manages to solve its scaling problems it's going to be in a much better place to help be the substrate that allows all of those missions to happen
