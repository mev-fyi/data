sign up at coinshift.xyz bankless okay let's start where we always do macro picture zenico what are you tracking how are you feeling about the state of the nft market and the market generally yeah i think i feel so like the merge literally happened uh eight hours ago or something so it's all very fresh macro is a global macro is very bad still nothing has really changed there uh eath price well inflation came in higher than expected yeah that was like the change that kind of precipitated the first round of crashing prices docks tanking and then yeah and it was sort of like uh everything was tanking but like eth was holding up relatively better compared to everything else but then i think the merge happened it went well everyone was expecting it to go well and price was like classic uh buy the room and sell the news and it well as of now it sounds like 1500 who knows where it's going to go uh i i don't pretend to have any sort of insider predictions there as for the nft market it it kind of seems like there's signs of life again just literally today that we haven't seen for a while renga is really pumping a lot um anamura is pumping a bunch uh there were a bunch of crypto punk sales it's there's just been a little more life like if you if you go back over the last two weeks it's been just completely dead like things are bleeding and it's been miserable out there today maybe there's signs of life and it's probably opium that you know things are going to pick up and be bullish but um i'm feeling particularly optimistic today in uh yeah but it's still not a great market by any stretch of the imagination like there's still all of the same problems that we had a week here a month ago six months ago like over supply and uh not enough new entrance not enough new money macro is bad all that kind of stuff but a few projects are pumping today which is just nice to see yeah and i think longer term projects initiatives some that we'll talk about today that are on the horizon that i think will bring those new users bring that increased energy now what that will do to existing pfp style projects none of us know of course but signs of life in in any number of ways this week i feel like just just cool news coming out of the space generally uh the merge yes you mentioned it prices have dipped quite a bit i mean you can literally track the chart it's like four a.m like basically an hour or so four am eastern time right like right after kind of the merge it goes through it's completed it all looks good just uh practically a straight line down uh from that moment forward which really just says people were expecting it to happen and to succeed and i think there was questions around that right it was like will the price pump after the merge and that would have been a sign that people were still skeptical about it in some capacity or maybe didn't think it was going to happen and then a successful merge would have caused the price to pump but the reality was everyone who was paying enough attention to be owning ethereum on the basis of this news clearly was was pretty optimistic about it and uh and so there's a dip completely unfazed by it at all of course i don't think it really means anything um and you and i have already described on this podcast just with the supply demand economics look like and and how much more beneficial they i guess officially now are yeah now that the merge has gone through and and i've been beating the drum just on the environmental side of this yes how incredibly exciting it is that um you know we we are no longer sort of the circus freak of the carbon world i saw a really great chart just like half an hour ago and it was just sort of uh if anyone talks to you about the environmental impact of nfts on each send them this graph and it's like it shows youtube it shows gold it shows bitcoin it shows ethereum proof of stake and then you go all the way down and it's like ethereum proof of sorry ethereum proof of work and then right all the way down pre ethereum proof of stake it's like 0.01 compared to like everything else it's just that narrative is going to circulate and i i think eventually maybe even soon but yeah mainstream will catch on more brands and institutions that had previously been looking at tazos or polygon or solana might now be more open to eath and artists like there's so many artists that the singular reason they did not want to create nfts was the environmental impact now obviously there's other reasons like the artificial scarcity and then just the the whole monetary system of it all but for a lot of people that was a a hindering block and i think yeah and i will say that the artists are who really permeated the media narrative like i went back and looked at a lot of the like anti-nft on the basis of environmentalism coverage and that coverage very much centered on artists and you know all these news stories use the same sources over and over again there were like a couple of artists in particular who were like i was so excited about nfts but i'm this huge environmentalist and the second i realized that like all of my other efforts to protect the environment had gone to like my my attempts to eliminate my carbon footprint were all for naught because this single nft that i sold did all of this damage which it also was a misunderstanding but that was really the basis of a lot of press coverage around it so totally i think the artist thing is huge because they get uh they get press outlets covering what they're doing and what they're thinking yeah um are you i'm assuming the answer is no but let's see are you planning on trying to grab any opportunities on the proof of work oh chain no no yeah i was just sitting on my hands i uh i think someone said like the futures for eth proof of worker trading at like less than one percent of ethereum's stakes was like you could try and and bridge and fork and claim like 15 for your 1500 each and something like that and and the risks of replay attacks and all sorts of other stuff i was just i am nowhere near smart enough or confident enough to battle it out with the bots and yeah just just sit in your hands is my approach i agree i agree and you know i think there's there's no future for the proof-of-work chain and so or fork or whatever it ends up being so um i'm just staying away from it all right um so speaking of brands coming in and and being mindful of the environmental narrative starbucks nfts this was big news this week people posting about it everywhere that they're launching on polygon which they cited being because it was proof of stake i was reading a lot of the coverage of it over the last couple of days and being like the irony of yeah like touting choosing polygon because it's proof of stake when you know ethereum is we're you know hours away at this point uh give us your take what are your thoughts on starbucks nfts yeah i think it's overall a really big win and a net positive to see a brand as like they have like a hundred million people enter their doors every single day they have uh more locations around the world than almost anything else i think more than mcdonald's or maybe maybe that used to be the case but not anymore does that mean where you're in uh san francisco and or seattle and the starbucks on every single block corner and they're everywhere and they have a loyalty rewards program that has i think 25 million members if i remember that remembering correctly and they're basically transitioning that to incorporating nfts or digital collectibles or digital uh that they tried reasonably hard not to use the word nfts but then in like the official uh publication they do say it but they will be getting people into the ecosystem of owning digital assets and i think that is the most significant thing and you know you talk about how it's it's on polygon and not eath but i think that's it's probably for gas costs more than anything rather than the environmental impact and i think that it's obviously going to be somewhat of a closed garden and it's not going to be this truly open you know metaverse or like open marketplace where people are buying and selling i think but maybe i'll be proven wrong there and a lot of like the rewards are going to be very specific so it's like you can earn these nfts and then um maybe upgrade them and then claim rewards like uh a discounted coffee grinder or access to a i think they have like online workshops and then maybe you can go visit one of their coffee plantations and and stuff like that which is really cool like those are great benefits and it is a good use case and i think uh it's a great way to onboard a lot of people trojan horse them trojan horse them in basically so and that puzzled it in my mind a huge net positive to my mind one thing is when i think loyalty programs i think airlines and i think like coffee shops like the only card in my wallet you know the stamp cards you know you collect 10 and you get a free one that i use with any sort of consistency is my coffee shop i go to a local coffee shop in fidei suited and it's because i buy it every day on morning and i buy tea right but i get my iced tea there every morning and so i i maintain that card and i maintain those stamps so those kinds of loyalty card programs and coffee has always been the thing in my mind that's such a no-brainer if we get there because it's an everyday habitual thing for folks who use it in a way that very few other purchases are um and i think what was so striking about this is it's it's a loyalty program on steroids right they're they're late stage capitalism in many ways is like squeezing the last drops of juice out of you know existing customers or getting uh you know getting a few more people to pay attention to your brand than to that other brand and that's where nfts really come to play i mean we talk about it when it comes to creators and how creators can now better monetize their super fans but it applies to brands too and that's i think what we're seeing here with starbucks is how can we just get more eyeballs and more time spent interacting with the starbucks brand and nfts as ultimately the most convenient sensible way to do that one thing that struck me is they're talking about to your point all of these really cool benefits like okay you can play these interactive games or you can take on challenges to show your knowledge of starbucks and then you'll earn these they call them journey stamps and then these journey stamps might unlock really amazing benefits like going and touring one of their coffee plants in costa rica they could have offered those experiences previously to their customers like there's nothing actually requiring them to use nft technology to say hey if you're such a super fan that you collected all of these stamps in our system because you engage with our brand so much we're going to send you to cost request they could have done that previously but there's this almost psychological unlock that i feel like is happening because of nfts with creators with brands where they're actually thinking about doing this kind of thing now in a way they just previously weren't and this technology is certainly ultimately going to be a much better way to unlock those experiences than the tech that they had previously but they could have done it previously so there also feels like there's this just psychological shift in the way brands are thinking about marketing and consumers and an audience engagement that doesn't require the tech but is being facilitated by the tech yeah it makes it uh just a little cleaner and you're totally right it's this mindset shift where people are now brands companies are thinking about how they can add value and enhance the user experience customer experience consumer experience whatever whatever you want to call it uh they could have done it without nfts but nfts i mean it does solve real-world issues it eliminates almost entirely fraud like and if someone loses um someone could like potentially sell their you know if someone gets all these rewards and it's like they're like i don't care about going to costa rica they could potentially sell that where and this depends on how open and close their marketplace actually is but um most traditional reward systems would probably not allow you to to sell your rewards and then and pass it on to someone else that have terms and conditions being like you have to use it but if we go where i hope we go and these do become open marketplaces then you will have an open market for all sorts of stuff like that and someone who could be a customer who spends a lot of time and money at starbucks but they want to sell all their rewards because they don't care about that kind of stuff and then there's someone else who maybe they don't spend that much time going to starbucks with like there's a particular reward that's really cool maybe like i think they mentioned that collab with artists as well so they could have really excellent artists come in and create pieces that someone external to the ecosystem might want to collect and then it's just like all this cross-pollination and hopefully win-win-win situations yeah the other reason this is a big deal is we talk about the social signaling potential for nfts or the you know the value prop there that one of the reasons this stuff is inevitable is because people want to socially signal and they want to they want to tell stories about themselves and nft is our way to tell stories about yourself and i've always given the example of like when and i've used coffee shops actually as this example of like when your receipts everywhere are nfts and the coffee shop you go to every morning gives you an nft as your receipt and your gigi hadid or insert mega star here and your fans can go look at your wallet and be like oh my gosh gigi drinks xyz coffee every day because we see these receipts like that's a powerful thing but but for that to occur and you could extrapolate that out to any different kinds of markets you know music to concert tickets etc that requires a preponderance of people to have wallets and to have nft wallets that are mainstream enough that people know where to go and look and see what's in your wallet et cetera et cetera so again it's about onboarding more users right about way of saying what we all already know and starbucks has a massive freaking audience of people who are probably not currently native to nfts who are going to participate in this and and starbucks was very adamant like without even knowing that they're actually getting into an nft or getting into a blockchain ecosystem so i think that's really exciting getting you know new people into the space because we need those network effects for the social signaling piece to be fully realized the question mark is if all of these badges and these starbucks journey or journey stamps etc live within this sort of walled ecosystem ultimately we need to have it that there are wallets like like an instagram or a place where people know to go to see all of the nfts that people hold right so like people aren't going to go to other people's starbucks account yeah pages you know like there's going to have to be more of a um platform yeah where you can go and see all all of the nfts that people hold but that's in starbucks best interest to integrate with something like that because they want people showing off that they have starbucks journey stamps like that only feeds their ecosystem so yeah um anyway very very exciting stuff was there you posted something funny i think about the starbucks which was like a screenshot of the google if you like google search i googled starbucks nft and the top result was the the starbucks announcement and the one directly under that in my google response was from gizmodo saying like starbucks unrolls its dumbass nft project and then you click through and they're like cutting into shreds and they mean they make some valid points but uh it was what were the valid points um i think it's it's kind of like that they're just using it as a way to extract more value from their their ecosystem and like trying to almost brainstorm that's what capitalism is exactly yeah in order to get these rewards you have to answer quizzes about starbucks it's like what year was starbucks founded and all of a sudden now people are doing this research and now you're just creating this mini cult-like environment but i mean that's obviously a pessimistic view yeah i think there's uh a much much larger reasonable middle ground where you can have fun experiences that are net positive win win win and reward people meaningfully for their um efforts and loyalty really totally and do you know how many people in this world would love to get a starbucks coffee because they answered questions rather than exactly by paying like yeah it's i don't know it's just so silly people i i it was very biased but it was just fun and like yeah fine some of that's some that's valid but people just have a pathological distaste for for change and um yeah anyway okay the doodles news doodles raised 54 million dollars at a 700 million dollar valuation the round was led by 776 which is alexis ohanian's venture fund and a couple other venture funds here we had 10 t holdings a crew capital and ftx ventures not asics you made that funny tweet that was the first thing that jumped out at me was i was like oh like i it was like i was like oh wait where's like where's mom and dad like what do you mean how is this possible when was the last time we saw a fundraise announcement that didn't include a16z what do you make of that uh it's not surprising i think they even announced a while back they were exploring this and and uh probably gonna be raising capital it is just another in a string of many many of these s-tier pfp projects that have raised vc capital obviously the largest most notable was bought apes uh it was like 500 million at like a 4.5 billion or 450 million to 4.5 billion valuation um proof raised 50 million recently uh i mean cool cats raised uh everyone's raising basically and there's just a bit of the narrative is shifting now where like used to happen people like yay great that's so much money and it's great for holders and i think it was because it was a bull market and it was a great news meme event where prices went up but now people are digging in a bit deeper and being like hang on why is it good for holders what where is the value accrual coming from if these vcs are investing into the company not into nfcs they're buying the actual company equity uh they are going to want a profit and how are they going to realize that profit it's by the ecosystem generating revenue and one of those ways to generate revenue is by selling nfts and secondary market sales which effectively makes the nft holder the customer rather than like an a first-class citizen in the ecosystem like many people thought and there was also i mean there has been a long-standing uh misconstrued and misaligned understanding where a lot of people think that they're like literally buying equity in a company which is very clearly not the case but and i think more and more people are realizing that but certainly some people had some sort of impression that hey i have an nft i'm entitled to financial upside directly from the company doing well and all that is just getting messy and the narrative is emerging now and i think people are becoming a little more anti-vc yeah i think doodles precipitated this because the announcement was preceded by a month and a half or two months or whatever it was a complete silence and so there was this already building resentment within the community around not feeling heard not feeling responded to not feeling engaged with and and then you have this vc announcement and it's like where do we stand with all this i'm gonna be honest i think people are being kind of babies like let me summarize what's going on i listened to the whole doodles call doodles is trying to build disney they want to be a 200 billion dollar freaking global conglomerate business that lasts 100 years your nft in their mind will be worth something for the same reason that original disney collectibles are worth a ton of money because you have the earliest incarnations of what they plan to make a very very incredibly valuable ip but it's a collectible on crack in the sense that along the way by holding this collectible you are going to have benefits throughout this whole experience jordan castro gave a number of examples of like hey if we launch a game it may only be token holders who are able to launch a guild and then other you know anybody can come on and play the game but but only the guilds will be run by original holders or if we launch a music video as part of the music you know program that we're launching we'll cast original doodle characters in the music video and pay you a licensing fee for the fact that we're using your doodle so fundamentally the run-up of the value of your token will be as a entertainment collectible thing like a you know mickey mouse collectible or a r2d2 collectible but you are gonna have these other benefits that come along the ride for this journey so no they don't really give an f if you're mad that they didn't retweet your fan art and i get why that's a painful transition for people to go through because they're going from what felt like this like community you know it's about us and this we're in this group and we're doing twitter whatever but like okay it's changed and they're becoming that's they're trying to become disney it's not that confusing i feel like people want to make it confusing because they're struggling with change yeah no i don't disagree it's also i think just like you said um the optics of not announcing anything for 54 days plus we're just in the depths of a bear market and people are just craving just direct revenue and money in their pockets at this point in time and it's just like the market has just significantly changed we are not where we were six months ago certainly not where we were a year ago and i think that it's going to take a while for people to adjust i i agree like i don't think if easies are bad or evil by any stretch of the imagination they allow companies to scale very quickly to places they might not have been able to in time spans they certainly would not have been able to um and it's not just about the money a lot of people think but there's a lot of connections and yes um things that can help like you know media announcements and and you know relationships that can be built and connected um it it is still a little antithetical to what a lot of people maybe thought of when it came to web 3 and these nfc communities where it a lot of people were hoping for it to be the community together building something without big bad vcs and web true corporations coming in and taking a big chunk of the pie but again it's this misunderstanding of and maybe i i can't remember how doodles announced it to begin with and various projects have had different narratives around what they're selling when they when they sell their nfts uh but certainly people did not necessarily expect to have a collectible in the next disney they maybe wanted something a little more like they had the doodle bank where they were paying grants for people to do things and the community was building the brand up and now all of a sudden it's like it's shifted to something incredible obviously it's like they have a lot of money and a lot of connections and and really a lot of talent and a very well recognized brand so they they have a ton of opportunity for success but it's just it's that change that i think people are uncomfortable with it it totally is and i don't want to sound entirely insensitive but to continue to sound entirely insensitive you can't have it both ways like you're saying people didn't necessarily think they were buying you know a piece of the next disney they thought they thought and that's where the sentence ends because people didn't know like none of us knew there was like this kind of in the vagueness and we've talked about this a lot they reward specificity and they they i'm sorry they punish specificity and they reward abstractness so when they bought doodles they were like we love this team maybe there's some magic something that can happen where it can just stay us 10 000 holders or you know what whatever it is and the price can just keep pumping like that's not realistic so if you're gonna think long term in terms of building a massive brand that will ultimately mean your doodle has a lot of value you need to onboard a hell of a lot more people which means not just caring what the original 10 000 people think but thinking bigger about how do we get another million people on board and there's an inherent tension with like in my opinion listening to like the early adopters who they're already sold by the vision you know and figuring out how to sell the vision to another million people so that your price can continue maybe not linearly but in the long term going up and i think folks just have to accept that again not trying to be insensitive i mean the doodlebank thing to me was it felt like one of the sillier moments on this twitter space that the the doodles team did where people are people are upset because there's not a lot of energy i guess around the doodle bank in terms of proposals getting passed they're not getting quorum of enough people like actually passing it and they're like looking to the team like well we look forward to hearing your strategies for how you're going to incentivize people to use the doodle bank and it's like there's 2600 eth in there like that's your damn incentive like like like that this is supposed to be a community fund and there have been projects that were passed recently there was some tri-wizard tournament like concept that just got allocated 60 eth like for people with strong ideas who really mobilized the community there are things being passed by the doodle bank and the expectation that the team should be spending a lot of time i just think it's totally backwards it's short-term thinking yes it might drive short-term value to your nft in the sense that the same x number of thousands of people who buy these pfps can trade them around a bunch and pump them up and whatever but it's not actually going to grow the pie if they're focused on that right now and i just think people are a little bit missing that in a way that 100 i would like to call out it all comes back to uh i think something i wrote about my newsletter impossible expectations about how it is literally impossible for a nft project a company especially in this space to please everyone or even please the majority of people because you have people that minted day one you have people that bought it five if you have people that bought it thirty eighth you have all these different people who paid different entry prices and that's just one element of it they all have different expectations some people are happy to be just owning a collectible in the next disney some people want it to be all about the doodle bank other people want it to be um they think they were buying part of the company and it's just like it's all over the place that's what you get when you have this open sale to thousands of people and i don't think anyone any project has quite figured out how to reconcile that piece just because of the nature of like nft selling on openc anyone can go and buy at any price the market will do what it's one and then all of a sudden you have no control over who your holders are and then they get angry and they come in discord and it's just like it's it's not really on the team but like there is communication that the team can do to improve that situation but it's just a systemic issue with the entire space i think with impossible expectations i talk about they come into the discord and like yell and get mad i thought about that because i understand this tension between hey we raised money from vcs so now we have we're quite legally beholden to these vcs in a way that we're not legally beholden to our token holders and so this question of like i i guess like why didn't you raise from us but it feels like there's this element of like why did you take money from vcs you know instead of us they screamed angrily on their laptops in twitter and in discord and with profanity and it's like because they don't like who wants to be you know legally bound to 10 000 people that scream at you sometimes irrationally on twitter over board members that you can get on the phone with and frankly have a rational conversation with like you know i tweeted something that was like i do think there's going to be pain in the future i think more and more projects are going to start having this fundamental problem which is they're trying to professionalize they're trying to become really legitimate businesses and there is a total tension between benefiting the vcs or your equity holders and benefiting your token holders who are not legally equity holders and that's an unfortunate position to be in and it arises simply because if these companies were to give equity to the token holders it would become an illegal security and that wasn't an option i don't think all of the i think there are projects that would actually choose to raise from just their token holders if they if they could and if they could fund it at the scale they needed to and if they could do it legally but they can't and so they turn to the vcs for that reason but i think the other side of this coin is what i just articulated which i think some would still choose to take vc money anyway oh absolutely because they have the connections and because you were talking about people who typically have had experience building massive businesses as opposed to 5 000 anonymous folks on line who may not have as much experience you know building a business or valuable insight et cetera et cetera um yeah i i i i do i spoke with a bunch of this was a while back but like a bunch of founders that had come into the nft in web 3 space from traditional web 2 startup culture and backgrounds where they would raise vc funding and by and large the consensus was always i thought having to answer the vcs was bad until you have thousands of people who paid 75 for an nft in discord you know demanding action on a daily basis it's like vc's uh i mean i've heard a lot of people saying that they don't love the demands that vcs might place on them every vc is different but it's still uh i guess a little more professional and a little more structured and a little more understanding and less uh chaotic that you get with thousands of stakeholders it is easier to talk to five people than it is to talk to 5000. that's just the reality we all know that feeling like it's just trying to be honest when there's situations with nuance in a twitter space of 5 000 people some of whom some small tiny minority of whom probably on like a like virtually a partisan ideological level have reasons that they want the project to fail and they want to twist and spin whatever you're gonna say is just a much more miserable experience and a harder experience than being honest in a room of five people who you've kind of hand selected and trust have your best interest in mind like they're not comparable experiences and i think doodles and again i don't own doodles i'm but i am i have been very i'm very bullish on that because i think the team is smart i think the way they're approaching this is smart the way they're not capitulating to their holders i know holders hate to hear it but i think it's smart and the way they went about picking their vcs i mean the fact that a16z isn't in there to me says something it says that they were very intentional about who they wanted on board and i think a16z already has a set of ideas around how projects should run i think you know are very involved with yuga which is a different direction than doodles is trying to go you know i just heard from various folks i think they were very intentional of like we want to have a lot of autonomy and so vcs who are going to let us have a lot of autonomy and let us do what we want to do is who we're going to go with because we do have our pick of the litter in terms of which vcs we bring on board so even that to me speaks to their just leadership and and vision which is what i've felt from doodles for a very long time like you said folks in the beginning maybe didn't buy on thinking they were buying into the next disney for example and that's fair and again i get that but i don't think they necessarily had a vision of exactly what they were buying into either they they wanted that vision to come from the top but then the second you have a specific vision people are gonna be people who feel angry about that which fine but doodles has pretty consistently to me been driving in this direction like from pretty early on when when jordan came on the podcast i don't even know when that was last year like you could tell this was the direction they were driving and they're being really intentional about it so i'm very team corporate doodle over kind of team holders who are aggrieved that they didn't tweet for a month and and again look i get it and i i frankly think they maybe should have just thrown a gm out there into the ether because who cares and and make people you know know that you're you're still around but i think doodles is building smart and this is a long long-term game and they're setting boundaries so they can achieve that that long-term gain yeah no absolutely how does board apes get away with it just because they're good at like tweeting like why has board apes got like managed to to um like toe the line where everybody's like seems thrilled with them and comfortable with the vc funding and i'm not so sure i think that they're just that they are anymore i think that narrative is changing quite a lot where yeah like even myself as an ape holder i'm less thrilled with the direction ever since i saw the leaked deck from uh when they were raising and it had things like yeah we're gonna drop a hundred thousand other side our expected profit is one to two with each profit margin is 99 and and this is and it's just like it was very oh okay so this is straight profit that we as a company going to extract from the community and then like the cost to build the game is this much less and it's just like okay so these are all the ways we can raise capital and um i i think we're still in like a mania bullish cycle when that came out other side was coming out people got air drops and uh but then that drop happened and it was kind of the pico top of the entire nft market this year and it's sort of basically been down ever since then um yes i mean i i am getting less bullish on yuga obviously they have a lot going for them they have like just a tremendous amount but just i don't know philosophically it is a little irksome the way that that all unraveled and and their communication after the fact was just odd like oh it's ethereum's fault that our smart contracts were very gas guzzlers yeah that was that was the lack of ownership there was just bad lack of accountability well and what you're getting at and again because i i i can actually take both sides of this is there was a tweet by punk4156 that i actually retweeted with some commentary that was like founders are absolutely engaging in a bait and switch around here selling you on the meme of protocol ownership then leveraging the hype to keep it for themselves at high valuations while claiming the nft was always the product so basically like they're selling you on this idea that you're like partly an owner and then they're now sort of getting these high valuations and being like no the nft was always just like a collectible they're always just a product you're not really an owner and i'm totally sympathetic to that i think the devil's in the details right which is certainly that was people's impression certainly there was this there's been this narrative that it's this new world of ownership which could be interpreted to mean like you own a piece of yuga or you own a piece of doodles and but i think you'd have to really go back and and go look specifically at specific companies and specifically what their comms have been historically to figure out were were the how much were the companies really pushing that narrative and how much was that the kind of broader narrative that was getting attached to companies and they weren't really correcting it do you see what i'm saying there like some projects i think certainly were pushing that i think some projects just rode that wave and wrote that set of assumptions but didn't necessarily foster it themselves that it's it's dicey right it's it's always been dicey yeah it's been all over the place and you know we've literally seen the whole spectrum where i remember it was i think around this time last year september october uh we went this whole phase of dows and erc20 tokens and people like would literally talk about passive income on the open seat description and it was just like crazy and everyone's like yeah i'm just buying a piece of this and i'm gonna do this they would do these calculations be like i'm gonna earn 400 000 a year by having 10 and it's just like it that was one extreme and then you have the other extreme whereas just i guess pure art and then all these 10k collections largely falls somewhere in the grayer especially the you know the more respectable ones have obviously tried i mean done things legally and and not stated that people are that they're selling unregulated uh illegal securities but uh the community like you said in many instances would have run with that and maybe they didn't course correct and weigh into those conversations as much as they should have it's really hard to tell i think the really complicated thing here is going to come when certain companies do incredibly well and the token holders don't so for example doodles to me has a really good shot at achieving this disney-like dream as far as all the players in the space go right that's an incredibly hard vision and disney is a company that is 200 years old right so but in terms of their the the doodle's potential relative to call it 99 of what's in the space to become a really mainstream entertainment brand um that who's like original holders like the original ip has collectible value i think is pretty high relative to others i think there are also will be projects in this space and companies that take their original ip or their you know whatever and um do very well and and have a lot of success and it doesn't translate into the original token being a coveted collectible item that's worth more and that's going to be really uncomfortable the reason i feel like i'm almost harsher on the doodle community is i think like they have the they have actually a really good shot of this happening in the long term you know and of the of their original token and of that collectible really going up in value as the company itself gains in prominence but there's other projects where i don't think that's going to happen where i think there will be companies that will do very well and the original token won't and that's that's going to be painful and a hard pill to swallow and i think they're going to be disappointed people when that happens yeah absolutely it's also a matter of time frame as well like building like you said disney is a 200 year old company it is if doodles wants to be the next disney it's it's going to take years i think for there to be pure collectible value on these early nfts i think for the next five ten years price might go up uh but it'll largely be speculative value and people still speculating that there's going to be it's all like people speculating that well there'll be even greater collectible value in the future it's like kind of like the greater fools theory but then like if the brand does turn up then there are people who genuinely do care to collect it but i would wager that 95 of people holding all nfts are just hoping to sell it at a high price at a future date which is uh the bubble basically there is a floor value and we don't know what it is but there's a floor amount of value to doodles because there is a certain level of utility or you know they're like getting into their events they're going to do these music collaborations with pharrell and your your doodle might be able to be cast in a music video or you know there will be they will inject enough opportunities for the original holders that will that there will be a floor of like this is worth something based on this utility what that is is unclear but everything above that point is that is that speculation until they really cement themselves as an ip that has collectible value to people and that's a really hard thing to do and you know so so remains to be seen but i think they have as good a shot as any that we see right now in actually pulling that off um last thing on the doodles front they did announce they have 19 new roles that they are opening up and uh i just i i gave this word of warning i guess to folks on on the show that i do with robbie ferguson between two layers the moodlex podcast you guys should go check it out we talked about raising capital and valuations and um one of the best pieces of advice is that i've gotten as i've navigated applying to startups and living life i guess is like if you're thinking of joining a startup thinking of joining something like doodles where a big part of your compensation or a big part of the of the appeal of the compensation is likely equity you really need to think long and hard about what the valuation of the company is what you think the valuation of that company could be because the difference between those two is like that's what you personally have to gain from your equity so doodles is already at a 700 million dollar valuation that's a huge ass valuation which means like it has to be a uniform corn it has to be a multi-billion dollar company for your equity to go up from whatever the initial offer is and i think people don't really think strategically enough about this and we saw this in the bear market it was i think a huge problem where you had all sorts of young people joined startups that had crazy valuations because it was the bull market and i'm talking outside of web3 right i'm talking just broadly in the world and then and their equity is now underwater because the valuation wasn't reasonable and it wasn't it it had gotten so inflated relative to what historical norms were so i think doodles has has big potential but building a multi-billion dollar company and then building a 10 billion dollar company or a 20 billion dollar company is really hard only so many of them exist in the world and many people only so many of them exist many many years and yeah there's so much risk i i completely agree with everything you said yeah so you just have to think about that if you're joining join doodles because you love the culture and you love the project and you're excited to work there every day and your equity on the top be worth a bunch someday immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9 000

and it appears that i will no longer be able to have video which is really disappointing because it's like the one day i put makeup on because i have another recording and then i have a bunch of events later today so i was like all right i'll look cute for this and then lo and behold that's the damn day that my video cuts out so you can't even tell that i'm looking cute okay blame the merge we blame the merge yeah this is the real why it went too well yeah [Laughter] okay i want to talk about another set of ip that i love dearly that i do hold which is aku and akutars um we're going to talk about disney in just a minute disney had their d23 conference recently which is their big annual corporate conference i actually they they apparently they wanted to kind of make it like an alternative to comic-con and like wanted to do their own kind of conference the way they wanted to do it for their ip so that was i guess where this whole concept originated for this d23 conference that they do um but akutar and micah johnson that project was the only non-disney ip project to be represented at d23 which is like a really big deal if you think about what it could mean who the hell knows now i'll say it's because micah is the first creator was the first creator in the visa creators program and visa was the presenting sponsor of the d23 conference so that was the up there but nevertheless i mean really cool really exciting and uh i i folks know i'm a really big believer in aku and awkward i actually picked up two alcaters uh this past week so uh disclosure disclosure pumping my own bags i suppose yeah i have some as well and it's because you were talking them up i don't know six months ago um i went and picked up a bunch and i did more research i was like yeah this this is legit this is incredible uh this is a project i'm really happy to support and hold and the thinking long term and i would say a project that has avoided the challenges of like a doodles or or you know everything we were just talking about because they actually really haven't courted the nft space that much people don't know about them they literally are they're yes it's hilarious to me and that's you know and and what's amazing about them is is micah's actually in discord a lot i don't know as much recently i haven't been in their discord as recently um but but it's not like they don't engage with their community or their holders they really do micah just hasn't done these big pushes to like pump within the nft space and so i think he really cannot be accused of you know what i think some of these other projects get this accusation around because he hasn't he's really targeted i think the broader world and you know he's he's gotten more mainstream press than he has even crypto press in some ways but this this has just always been for me a case of an ip that resonates for me i think it's i think it's awesome i think it has that ne sais quoi you know it has that magic where i could just see this as a movie i could see this as a beloved character that um that kid's everywhere like attached to and therefore it has collector value and um that's why i uh i've grabbed them i also just think it has room you know part of my challenge is even when you have these projects that are at 70 like a doodles and we didn't even mention that doodles had actually fallen after this announcement which is interesting and shows how holders are feeling about it but like 17th is a lot of money and i believe the price of eat is going to go up you know and so you know ethan's 5k 10k like 35 000 70 000. like you got to be driving a lot of value or people have to you know really feel like this is going to be a an impressive collectible or it needs to be a really valuable collectible for to really justify that price whereas aqua towers are still sitting at you know half an eighth point seven eighth that to me has room still to to grow on some on some great news that and it doesn't have to be disney level ip to justify that kind of a price or or to pump from here so anyways that's my that's my case for aquitars yeah they're fantastic and um to your point there it's something that i don't think people necessarily think about enough and that is how much harder it is for a a nft that's 70 to 10x to 70 eath versus one that's 0.78 to go to 70th and it just requires an order of magnitude more capital and it's just we're not going to see that many and like you said even at 70 that's a crazy valuation in today's standards let alone when heath goes up so yeah i i think the i guess the quote-unquote play not financial advice but generally is to look for those lower-priced gems and there are a lot out there especially in this bear market of teams that have been building heads down engaging with their community they didn't waste their treasury they've got runway they've got plans they've got alternate revenue models perhaps and they've got ip and you know their floor price might have fallen from maybe two and a half eighth to point two like a lot of projects are down 90 95 percent but fundamentally nothing has changed it's just the entire market the macro world has all gone to hell so i think there are tremendous buy potential uh absolutely out there it's about finding them because it is a bit of a minefield there are on the flip side a lot of those projects that did mismanage their treasury and are probably gonna soft rug and pack up shop in six months so you wanna yeah it's not an easy thing to to navigate but if you put in the time and research i really think there are significant upsize returns for those who can navigate these awards as well totally and this is perhaps the most obvious thing or the thing that people always say but it's like find the that resonates for you which i will say for me there's not that much like i i love doodles clearly right but like nothing resonates for me at you know twenty thousand dollars you know like that's just that's you know kind of above where i'm willing to spend on something um but there are a handful of things like acoutars is one of them where i'm like i just want to own this like i just think this is cool and i just the story and like i want to own it and the other one for me that that hasn't launched but you can get access to the the private beta if you uh listen to my last overwatch pegs episode is toys like these little cute characters these little collectibles they're these little toys like it it you know i want to own them and so and they're at a price point that i can afford to have that feeling about so um you can be selective like again not a lot of stuff just doesn't hit me in that emotional place and aquitars is one of them and the crypt toys is and um you know i'll let you know as more do but um so anyway uh disney so we just mentioned they had their d23 corporate annual conference thing and we had a lot of interesting stuff come out of that the aquatar news was big but bob chapic who is their ceo was really like let loose and did a lot of interviews and spoke more candidly than i think we've seen him speak historically about the company and what they're looking to do and i have to say it was exciting like they like starbucks doesn't want to use the the nft phrase they he said they don't like to use the the m word which is metaverse he's like there's a lot of hair on that so um so they they stayed away from metaverse and opted for i think it was experiential lifestyle platform yeah and making decisions an experiential lifestyle platform did you see the video the ar disney video okay of the tv spilling out into the living room with uh waterfall and trees it was magical yep we will link to this for everyone to see if you missed it but i mean it looks dope it's this ar disney whatever where like you hold your phone up and yeah like a tree sprouts in your living room and there's a waterfall and now look we're still a ways away from nobody wants to like watch a movie holding their phone up to the screen like that's way too much work but when the glasses get seamless enough i mean it just strikes me that future generations are going to see like static on your tv images as the way we look at like black and white movies like not like i wouldn't watch a black and white movie if it was good enough but the bar is so much higher because it just is a duller experience than what we have today and what i can watch today and i mean this i'm i'm looking at it now it's it's so cool it looks beautiful i did have like a little fear uh you know how we had that whole phase of like 3d glasses and home tvs that are 3d and then it was like a fad but i think this is so much more and virtual reality and augmented reality is has so much more potential and when the the glasses catch up it i really agree it's gonna be this this monumental shift yeah yeah i i totally agree with you that there's there's skepticism to be had here i mean john rogers who everyone who listens to the show will know in x disney etc he's described the failure of 3d as a failure of movie studios in in the sense that they wanted to command the higher ticket price that 3d movies commanded but they didn't want to put in the work to film in 3d so avatars was such a big deal the james cameron movie avatar because he actually shot for 3d and then what you had was this wave of movie studios not shooting for 3d and then like making them 3d which was actually a much crappier experience and it burned consumers and john said that before in the context of being afraid that perhaps these studios are doing the same thing with nfts where they're doing these like really schlocky happy meal style nft projects that are going to burn consumers on you know entertainment nfts i've since had other people kind of push back and say that wasn't the only problem like even there were there were movies that were shot for 3d that still just like fundamentally weren't a better enough experience for people to like want to pay for that so i think that's true i do think it's a matter of like getting a pair of home ar glasses that are cheap enough don't cause a headache like we are some number of years away from that maybe it's 10 years maybe it's 20 years maybe it's five years i i don't know but where like it just sits next to your remote and you select to like you know there are certain experiences that are just better when you put on those hourglasses and watch it that way i i just it's hard for me not to imagine that ultimately becoming fairly mainstream in some in some time horizon i agree um they also talked about so i'll read a quote this is from a deadline article that we can link to um bob chapic we want to give people the ability to experience digitally something that's akin to the physical experience that they necessarily it's a little confusing the way it's phrased basically it sounds like they want to be able to allow people to experience digitally what they can experience at their at the disney parks um and he said like you know he's like 99 you know however many people can't actually afford or can't actually get to a disney park but we want to be able to bring that experience to them but it's even more important than that when a family comes to our parks we know exactly what you did let's say you stay a week we got seven days 24 hours we know everything that you do in the park and if you give us the permission and the ability through the membership app we'll then program your disney plus experience not according to what you watch last or what other people who watch this show watch but according to what you did and what you experienced at the park so really blending their physical disney park experience with their disney plus media entertainment experience in ways that to me are like nfts are a no-brainer part of blending the digital and the physical and um i just think you it's still a little bit squinting to see the future here but i can't see any way they do this without nfts being a just a massive component of it where you can buy the collectibles on your tv because you just watch something and that collectible is going to give you something that you're going to be able to unlock at the park when you're there like it's just no-brainer yeah it's it's that's super exciting to hear that frame of thought and yeah like that stuff can absolutely and it will absolutely happen and it it's very exciting a part of me is like a little weary of like the dystopian perspective from privacy perspectives and thinking about more and more companies tracking our data and then and us getting into echo chambers and and these places where our life is now dictated by companies rather than like maybe we lose autonomy around our decision making processes and we we need to work harder to retain that and i don't know i could go down a whole round here but it there's just the more i think about the future of of all of this that there is something to be wary of and i think that we should be mindful of that direction um but it's so exciting and and there's so much power and potential to it yes i totally agree yeah privacy is another conversation hat that's definitely the thing that you have to put aside to get excited about follow the rest of this no doubt um i wanted to throw out a number here the disney pins business have you been to disney world a lot like 15 years ago but yeah did you collect the pins when you were there i doubt it when you go to disney parks they have you you can get pins for different experiences or different characters and then you wear these little sachets and nobody can see me because again technical issues difficulties on this but i'm i'm indicating really saturation you can put the pins on it and i am not somebody who's ever been a part like a collector particularly and when i was younger and like went to disney world i was obsessed with collecting these pins i mean this was so fun and i just thought this was like the greatest thing ever the disney pins business is a hundred million dollars disney makes 100 million dollars on these pin collectibles just from the in park i mean if your head isn't spinning about the nft potential there like you are not paying enough attention it's just such a no-brainer i have family members who are huge disney people who um they used to live in orlando actually they now live in north carolina and just like can't wait to get back to orlando so they can go to disney more and like their whole house are just like disney plates that they don't use they just hang them on the wall you know to like because they are just huge disney people i mean this is a brand that the collectible value of disney ip is massive and enormous and um and the more they lean into the combining digital and the physical coupled with their naturally collectible ip orientation i mean just print baby just like nfts all day long um all right nearing the end here i think a couple shout outs maybe want to give are our girl somi in peak her company super awesome swimmy's amazing and their their first mint just happened so they just sold their first 300 it was 350 300 some nfts sold out congratulations to somi um uh i think that they cut supply so it didn't properly sold out but they cut supply and then they sold it that and then there was this effect where um because they had cut supply the full price went up because there was still demand for it and it just you know came in a little late and so they're now working on a gen 2 so it's effectively a membership card token to the in peak platform and ecosystem which comes with all sorts of utilities and benefit and access and yeah they were already planning out their gen 2 and really bringing the community along for the ride so i think it's it's a really good use case of when like a a case study of a project where the mint date doesn't go exceptionally well as planned i think they were trying to min a thousand um but some pivoted day of made some fast and hard decisions cut supply and now all the holders are happy because the floor price is up and there are people buying on secondary realizing oh there's actual value here and and there's i had a really successful town hall and an empowering full steam ahead so yeah i have a lot of respect for so me that's a great point yeah that's a a great strategy i mean she's a hustler you're right like she's one of these people that like figures out how to make it work and you're right so she said we now have 300 unique holders and they're going to give away about 100 tokens to members through a scholarship program um where folks will apply so we'll include the link to someone's tweet you can go find in peek and and if you're interested in joining the scholarship program she's really trying to build an education platform and where for like networking career development and sort of like always-on content about what's happening in this space i know you've done some classes um you know with her i'm doing another one yeah that's awesome art blocks and um yeah i just have a tremendous amount of respect for show me and she's been somebody who really has entered a number of communities i know the proof being a big one like she entered the proof discord and has been really active there as a way to like you know connect with people in this space just like she she like i said she hustles and she um it seems like builds really strong communities so a lot of respect um eight coin unlocked there's a big eight point unlock happening here in the tomorrow or two days and we're reporting this on thursday september 15th so i think it's the 16th or 17th the first uh apoint will be unlocked since apecoin was released so you've got 25 million tokens that are going to launch partner one and we don't know who launched partner one is but we can be pretty sure it's probably like animoka or a16z or i forget who the third big partner for them is but um one of those two yeah so the price is around five dollars it's been falling a little lately i i can't tell i don't know how much people are tracking this are you are you seeing a lot like in the ape community of people talking about this like it's it's definitely on people's radars it's definitely on people's radars there's um a lot of talk about the upcoming staking pools and yeah i think you need like 10 000 8 coin per board 8 original ape to max those staking pools out and like 2 000 per mutant and 900 per dog and people are doing math around how much unique uh how much you need to to get the most out of those staking pools and then i guess offsetting that by the amount of supply that's about to come on the market um i'm not convinced that it is going to come on the market i think if it does go to yeah a160 animaker i think that these are established enough funds and and and companies that i mean they will be thinking long term and consider the well what's the short-term impact if we dump 20 000 coins uh 20 million coins rather on the market it's going to have a devastating effect so and they don't need the money i imagine so they'll probably hold and i don't think it's going to have this massive cascading effect on the floor price um yeah i i don't know i'm a little i agree about the whole staking thing because i don't know if you read uh kobe wrote this really fantastic sub stack on what staking had become in in nfc communities versus what it's meant to be and it's meant to be a wave like we've just heard to prove a mistake to to secure the network secure the network and now all of nfc's projects like well if you just lock it up for a while we'll give you more of the token and it's it's not really doing anything other than being a meme for anyway um so i'm i'm i'm just hearing myself become more and more bearish when you go uh which i'm not bearish on them they're there obviously just the s tier project and and have tremendous amount going for them but yeah just a little bit of skepticism about some of this stuff it's funny we've flipped what do you think shows that you're like the true dj and i'm like the corporate the corporate shill and hat where like these these companies get more like professionalized and more corporate and i get more bullies yeah and i'm getting more we get more bearish which the truth is both are right and wrong you know what i mean like i i i could i i've been taking the the kind of corporate shell perspective but i i could argue it both ways truthfully um and i think i'm just excited because i think it's it's been the kind of dj unprofessionalized nature of these projects that have led to a lot of skepticism by the mainstream and i really am in a phase right now where i'm just like i want a million more people i want five million more people in this space and i i do think these companies getting kind of serious and that doesn't have come at the expense of like listening to the mob on twitter um that excites me again there's lots of new ones there but um yeah yeah yeah i i've been tracking very loosely the staking proposals and the i guess there was the one that was accepted and then this the the staking mechanism it's horizon labs is their partner on the staking sounds about right i think horizon labs is yuga's partner and i think yoga does a very good job of picking partners typically so on their like staking mechanics and whatever um i haven't been tracking it too closely i guess because i kind of agree like i'm like i don't really understand what the point is um yeah i guess other than to just get more token but um you know whatever interest is a is a well understood concept so you know if staking were a little bit more like it was to lend it out and you were creating like a lending pool then i understand why you get rewarded for that but when you are rewarded simply for not selling your coin that's just like an unsustainable position to be in yeah because your your price is artificially propped up it's not based on how much people want it so um anyway that is the show zenika thank you so much through all of the technical challenges i think uh there's just too much to get through today to try and cut this short and and do it all with video so
