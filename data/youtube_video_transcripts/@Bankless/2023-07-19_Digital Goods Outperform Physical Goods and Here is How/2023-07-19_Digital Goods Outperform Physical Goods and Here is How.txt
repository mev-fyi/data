let's say you're going to buy a 200 000 Patek Grand complications and it's on your wrist how many people are going to see it on your wrist like maybe 10 000 people and so that's effectively 20 CPA per conversion of person that sees it and now you get their social capital If instead you buy and spend 200 000 on digital items whether that's skins in fortnite or nfts on your Twitter profile a million people could see it you have one tweet that goes viral and a million people will see that tweet and they see your picture so it's effectively 20 cents an impression it's literally 100x more efficient to accrue Social Capital using digital Goods versus physical Goods
