this week uh Bitcoin very happy this week Chad Chad levels of happiness uh started the week at 22 600 uh ending the week just shy of 25 000 we did touch 25 000 we are currently at twenty four thousand eight hundred dollars so is that a ten percent ten percent nice job Bitcoin dang nice crushing it is taking off the rest yes nft fervor I don't think this is nft forever can we say it is like can we just make up it happened in the same week so yes it is absolutely nft Forever on bitcoin that's why this happened yeah okay yeah and we called it too we predicted it we knew it would be ten percent how's eth doing eth uh started the week at 16 30 up six percent to 1710. uh we're breaking through that 1700 Mark if we can keep our head there's a resistance line a meme line at Seventeen hundred dollars and we are currently ten dollars above that uh if we can hold that and we have B above the mean line that means we have broken through some resistance and hopefully that means you get continuation uh if you believe in this kind of thing this view chart magic Pop Quiz so when bitcoin price goes up more than each price what happens to the ratio David uh the ratio uh between ether and Bitcoin goes down from an ethereum perspective so we are down 4.5 which is a big move for the ratio on the week so Bitcoin definitely won the week this week definitely uh won the week and David what would we do without Kraken Who provided us these glorious charts allows us to on a weekly basis tell you the price of eth tell you the price of Bitcoin otherwise how would you know it's not like how you check the prices yeah you can still you can still tell that Ryan's still using uh his old tabs method even though that these uh Kraken charts have tabs inside of the tabs you don't have to use your browser tabs you can just use all right sold BTC up yeah right it's looking at the soul BTC ratio how's that doing can you zoom out on that uh over on the top left left you can go to the four hour candles instead of four hours candles yeah yeah how's the soul BTC doing oh not great yeah total market cap for crypto I know we're above Australian right what's the number we are almost at 1.2 trillion we got 1.17 trillion dollars in total crypto market cap uh bullish bullish traffic I feel embarrassed right now I'm not I'm not bearish at all um should that concern me I mean it's been like what 260 some days 250 days or something since um all-time lows on ether uh it's not that long in the scheme of things yeah well so ether bottomed back in last like April or May in dollar terms Bitcoin bottomed recently in November so ether in the FTX crash Bitcoin hit a new low ethers did not hit a new low so ether's been like uh having higher lows for a long time now it's actually it's because like no one really expected the 2022 bear Market to be as bad as it was and so we were like halfway through 2022 oh is this bear Market happening or not and then all the way through 2022 like oh this is definitely happening now we're into February we're like almost a year and a half into a bear market and that's not a short amount of time so like people like how this bear Market is going to be so brutal we're a year and a half into it it hasn't been brutal has it like I I just for from an ether has had a better time this bear Market than okay and ether and Bitcoin has had a better time this bear Market than every other asset we'll talk about why that might be true when we get to uh the ultrasound money charts a little bit later but first we gotta do our inflation watch David so the inflation report came out this week and uh how are we doing I'll read the headline and you tell me what this means David inflation Rose 0.5 in January more than expected and up 6.4 percent from a year ago that's up 6.4 percent but overall down in annualized inflation numbers but it grows point five percent in January which as I understand it was a bit higher than most people in the market was expecting so what what do you take from this uh yeah so um the markets really liked this so I think even though it's higher than expectations I think the downtrend the market is starting to believe in this downtrend uh it's interesting it's like a kind of counter-intuitive but the markets are liking it and I think people are the market is overall accounting for the fact that inflation has definitely peaked it's funny to me because I I don't like this is a little higher than I expected right so just to give you context in just January alone is 0.5 increase in inflation December was only a point one percent increase in inflation so the annualized number covers a lot because it's a trailing uh 12 months even though that was down on the month we were like 5x up I don't know if that makes sense I I do think that this means we're guaranteed to get more rate increases from the FED at least another 0.25 increase I was already on the table but that was already on the table and this just uh this just guarantees tease it I I saw um some headlines from The New York Times uh one of the subtitles was evidence is mounting that it could be a long road back to normal which also begs the question David of what is normal yeah I don't two percent is no longer the normal number I don't think will like I don't think that should be considered the The New Normal and I'm not kind of making excuses for the for the FED obviously I mean we we talk a lot about the problem of of money imprinting here but for everyone to just expect inflation to go back to two percent and for it to reset um after we kind of get through this you know covid supply chain thing that we've gone through over the past 24 months I think that is Fantasyland I don't think we're going uh quite there and maybe this um proves that inflation is going to be a bit more pernicious than some people thought yeah well inflation conspiracy theorists which I don't think is an actually conspiracy but uh has is you know is only reported to be at this level the actual real inflation uh is likely always going to be higher than was reported and people who are familiar with this are the citizens of Argentina and this is a tweet that we're looking at from Dylan LeClaire where annualized Argentine inflation hits 99 basically 100 hundred percent inflation level which means that the value of the Argentine peso loses 50 percent of its value over an annualized basis uh at the current monthly inflation levels measured in January highest since 1991. can you imagine that so think about that so you're making a hundred thousand dollars last year right um your salary let's say now it's only worth fifty thousand dollars so you hadn't gotten a pay raise at all you just cut in half your um price adjusted earnings right but then you'll go to your employer and be like well because of inflation you have to pay me more and the employer's like yeah I have to pay you more and so in wages go up which means spending goes up which means inflation in further so which is why this spirals out of control so like we talked about like though I wanted to put this in the agenda because we always talk about like oh inflation's at seven percent oh it's going down to six and a half percent we are so privileged in America to be talking about single-digit inflation Argentine Argentina and many many other countries have been dealing with 20 30 inflation for like decades now and so like the difference between what is the official reported inflation numbers which is always suppressed because it makes governments look better versus what actual real inflation is like this is this is like new to a lot of American listeners this is a part of life and culture in so many countries around the world yeah you look at this chart um in 2019 Argentina was hitting over 50 inflation almost 60 percent inflation some months right this is um increased but it's not like 50 is uh is the easy Road here um speaking of inflation David this is about the opposite of inflation this is called what they call deflation deflation my friend this is eth Supply and it's a dip a chart that's only going One Direction that direction is down we talked about this the last couple of times in the roll up but I can't can't believe it we are down almost a full 25 000 ether yeah down 25 000 ether since the merge happened yep which is uh pretty crazy that was 154 days ago this must mean that gas fees are up this must mean that block space demand is uh being demanded yeah um yeah I I guess maybe tell us what this means gas yeah so we've hit a new 24-hour eath burn record 3 800 this was a result of the blur token airdrop uh gas prices hit something like five it sustained 500 way for almost an hour dude and we haven't seen that since D5 summer days it peaked out at 750 gray the new 24-hour burn record is about 3 800 ether burned inside of 24 hours I think we almost burned a thousand ether inside of one hour at the very very Peak the monthly inflation rate for ether is negative one quarter of one percent which is pretty cool it's pretty cool gases are back can I ask you so I I mean this is incredible and it's incredible to see this staring in in a bear Market so-called right that's a block space demand being so off the charts why isn't somebody like a Michael Saylor all over ether as NASA like why are some of these people thinking if you could answer that question you get like a Nobel Prize I don't know I mean but I I this is um is this not sound to money I mean is that this is deflationary I know bitcoiners will Define sound money a little bit differently and they'll say because they don't like disagree with the monetary Supply yeah right but the human control over the monetary this is not human control this is all like code driven at this point right but humans tinkered with it too recently so you have to wait 10 years until you buy it some of the the hardest hard course bitcoiners were like well they humans tinkered with it once therefore it's tainted for forever but this is an argument we'll never accept it it's just an argument we made going back as as far as the 2018 which is like there's really no incentive to Tinker it in the inflationary direction is there right right not only wants it to become more deflationary yeah if you think about all the evil eth people um like and they have the dials of the monitor even if you think that which is which is totally not true but like even if you think that yeah well all the evil Eve people probably hold a lot of ether don't they right and so why in the world would they be incented to increase the supply of ether I guess because it's just two different philosophies bitcoiners are like if you never ever touch the monetary policy people will will grow to trust it and then the ethereum philosophy is like if you only make changes that benefit the holder base then people become start to trust it and like if you see every single ethereum monetary policy change ever it has always been towards the more scarce Direction and now recently with the combination of eip1559 improve of stake the supply of ether is becoming more scarce than Bitcoin judged by inflationary issuance and so it's just a matter of what what do you what are your values and what do you appreciate do you appreciate something that never ever ever changes ever but still perhaps inflates more or do you uh appreciate something that even while there is human input that human input is always into the more scarce Direction like when you want what do you want and also I think the human input into the you know monetary policy of ethers is kind of almost fully ossified I mean there might be some other changes to to gas fee consumption but we're kind of there yet and also the conversation is like well okay bitcoiners and the Bitcoin philosophy has never ever touch it but then you run yourself into the dead end of like well then your security budget runs out and then you're forced to change it later after you've already like created this culture of never ever touching it and so you run into a dead end that's the ethereum uh perspective on it yeah exactly well let's talk let's talk about uh some Bitcoin stuff because Bitcoin blocks based revenue is up as well yeah what are we looking at though this is the Bitcoin happening Cycles yeah so uh this is an arbitrary chart that is uh four years in length uh day since happening uh and then they're inside of this four years of time there's this arbitrary lines of hype disillusionment Enlightenment um but it's pretty obvious that the first one-ish year of one and a half years after a having Bitcoin has only gone up three out of three times how many happenings have you had three either three or four uh and so Bitcoin has only gone up in the one and a half years post happening in the second half uh after that one and a half to like two and a half years after a happening Bitcoin only has gone down and we have continued that pattern and then in the what is the last phase the perhaps one to one and a half years before the next happening Bitcoin is flat to up-ish Flat to up-ish more on the upside I'd say and so we are now in that last phase uh and the idea here is that if this trend continues the approach to the having the one to one and a half years up to the happening is definitely a upwards Trend in bitcoin price that is what this chart shows this is uh three happenings over time and the red line is is the most recent right so we're getting ready to enter in the fourth and so it does predict this Enlightenment period where bitcoin's just gonna go go on a terror go on a run David no I would say it goes up and then it hits the happening and then exactly that's right then then it goes into after Enlightenment then we can do yeah and then that's when it restarts uh let me ask you though I mean this has been true of previous Cycles but do you still think King Bitcoin controls the crypto markets in such a way do you do you think that it has I mean first of all the happenings are much smaller than previously so in terms of um like Bitcoin 6. 6.25 Bitcoins issue per block now in about a year and a half it'll be uh one 3.125 yeah and and so that's one argument I make that the second argument I'd make is like well um I I don't think the Bitcoin has the narrative any longer in crypto I mean I I think that um ethereum for example or web3 in general or other crypto assets has more of the narrative capture than than Bitcoin at this point that that wasn't true in previous happening Cycles but I think it is true now do you think Bitcoin still can control the market in this way uh yeah I think that might be an ethereum like inside of the ethereum world perspective um I think from the outside perspective Bitcoin is still Bitcoin and still dominates uh I I think what you are saying will be true when the flipping happens almost by definition um I think that like what is culturally web 3 is far more culturally relevant than Bitcoin but Bitcoin is like a financial asset and it's also the biggest financial asset so it still is in the driver's seat but every single how every single year that this goes on I think that that is less and less true as time goes on yeah well we will see what happens this time I do think directionally this will prove to be uh correct one other thing that we'll leave folks with in the market section David is chain analysis came out with their annual report on illicit cryptocurrency activity David do you want to guess the percentage of crypto transactions that are so-called illicit uh as reported by the last time this report came out from channelis it was something like one percent ish I think it was less than one percent I think it was something I point eight or point nine percent what is it now I I by the way I appreciate you not looking at the answer and actually uh doing a good faith guess because it is on screen right now 0.24 percent Ah that's really low really low uh elicit inactivity and these guys are pretty close to zero right these guys capture it all it's not just like um you know terrorist financing although that is one category this includes ransomware this includes scams this includes cyber criminal administrators this includes fraud shops and dark net markets and stolen funds and everything that um ofac has has sanctioned includes all of that and it comes in at a whopping .24 percent um what do you think the illicit activity of like Cash Money real life physical caches approaching 100 I'm guessing it's a lot more than uh 0.24 um yeah and by the way these are the guys I joke with uh my friends like the only time I use cash nowadays is to uh for drugs and laundry and not even drugs these days [Laughter] that's great um yeah so look at this man I anyway point this stat out next time someone tells you that all cryptocurrencies just like for criminal criminals and drug lords you'd think that Meme would die it but you know back 10 years ago when it stopped being true but it's still alive somehow in our Halls of Congress um David what do we got coming up next coming up next the SEC comes with a band hammer on Kraken on paxos on all the things so we're going to cover the news that dropped right after we recorded the weekly roll up last week um there's also plenty of cool stuff to talk about the blur airdrop uh we also found out the source of SPS bailout money Bitcoin ordinals a lot more than another the zkevm wars uh a lot of lots of cool stuff so stick around but first a

where is Gary Gensler swinging his hammer this time Kraken has agreed to shutter its crypto staking services to settle with the SEC they've paid a 30 million dollar fine to settle out of court the SEC has accused cracker of offering unregistered Securities in their staking products so the SEC claims that Kraken sold staking services to the public they pulled crypto assets and staked them on their behalf but did some extra things as well beyond just simply staking that created a unregistered security and so Kraken has agreed to shutter that service and wind down that that program um yeah what's your take on this run oh that that is of course when you said steak you mean s-t-a-k-e not okay a part of this story this is gonna be a reoccurring theme every enforcement action that we get first with Kraken and with paxos and one other we get this influencer video influencer video from Gary genzer which is extremely infantilizing it's like talking about proof of stake and Gary genser goes that's s-t-a-k-a-e-e not s t who is the target market for this children what kind of child that's what he's talking like should we should we play this let's play this line all right let's let's play a clip of this what does steak have to do with our Securities laws that's s-t-a-k-e not s-t-e-a-k [Music] thanks Gary yeah but the music office hours you ready in the crypto markets there are various ways to validate data stored on crypto there we go oh my God yeah that's what we're dealing with right now um okay so why I'm sure Gary had a justifiable reason for ending staking at Kraken did he not so there is there are differences between uh like just taking customers ether staking on their behalf and passing along their rewards so Kraken actually advertised a fixed yield not a dynamic yield and so of course the the yield that you get from staking your assets is dynamic but Kraken advertise like you will get this percentage and then they did some other things that they could do because of the economies of scale to make the product a better product but because they were doing some extra things they were finessing this if you will that went from just being like a software as a security provider I guess to being an unregistered security so like technically I'm not a Securities lawyer uh technically that what they did change their product from just being a service provider to being an unregistered security but I'll ask the question to what risk was there right and so like yeah they're doing some extra things that change the nature of the product but is what's the risk well I'm confused my argument is this right like all of the things that you mentioned are pretty freaking easy tweaks to make right if Gensler and the SEC if they had a problem like this product has existed for a very very long time and suddenly now the SEC is giving it the band Hammer why not just have a conversation with Kraken I mean they could have done something like tighter mandates around proof of reserves which I think the entire industry supports with respect to staking more more transparency into where the funds are going like lots of detail there this could have been a productive conversation yeah but it but it wasn't they could have also said something about decentralized staking options and maybe that being another path but instead we just got the Gary G ban Hammer smacked across their head and by the way Kraken uh in the EU they're still offering staking Services of course yep because this is only for U.S citizens thinking is still up and running totally fine except for US citizens yeah oh but but why is this being banned in the US then I mean like maybe because Gary Gensler wants to trap us in his financial prison exactly because of Care Bear I so I don't understand exactly why they went with the approach of uh pay us 30 million dollars and you know there's no remediation around shut down your services pay us money and shut down your service yeah uh it's absolutely like it's almost like extortion I'm like it's um it's brutal the way that this is playing out now our friend commissioner Hester purse had something to say about it so of course she dissented is this like the the second week in a row we've talked about one of Hester purse's descents because I think we have two descents Hester person descends in today's agenda but this is the first one on the SEC Kraken shutdown what does she say uh I'm gonna Skip to My favorite quote uh Hester says a paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in this settlement do not initiate a public process to develop a workable registration process that provides valuable information to investors just they just shut it down the SEC just shut it down like it's I have to you have to give a tip of the hat to Hester purse who's operating inside of an agency that is not doing things that are aligned with what she personally believes yes she's still there fighting the fight that she believes in like that's hard calling the agency that she works in a paternalistic and lazy regulator she's basically calling her boss they like Gary Gensler is not her boss I guess not but he's like in the bigger chair and she's calling him a paternalistic and lazy right I am so impressed I'm just so impressed by it it's awesome it is incredible um and look she it's not it's not just the word she's using which are impressive but like she's raising lots of substance here we've known about crypto staking programs for a long time she also says although it may not have made a difference in this case I should have called for us to put out guidance on staking long before now this is what a leader does too is is take some accountability in this like it's just so refreshing and uh look this is this is a model for how all Regulators should approach this space and approach their jobs in general I'm told we say first principles too often on the podcast we do not say first principle you cannot say the word first principles this is a first principles regulator I'm gonna say it yes she's doing her job right here and it's incredible to watch in the in the in the contrast of those that aren't doing their job yeah uh this is also coming out so Hester's not the only person who's identified this uh this is representative Bill whozienga pretty sick who's anger yeah uh who tweets out since Gary Gensler won't abide by his own policies to quote come in and talk the House GOP will hold him accountable today as promised our oversight of the SEC begins with a request for documents surrounding their interactions with SPF FTX and the justice department kind of adjacent to the topic at hand being uh staking but uh definitely relevant to the topic of what the hell is Gary's deal uh and so I guess maybe Kraken made the mistake of not like bribing the right people not scratching Gary gensler's back I mean is that the contrast here like I maybe Jesse Powell should have um been sucking up to Gary a bit more and he wouldn't be in this position uh is that what this implication is it's like you mean Jesse Powell should have succumbed to SEC extortion well this is this is kind of what it feels like because we know already that um chairman genzler was meeting behind closed doors with FTX had a very multiple relationship with them multiple times these meetings are on on public record uh didn't try to shut down any like Kraken has been servicing this industry for a very long time number of years 12 years Gary was meeting with somebody and an entire exchange that was 29 years old stealing billions of dollars from depositors SPF was 17 when the time Jesse Powell created Kraken I just it's stupid David and um yeah I'm glad that somebody in government hopefully this is more than talk is is trying to hold some accountability for for what's going on on here so that is not the only voice of descent as well here's another one David what are we looking at this is uh Brian Armstrong tweets out coinbases staking services are not Securities people to happily defend this in court if needed translation come at me bro uh for that Brian says to the SEC uh how come how come coinbase uh gets a pass right now in Kraken doesn't right so coinbase does less things with their staking products than Kraken did so like I said Kraken use economies of scale to finesse some extra cool features about the product to bolster the value of the product coinbase is doing a much more bare bone simplified restake your ether and then we pass you back the yield that you get uh and so it's just much more simple and so there's less um there's less like uh they're touching the product less and they're just passing along the stake and so because it's more simplified and there's less like agency that coinbase isn't putting into the service has more of an argument basically right exactly and crack in for whatever reason decided to settle rather than fight this in court right yeah but Brian here implying that they're happy happy to fight this in court this is a tweet from Jason Gottlieb who says I find the sec's all crypto projects have to do is come in and register line unbelievably insulting it assumes that there's this vast quantity of sophisticated Securities lawyers advising their clients no man screw the SEC YOLO baby do whatever you want uh which is a really good take crypto has some fantastic lawyers and all of them implying that the fact that judging by the fact that none of these projects really come in to talk to the SEC that whole line out of Gary genser is like just come in and talk to us it's a trap it's a trap but it's also I think the SEC doing propaganda to the rest of the non-crypto world saying like hey like are you confused about the crypto world uh we just want them to come in and talk to us and then like the average American is like oh those crypto lawyers are so naughty when that's not at all what's true that's what the office hours with Gary influencer video is about that's why he spelled out steak and thought it was like really funny and it's not neat haha it's actually like a staking your asset and like he wasn't talking to anyone in crypto we all know this he's not talking to us he was talking that's why we always are like Ryan you're always lying like but Gary Come on bankless he's not coming on Bank list dude like he doesn't want to talk to us but but seriously Gary come on baby but seriously Gary Come on bankless I've like we've asked him I don't know how many times and uh yeah a handful of times he doesn't care to interface with us she is within it's not just us own agenda it's like but people are listening and be like but that's because you guys talk smack about Gary all the time it's like first if he ever came on we would be very cordial we have never never been antagonist a guest ever nor would we no we would uh love to talk to you I think it would be a you know productive conversation we're not going to sit here and kind of like uh get you in gotchas that sort of thing that's not what we do and then secondly um he won't come on any crypto podcast whatsoever he won't even talk to the crypto Community the closest he comes is like the CNBC Trad fire type space so I don't know why he won't just collaborate like have a conversation with us we're not shadowy super coders like Elizabeth Warren told you which brings us to this miles Jennings tweet who is the council over at a16z so perfect leeway into this uh miles tweets out it has now been four years since the last crypto related guidance from the SEC whose chairman continues to focus on headlines rather than a legitimate effort to protect investors in accordance with the sec's core Mission four years since the SEC has given crypto any sort of guidance and only enforcement actions so like you you we know he doesn't care to talk to us it's been four years since he's given us any guidance yeah all we've been asking for the entire time is Clarity guidance Clarity do you do your job and set instead of Regulation via enforcement um okay here's a here's a flip on this though it's a lot of what I've heard this week uh when we were talking about this but David Ryan isn't this good for decentralize staking uh so basically Gary and and others Regulators coming after the centralized exchanges and saying no Thou shalt not stake well doesn't all of this staking liquidity go to decentralized staking providers um I have a take on this what's your take though well I think you you can look at the market and agree that the market totally agrees with that take because both RP RPL is at all-time highs and ether terms almost all-time highs in dollar terms Lido is at a very strong price performance so the market agrees with that take here's the thing I would say to everyone arguing that and I agree with elements of that too we have no confidence that Gary Gensler isn't going to come for decentralized staking protocols next whatever he wants he is trying to increase his scope influence our eth is that a security under gensler's regime team who knows that is rockapool's staked eth we'd call it a derivative but it's a token staking token um s eth is that is that a security I mean there are all sorts of ways he could begin Where's the Line yeah I'm sure everyone is like no of course not are you sure this man has no lines with you his man has no mind he will go as far as we let him right and so that's why we have to um try to stop it at every opportunity so it doesn't encroach into decentralized staking as well now it has to be a bridge too far for him to try to Outlaw validating in your own freaking home right uh it seems like that could be fought in court but uh who knows um that that wasn't the only SEC action this week though what's this David no uh crypto firm paxos which is used stable coins uh is to face SEC charges about the busd the binance stable coin now the relationship between paxos and binance is interesting paxos is kind of like this white label service so B USD binance dollar is offered and minted by and managed by paxos so it's kind of like putting the binance brand on a paxo stable coin and there's like synergies there it's kind of it's kind of like Finance wants an American Bank to help them with this right yeah exactly yeah yeah um so the SEC has ordered uh paxos to stop issuing binance uh US dollar and the regulator cited that uh is as a result of unresolved issues relating to paxos oversight of its relationship with binance so I think if you read between the lines here um The Regulators believe that busd and binance are doing illicit things that they don't like perhaps money laundering wash trading like a bunch of illicit stuff that that probably offends them and so they're going after paxos who's issuing buse and say hey stop doing that the SEC is bringing a lawsuit to paxos as a result of this David I don't understand why this is in the scope of the SEC at all yeah well so this is this is all about like the whole coordinated effort right and so the again if you read between the lines we have uh new the New York Financial Services uh like uh regulatory body Department of Financial Services excuse me the SEC uh we have treasury like every like all of these I'm guessing all of these agencies are like you know in whatever communication channels that they have with each other and they're like hey we want that to end SEC go you go after a paxos what can make it like yeah like go get them and so like this is like the government acting as kind of a monolith which I don't usually do in order to like uh you're coordinating yeah they're coordinating yeah exactly yeah yeah it's uh it's interesting to me that they're picking on binance in this way I think now they're picking on finance through paxos but it's really you could tell this is kind of targeted at binance I think it's harder for them to come at like coinbase usdc but do you think they could be coming after Circle and the usdc product next I I don't think that there's a line I don't think there's a line there is no line and so David there's they're not Banning busd just paxos is no longer able to issue the supply of busd so it's basically going into legacy mode and the supply of busd is down only is paxis going to fight this do they have a way to fight this I don't know man I don't I don't think I haven't heard anything like that I don't know if they intend to fight it or not it's a Well's noticed it's really hard to fight the government isn't it yes one other byproduct of this is an article in Bloomberg that PayPal is pausing stablecoin work amid the regulatory scrutiny remember all that good news of of PayPal and venmo doing like a stable coin adoption well they've had to pause one of their Partners was actually paxos right for uh the staplecoin product and they're like well now what do we do well they got scared they got scared and this is this is like a success indicator for the SEC and all those like Regulators that don't want they're slowing it down they're like oh yeah this is what we wanted yeah right this is the positive second order effect for them yeah yeah you know some crypto people are like well Regulators don't matter and like we'll be fine without them and none of this matters you mean I agree that's true over the long run right but over the shorts they do have the ability to slow it down yeah just slow adoption velocity specifically in the jurisdiction where they have some power and looks like that's what they're doing unfortunately with on PayPal so David question of how do we fight this it's all sorts of ways for people to get involved uh one of which is we depend on actually people with some power uh to go to Washington and fight the fight not the way that sandbagment free did with bribing all the politicians at least I I hope that's not the case um what's this a picture of what are we looking at this is just Brian Armstrong and what I'm assuming is the coinbase legal team perhaps some others as well uh they were in Washington they're in Washington DC fighting this fight uh and so this is just the way that regular regulation and Innovation and Technology Works uh new technology offends the status quo it tries to get regulated then these Representatives who are aligned with technology come and fight for it and so Brian Armstrong and other lawyers at coinbase are in Washington DC doing the trench warfare of fighting this stuff Case by Case by case so thank you for everyone who's in Washington DC fighting that fight it's really you got to put your suit on if you want to do that well I ever see you um testifying in front of Congress David I would in a suit I would put on a suit if I was called upon to do it I would put on a suit and I'd go do it look that was something thankfully I can just sit at home and talk about it that was only the second uh smack across the face this week from the SEC uh there's a third too and this was even more recent there's an SEC proposal that could bar investment advisors from keeping assets at crypto firms this is registered investment advisors who would have no ability to essentially custody their assets and so if you want to give quote unquote real Financial advice remember everything on Bank lists is just for entertainment purposes we do not give Financial advice around here we are not registered investment advisors we'll never pretend to be but if you are are a registered investment advisor well Gary has just made it a bit more difficult to keep assets on behalf of your clients at crypto firms another influencer video to explain it to you yeah yeah ah Gary's playing let's watch it dude how are we watching this one too oh yeah we're watching this okay here we go what is a qualified custodian I don't know Gary what does it have to do with the Securities I don't know tell me [Music] I'm so excited to hear about this a qualified custodian no no not groundskeeper Willie oh that's what I was thinking I can't watch anymore god dude okay so like okay what is it what is the net effect of this um and so actually this is something I hear out of Matt Walsh from uh the uh on the brink podcast his take is that exchanges in the future will not also be the custodians of their customers deposits because that's how it's structured already in crowded world so this is actually gonna take that off kind of this is a take I've heard before is yeah so like exchanges will just do exchanging stuff and then they will have a third priority service provider to do the custodian stuff so separately keeping the private keys somebody else says yes exactly yeah that's kind of interesting that he would say that I think that's true but that's not necessarily true for Bearer assets is it you ever go to the like old Banks and they have these ginormous Bank vaults where like they keep safe deposit boxes and that sort of thing and previously they'd kept other valuables like actual cash money and gold and that kind of thing right but they but those Banks aren't also doing facilitating the swapping and exchange trading of those things though so it's the combination of the exchange and the custodian that I think is what is being targeted here so a quote from Gary here rather than properly segregating investors crypto these platforms have co-mingled the those assets with their own crypto or others investors crypto this is how coinbase crap I'm assuming crack and all of these exchanges work is like binance too when you send them your ether they spin up a temporary address so you deposit your like ether into that temporary address and then that temporary address forwards it off to like coinbase cold storage or whatever and that's co-mingled with everyone's deposits they just mark on their Ledger that this one person sent us this amount of ether but then everything does get co-mingled uh and so the the Gary Gensler claim is that when these platforms go bankrupt something that we've seen time and time again recently FTX is what they're going after uh they're setting investors assets often become the property of the failed company leaving investors in line at the bankruptcy court um so you can see the logic also is this what the SEC is for how is this related to Securities though that's a good question yeah David so here's really the problem is Gary Gensler is trying to completely delegitimize this asset class for in registered investment advisors which again provide the bulk of financial advice to Americans in the U.S and here's a quote from an article we've read about this if the agency that is the SEC is trying to force advisors to go to banks with their clients crypto assets so they can only go to Banks rather than exchanges with clients crypto assets and the bank Regulators Are cautioning banks against crypto activity is it making crypto investing impossible through the advisors yes of course this is the operation choke point this is how it gets right so Gary is coming in and it's like they're sort of encircling the crypto movement and so he's going in he's being like ah here's a weak point registered investment advisors you know what we'll do we'll just make it so that they can't keep clients funds on crypto exchanges they have to go to Banks yeah and then over here you guys over here like um OCC or whoever else like make it really difficult for the banks to actually work with crypto because it's a super risky asset we've seen that in the recent months so you sort of encircle the industry and like squeeze it off like choke it out slowly over time so this is this is the intergovernmental agency coordination the SEC is pushing all registered investment advisors so like don't store the crypto asset with bank with exchanges has to be crypto native exchanges yeah exchanges like Kraken and coinbase et cetera the people that are aligned with the crypto industry instead you have to store your crypto assets with banks and maybe in Silo you can accept that maybe but then on the other side of things you have all of the other banking Regulators who are saying hey Banks you can't store crypto assets that's the plate right okay here's the thing here's why it's so stupid and short-sighted so if that's the game that's cool guess what happens completely yeah yes and it completely delegitimizes not only the SEC we said that before but registered investment advisors it eliminates them from being able to talk about an entire asset class so if I'm a millennial and by the way did you know that for Millennial millionaires the vast like a lot of them a majority of them actually own 50 or greater of their Assets in crypto if that's a stat I read recently um the source for that um it's like you are making it so that a registered investment advisor can't actually help you with this entire asset class called crypto class called crypto assets which is like the biggest most wealth generating Highest Potential growth asset class on the planet so what do you do you just completely neuter registered investment advisors like why work with a registered investment advisor if they can't even talk about crypto you don't have an incentive here so that's the byproduct of this and of course our friend Hester purse wrote another statement about this or uh we what we might call a descent on this as well we'll include a link to that in the show notes um I think this take from Jake travinsky really uh takes it home for us David on all of the actions from the SEC over the past week do you want to read this out yeah Jake says this proposal would flagrantly violate the sec's mission by making investors less safe and by discouraging Capital formation it wouldn't directly invest affect investments in crypto companies since it only targets digital assets not company Equity that's a small Comfort though since it would cover many non-securities that the SEC shouldn't regulate so this is just Jake saying this is a huge over step by the SEC which we already know David what are we looking at you got some memes we got some memes we are 55 minutes into this roll up and we've talked about one subject matter Beyond markets so we're going to end this with Meme and move on uh here's the SEC protecting us protecting a sleeping child from Kraken meanwhile Celsius Tara Luna fgx whatever oh Voyager that's just raining bullets down on this sleeping child again nice job this I love this meme format this is the dog that wants you to play fetch with it but it won't give you the ball at the same time so the dog is please comply and then you read for the ball and the dog goes no regulatory guidance only compliance I love this new format yeah it's so good uh David all right on to brighter subjects uh blur did an airdrop this week how much did people make how did it go do you have any details for us yeah so trading the trading price of blur at the time of recording is moving around a lot but is something like two to two and a half billion dollars on day one of the blur drop uh 12 yeah so at one dollar what is that fully deserted market cap three billion dollars what is Blur by the way it is a tokenized uh attempt at did decentralized version of openc basically it is a nft trading platform that's optimized for nft Traders people who are doing the speculation all that kind of stuff uh and so it is um uh just a new tokenized NFC trading platform three billion dollar market cap uh 12 of the total Supply was air dropped to blur people who went through the gamut of qualifying for the airdrop interesting choice to make the airdrop uh qualification criteria explicit they tried to make a non-gameable uh mechanism for airdropping the token uh so that means that they gave away 250 to 300 million dollars of airdrop to their to uh their uh I can't remember the number of uh individuals I got the the token is quite a lot uh but pretty successful token airdrop uh I would say I did a show with them I did a show with Pac-Man this is an Anon team uh so if you are looking to learn about a blur and the details of the airdrop there we already did a show with them if you are looking to learn more there's also of course you can go to earnify which is earn.fi and get alerts when air drops like this are happening just type your address email address you won't miss an airdrop David we've got a lot more coming up what's what's happening coming up next polygons the ZK evm mainnet is set to launch in March are they going to beat zk6 ZK evm which is also announced this week coincidence that happened on the same week I don't know but at least a zkevm Wars are heating up we gotta love that uh sbfs uh people that whoever paid for spf's bail money or we know who they are so we're going to talk about that Celsius issues a recovery plan you're gonna get your money back Ryan maybe and three weeks later ordinals are still a thing More Alive than ever but first before we get to all that super hot stuff a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you can go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and unisop's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and we are back Ryan you know what to set new lows recently is non-ofac compliant blocks on ethereum wow this was uh once upon a time a big concern uh you and I were never really concerned about this because basically because of the layer 0 of ethereum why is there an increase of non-offat compliant blocks on ethereum because there is a culture of censorship resistance built into the layer zero around ethereum I was never really endowed that this was going to happen but the ratio between non-ofac compliant blocks to ofac compliant blocks is up only so ethereum increasingly ignoring ofac compliance which is tight uh that's the typical should that's the protocol level yeah uh and this is I saw this graphic I thought this was pretty so cool this is an illustration of how a block is built so on the left you have block builders on the middle you have block relayers and then on the right you have stakers people who are actually proposing blocks blocks Celsius over there and so it's just a pretty cool distribution of all of the supply chain of how you make a block this was the topic of a podcast topic that we had with Matt Cutler uh and so this is now we this was before or we had that podcast before this was even a thing because Matt knew that this was coming and so bankless listeners got the front right okay so so on the left is what is that's block Builders and in the middle is relayers yeah relayers okay and then on the right are some of the big staking providers exactly and you would be on the right as well if you're running if you're an individual Staker yeah yeah it's just maybe not depicted here because it might also be the gaps between between the yes it's not depicted very cool look at the flows here um and ultrasound is an up and coming that is right that is um that's an up-and-coming relayer and that is um ultrasound.money and is also ofac non-compliant not of fat compliant yeah or ofac non-compliant I don't know I love the words compliance uh let's talk about ZK okay because the ZK Wars are heating up this is a tweet from Hollow did you know David it's official the polygon ZK evm mainnet will be launched on March 27th after more than a year of intense and inspiring research development and testing were incredibly proud to launch the first ever ZK evm mainnet a lot of people claimed first everyone wants you to know that they have the first ever ZKA evm well who knows who's gonna be first I don't know who officially gets that title but polygon has a date here of March 27th so that seems pretty uh compelling um a few things like when people say that their thing is going to mainnet it's always a question of like what is actually going to mean that are you like main netting a test net version is that what you mean by mainnet or is it sort of a half version um I believe this is indeed mainnet as defined by real assets and real users and open to everyone so there you go there's lots of other technical stats uh behind this and um for me I can't wait to to use something like this the day it comes out so stay tuned bankless Nation for more ZK evm content so we can explore this new world but David they are not the only ones that are getting close to mainnet this is ZK sync CK sync yeah also announcing the ZK sync era mainnet uh so for bankless listeners that don't know there's actually two ZK syncs there's ZK sync 1.0 which was the very very early implementation of a ZK roll up which just did token transfers and payments and then ZK saying 2.0 came around and that was launched a zkevm was launched on ethereum months ago except it was closed to only the ZK sync protocol Dev so they could only be the ones to stress test this thing they would shut down the network restart like do a operating system upgrade basically restart it and so they claimed back then first we accept it was closed uh and so like everyone's claiming first over and over and over again uh but this is the same thing as the polygon announcement where the zke evm is open to builders and so they are doing a uh where they're calling a fair onboarding so teams can sign up to get onboarded onto the ZK sync era to start building the right start building right exactly yeah and so that I've talked to the zkc team six to eight weeks of that of this Fair onboarding time period where everyone gets to have peace and quiet while they build their applications and that starts today that started today Thursday so yesterday for the time of listeners so six to eight weeks later ish give or take whenever the protocol devs of ZK sync say that it's ready and secure they will open it up to True actual real mainnet for everyone else to come but we have this Fair onboarding period where projects can deploy and test their dapps on zksync era also has token Bridges and they are also going through finishing up their security audits you know if if one of them technically beats the other to mainnet it's only going to be by a few weeks yeah and that's what's so great about this how does this matter but I love the fact that everyone's competing and that this is a race um now we've got to make sure you get security right obviously this is some new more complicated technology so that's something we won't be able to know until after the fact um but uh yeah it's exciting to see for sure I should mention too both David and I are advisors for matter Labs ZK sync and also I'm an advisor for polygon we love and support the ZK evm ecosystem for sure um we also own some eth David disclose that I don't think we need to disclose that tornado cash developer to stay in jail as the Dutch trial continues this is Alexei purtzeff we talked about him so often when this happened in August earlier this year this is just a heartbreaking title um for the story and it's like this guy has been in jail for developing open source code as far as we know more serious charges have not been put forward he put open uh he helped develop tornado cash which is ofac sanctioned and now he's in jail for it and there's a trial going on so hopefully this is not permanent but the fact that he's been in jail for I don't know how long is this David six months like almost a half a year now what so I I know you said like this is a disheartening title so let me run this by you perceive's lawyer said that they had a good beginning in educating the court about how decentralized Finance works the low lawyer quoted said we had the opportunity to explain what the basis is for tornado cash and why it is not money laundering it is our opinion that the lack of knowledge is what's keeping him here Dutch public prosecutors allege that persev rather than merely publishing code said that uh he accepted accepted piles of suspicious cash without question so there are two very different realities being talked about here and see yeah we will see uh and so like is this such a misunderstanding and like we have to just educate that tornado cash is is six months because we didn't know about D5 sorry or was pertzev actually helping money laundering maybe there's much more to the story that we don't know we'll find out yes it's true that we don't have all the evidence um but serious charges haven't been laid I guess that's what the court case is for um one other thing I'll say is look at the contrast Alexa is in jail and not able to be released on bail who's out on bail David oh uh this guy named SPF who's on out on bailing like something like a quarter billion dollars or something like it's so crazy the contrast here before we get to that though uh Cosmo Dave Medici who's of course known as being Snoop Dogg's Twitter account for the nft world 22 were pieces of works nfts from the cosmo de Medici collection has been added to the permanent collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art the first donation of on-train art from a collector to a museum and also the largest digital art collection to ever enter a museum uh cool it's just on loan right that's what collectors do you just load it to museums I'm assuming so yeah in this case so or more nft stuff ordinals getting into the original section uh ordinal is our ordinals are up only we are almost Ryan passing one million dollars in transaction fees paid to bitcoin miners from inscribing ordinals we have passed over a hundred thousand ordinals in scripted into Bitcoin so there's over a hundred thousand and nfts on bitcoin which is so cool you can have Dune boards about Bitcoin I'm not used to seeing Dune boards on bitcoin and ordinals uh so people know are basically nfts on on bitcoin are these being sold on like openc and other marketplaces yeah dude they are crazy well when they are sold on openc they're actually sold as like a wrapped ordinal on ethereum which is kind of hard this is getting very very it's because Bitcoin doesn't have like on-chain infrastructure to support some of this stuff so like the people were like trading OTC like OTC ordinals with each other through this like public Google sheet it's like all a mess oh see guys it's still a TI-83 calculator they're trying they're trying their best anyways Bitcoin punks are a brand new nft collection on bitcoin uh somebody bought a a Bitcoin crypto Punk which are like much like the crypto punks that you all know except with some mutation some some changes to make them unique um one one Bitcoin Punk was sold for 9.5 Bitcoins dude wow it's funny that they're following in the footsteps of ethereum yeah well don't don't tell the Bitcoin is that this is uh like crypto punks but for Bitcoin you know um I I'm hopeful that the nft community in Bitcoin starts to establish its own independent culture as well are we starting to see any of that I think yeah I think so so yeah there's now a like I said a couple Roll-Ups ago like ordinals are a place for different flavors of bitcoiners other than the fundamentalists like extremist Camp to latch on to and use Bitcoin in a way that's not necessarily aligned with like the maximalist flavor of bitcoiners so now there's like different we can actually talk about different flavors of bitcoiners with more like Fidelity which is great well here's something that you'll never see on ethereum and that is the constitution of El Salvador being Minted as an ordinal nft so that just happened the reason you'll never see it on ethereum David is uh buchelli is a notorious Bitcoin I maximalist I would say yes laser eye Maxi for sure laser-eyed maximalist and apparently they are cool with blocks having nft data in in them at least be Kelly is and so minted the El Salvador's Constitution here yeah this definitely ruffled some feathers so here's a quote from president uh nayi bukhale someday Bitcoin will host a distinct Global culture that will rival ethereum we think that that culture should be El Salvadoran Michael Saylor responded this isn't how Bitcoin should be used or smart contracts or any of this artsy fartsy stuff Bitcoin is a currency the citizens of the world need to quit finding artistic and profitable ways to use our blockchain they can take that now so it's trouble in Maximus Paradise you're using the blocks wrong Kelly okay yeah that was take your take your Finance your nonsense somewhere else that's what he said is it fair for us to just like put words in other people's mouths under the uh the the vibe of the rug so this is a rug no that was a rug again oh I got rugged yeah dude I didn't even look up yes if I got rugged that was a rug and I got rugged so hard ah I love the fact that this is so nice and you don't even know I didn't even look this is so dumb I think oh my God you're 100 believe me I was that was even more than a lot I got rugged harder than you last time so hard so so you know I was gonna ask you when we got to the end of um our agenda when we were talking about things he's like oh you didn't put a rug link there must not have been anything good this week when the rug team passed this link to me I was like oh my God this is so good and so I pass it to Chrissy who makes the agenda and I'm like all right sneak this one in here in a way that doesn't like trigger Ryan and see if he can just get into it okay okay so reset none of that happened none of that happened no so like quotes it's all wrong this is the third the third rug that we've put into the weekly Roll Up is it what is the rug the rug dot mirror.xyz it is the onion of crypto uh last week I was not able to rug Ryan but the week before I was that I was actually able to rug around a second time is awesome last time uh so nice job rug team uh the again the onion of crypto you can collect this rug I thought that only the first rug ever would be the rug that rugged Ryan because I thought he would learn but I guess AI so it's so stupid um yeah it's the same website every time dude I'm in a message we can get him to clip this um I'm the one with the recording man all right Ryan got wrecked all right ignore that happened guys two two marks two rugs for Ryan all right moving on FTX founder Sam bingman feeds two Bond guarantors unsealed both with ties to Stanford uh and so the names of who paid for spf's and bail money has now been released that was a big question these people are Larry Kramer the president of the William and Flora hewert foundation and Dean amarettes Emeritus how do you pronounce that name Dean emeraldus at Stanford law and Andreas got these names a senior research scientist also at Stanford why Stanford well that's because that's where bankman Freed's parents Joe and Barbara are their faculty at Stanford and close friends with these people uh I mean 250 million dollars in bond money is a lot of bond a lot of money that's I have a lot of respect for Stanford professors but they don't make that kind of money I'm guessing that the parents are just like hey guys help support our child and pay for some of the bond money also here's some money to do that I'm guessing that's how that happened that's gross and definitely um selling the name of the Stanford name I'm bringing down with them yeah my mom went to Stanford and now I feel like this is personal even though I didn't even go to Stanford don't be don't be angry at your mom though it wasn't her fault it wasn't like yeah my mom would have done that um Celsius okay is there some good news for us uh yes so Celsius there is a new plan a new plan to uh resolve all of the uh debt that Celsius owes so TLD of this plan small customers small creditors to Celsius people that have less than five thousand dollars are getting about 70 cents on the dollar in cash back um which is a lot of that's most people that's more than 50 percent uh other customers with bigger balances it's kind of hard hard to tell 30 to 40 percent in cash uh of you're getting cash back you also are getting equity in this new company that is being spun out of uh Celsius that someone else plans to manage not Alex machinsky not alexwinsky zero Founders and so a brand new company is being built to out of the the decimation of Celsius and customers with bigger account balances and five thousand dollars are getting equity in this new company um and so that is that I mean I guess could have been worse right um 30 40 is better than zero percent for those with 5K or less they get 70 percent essentially so um that's all okay I I'm guessing the people with a lot of money in Celsius are not too pleased about this because they're you know maybe that's unfair from their perspective but look man it's higher than like the 10 or 20 I was mentally thinking so yeah that's something that's something they're also doing clawbacks too yeah so Alex machinski uh a bunch of basically uh Celsius insiders uh are asked are being asked to return the money and also it at one point will not become a request their property and stuff how deep does a clawback go like can you pierce the um the shield of those up to a lawyer Court to decide geez but we all know that both the Christine mihan machinski or I'm assuming is Alexander michinci's wife uh also uh like we all know that alexinsky would throw millions and millions of dollars from Celsius right before it got frozen yeah uh so this is cool David Shopify has integrated with sign in with ethereum Shopify has been a huge supporter of crypto on kind of The Cutting Edge here so this means you can now log in with ethereum using the best wallet on

ethereum I'm assuming Shopify using your sign in with ethereum properties you can like stick your address if you want to it's up for your control or not a secure address and perhaps payment information into your sign in with ethereum experience so you never have to redo that over and over and over again and Ryan the cool part is that you can also they're they're released saying token gated products so when you sign in to Shopify with sign in with ethereum using your favorite wallet ever metamask you're signing with ethereum the service will look into your favorite wallet ever met a mask and see like oh are you an owner of uh a particular asset well then a bankless poapp for example other bank list type assets you can go to the banklers merch store sign in with the best wallet ever met a mask and get other products and token gated products unlocked to you and this is all in Shopify yeah that that's super cool so the idea of having like specialty merch that only specific token holders can actually select from that can be integrated with Shopify it's really cool to see that so I don't know maybe bankless decides to do an nft one day and then that opens the door up for all of our nft holders to access some really cool merch perhaps we'll talk to medafactory about building some cool merch but it'll happen through sign in with ethereum M plugged into Shopify and when you do that make sure to use the best well ever remember thank you for sponsoring metamask uh token terminal they introduced financial statements for Dows David this is just cool thought experiment badass look you know um the SEC requires that companies publicly traded companies release their financial statements their 10ks and such guess what we can generate that automatically on chain with crypto protocols more of transparent than any regulated crypto publicly traded publicly traded company could be crypto is is better regulated crypto more transparent like I mean look at this this is um Xerox view their quarterly financials here there's even a download CSV button yeah one inch updated in real time you don't have to wait on the quarter right where'd the revenue go it's all on chain anyone anyone can produce these reports this token terminal made it really easy friendly uh user friendly to do this like name name something uh any regulator can don't doesn't see the value in this is this is a regulator's best friend this is the hypocrisy I just want to emphasize we spent a lot of time talking about SEC and Gary Gensler there's such hypocrisy in the approach that they're taking because if you are a regulator you actually care about the mission of protecting retail investors and um you know uh fair and orderly Capital markets and capital formation then you should be supportive of an open transparent Financial system one that allows you to generate Financial reports in a second automatically from anywhere in the world that is like unparalleled transparency and here it is you could just there's a very long history of corrupt companies reveling in the black box that they get between quarter and to quarter end doing a bunch of illicit shuffling and moving around debt and doing a bunch of Black Box things and it only becomes transparent at one snapshot four times a year you can there is a financial statement for every single D5 protocol that happens every 12 seconds which is how long one ethereum block is it's so cool guys this is why we're in this space uh David we got some more to talk about in this episode what do we have coming up coming up next we've got some questions from the nation we got a question about Kanto as a result of the recent podcast as well as cosmos the cosmos Chain versus optimism's Bedrock so we're going to talk about that and then of course we got three takes from the week uh Ryan brings up the subject matter that's not about crypto so stay tuned for that take of the week and also what do we bullish on uh and the meme of the week so all of this and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of Arboretum Nova gaming and social adapts like Reddit are also now calling arbitrum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide your uglies burn the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom dot app waitlist to get access in late February questions from the bankless nation Discord let's get to them David the first one is from Weston estate fan given the recent Canto podcast how do you think kanta will hold up against established l1s and l2s are the public good infrastructure incentives through contract shared Revenue sufficient to differentiate the chain that is the question uh give us a Refresh on what Kanto is for folks that miss the podcast episode on it and then if you could answer this question yeah Kanto is an evm compatible Cosmos IBC chain which is a mouthful so it's a chain on the cosmos ecosystem that is evm compatible and its main differentiator is this thing called CSR contract secured Revenue uh and we had to podcast with Zach Cole who's one of the core contributors of Kanto over a week ago and so the question again is uh how is Kanto differentiated enough to hold its way up against other layer ones or layer twos um interestingly Kanto did not create or invent contract secured Revenue near as a blockchain also has CSR and it's already been around for a very long time on the layer one level anyway one level yeah so there's already other chains out there that have contracts secured Revenue uh near never really seems to have taken off so at least Kanto has found a way to bootstrap itself in ways that near hasn't um I am not convinced at all that this short-term price movement in Kanto is indicative of its long-term Health that is needs to be proven out with proof and time over the long term which is a take we had last week so while Kanto is at the beginning of what could be that it is still very very early and so I'm still in the camp that this is just a short-term rotational trade a little bit of a momentum play we will see how well Canto can hold itself up to uh other like like I said other layer ones or layer twos um though so I mean you really big because people will let know that or I kind of think that anything of value ultimately becomes built on ethereum that's kind of the point of ethereum uh and so if it's proving to work at the Kanto level it is only a matter of time for an ethereum layer 2 to copy that and run with it and then you have what differentiated Kanto in a positive way plus all of the network effects of all the other things that benefit you from being on ethereum and so I think the jury is definitely still out that Kanto has sticking power you know one thing it has that near didn't is you know near was kind of like mostly a vce backed um kind of coin right coins a bunch of VCS Kanto had a bunch of Builders with the initial seed of their coin so that's why we're seeing more early activity I think because there's it's more ground up organic Community oriented sentiment that weather can sustain that as another question but there's also I mean Zach Cole um we had the podcast also mentioned the possibility of like maybe at some stage Kanto converts into a a layer too right and he said that the reason they used the the Cosmos app chain model is because those were the best tools available for launching a blockchain at the time they launched it which was like what um last year at the end of last year so it's the same logic as dydx like why is dydx going from uh Stark X layer 2 onto Cosmos it's because of the same reason why they started Kanto as a cosmos train now but it's all it's in the design roadmap of all these layer twos to not have the problem that Kanto cited as to why they became independent in the first place and I think that goes into the next question which is really a question of Cosmos versus Bedrock so here's a question from Kyle k plan hi I had a question about Cosmos versus Bedrock Cosmos has IBC that's inner blockchain communication that's a protocol for interoperability between chains and I think Bedrock will support interoperability between other Bedrock chains correct me if I'm wrong do you see a feature where projects use Bedrock for app chains similar to the cosmos model so first I feel like you have to explain a term the term app chain and then you need to explain maybe like Bedrock for us in order to answer this question yeah uh okay thanks for the question Kyle Kaplan I love this subject uh so actually one thing uh the one thing of clarification it's not Cosmos versus Bedrock it's Cosmos versus the op stack the op stack is the generalizable app chain infrastructure for optimism optimism mainnet is upgrading to bedrock which is the first time that optimism will use the op stack so Bedrock is one specific flavor of the op stack so it's the op stack that is like the bare bone scaffolding that creates many many many different app chains on top of Bedrock which is optimism mainnet and so like you say Cosmos has IBC for interoperability between chains and so Cosmos is like this mesh network of chains there is no Central Main net it uses IBC to connect all these Cosmos chains into this mesh Network that it doesn't have a center and you are correct in you're saying that Bedrock actually op stack will support interoperability between other op stack chains and so because all these chains are being built on the op stack standard there becomes additional surface area for cross-chain composability inside of the op stack standard and so many many app chains can come to be built on the optimism op stack and as more as the op stack becomes the standard it becomes so much easier to abstract away the boundaries between these chains and so you can get things like cross chain synchronization of transactions Atomic transactions and so just the walls between op stock chains start to blur and so do you see a future where projects use op stack for app chains similar to the cosmos model that is the whole entire point of the op stack is to create more change that you can count and to have all of those boundaries between between all of those chains completely abstracted away from the end user and so that's why the optimism team has called this the vision the super chain because it's like a fractal root system of chains and you don't have to be worried about where you are on the op stack it's hugely bullish one thing it's extremely bullish one thing that's different between kind of like the whole Bedrock approach and the op stack approach versus um Cosmos is shared security is native so all everything in Bedrock it's a layer two of ethereum so ultimately it inherits the security of ethereum and so it all settles that that is not true with Cosmos app chains they have kind of unique validator sets and some of these can sort of mesh together and provide some shared security but there's not shared security across the entire Cosmos ecosystem and so I think that is a significant difference too but this is an example David of the ethereum ecosystem really catching up on app chains because Cosmos has been far ahead of ethereum in app chains I mean it was kind of built for this purpose and ethereum has not caught up yet but I think it's going to start to with these layer twos and these kind of Frameworks and code bases like Bedrock that allow anyone to basically spin up their own Layer Two secured app chains so it's pretty cool to see another Another War in progress between chains that only benefits the users and the developers so while Cosmos is definitely further ahead on the app chain world than ethereum remember like they are so far behind on the shared security and Native money of Cosmos ethereum sorry harder thing let's talk about some Taste of the week this one was from Balaji so I think I prompted this tweet a little bit because I said okay crypto what's the best way to fight this Rogue SEC it was kind of on my mind given last week's event and I feel like Balaji gave the best answer to this David you want to read this Balaji says you need a state to fight a state United States like Wyoming Tennessee is Mississippi Montana are passing bills in support of dows and Bitcoin mining meanwhile foreign States like El Salvador or the UAE are recruiting crypto Founders Sanctuary States for Innovation both inside and outside interesting yeah interesting he's totally right I think this is the ultimate answer to like what do we do about the Rogue SCC is you compete with them you disrupt them yeah he goes on by the way which is I think even almost even better than the parent tweet he said the other part we need to build a better Financial regulator than the SEC free open source on-chain star ratings for crypto projects eventually adopted by U.S states and foreign States in lieu of the SEC which didn't catch FTX guess what the SEC ain't the only regulator in town the US ain't the only country in town either and the SEC isn't even the only regulator necessarily in the US we were just showing you a token terminal boom click click of a button and you can generate audited chain audited Financial reports right well that is on-chain regulation in and of itself that is using code to enforce transparency in crypto and so balaji's other point is we can build a better Financial regulator than the SEC that's ultimately what is going to shift SEC policy is you disrupt them you out-compete them right they are the Blockbuster of regulators and you've just come out with Netflix I really like his take here and of course you know biology is very bullish on the network State ideas and maybe that kind of uh is the lens through which he sees all of crypto yep uh Punk 6529 moving on says if cash were proposed today it would absolutely not be approved yeah this is like a consensus take by now in the crypto world yeah and what does he mean by that just like physical cash money if Congress said hey we've got this idea it's like you mean a different form of cash that we can't trace and and people are free to transact without permission God we can't have that it's peer-to-peer it's peer-to-peer it's private how do we regulate it yeah exactly um I can't make an influencer video about cash uh David and Sean Adams tweets out how old were you when you realize the adults have no idea what they were doing Ryan I feel like there's a backstory to this there's actually I was just thinking about it of um oh okay well I I'll give maybe give my answer to this question is like I actually think that um how old were you when you realized adults have no idea what they're doing I think that is the point when you realize that at which you actually become an adult and oh when you have to take on responsibility because you realize that if you don't no one else will yes that is actually the marker like that's kind of for me it was almost like The Meta answer this question it's going to be a different age for everyone but that is what marks adulthood and some people reach that at different times for me it was probably like gradual over time it wasn't just suddenly like I woke up and I'm 15 years old I'm like what the hell these adults it was just like gradual data collection being like and then getting in places where it was it was sort of cohorts of grips where I was like well of course these adults don't know what they're doing but they're smarter adults out there that have more influence and power and surely they know what they're doing no it's adults not knowing what they're doing all the way down right like everywhere you go you see this and so I guess maybe for me it's been a journey of gradually coming to that realization and becoming an adult over time as a result and taking on that responsibility being like okay well I don't really know what I'm doing either but I'm gonna give it a shot and if not me these other adults don't know and uh so I'm gonna band together with with others that also want to take on these types of adult responsibilities make the world a better place but same question to you like when did you realize that the adults just don't know yeah I think for me it was crypto uh I didn't I woke up to this kind of ideas like wait most people don't know most things we're all just as Humanity just making this up as we go uh and it was really crypto that using crypto as a lens for viewing the rest of the world um that allowed me to kind of see that like so many other people don't know what they're doing and they're just making things up and it was like oh if you can portray confidence a lot of people will just start listening to you no matter what which is terrible because that is not the right thing to optimize for they optimize they'll often my thing to optimize for is like being correct and responsible I'm a firm believer that responsibility is the meaning and purpose of life to take responsibility and put responsibility on your shoulders uh and so that that's the realization I had once again in the end of 2022 after like three hours Capital went to zero and Terra Luna was Dumb and bad and we knew it yet people still follow Terra Luna and FTX and SPF like a lot of people just posture and a lot of other people just follow those people and meanwhile the responsible adults kind of get drowned out at least in that particular phase of the market so like once again it's like God damn it you have to fix all this that uh I I I hope that's the bankless call that's why we call you know people who are in the crypto Journey for the long run settlers right it's um you're taking on adult responsibilities in crypto because we actually want to grow this community and this movement for the long run and um we're going to make long-term decisions here not not short-term shortcuts uh remember remember the subject to Montauk Denver or at shelling Point let's say college oh uh shelling point was last year no this year no yeah yeah you said psychology right it's like yeah the way how crypto grows you up and mature exactly yeah that's part of the subtext it's like we went you when you have self-sovereign money and finance and self-custody and influence over your protocols you are given a lot more responsibility so I think the Advent I'm just teasing Bit by Bit by Bit my talk over the last few weeks the Advent of crypto protocols will help Society grow up faster because it gives us more things to have ownership over yeah and be responsible for it I certainly hope so um David let me ask you the question I ask you every week what are you bullish about so all of this uh clamoring about the ZK evm Ryan uh taking what I learned from starkware the starkware sessions uh that was at a week and a half ago so much more can go on chain with his eke evm than even with an optimistic roll up so there's just like this untapped playing field obviously like some things come to mind like on-chain gaming we can put more of our game logic on chain and make that composable and people will use that as a playground but that's just like one thing more and more things that go on chain are more and more surface area for more and more things to get built and so like there is this world out there called the zkevms that are going to have more things more Logic on chain and allow for more composability and we have these teams that are racing to produce this new real estate there is going to be so much Innovation as a result of this is it this really is people are not accounting this really is like cryptos uh Broadband moment isn't it yeah yeah yeah exactly and yeah that's right I could not have had the in dial-up land we could not have had Netflix yeah is it going to be the same thing we're going to be able to get like all of the use cases of the internet that require High throughput we're going to apply that same logic to zkevms we're going to untap this massive New Field of what can be done because we can put so much stuff on chain yeah I don't know if you ever saw that clip it's from like 1993 or something and it was like Bill Gates being interviewed by David Letterman and uh he was asking like like build like explain the internet or something and um Bill Gates was like well you know you'll be able to kind of listen to broadcasts online and music and Letterman's like what you mean like the radio yeah right and everyone and then everyone laughs right everyone laughs like yeah what a joke but like it's just back in 1993 that was beyond like it was impossible you couldn't even stream stream I didn't even know if we had MP3 uh compression format back then but you certainly couldn't uh stream sound let alone video and uh 10 years later we had broadband and everything changed so all of the crypto use cases that people have said are on the horizon and and they are coming and like crypto gaming all these things that we haven't seen yet I think a lot of that's just been waiting for broadband and uh this is the beginning of that I will say that is definitely true like all these crypto use cases like streaming payments like stuff like that but also importantly we just there's so much there's more stuff than the stuff that we know about in the world that we don't know about like there's new stuff that we do not know about that we cannot imagine that we just need one creative developer to do something and then all of a sudden people are like oh I didn't know you could do that and then all of a sudden a new world happens and that's why I'm bullish on yeah okay cool what what are you uh more AI content on Bank list David I feel like we got to do it now um so we recorded a podcast with uh Elise orkowski earlier this week it comes out Monday if you are a bankless citizen you already have that episode and it was the first podcast David where I feel like I was prepared for a completely different podcast than it turned out to be and I'm like I'm almost like doubting myself I'm like maybe like did I do kind of a shitty job on that like uh I mean you were there it was just a very hard conversational interview it was a difficult interview and he accidentally stumbled into like 400 level AI content yes uh I I was telling you David before like when we were recapping that that episode where it felt like um we we wanted to get some uh not necessarily light AI topic but just like an overview of AI and let's learn a little bit about Ai and how it intersects with crypto and like rather than like doing the level one boss we went all the way to the final boss and like genius level AI guy who is um very dimorist about the entire project AI Doomer yeah basically I mean we titled the episode we're all gonna die because that was the conclusion the entire it was the start it was the conclusion it was the middle it was all of it was we're all gonna die and um that the the debrief of that episode I actually might go back and listen to it again because I was in a pretty bad mental state like after that episode almost like existential dread type of stuff which um I don't know that I've been hit like that in a while like obviously we all you know when we first realized there's nuclear weapons that can blow up the world right that's that's kind of a moment uh in your existence where you're like wow this like we're on a knife's edge of success or failure as a species and this was another one for me not that I hadn't heard the kind of the case for um artificial general intelligence and how it could spell Doom for anyone but it's just to see someone uh in not in the flesh I guess across the screen but like to be with someone who has clearly thought about this tried his hardest against it and almost like I don't want to say given up but like is just he's reached this inevitable conclusion that we're all gonna die it was um it was very um I don't know it was it was a moment for me a memorable moment and um there might be some like failings on that podcast too I feel like like maybe there are different directions we could have asked him and so I'd love the bankless community's kind of feedback on what we could have done differently but all of this means is I we can't let that be the last episode on bankless about AI all right because uh if it is I don't think we've told the full story there's got to be someone much more optimistic about things that are going into artificial intelligence I'm looking for like another doctor to give me a second opinion on that terminal diagnosis that Eliezer just gave us that aside at least there's a brilliant I think it's a really interesting episode if you want to see two crypto guys try to like not to get dragged down uh like going in too deep in the deep end with his subject then this is the episode they like to to watch but you have been thinking about this episode the entire week so um it's I don't know if I'm really bullish about it I just wanted to fit this in I wanted to tell that to you right now well uh I hopefully have good news for you Ryan because uh vitalik put me into DMS with Sam Altman uh and so uh I got a response from Sam Altman TBD so whether I can get him to say yes to come on to the show but this would be the first ever the Same album is the guy behind chat GPT and open AI oh yeah I don't I don't think he's done a podcast since the rise of chapter gbt so if we could land that interview that would be awesome uh and also that would be the the more optimistic uh typical happy flavor of bankless content that we would be able to really got me down this week yeah yeah you did but I'm also bullish on AI content um and this and like this isn't just bankless like oh bankless is doing AI stuff we talk about front running the opportunity that's one of the main themes of this show eventually Ai and the in crypto worlds will collide and we want to equip the bankless community with the ability to understand that inevitable conclusion which is why we're doing AI stuff David we also talked about coordination failures and if we can't protect ourselves from artificial gender intelligence like that that is the mother of all coordination failures if we screw that one up isn't it right yeah bankless is much more of a coordination podcast and it is a crypto podcast so is ethereum coordination technology that's uh that's really the Hope here uh all right meme of the week David what do we got meme of the week what do we have in this meme of the week sell me this Satoshi this is what what movie is this Wolf of Wall Street Wolf of Wall Street yeah sell me this Satoshi and this is the Leonardo DiCaprio uh holding up a pen he's like selling me this pen uh so the response to sell me the Satoshi is it's an ordinal that's awesome for those that don't know an ordinal is uh and basically data that's appended to a single Satoshi so all of a sudden a single Satoshi can have the value of an nft uh that's the meme very cool uh all right guys risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice neither Dave and myself are registered investment advisors we never will be at least maybe David will someday I won't I can promise you that nope uh crypto is risky you gotta know this by now we tell you every week you could
