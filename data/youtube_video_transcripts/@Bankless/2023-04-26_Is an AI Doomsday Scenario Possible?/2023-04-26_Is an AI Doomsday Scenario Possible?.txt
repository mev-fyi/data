what is your percentage likelihood of the full out Doom scenario where we're all gonna die from the machines I think maybe there's something like a 10 20 chance of hey I take over many most humans Dead really high I agree better than 100 David just better than 100 so there's other ways that the development of AI can be rough you can have access to new destructive physical technology and that adds up to at least another 10 overall you know maybe you're getting more up to like 50 50 chance of Doom shortly after you have systems that are at human level
