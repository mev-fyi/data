hello everyone today we're going to read global public goods and the protocol sync thesis so this article has been a long time coming and it was originally supposed to be just about the protocol sync and what the protocol sync is but as writing happens thoughts develop and so i added this new aspect which is the global public goods aspect to the protocol sync and really this article tries to answer the question what is at the bottom of the protocol sync and so you're probably only familiar with the protocol sync if you're listening to me and ryan on the bankless podcast talk about it and tweet about it so this article also does define what that protocol sync actually is so let's go ahead and get into it ethereum is a platform for global public goods in the realm of money and finance the protocol sync thesis illustrates how applications move from being financial experiments to unstoppable global financial platforms used by everyone the more people use an application the further down in the protocol sync it falls and the more things that collect at the bottom of the protocol sync the stronger ethereum's gravitational pull grows this is just an awesome gif kind of illustrating how there's like this network on top of the world this layer on top of the world and it's all these protocols like there's ethereum but then the protocols themselves are also layered upon the world the protocol sync the protocol sync thesis offers a model for how cryptosystems will manifest at maturity the thesis states that the more trustless permissionless incredibly neutral a protocol is the further it can scale itself to a global platform and as a consequence absorb a larger amount of capital protocols that offer a platform to build upon become dense and fall down to the bottom of the protocol sink from the collective weight of the people and companies building on them web 3 web 3 d5 protocols like unit swap compound and maker will survive in the long term by removing attack vectors and gaining anti-fragility which will allow them to break through the limits on the scale that the web 2 applications have reached sorry two key features predict where a protocol finds its resting place in the protocol sync utility and surface area utility of a protocol is the value that the protocol brings to its users and generates the incentive for adopting and leveraging the protocol the utility of a protocol is the incentive it generates for depositing money and assets into contracts the total value of assets deposited into an application think the value locked in d5 everything that we see on d5 pulse for protocols with a token utility can be measured by the token's market cap or the total value deposited into its contracts surface area the attack surface area of a protocol is the weakness or resistance a protocol has to capture coercion corruption and exploit if a protocol has a large attack surface it can be captured coerced and exploited to benefit some individuals over others which invalidates the credible neutrality of the protocol the elimination of attack surface area reduces the ways that a protocol favors one set of individuals over everyone else if a protocol has minimal attack surfaces the protocol is trustless permissionless and credibly neutral these qualities are what enable it to scale to the maximum number of people this increases the protocol's potential for receiving more deposits from a wider set of users and thus impacts its weight density to discover the projected density of a protocol or application on ethereum you simply take the utility of a protocol how useful it is and then you divide it by its attack surface area how easy it is to capture that utility things that are very useful and cannot be captured will find themselves at the bottom of the protocol sink dense protocols are found at the bottom density limits in web 2. we've seen early indications of the presence of the protocol scene from a large from the large web 2 platforms like youtube twitter facebook in which almost all companies and businesses have profiles on these platforms right like ford uh you know baskin and robins whatever disney they all have like facebook accounts they all have twitter accounts so all companies have these twitter accounts and then also all people have twitter accounts these these are platforms for other people to build on even further platforms like the ios app store and android play store are found in the deeper layers of the protocol sync due to the mass of companies that build on the products on top of them the web 2 gargantuans like google apple amazon facebook twitter are all found somewhere in the protocol sync not necessarily at the bottom definitely not at the bottom these companies achieve their mass valuations because they build platforms for others to build on businesses individuals nonprofits social organizations all have free access to sign up and use their service and the web 2 platforms become global infrastructure used by everyone these companies have succeeded in scale by creating a global platform through a product with lots of utility while also being relatively lazy fair about what users can or cannot do on their platform the web 2 movement illustrates the presence of the same outcomes that the protocol sync thesis predict global non-rivalrous non-exclusionary platforms like instagram facebook twitter youtube medium have seen incredible adoption and growth due to the density they amassed from free user generated content and their ability to scale to the widest audience possible however being a product from a for-profit company the answers to nation-state regulators places a limit on the scale of these platforms the incentive of the company to extract as much as possible out of the user in order to generate revenue from the advertiser is inherently misaligning between all three parties another limit on scale the web 2 movement is built upon the highly dense protocols of the web 1 layer tcp http ftp are some of the world's most densely built slash discovered protocols and represents the bottom most layer of the protocol sync we don't talk about these much because of how invisible they are to us and unlike web 3 protocols they aren't things to invest or profit from they have perfect credible neutrality web 3 protocols applications found on ethereum should strive to achieve this same level of credible neutrality as the protocols of web one twitter facebook youtube are all free global services and they have provided much value to the world but ultimately they are the private property of a single company these products benefit a certain group of people above all others and enable the influence and coercion of the people that use them as these platforms have reached maturity conversations have emerged about their monopoly status and their bias nature as it turns out the human subjectivity involved with monitoring content limits their neutrality and prevents them from being an unbiased protocol additionally being a centralized company forces them to be a subject to the rules and regulations of a nation-state government the free sign up and entrance into these platforms as well as the value they provide made these platforms incredibly useful but the existence of a centralized for-profit company has placed limits on how far these platforms can scale or the freedoms that they have no matter how much utility these companies provide they will never provide enough to sink to the bottom of the protocol sink in order to fall down the protocol sync you cannot be a for-profit company that answers to government regulation and subjective human desires the bias trust and permission present in these platforms is the achilles heel that paints a target on the back of the operators in order to fall down deeper in the protocol sync you must be a self-regulating global protocol that doesn't require a central operator to uphold the system the protocol itself must be self-sovereign prediction of the protocol sync thesis the core prediction of the protocol sync thesis is that the centralized businesses and companies will freely build upon top of build on top of trustless permissionless and unbiased protocols in order to offer superior services to their users as a result cryptoeconomic protocols are destined to fall below the centralized companies in the protocol sync simple game theory suggests that centralized companies like crypto banks coinbase gemini will leverage the power of decentralized protocols beneath them in order to create uh increase their value to their customers so here's a little graphic that that ryan john adams made where we have like d5 and then we also have crypto banks but the prediction is that crypto banks are going to build on top of defy while right now they're mostly in parallel but soon we're gonna see like the d5 is gonna win a thumb war and crypto banks are going to build on top of defy any crypto bank can improve its product and services by enabling users to access the die savings rate for example the dsr customers with dye in their account can one click themselves into earning the apr offered by the dsr while crypto banks compete with themselves none of them compete with a dsr and none of them have anything to lose by leveraging it while coinbase and gemini are rival risks using the dsr is not this allows the dsr to scale to any financial institution or individual who chooses to use it you can repeat this same model for any protocol or application on ethereum maker compound pool together agar global public goods are the things that are found at the bottom of the protocol sync useful protocols have removed trust bias and permission will find themselves leveraged by companies businesses banks and individuals from all over the world global public goods do not answer to or even recognize nation state regulations air water knowledge and internet protocols are all the same all over the globe and do not change based on the regulations of a jurisdiction they are something that everyone can use regardless of where they live and ethereum is a platform for hosting global public goods in money and finance all right sinks attractors and basins this is gonna be like a slight detour into some metaphysical sciency type the sink in a protocol sink is not talking about your kitchen sink although that is relevant rather a sink is a place of convergence a sink is an environment that defines the borders and limits of a closed system which influences the trajectory and the outcomes of all the chaotic nebulous set of individual units inside of it a sink forces the convergence of independent chaotic things into a singular ordered pattern of dependable predictable outcomes in mathematics an attractor also known as a sink is a condition or set of conditions towards which a systems tends to evolve for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system system values get close enough to the attractor values that system values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if disturbed over time things converge upon a stable condition regardless of their starting condition the place that things converge upon the attractor is not actually a thing but rather the emergent location of many independent things that have shown to converge upon it nothing central is actually attracting them there but rather the collective emergent forces of the universe pushes them into a common order so this is basically stating that you have the sink you have this basin you have this realm and then there are certain conditions of that realm and the conditions of that realm will no matter like how many times we roll the dice know how many times we've run the simulation things will always converge upon the same outcomes at the end of the day another word for sink is a basin below is a map of the river basins of the usa most notably the river the mississippi basin is in in pink is one of the world's largest basins any droplet of water that falls anywhere inside the pink region is assured to ultimately find itself at the point of convergence where the mississippi river meets the atlantic ocean so like the mississippi basin all this is one massive basin and so it doesn't matter what happens because whenever any pers rainfall happens anywhere it always goes to the same spot things converge outcomes are the same the mississippi basin is the sink gravity is the force that generates the energy that creates convergence at the bottom ethereum is a basin ethereum apps are the creeks streams rivers that reside within it money assets and capital is the water that flows downstream there is an attractor at the bottom of the protocol sink that pulls applications and assets downwards and this attractor is the universal collective global demand for global public goods take a look at this real quick because i'm going to talk about it this graphic has been going around twitter recently and perfectly represents the protocol sync things on ethereum converge they coalesce and collectively descend down the protocol sync it also illustrates how ethereum is not just a bunch of separate applications but is instead one single cohered network of interconnecting applications the demand for global platforms with user-generated value is ubiquitous and generates a perpetual incentive to build applications on ethereum ethereum is the sink for minimally extractive coordinators an internet basin that converges on permissionless trustless and unbiased applications in money and finance the fundamental innovation that ethereum provides is as a system that offers free security and protection to applications that aspire to be global public goods i guess i have two sections titled the protocol sync global public goods are what is found at the bottom of the protocol sink the cryptoeconomic revolution is built on the fundamental assumption assumption that in its final form this revolution will have spawned an array of global public goods in money and finance global public goods are by definition the most scalable usable dependable and persistent infrastructure that we have available and the qualities that make a good global public good are the same qualities that push a protocol down the protocol sync there are two characteristics that determines a protocol's place in the protocol in the protocol sync attack surface and utility attack surface is the measure that illustrates the protocol's weakness to capture and control simplistically having a low attack surface means simply means that there is no essential point of a protocol trust permission and bias are the characteristics that determine where the center of a protocol is or how easy it is to develop difficult it is to capture a protocol trustlessness when using a protocol how much trust are users placing in others to do the right thing with the selfish mo will the self selfish motives of others impact the outcome of other users is anyone extracting anything from a user against their will or knowledge if trust is not an issue the protocol will fall down further in the protocol sync permissionlessness can anyone use the protocol is there some someone that can restrict or censor usage of the protocol are there admin keys that give certain privileges to a special set of users if everyone has equal access to the protocol and no one can censor others the protocol will fall down further in the protocol sync credible neutrality does the protocol benefit any particular user or entity above any other does one person have or entity disportion disproportionately benefit from the success of the protocol than what is fair if the protocol is sufficiently fair or equitable then it will fall further down the protocol sync utility is simply the measure that the value that a protocol provides to the world the more useful a protocol is the more people companies entities will build on top of it when a protocol has high utility more value more capital will be deposited into the cap location this generates mass which adds to the density if the protocol has utility it will fall further down the protocol sink each characteristic above has its own spectrum an application that can be anywhere an application can be anywhere on the 0 to 100 scale for both attack surface and utility further the total score of this character of the characteristics illustrates the density of the applications in relation to each other this scoring system is largely just for illustrative purposes just to illustrate the metaphor i'm going to call this the gb gpg score later in the article the global public good score assets and applications the protocol sync doesn't only apply to assets applications on ethereum but assets as well on ethereum assets are applications not applications are tokens but all tokens are applications applications on ethereum are defined by a contract with its own address if it's a contract on ethereum it's an app in the glass cylinder above we have both liquids and solids of various densities like the liquids the solids find their appropriate place in the protocol sink that corresponds with their native density the global public good score applies to assets just as much as applications all right here we get into into public goods wikipedia's definition of a public good in economics a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous and that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could benefit from without paying for it and where one where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others or the good uh to the others or the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person this is in contrast to a common good such as wild fish stocks in the ocean which is non-excludable but is rival risk to a certain degree as if too many fish are harvested the stocks will be depleted non-excludability a good a good is excludable if it is possible to prevent people who have not paid for it from having access to it a good or service is non-excludable if non-paying customers cannot be prevented from accessing it non-rival risk a good is rival risk if its consumption is by one consumer prevents the consumption by another or if consumption by one party reduces the ability of another party to consume it a good is considered non-rival risk if for any level of production the cost of providing it to a marginal individual is zero public goods do not get exhausted the more that they are used air water sunlight are all public goods listening to a radio broadcast does not prevent others from also listening street lights illuminate the roads for everyone equally as with all things there is a spectrum involved streams and lakes are public goods anyone can use them and they are very difficult to to deplete however they can be depleted while they are depletion resistant the scaling of the human species has shown that it does have the capacity to deplete even the largest reservoirs of public goods a river has a nearly endless supply of water thanks to the cycles of the seasons that migrate precipitation higher in elevation however there is a rate limit to which water migrates upstream if the consumption rate passes the supply rate scarcity takes over and public goods turn into rivalrous ones sunlight pours endlessly across the earth but there is finite space available to capture it physical space is endless and inexhaustible except some spaces are more valuable than other spaces which makes them rivalrous global public goods are public goods but their benefits extend to all countries people and generations global public goods have the ability to scale far beyond the typical public good the ability for some public goods to extend to a global and generational scale comes from how some public goods are anti-fragile in their nature two different things can both be public goods but if one is anti-fragile it will become a global public good anti-fragile anti-fragile is a property of systems that increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors shocks volatility noise mistakes faults attacks or failures it is a concept developed by naseem nicholas taleb in his book antifragile as taleb explains in his book anti-fragility is fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency the ability to recover from failure or robustness the ability to resist failure public goods often have qualities of resilience and robustness earlier i call this depletion resistance but global republicans are anti-fragile they get better or stronger as more people use them the key feature behind global public goods is that they benefit from the externalities of the users that consume them the more a global public good is consumed or used or leveraged the stronger it gets ideas and knowledge are global public goods when you share an idea you also retain that idea and you enable others to use it and share it a good idea can scale to the whole world without subtracting anything from the idea originator or the idea itself ideas transcend generations without any decay most importantly an idea improves when more people think about it ideas are something to be iterated and expanded upon these iterations are similarly as scalable and shareable as the original idea itself good ideas find themselves being shared iterated and developed and adopted faster than bad ideas which which is how a small spark can turn into a revolution in such a short amount of time ideas are better if everyone has the same idea the internet is also a global public good the use of the internet does not inhibit others from also using it and the more people use the internet the more useful it becomes for others if more things are on the internet the more utility the internet provides for more people which brings more users to the internet in the first place which generates the incentive to which generates a stronger incentive to build further things upon the internet the products are of web 2 are anti-fragile at their core facebook instagram twitter all become better products when more of the world is using them however the companies that own these projects are just as products are just as fragile as the rest of the world and therein lies the problem of the scale of these projects products the free rider problem the free rider problem is the burden on a shared resource that is created by its use or overuse by people who aren't paying their fair share streetlights are public goods that require resources to build and consume energy for their operation this requires taxes upon its users and anyone not paying taxes places a burden on the ability for a public global a publica to scale and become more useful this is why street lights are not a global public good their use does not make them more scalable global public goods by definition are public goods that are immune from the free rider problem in fact it's the opposite global public goods have mechanisms that bake in some minimum level of contribution to their usage you by definition cannot use a global public good without returning some amount of value and that amount of value provided is above the minimum threshold needed for keeping the global public good alive and healthy simply using the global public good is providing it with a newer shipment it needs to sustain itself rather than a tragedy of the commons global public goods instead experience the festival of the commons where the commons is a place to come together and rejoice in our common usage of a shared utility that improves as the festival grows bitcoin is a global public good bitcoin lives on because of the strength of its anti-fragility the value of bitcoin the asset comes from bitcoin's anti-fragility bitcoin's anti-fragility generates the strongest possible assurances for the future settlement of bitcoins at any time frame in which turn generates its utility and incentive for use in the first place bitcoin succeeds and is itself valued because of its anti-fragility any other crypto any other crypto economic blockchain system that is born in this space must also exhibit anti-fragile qualities or else it will be eventually forced to succumb to the rules and paradigms that keep the legacy systems afloat laws and regulations by nation states this is what xrp that's the realm that xrp is in things that are anti-fragile don't need laws or regulations to keep them afloat they support themselves anti-fragility is independence from outside help and support bitcoin is the first example of a global public good that offers a monetary or financial platform for the world that matches the current state of technology and needs by the citizens of planet earth gold was also a global public good but it slowly became obsolete and antiquated as new technology subverted its utility ethereum is a protocol for global public goods it's a global public good for global public goods as discussed in a bankless nation part 2 ethereum is a protocol for protocols it is a platform ethereum as a platform does the heavy lifting for producing an environment that is favorable for generating global public good applications ethereum is a platform that has security and protection baked in at the protocol which allows for applications to be built that don't need to concern themselves with their individual security and protection national parks are global public goods because they receive the protection of laws and regulations in the united states if they did not have this protection they would either have succumbed to the tragedy or of the commons or be divided into private property and be unable to be used or appreciated by the public at large imagine the grand canyon but with houses building streets plumbing sewage systems throughout it it wouldn't be the grand canyon it would be a tragedy in order to maintain public good status of the national parks the usa protects them via real rules and regulations it bottlenecks entry restricts usage in order to preserve the ability for grand canyon to be appreciated by everyone in all future generations the usa uses tax dollars to support this public good without this protection the national parks wouldn't exist and they as they don't have the anti-fragility required to be self-sovereign self-sustaining public goods they require outside help the usa protocol protects and maintains public goods because of the belief that they are that some things that should be public goods but without protection would deteriorate into private property ethereum follows a similar pattern but instead of local public goods like national parks is a platform for the creation and protection of global public goods in the realm of money and finance uniswap maker dao compound are all financial applications because that alright excuse me unit swap maker down compound are all financial applications that are better because they are unrestricted and unregulated a uni-swap that is a for-profit company under the purview of a nation-state is not a unit swap at all permissionless collateralized loans are simply more useful when they are not subject to wall street regulations borrowing and lending are more efficient when the rules and regulations are baked into the protocol not administered by a central government ethereum is the protocol that offers protections to public goods which enables them to become global public goods because of the security offered by ethereum applications can replace the rules and regulations of the nation state with their own rules that protocols designers have deemed optimal optimal for their particular application uniswap compound maker are all given sovereignty by ethereum the only rules that ethereum imparts upon its applications is that they abide by the laws of the evm ethereum is a protocol that enables financial application self-sovereignty uniswap i recently wrote a piece titled uniswapa's infrastructure that explores a few key points about the uniswap application the point of this article was to illustrate uniswap's anti-fragility and its innate ability to scale to meet the demand of the whole globe where whatever demand that may be however i now realize i was actually describing uniswap as a global public good uniswap keeps itself alive by baking in its own nourishment into the protocol the point three percent exchange fee is what drives liquidity into the protocol and creates the environment for uniswap to just scale to a global platform the exchange fee is how uniswap consumers are simultaneously unisop producers there's no way to use uniswap without giving back to the protocol this is uniswap's anti-fragility and its mechanism for how it rises to global public good status but is it decentralized question mark this is in reference to unit swap this is just the question we've heard this question endlessly from various different critics of ethereum and the things being built upon it what these critics are really asking is whether the product in question has the capacity to become anti-fragile and gain global public good status listen to the episode on the d5 trust spectrum it is impossible to be a global public good while being under the control of admin keys admin keys illustrate power and control over something which is antithetical to the role and purpose of a global public good global public goods are public and require no external protection or support therefore admin keys must be must be absent from a global public good the existence of admin keys means there is potential to reduce the trustlessness permissionless or credible neutrality and if this potential exists it cannot be a global public good comp and the governance token revolution compound recently debuted its comp token which had which has changed the game for how a protocol in ethereum moves from being a public good protected by a centralized entity to a global public good with a decentralized set of keepers while comp is the most salient example of this the underlying structure is independent from comp and is a model that many ethereum applications can follow to elevate themselves to the status of global public good this model was illustrated by gavin mcdermott in his mob article meet the saf g the staff ga token model is how ethereum applications elegantly and seamlessly migrate from being a protected public good to an anti-fragile global public good this is the fundamental reason why the ethereum defy ecosystems are so excited about this new token model paradigm protecting the protector ether the asset is a global public good and most importantly it is the global public good that supports the health of the ethereum ecosystem which is an ecosystem of more global public goods all the global public goods on ethereum current and future depend on the value of eth in order to function the higher the east price the stronger the protection ethereum can provide to the global public goods that run on top of it a rejection of the value of each is not just a disservice to those attempting to build something of value on ethereum it is a direct attack upon these efforts this is why i vehemently reject the notion that shilling eth is bad and comes out of the mouth of someone who doesn't understand this concept or how he is inextricably tied to any and all efforts surrounding ethereum and his development when the price of eth grows so do the walls that protect the global public goods on ethereum fortunately ether itself is a global public good it is anti-fragile and does not need the support of others to grow i've illustrates i've illustrated eth's destiny in ethereum in a few articles which i summarized below through the the lens of eth's destiny as the global public good that protects ethereum like applications on ethereum all my articles are composable and each one builds off the others and the of and makes the others better and more useful in my opinion this hits pretty hard and is a good finale to this article ethereum is an immersion structure applications on ethereum are composable and this composability makes applications meld together over time rather than being a platform of many individual apps ethereum is a single structure of melded applications that are all coalescing together ether as the asset with the highest gpg score on ethereum is the point at which this structure gains its initial and strongest foundations other assets are welcome and encouraged to aid in the support and foundation of the structure in fact other assets are required you can't build a structure on a single point ether due to its privileged position position as the native asset to ethereum will always be contributing greater support and foundation to the ethereum defy structure the weight of this structure is directly correlated to the price of the assets that support it on the secondary market the fundamental value prop of eth assuming that plan planned protocol up updates are all included mainly staking in eip1559 ether is given direct exposure to the health and size of the ethereum economy the volume of the ethereum economy will generate eth scarcity in the form of eip-1559 the burning of eth at a rate that follows the size of the ethereum economy the scarcity of eth is directly related to its utility score in the gpg score criteria the utility of eth is scarcity current and future global public goods on ethereum will all demand eth as an asset due to its high gpg score lots of global public goods on ethereum will generate endless demand for eth you know swap is infrastructure gpgs on ethereum improve as more people use them each global public good can act as infrastructure for other global public goods but making making the creation of new and more useful global public goods easier over time aka they all stack together as new global public goods come onto ethereum they make pre-existing global public goods more useful in turn the more global public goods there are the more better global public goods on ethereum there are collectively pushing each other down the protocol sink when there are many global public goods with high utility at the bottom of the ethereum protocol sync the gravitational pull of the collective market cap of all global public good protocols will reach a sphere that is outside of ethereum this produces a positive feedback loop in not just global public good numbers but also global public good utilities and therefore a dual feedback loop in the incentive to come use ethereum in the first place conclusion ethereum is an attractor for global public goods in ethereum anti-fragility begets anti-fragility the last two points in the above unit swap is infrastructure summary illustrates the future of ethereum a landscape of anti-fragile global public goods infrastructure currently there are just a few applications found at the bottom of the protocol sink with just a few hundred million dollars of density found there over time as more mass collects at the bottom the stronger the influence of the gravitational pull will be this influence will pull on things higher up in the protocol sink and force them down into the realm of global public goods the growing mass at the bottom of the protocol sink exerts a gravitational pull that extends beyond the internal ethereum ecosystem in addition to the internal ethereum ecosystem the capital and assets found in the outside world world will also feel the presence of value found at the bottom of the protocol sink value is a nebulous thing the barriers and restrictions of the nation say are not strong enough to prevent value from permeating into ethereum over time value will migrate onto the world of anti-fragile global public goods show me the incentive and i'll show you the outcome this famous line from charlie munger illustrates why i have such strong convictions about the development of the ethereum ecosystem at maturity modeled in this article global public goods offer incentives too strong to be ignored by the rest of the world chris bruniski's piece protocols as minimally extractive coordinators illustrates the incentive to adopt ethereum-based global public good platforms above any other alternative he concludes his piece with the following two sentences any unnecessary extraction from the process of exchange is a tax that will ultimately be weeded out by copy paste competition in the world of open source protocols while this presents a brave new world for businesses minimizing extraction should accrue to the benefit of all consumers ethereum is a free market crucible where competition is so active and harsh that the only things that can survive at the end of the race are anti-fragile global public good systems everything else finds their appropriate space place higher up in the protocol sync i look forward to the web 3 world that the protocol sync will bring it will be a hundred times more useful than web 2 but with the same fairness and credible neutrality of web one once it is here humanity can truly resemble a single global community cool thanks everyone for
