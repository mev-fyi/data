what is the evolution of music nfts like did it did this start with tokenized music or did it start with we want to fix the system it's a little bit of both you know my relationship with music and web 3 in general started from fixing the system as a whole so i went to school for music business and i was told about smart contracts being able to expedite the royalty system if i stream your track on spotify today you are not going to see that payment for about three to six months it's gonna go through a bunch of different systems and eventually over time it's gonna trickle down and come back to one of your sites that you can go and press the button to collect from when i heard about smart contracts as a way to be able to say hey i'm streaming your track right now here's one cent and it's going to go directly to your wallet that instantly clicked and made sense to me and over time that sort of grew into tokenized collectible music instead of it just being a one-of-one collectible with only one fan collecting we started to see people tokenizing 10 25 100 1 000 records and since then we've now seen kind of a wider wave around generative music and sort of bigger drops in the form of platforms like beat foundry sound men and now more recently a lot of the bigger artists and music entities are building their own drop sites and products
