i want to shift a little bit to the creator economy what is the sentiment right now around web3 and nfts among like the tick tock young creator crowd no one understands nor cares about it there's less than 10 people i know in the creator economy that's like taking it seriously actually doing well at the end of the day web 3 is complicated so when it comes to creators coming in we obviously seen a lot of just people get into it not understanding it and then obviously getting taken advantage of and you know putting their name behind something that's not as reputable or whatnot i think that creators are going to eventually understand but they're like everyone else it takes the right person to educate them on it
