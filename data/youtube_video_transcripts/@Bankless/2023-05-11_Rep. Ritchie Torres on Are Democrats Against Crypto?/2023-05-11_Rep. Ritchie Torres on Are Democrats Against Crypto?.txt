foreign [Music] we have a special episode for you today a bonus episode the question on my mind is are Democrats for or against crypto we have representative Richie Torres who happens to be a Democrat helping to answer that question I'm taking this episode solo today but it is jam-packed this is our first Democratic member of Congress on Bank list so you know we had to ask him what does he think about crypto is it a partisan issue what does he think of Gary Gensler in cdbc's will crypto become a 2024 election campaign issue and how about his party how about the Democrats how do we get more support for crypto among progressives and among Democrats that was the question today so yes we are having a politician on the podcast today and I want to begin by saying this bankless is not a political podcast we're not read we're not team blue we don't have a party affiliation to the U.S or in any country what we do care about are values like decentralization autonomy and power to the people that underlie crypto technology you've heard us talk about this before on the bankless podcast and to the extent these values are political so are we this is not a clean party line's distinction we'll have anyone on the podcast from team red Cynthia lemus Ted Cruz they're all welcome here so is AOC and Elizabeth Warren we just want to have the conversation for my own part as I've said before I see massive value for both conservatives and true progressives in the crypto movement and I think that'll come out here today I'll be back to have this conversation with representative

conditional District this is basically the Bronx representative Torres was elected to congress in the 2020 elections and is one of the few members of the Democrat Party who is pro-crypto and that is great to hear representative Torres welcome to bankless how you doing today it's a pleasure to be here can you tell us uh firstly we've been looking for some Democrats to come on Bank lists to talk a bit more about crypto and you are a name that has come to mind um more than a few times tell us about your position on crypto why are you supportive why are you Pro crypto uh sure and I and I should start with a disclaimer you know I've never been a user of crypto I've never been an investor in crypto so I have no personal skin in the game but I do have an intellectual curiosity about the Innovative possibilities of crypto and blockchain like I'm drawn to the potential of blockchain to radically decentralize the internet creating a new layer commonly known as web3 or radically decentralized Finance creating a better cheaper and faster payment system particularly for the lowest income families you know I'm excited about the possibility of creating uh decentralized economy Progressive ownership society and which workers and creators can keep a greater share of their own income can enjoy and own the fruits of their own labor um you know I'll use an analogy so I represent a neighborhood known as Arthur Avenue which historically was actually controlled by the mafia and if you owned a business on Arthur Avenue you would have to pay a toll or taxes to the mafia and there's a sense in which big Tech is the mafia of web 2. you know apple has a take rate of about 30 percent YouTube 50 Facebook 100 in fact big Tech has a much higher take rate than the mafia and so what I find most appealing about crypto and blockchain is that it will enable workers and creators to liberate themselves from the excessive and often extortionary rent seeking of the Legacy Financial system and the Legacy internet these are many of the benefits that we see a representative Torres but I want to ask you the question if you could do some political analysis how come you think this topic of crypto is so polarizing in Capitol Hill I think the starting point is a lack of Education like everyone seems to have an opinion on crypto everyone has heard of crypto but few people can Define it I mean I would venture to guests that most members of Congress could not Define crypto blockchain and web3 and yet everyone is rushing to offer an opinion on the subject so the the you know I said earlier at a congressional hearing that there seems to be an anti-crypto derangement syndrome that has clouded clear and rational thinking about the subject of crypto and much of it is rooted in ignorance what you will find is that the pro crypto members of Congress are much more knowledgeable about the technology than the opposition would you think there was a time I would say in the not too um distant past where I would have said crypto was kind of a bipartisan issue and there was kind of some bipartisan support uh but not a lot a lot of bipartisan apathy I would say or neutrality let's say but increasingly it's it's seemed to have split among party lines and I'm wondering if you see that and it I'm I'm wondering if um you'll like what could you say on behalf of Democratic party like what how would you sell members of the democratic party on on this technology and why do you think it has split across partisan lines well my perception is that the Divide on crypto is not so much partisan or ideological as it is generational you will find that younger Democrats like myself and Wiley Nichol who sits on financial services are much more open to the Innovative possibilities of crypto and blockchain and and I want to be you know Crystal Clear whatever one's personal View of crypto is irrelevant like for me as a policy maker my role is not to evaluate the utility of crypto and blockchain right you know the role of government is not to sabotage Innovation the role of government is to ensure that Innovation is safe for consumers and investors um and so that's the role that I see myself as playing in the United States Congress as you know Congress is something of a gerontocracy until recently our three leading three leaders in the Democratic caucus who are all above the age of 80. almost all of our committee chairs are above the age of 70. and so among the leading members of Congress there tends to be a xenophobia about new technologies like crypto and blockchain so I see it more as a generational divide than an ideological one more of a generational divide than an ideological one and uh so you do think that there are wins for the Democratic party and kind of the the policies and and the things that the Democratic party values there there are lots of wins in crypto so would you point to like I think everyone has like there's a sense in which crypto is a raw shock test right on which you can project your ideological values you know a libertarian season crypto a tool for an alternative to government control a progressive might see in crypto an alternative to corporate control or tool for aiding the most vulnerable in our society and a conservative might see in crypto a tool for creating a Civil Society on the internet so it's like a buffet there's something for everyone in the world of crypto and blockchain and I can explain briefly why it appeals to me I represent New York 15 which is the South Bronx it's the forest congressional district in America and so I represent families who are struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills and keep their families afloat and these are families who have been catastrophically left behind by the traditional Financial system right I represent immigrants who pay exorbitant fees in order to transfer their own money abroad to their loved ones you know about a decade ago the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs did a study and found that low-income people in places like the South Bronx pay 200 million dollars a year on check cashing fees hmm people of color in places like the South Bronx and so for me a technology like blockchain can enable the lowest income families to transfer remittances while Escaping The Long delays and the high fees of the traditional Financial system and and that's a game changer what would you like to see Congress or the US do to sort of support uh the use cases and the crypto technology that can bring the change that you just discussed what could Congress be doing what should it do well Congress should create a workable but rigorous framework for regulating crypto we should create a framework that enables the best actors to innovate while filtering out the worst actors and and what I find fascinating is the debate in Congress is not how to regulate crypto but whether to regulate crypto you know there were there is an anti-crypto faction which has taken the position that crypto should collapse under the weight of its own volatility and that to regulate crypto is to legitimize it whereas I feel differently I feel like we have an obligation to create an environment in which the worst actors are held accountable but the best actors are given the freedom to innovate to build on the Computing platform that is blockchain I think this sounds reasonable I I mean one of the criticisms though from the um the crypto Community to regulators and um to the US government is uh entrepreneurs and those good actors trying to work on some of the use cases that you just mentioned don't have sufficient regulatory Clarity there's a kind of an encounter in a congressional hearing a couple of weeks ago where members of Congress repeatedly asked uh the the leading regulator of the SEC Gary Gensler to just tell us a simple matter second largest market cap cryptocurrency that is ethereum whether it's a security or not and he failed to do that he wasn't able to do that uh how could we get more clarity to the industry do you agree that the clarity that we have is not sufficient to Foster this technology and to have it um achieve some of the use cases that you mentioned in the United States there is a lack of regulatory Clarity the SEC under Gary gunzler has not issued a single rule relating to crypto it has not issued a single piece of guidance relating to crypto it has simply taken enforcement actions that come out of nowhere and the crypto Community feels ambushed by the SEC it feels like the SEC is weaponizing the registration process against the crypto industry for me Clarity is the Cornerstone of compliance you know the government has no right to accuse you of speeding unless it is telling you the speeding limit unless it is clearly defining the rules of the road and so there needs to be a greater regulatory Clarity and you know I confronted Mr genser a few weeks ago and I said to him the lesson learned from the failure of FTX is that companies like FTX offshore over leveraged deregulated companies bear the greatest risk of losing customer funds so why not focus your enforcement efforts on companies that bear the same characteristics as FTX and yet Mr Gensler has done otherwise instead of targeting sandbankment freed he's chosen to Target Kim Kardashian instead of targeting an offshore exchange he's chosen to Target coinbase instead of targeting an offshore uh stable coin issue where he's chosen to Target paxos which is rigorously regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services and so when I brought up these points to miss it again so he he more or less conceded the premise of my question and and in my view his enforcement priorities are catastrophically in the wrong place is this just a problem with one Rogue regulator and in the SE in the SEC or is it deeper than that um some encrypt of of brought forth this idea of maybe an operation checkpoint where there is an all-out assault on crypto that spans uh multiple regulatory branches in multiple areas of government where it's it's become much more difficult even for a crypto entrepreneur or a startup to actually get a bank account we can't even get the industry like banked uh in a regulated way is this one Rogue actor or do you feel like it's steeper than this serious skepticism about crypto across the regulatory state but Gary Gensler stands in a class of his own when it comes to weaponizing the registration process against crypto and what I find ironic is that Mr Gensler himself was once a supporter of crypto and blockchain I mean he taught a course on blockchain when he was at MIT a few weeks ago there was a video of Mr Gensler Shilling for a particular blockchain so there's the old Gary Gensler who was a crypto cheerleader and then there's the new Gary gunster who's a crypto critic and the new Garrett Gensler would accuse the o'gara Gensler of selling an unregistered security so it would be amusing were not for the fact that his approach to crypto is driving the activity offshore which will only create more companies like FTX representative Torres why does this happen to people when they go to DC I mean like this is kind of a fundamental uh question I have generally and I think a lot of members of Our Generation have it just seems like there is this corrupting Force where you know before you get to DC you have one vision for the world and have one set of values and then after you get to DC uh all of that changes like why is there a new Gary Gensler why does it have to be the case um is there just a corrupting force or like how do you explain this politics poisons everything it touches and when regulators act like politicians it has a distortionary effect on on on Industries like crypto you know there are politicians and Regulators who are intent are on portraying crypto as the villain in order to portray themselves as Heroes as saviors and so for me it's ultimately driven not by principle but by politics that's how I view the behavior of these actors you know uniswap it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with

different things people mean when they say cdbc right and recently there's been more political clamor about certain um certain politicians rejecting the idea of a cbdc um you know um DeSantis in Florida has even worked on some legislation to have it banned in Florida what what's your take from your community and from kind of the value set that you just purported what's your take on a central bank digital currency is that a good thing for the United States um does it require safeguards are you supportive of it or do not like the idea of a central bank digital currency well to be honest with you I I have no strong opinions about a cbdc I would have questions so first I do believe that the Federal Reserve does not have the authority to create a cbdc without the express approval of Congress I feel like that's such a consequential policy that Congress ought to weigh in on the matter so so that's where I agree with some of the criticisms um but the question I would ask is what function would a cbdc perform that could not be performed presently by a stable coin right if it's simply mimicking the function of a stable coin then I would question the necessity of it the utility of it but if there's a value add then I would have an open mind about it so it depends on what the arguments are made with respect to cbdc but I certainly believe that if there were to be a cbdc it would have to perform a function that's not presently performed by a stablecoin and they would need to be clear Congressional authorization you know one of the common misconceptions about crypto is that cryptocurrency would pose an existential threat to the status of the dollars the world to serve currency but we've actually seen the exact opposite you know the fact that most stable coin issuers have chosen to Peg their dollars Peg their stable coins to the dollar reinforces rather than challenges the supremacy of the US dollar and so crypto blockchain stable coins have enabled the United States to out-compete countries like China in the realm of digital currencies even without a cbdc one thing I think the the crypto Community is worried about and I would say the the larger community that that cares about digital privacy and uh civil liberties in the US is worried about a some version of a central bank digital uh currency that is completely surveilled that does not uh take privacy into account um lately you know crypto itself has come under Fire and uh recently I'm not sure if uh you've been following this but there has been a series of smart contracts on ethereum tornado cash privacy mixer basic privacy technology on ethereum that's been ofax sanctioned and so the worry in the crypto community and the digital privacy community at large is if there is some version of a central bank digital currency that that moves forward right and it does make sense that it will have it will be government surveillance attached and American citizens will lose their right to privacy the same rights privacy they had with physical cash if I give you cash a 20 Bill representative Torres there is no um tech company there is no agency in the US government that is tracking that transaction we're worried we lose that with the move to digital privacy to a central bank digital currency or some sort of a government uh mandated cbdc can you weigh in on that how how important is this fight for uh privacy in your eyes uh it's it's it's so consequent for us to be existential for our democracy I mean you know a totalitarian regime like the Chinese Communist Party is intent on creating a cbdc so that it can monitor the transaction of every Chinese citizen and have the authority to unilaterally exclude disfavored citizens from the financial system so that's the kind of authority that should never exist in the United States that if we were to ever create a cbdc there has to be strong safeguards for privacy and civil liberties and those should be non-negotiables um and then even if we were to have a cbdc the uses should be limited you know I could imagine one circumstance in which it could be useful so if if the economy were on the verge of collapsing and we were on the verge of facing a great depression and certainly something like a cbdc could enable an instantaneous injection of stimulus that could lift up the economy but again outside that context I feel stable coins are performing the same function and probably could perform it more jointly do you see the uh crypto becoming an increasing uh political issue uh when we get to something like the the 2024 elections or maybe crypto and cdbc these types of issues will they rise to the level of national conversation well there are certainly more elected officials who are villainizing the crypto industry and scapegoating crypto as if it were the root of all evil in society you know I I said earlier that Congress has an anti-crypto derangement syndrome and it's pervading our politics but you know I I see a disconnect because within the crypto community I see a Groundswell of enthusiasm and engagement but there has been a failure to translate that Grassroots enthusiasm for crypto into an effective operation in Washington DC and at some level it's understandable you know people see Politics as something to be avoided you know people are so cynical and so disillusioned that they would rather keep politics at arm's length but there's no escaping the power of the politics wields on your life and if you if you disengage um you might react when it's too late and and that's why there's such antagonism toward the crypto industry because the store the crypto Community has not told its story in Washington in DC it's had its story told for for the community by others how would you advise us on that how can we as the crypto Community uh step up and do better to to educate and to tell our story well there's there among some members there's a prejudice against crypto and Prejudice means judging before knowing and so if there's no knowledge of crypto if there's no first-hand engagement with crypto entrepreneurs then you become a boogie man who can be easily villainized and scapegoated and so I would encourage crypto entrepreneurs to meet with their members of Congress and explain the transformative power of the technology in their lives like make what is presently abstract more real to those members of Congress there's no substitute from hearing directly from the people who vote you into office and and I know people find politics nauseating and something to be avoided at all cost but the the future of crypto depends on political and Civic engagement so engagement engaging representatives and not simply leaving it to lobbyist but but the entrepreneurs themselves the innovators themselves should meet with their members of Congress and make the case for crypto and and that's more powerful than you think for me there's nothing more powerful than hearing directly from the people I represent in the Bronx one uh item that is adjacent to crypto but somehow also affecting it are the recent uh bank failures and so we've seen a few bank failures in March and one as recently as as last week with the First Republic Bank what's going on here uh do you have any takes it's it's straightforward there's there's there's a classic series of Bank runs um you know it's largely a story of interest rate management failure um when interest rates rise long-term assets become less valuable but deposits become more valuable and so if you have a stable deposit base the gains from your deposit should offset the losses from your long-term assets but if you have an unstable deposit base then there's no structural offset and and that's precisely that that explains the failure of Silicon Valley Bank 90 percent of the deposits at Silicon Valley Bank were uninsured and the largely uninsured unstable deposit base of Silicon Valley Bank left it wide open to a bank run particularly in the age of social media you know the the speed of the Silicon Valley bank failure was historically unprecedented in 2008 Washington Mutual which was the largest bank failure in history saw the loss of about 16 billion in the span of 10 days by contrast Silicon Valley Bank saw the loss of 42 billion in the span of a few hours so social media has enabled Financial Panic to spread on a scale and at a speed that we've never seen before and banking Regulators have to think about the role of social media in financial panics representative Torres we've talked a lot about uh crypto we just talked um about the the bank failures and and some of your takes on that um I we're engaging in crypto with uh you're right an audience that skews younger uh certainly and I think that's what where this community kind of um has arisen from and I I speak to a lot of younger people who are basically Jaded by politics um there's almost this nihilism this this lack of Hope and um you know crypto has been advertised as like oh it's a way to escape from the system and my encouragement has been for young people to uh to engage in the political process as as you have encouraged us here today um but I think in order to engage they have to have some hope that uh they will be heard that things can change as we close out this uh this episode can you provide us some hope for the future like what is going well about America right now where can we end up up at the end of this decade give us a reason to engage in in the political process give some hope here look we're living in a Time where the individual has never had a greater impact on society where the potential for social impact has never been greater I mean we're living at a time where you're one hashtag away from sparking a social movement a hashtag I can't breathe um the whole host of hashtags and we've seen in the past few years some of the largest demonstrations in American history from the woman's March to the March for our lives March for climate change March for Criminal Justice Reform and the Common Thread among all these Mass mobilizations is young people is that young people have a passion for social justice that has been a driver of social impact in our society and so I feel like if there were ever a time to bet on the Grassroots energy and the social impact of young people that time is down awesome we'll close with that representative Torres thank you so much for joining us thank you for your voice in DC for crypto we appreciate all that you're doing absolutely thank you for having me on bankless Nation gotta end with this risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice it wasn't even political advice at least I don't think so crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
