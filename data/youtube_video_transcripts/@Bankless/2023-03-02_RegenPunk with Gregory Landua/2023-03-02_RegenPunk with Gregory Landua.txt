foreign ation on the Pod today we have Gregory landuit who is co-founder of the region Network region network is a web 3 marketplace where you can buy trade and retire ecological credits um in a voluntary carbon market so Gregory's been an inspiration for me since writing the Greenfield book and starting the green pill podcast the second time we've had him on the podcast on the podcast today we're talking about what's new since the last time we had them on we are talking about regen Punk which is kind of a more earthy less high-tech uh variant of Imagining the future that we want to live in relative to solar Punk we talk about deep green pilling so basically a little bit more of an earthy uh refi type of green pill we talk about the eight forms of capital which is um something that Gregory was involved in creating the idea that we don't just have Financial Capital but we have spiritual capital and we have intellectual Capital we have cultural capital material Capital many different types of capital and what if we could use web 3 to regener not just our financial system but all of those different types of capital so um this episode in a fun meta way is regenerative of intellectual capital and at least for me spiritual Capital because Gregory is just such an inspiration has been working on this space and the things leading up to the regen Network for the last 10 years or so and he's just one of the thinkers that I I respect the most when it comes to building a regenerative crypto economic movement green pilling and now deep green pilling the web3 ecosystem creating more coordination so uh really enjoyed the episode with Gregory and I think that you will too enjoy coordination working in web3 is awesome but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work tax time is coming up opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity generate proof of employment through pay subs and receive a W-2 at the end of the tax year are you self-employed and forced to spend money on expensive Health Care insurance when

dot org slash green pill what's up Gregory how you doing I'm good Kevin I'm stoked to be here yeah so good to have you um I really enjoyed the episode that we did uh about a year ago when green pill is just getting started and wanted to invite you back to uh chat about a bunch of stuff so maybe we start by talking about regen punk what is that region Punk well you know that this is sort of a um I believe there's this emerging I guess art and Ethos culture that isn't quite uh fully um encapsulated or described by solar Punk but is sort of adjacent or a sub-tribe or um you know but but has some clear differences I think and um maybe it's a little bit more Cottage core than it is uh you know like utopian techno future or something like that and maybe it's got a little bit different set of kind of like maybe it's a little bit deeper green you know than than brilliant neon green you know maybe it's a little bit um and maybe it's a little bit more focused on the relationship between humans and the greater than human world you know agriculture land use it's just a little bit more and I think it is kind of a sub-tribe within the the larger it's probably a little bit less beyond meat and a little bit more holistic grazing you know so let's let's let's uh play back a couple of these things just for the audience solar Punk is about sustainability and sort of nature integrated with technology but in this like high utopiaist world where there isn't a lot of people um and and region Punk is more of a deeper green than that it's more about land use salt of the earth less beyond meat and more uh like eating uh I actually don't remember what you said there but uh uh and then like what's Cottage core so uh can you take us can you take us is like a an internet um aesthetic where people post you know photos of cool little log cabins in the woods or like Mossy Hobbit houses and stuff like that so this like deep forest imagery um does that come from actually using web3 in order to create material Capital uh basically using web3 in order to regenerate the Earth is is like what is the intellectual uh sort of analog to this vision of being in the deep forest you think that it informs that aesthetic it's a good question I mean I think um yes I mean I think in Regent Punk there is maybe just a little bit more techno skepticism than techno-utopianism but very clearly there is kind of the DIY like we own and operate our own digital networks and computer-aided governance and you know and in our embedding Market mechanisms and funding public because I think that's all really as you're saying like that is the pathway to get there and I believe it and is kind of intrinsic um I was recently talking with Daniel schrocktenberger who many of your guests probably familiar with you did a couple of great episodes with Daniel and um shout out Daniel and I have a podcast on the planetary regeneration podcast coming out pretty soon and one of the things that he said that really resonated with me which I would identify kind of you know in a way both with solar Punk and region Punk is the Embrace and acceptance of high technology but um the emphasis on high ecology right where this isn't sort of like a Luddite Revolution necessarily um it is really like hey we need to roll up our sleeves we need to learn to be owner operators of these new this sort of digital enablement of humans to coordinate um but maybe we're also going to try to do that in in as minimalist as way as possible you know maybe we're going to also understand the potential for you know addictive behaviors and Degen behaviors to sync all of that so we're not going to love it just for its own sake yeah well you know I think that's interesting what you said about being Tech skeptical and more local like I feel like if solar Punk is high utopian High-Tech high globalist then regen Punk feels like it's more about putting control and sovereignty back into local communities and that leads to the more Minimus minimalist way of of life and the high ecology way of life um it and for me you know understanding the um it feels like there's almost an analog here with like the ethereum architecture which started off as this giant layer one is now decentralizing into all these layer twos to what Cosmos has with IBC where it's kind of like every Sovereign uh Cosmos chain to itself like there's almost more like of an emphasis on localism and Cosmos and I see that mirrored in regen Punk whereas in ethereum I see like a little bit more of a solar Punk aesthetic not not that I would say most ethereums are globalists there's the Nuance there but um do you see the an analog there with the cosmos architecture informing the philosophy 100 percent 100 I would definitely I think Cosmos architecturally and from an ethos perspective is very regen Punky and and yes it is that localism as a as one of the core sort of design principles sort of this this idea of bringing sovereignty as as close to you know the local interactions and relationships as is possible um and then allowing people to assemble and Federate into larger conglomerations and coordination systems you know in our case in Cosmos via IBC via shared security but you always want the tools so that you don't force people into the tyranny of network effect into large monolithic globalized systems because that's where we start to lose diversity and nuance and uh Beauty and the kind of inspiration all of those things get squashed when you get into these big monolithic you know modernist globalist schemes yeah so it's like you know how do we create the sovereignty of local values and of local Goods whereas in the globalist economy thing everything becomes like Bud Lights in Super Bowl Bud Light and Super Bowl ads and and like cheeseburgers like Global commodified sort of goods when you're in the like the more High globalist type of economy I think that's a tendency right and and look you know I don't think we need to be sort of naive we don't need to naively dismiss you know globalism and the role that that may have played in having a somewhat stable peaceful last you know like 40 60 years of of the world but on the other hand we can also understand that look wow there are consequences of this sort of like globalized homogenized accelerated economy that you know um that came about for for for maybe people wanted progress and um affluence and all these good things but it has consequences so then we can ask how do we coordinate and maintain that kind of you know I mean I guess relative peace and prosperity but also ground that and root that in local sovereignty in local again regenerative relationships and how do we I'm very passionate about this question of how do we re-center the economic relationships between humans and the the greater than human world our biosphere are our the ecosystems we're part of in in our economy so that we're actually coordinating to be a a keystone species a force for regeneration so that as we practice agriculture we're deepening the soils we're making them more carbon rich as we practice forestry we're improving the Forest Health and that is completely possible I mean there's a huge uh body actually of scientific evidence that humans are capable of enhancing ecological Health while extracting value for our food and our building and our medicine like that's totally possible it's just how that exchange and that relationships takes place right that's regen Punk that's that's permaculture that's regenerative agriculture that's sort of that that's fear that mean Plex the quest to try to unfurl that and web3 is such a has such a powerful set of tools to explore that design space I think yeah totally well you know the reason why we do these episodes on the endless procession of Punk's solar Punk Terra Punk lunar Punk is because there's a loop between Imagining the world that we want to live in and then building it so the more that we can imagine it and articulate it as uh articulate those value systems the more the engineers and the creative people in the world can pull the hearts and minds of humanity towards it and so that's why we do those episodes these up these episodes about these different types of punk and one of the things I'm really excited to talk get really deep and weird with you on Gregory is that you know it says in the the green pill until podcast album art regenerative crypto economics um and and you know the the green pill podcast album art is like light green so I want you to take me like deep regen punk I want you to take me like deep forest green green pills and uh let's let's do some deep forest green green pilling here tell me about web 3 permaculture tell me about living in harmony with uh the people in the communities around you but also the nature around you like let's let's take some d uh dark green pills together awesome well so so first off just invite everyone you know to to take a quick tour of uh permaculture design ethics and principles so so permaculture um for for listeners who aren't familiar with it is a design Art and Science that was uh brought into the World by um uh Bill Mollison and David Holmgren to Aussies um who are heavily influenced by observing indigenous people interacting with their environments and directly observing nature and then kind of asking themselves what would it look like for us to create a sort of design science that encapsulates what we've learned in a set of in a set of simple ethics and then a set of principles to kind of guide how we're thinking about things there's kind of a whole Global movement of permaculture I used to be very deeply in the permaculture world and so I'm quite I guess influenced by that and how I think about things so just to out that lineage and give people an opportunity to like dig in and do your do your own research there's so many different great teachers and resources there um the three ethics uh are Earth care people care and fair share or care for the future Generations it's it's put that third ethic is is articulated by different people in different ways um and then there's a set of principles that we ask you know when we're does when we're trying to design something and you know if we're going deep green right as opposed to bright green we might be a little bit more likely to think about key design principles such as observe and interact like there's this idea in permaculture that before you make a design intervention in a landscape you should probably watch that landscape for at least a year right so there's this idea of going slow and really observing the system that you want to engage with now if I was to critique the sort of like bright green solar Punk High uh you know sort of like high utopian Vision in the web 3 space and and be like hey I want to invite you all to take a Deeper Shade of green pill it'd be like what what are the ways that we can be more deeply informed for instance around Dow governance around the experimentations that have preceded us to understand how human coordination works and doesn't work and really like base our design on those sorts of things how can we observe relationships between um different living systems in a watershed for instance outside our doors and and really base our design decisions and our technological decisions on those functional emergent phenomena of life um so that's that's one sort of piece of things another piece as you were mentioning earlier that I really think is important and you know deeply regen Punk and you really honed in on this is just the the we have to be considering I guess local sovereignty and um integration and self-regulation so so what does that mean right well to me that means in web 3 design that means really deeply exploring things like Sovereign application or Community specific blockchains that can choose to engage in shared security or roll up relationships or other pieces like that but where you're really aiming to build the capacity of of a community to maintain its own consensus about what it thinks is important because that enables Us in its deep green perspective to have a diversity of approaches instead of a singular monolithic approach so you can start so that diversity that mimics how we see rainforest work and how we see ecosystems work right different communities different actors need to adapt to specific circumstances so they need a maximum of flexibility around how they're designing it but they do still need sort of consensus and interoperability across those systems so again that's kind of an invitation maybe into the Deeper Shade of green pill yeah that's so interesting um so you're taking me there I'm digesting the Deep green pill and I want to get to the cosmos stuff in the design philosophy but first I want to just recap the permaculture uh because that's where we started on this journey so um I almost look at look at it as like permaculture is a way of accepting that there's a like a um a short-term debt cycle and a long-term debt cycle not only in our financial World um in in how we borrow money in the short term but how long-term debt accumulates and the whole system like resets forth turning style but I take that and I apply it to like the eight forms of capital which you're uh one of the primary authors behind there's there's not just Financial Capital there's Social Capital there's material Capital there's spiritual capital from how we treat each other and so when I think about permaculture it's about like managing the short term and the long-term debt cycle of our soil and of our spiritual relationships with each other through Earth care and people care and fair share and care for future Generations like there's a long-term debt cycle where if you don't care for the people in your community and um you're creating spiritual debt if you don't care for your soil then you're creating soil debt and you won't be able to grow anything anymore um and so I don't know in my mind uh permaculture just seems like a way of man managing those debt Cycles except with different types of capital am I on the right track at all yeah definitely I I think that that's the right track and and that that eight forms of capital framework really emerged out of the permaculture movement it gets used a lot in the permaculture movement it's sort of like a folk economics framework and uh you know at some point I can tell the story of how that framework emerged for for Ethan and I uh who who co-created it with me but yeah you know one thing one story I I just love to tell everyone because I feel like it can help us take it can help take us to the Deep green pill the the place where we're seeing it really living and thriving is you know in the web 3 space we're very uh we talk a lot about liquidity we talk a lot about liquidity yeah um so I'm gonna just invite everyone to imagine a landscape that is denuded of life that is just um just dirt yeah and imagine what happens when there's a giant liquidity event a torrential downpour a tropical storm a monsoon comes yeah and it just is just unloading this liquidity from the sky what happens to that landscape well I'm no uh uh uh I'm no expert on this but I'm imagining that a lot of the topsoil gets gets washed away by the liquidity the topsoil gets washed away big gullies form and all of it rushes super fast down to the biggest body of liquidity of them all the ocean and and it deposits all the sediment into the ocean the ocean then is polluted and has all of this sediment and it kills the species it it silts over any coral reefs and it just you know it clogs up all the mollusks it just creates Havoc right in the ocean it also creates Havoc Upstream um and then a day later after the Sun comes back out what happens the the landscape is dry and it's cracked and it has retained none of the moisture now now let's think about what happens when that same rainfall event falls on a vibrant Forest an agroforestry system that has swales and ponds and deep soil and a canopy and it's just fully vegetated right what happens and it just absorbs it and there could be hardly any runoff but then what happens is it recharges the groundwater and springs pop up and those Springs flow down into the ocean and so all the liquidity still goes to this big the biggest liquidity pool of them all the ocean it just takes way longer to get there it's slow and in that stream there are fish and they're crawfish and all sorts of things and in the ocean there's so much more life it hasn't been silted and so this to me this visual metaphor this is the invitation for how we need to think about our digital infrastructure our web 3 infrastructure and embedding liquidity and markets into the commons into living systems and taking that information and thinking as entrepreneurs as community members as Dow members how do we grow the forest because the liquidity comes right the liquidity comes but how do we manage it how do we absorb it and flow it slowly in such a ways to create abundance and and uh I think that's a really illustrative story for those of us who are passionate about public goods funding and Commons management common pool resources and who maybe self-identify as regions and have taken the green pill yeah well you know one of the stories that I've always been inspired by is I uh uh from the ethereum foundation the executive director of the ethereum foundation has a story about how web3 is like this infinite Garden where you have all these different fauna that are all overlapping with each other and in symbiosis but also sort of competition with each other for resources and and that web 3 is like this infinite Garden uh where all these all these this diversity of an ecosystem all sort of depends on each other and every organism is optimized to do one little thing different from every other little organism and it's through that that we swap up the liquidity in the sunlight in the in the ecosystem and I saw this beautiful metaphor for Bio biomimicry in our digital ecosystem and I think I guess the thing that points that that stands out to me here Gregory is that um in a pluralistic ecosystem that's very diverse it's not like you can really invest all your capital in making one of those organisms survive you really need to have the whole ecosystem uh in symbiosis and growing together so it's like rediscovering the Commons in the digital age by having to build this ecosystem me for my purchase super modular you for at regen network but everyone else who's funding public goods in their own uh ecosystem is building their own little special fertilizer and formula for regenerating the infinite Garden I just think it's a beautiful thing but I guess my question is like how do like how do we get humans to coordinate to actually build this Rich Commons uh like how do we get more people to see that we don't want to have that bear in Wasteland but we want to actually have more liquidity and put in the effort to make it make it happen that's that's kind of where my mind goes yeah well that's a great question I think you see people doing it I mean at regen Network the way that we're approaching it and so like disclaimer that I fully am an adherent of this sort of pluralistic infinite Garden idea I love that I think it's a great metaphor um but speaking concretely from my personal experience my answer to that question really is how how do we show the use of a state machine of of a community that's generating consensus computational consensus maintaining that computational consensus over time I think you know what's the most the highest leverage point to to engage that type of tech where where is in my mind is to try to generate computational consensus about ecological health and to be able to you know bring that ecological Health into uh social consensus around how to Value it and so this is my passion around living Capital specifically around the relationship between living capital and the other forms of capital the relationship between living capital and financial Capital how do we how do we build infrastructure that allows communities to express preference and desire and bring and actually sort of like generate profit from regeneration that to me is enormously exciting and I think you can kind of use the eight forms of capital framework to think about that about each of the other forms of capital as well I just happen to be super passionate about the living Capital relationship yeah I think at this point it's worth reminding listeners what regen network does uh I know that you've got a tool a toolkit that allows people to I think generate this consensus about the health of their Commons and would love to have you tell us about that real quick and so right now regen network is an application specific blockchain that also is connected via Bridges to the CRM World several EVMS other things going on we have our own uh validator set and it's built to be a registry and Marketplace for Eco credits and the the bulk of those Eco credits that are live in the system right now are carbon credits right which have an existing Marketplace and existing value they're sort of considered to be real world assets and we've developed a system and we're sort of we're sort of blockchainifying more and more of this system over time but we're also very pragmatic like you gotta you know hit things where they're at and build what you need to build in order for something to work so right now you know if you were to go to app.region.network you'd see a Marketplace that has these really cool carbon credits in which people communities are getting paid to sequester and store carbon they're very high quality they sort of follow the most vigorous science available and we're more and more building tools for this to become sort of a disinterm disintermediated and self-service Marketplace and process but that also takes time because people need to learn how to sort of represent these Eco credits and our rigorous and robust way so it's sort of a slow and steady progress to maintain maintain counterparty trust and really build out a vibrant Marketplace for these sorts of Eco credits for these living these these units of account for living capital so uh I'm wondering if you could tell us about how you solved the Oracle problem of the creation of a carbon Credit in one of these local communities like are there sensors that ingested into the blockchain and attestation that a carbon credit or sorry not get carbon credit but like an ecological credit um a superset of what carbon credits are uh like how do you solve the Oracle problem um what's a typical use case for these credits uh I'd love to just get like real Hands-On with the tech and the use case of regen Network because I think that's where the rubber meets the road on a lot of this stuff totally yeah so um it's funny I I don't use the term Oracle very often okay um so um we take more of a trust graph approach around ecological data claims and then the credit minting process so um at the moment how this works is we have sort of governance gated token issuance in which it's very clear who's issuing the token and what the agreement between counterparties of what that token needs to be in order to be issued and that includes like what data needs to be present what methodology needs to be followed and who maybe needs to audit it so we're sort of like at this first phase where we're sort of taking the Legacy approach to this where you have like legal contracts between counterparties and we're we're going through those processes we're representing those on chain and we're also automating certain pieces of it phase two we're building out this larger trust graph where it really starts we start to be able to automate some of the this we start to be able to engage with sensors with satellites and by the way there's already satellites and sensor and machine learning embedded into the credits that are being generated um sometimes that data gets anchored and signed as it relates to the credit and just more and more of that is moving closer and closer and and deep more deeply on chain essentially where there's larger metadata loads and automation processes around the specific claims but again um you know ecological the science of Earth observation isn't and and the blockchain toolkit we're sort of bringing those together at regen network but there's still you know there's still work to do to bring them fully together so if you go and find that um like a car a City forest credit on region Network or the carbon plus credits on region Network what you'll see e is a metadata load and a tokenization that is referring to also a set of legal contractual Frameworks between counterparties that again kind of follows Legacy carbon credit approaches but has been augmented and improved and made more transparent and so essentially the you know it's like a step-by-step incremental process to really build this more transformative trust graph in which we have um yeah an oracle Network a trust graph Network that is allowing us to then issue credits programmatically according to an algorithm that represents each ecological Health but we're not there yet that's going to take us more and more time or more time with our community continuing to build everything up wow that's incredible I just think that you know the the thing that I respect about regen Network so much is that all this regen Punk stuff and web3 permaculture um sort of philosophy that you have you're practicing it day to day and in building out technology and just iterating to make it happen and and y'all are such long-term thinkers on this I know because Gregory you and I have been in touch for years but I know that you're uh your your career working on this stuff goes goes back uh on the order of decades not months not years so um I think it's it's neat how you're connecting with the Tactical to the um to the philosophy there uh I'm curious if I did if there's anything I didn't ask that you want to tell us like where should we go Nest what's the coolest thing in the region Punk regen network uh community that you want to show off well uh awesome question I I love that thank you I mean one of the things one of the things that I'm most passionate about is one of the things that we need the most help with and one of the things that's like the the least finished and that is this vision of of of region Network being owned and operated by Landscapes by Nature by indigenous people by Farmers by scientists not just by you know web 3 speculators or VCS and so we have this amazing organization called region Foundation which unlike a lot of um you know a lot of Foundations in the space isn't like a Swiss Foundation that received you know a big chunk of money and it's stewarding it no it's a it's a it's a U.S 501c3 that is responsible as an organization for supporting and ensuring that these communities are really we're embedding the market mechanisms that we're building into the hands of these communities they have a big task they have you know it's digital literacy it's Dow tooling and onboarding for communities that are not automatically in the web 3 world in the web 3 family and um you know I'm really excited about that and that's one of the things that you know in a way I'm most passionate about but is hardest and is you know it's sort of like in this beautiful tension between success in the marketplace and having people you know buy a carbon credit and offset it which predominantly you know there are blockchains offsetting there are smart contracts offsetting there are corporations offsetting but the ultimate expression of this vision is really to ground the process into like a platform Cooperative ownership structure that is really owned and operated by you know the land stewards and the indigenous people by Amazonian tribes by rivers in New Zealand by the you know a plurality of what it means because that's how we're going to start to be able to express rights of Nature and sovereignty and living capital in a really clear way right that's where the market can actually serve life if if on the other hand and there's lots of experiment experiments in the refi space and I respect all of them but many of them aren't really rooting you know with this deep green pill many of them aren't really rooting things into ownership and governance of these communities which are ultimately producing the value through how they interact with living systems so um that's something that I don't I as often get to talk about and I'm not I don't sit on the region Foundation side you know as a Founder I influenced and and helped co-create that Vision but there's a very clear separation between the company that I'm CEO of which is region Network development public benefit Corp right and region Foundation which is this 501c3 and so I get to sort of be a fan and sometimes use my soapbox to talk about it and as a community member help co-create and connect but there's sort of this organization uh that is really LED right now by Austin Wade Smith who's brilliant and is going to be at East Denver as well and um yeah so just that's uh that's what sprung to mind when you asked that great question about what you know what what was sort of under the surface or missing that I'm really excited about yeah um you know uh I I saw as I was doing my research for this episode you you retweeted uh Speaker John Ash who has a take that says uh we need to establish protocols to make sense of the level of alignment between individuals and groups and you know what you said about that relationship between the global economy and this deep pool of liquidity that's sloshing around and the local communities and their need to maintain diversity and plurality and represent their local values it feels like the history of of those things has been one of like Global imperialism and domination from the global uh or of the local but if we can sort of reverse that cycle of domination such that we have Bottoms Up Community currencies and Sovereign communities that are thriving because of their plurality and diversity that feels like a huge leverage point for Humanity to establish that sense of alignment between the global Collective and our local communities um and so yeah I mean it's it's it's I it's definitely it feels like a high leverage High leverage point to me um I I guess you know how can the the green pill Community engage with your vision and help make this world a reality um what should we focus on well I mean obviously we love people to come check out regen become community members engage with us um you know if you've got a vision for an Eco credit um awesome come Jam we have this community of scientists and project developers um a disclaimer you know region network isn't really a developer focused Community we don't have like arbitrary smart contract endless like Choose Your Own Adventure permissionlessness like ethereum does which is awesome and we love um however via IBC If you're sort of like a Dev a a solidity Dev and you have cool refi uh aspirations you could be potentially deploying on evmos and interacting directly with regen and sort of like doing Dow governance and tooling and all sorts of fun stuff but regen we sort of have a more lean strict things have to go through governance to get on chain slower you know more more methodical so just to like set that expectation for people don't expect that it's like cool there's like a you know a Dev rails engineer but if you're a farmer if you're a scientist um wow do we have an amazing community of people who are working to build this blockchain just for you so come and engage um and if you're a developer I mean obviously we'd love that I just want to set expectations about how the development process tends to work in our world um which is a little slower government-gated governance gated rather and sort of like really focused on the core use case because we don't want to compete with everybody we want to create this Ledger of record for ecological State and a well-governed Marketplace for Eco credits that's what we're doing so um let's see so Discord um probably pop it into show notes I always love to engage with people on Twitter as well um and for those of you who are interested we've been doing this experiment with uh with a GP T3 sub model called series which working with speaker John Ash we've created trained on regen Network's technical papers and white papers and blogs and then in a dynamic process with myself and some other sort of like founding members so you can actually go interact with our first attempt to create the voice of regen the voice of regen Network and we're going to be working to create other sub voices and actually start to experiment with Dow governance where these are sort of automated protocol politicians for sub-dos that are helping govern specific elements that may say may sound kind of far-fetched or maybe it doesn't because things are moving so fast but what's cool is it's already underway so series exists she's out there you can communicate with her and our Discord will probably be trying to get her up onto Twitter before too long and um I know at some point you should have uh John Ash up on your podcast because his um vision of cognizism and the iris sort of being able to use these tools to allow allow communities to train and express their voices as individuals or as smaller communities I think is a really core and important part of how you know in addition to sort of the web 3 computer-aided governance this Dao Vision but having this the ability to train a voice that can amplify and articulate things efficiently and clearly for communities and to be able to govern and upgrade that and calibrate it as you need to is really exciting and transformational so shout out to him and um definitely really inspiring work yeah well it feels like there's a lot of interesting stuff going on here uh I've got Speaker John Ash in the podcast queue I think for the next month or so and then we're gonna do another episode together where we go deep on Cosmos and regen Network's position in the cosmos ecosystem and uh I think that
