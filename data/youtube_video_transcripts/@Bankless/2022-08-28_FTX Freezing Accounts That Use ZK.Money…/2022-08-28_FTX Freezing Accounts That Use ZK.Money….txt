big problem flashing red light ftx actually froze a user account who sent coins to aztecs zk money aztec of course was not on any of sanctions list now here's a crypto exchange saying our users can no longer withdraw to aztec what do you think about this david if we're gonna be in crypto can we live by crypto values which is like a minimum viable censorship that doesn't make operators of ftx and others go to jail you can just go and use aztec right now you're not violating any laws you are free to do so i'm not a lawyer but i'm pretty sure that's true the fact that we are banning people that are using aztec before just because it is privacy services is like against the ethos of crypto we didn't need to do this this is bad
