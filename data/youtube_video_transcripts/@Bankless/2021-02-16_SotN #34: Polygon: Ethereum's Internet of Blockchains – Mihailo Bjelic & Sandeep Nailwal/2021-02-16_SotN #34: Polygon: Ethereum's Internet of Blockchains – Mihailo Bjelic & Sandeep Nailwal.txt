all right everyone welcome to another bankless episode of state of the nation we are super excited to bring i think a very timely set of guests on today talking about polygon which is ethereum's internet of change this is a layer two solution we've got the co-founders of the polygon project on to discuss that i think that is really the big news this week with gas fees as high as they are david but how are you doing and uh tease this episode a little bit for us here yeah i'm doing just fantastic just another week in the crypto uh just blazing news of an industry uh and so you know the the the uh the mata team and and polygon has been uh i would say a little bit under the radar or at least under my radar you know heads down building uh and now they are exploding onto the scene um and so that we're bringing the co-founders on to talk about the specific implementation details of this specific flavor of l2 i think uh going into 2021 and definitely in the second half of 2020 it was all about people picking out their favorite flavors of l2 and matic now now known as polygon is another flavor of l2 that we that i think deserves people's attention and so we are going to investigate what that flavor is in this state of the nation yeah and i think what's cool about this project polygon it's more than just a flavor it's like a whole ice cream shop with all the flavors because they're executing on all of them but anyway we will get to that of course this is state of the nation comes out every tuesday we try to bring up a really relevant topic and discuss it in depth we release it on youtube if you're watching live how's it going uh and we also release it on the podcast as well david before we get to polygon let's talk about some things that are new in the bankless nation um you had a fantastic conversation with hugh carp who is the founder of the the nexus mutual project insurance protocol for d5 we've had hugh on the podcast previously but what was that conversation when's it coming out and why is it important for folks to tune in yeah an unfortunate part of uh defy history now hugh carp is the founder of nexus mutual and he was the uh the owner of a bunch of nxm tokens as the founder would be this is normal uh and uh and so he was playing with defy i think he was redeeming some farming rewards or something of this nature and he pressed approve on his ledger to send a transaction and turns out the transaction that he approved on his ledger was not actually the transaction that he meant to approve and what happened was that a a hacker was able to inject a rogue file into his computer that hot swapped metamask with a forked version of metamask that injected a bad transaction into his ledger which and i i make out every single day at least a couple transactions on my ledger and i never like view the little like little like display that's going to tell me what to do and so you know i don't think anyone really does um and so you know hugh pressed send to claim his farming rewards or whatever but what actually happened was that this hacker had geared up this uh transaction to send all of his nxm tokens to the hacker's address which then the hacker then just you know cleaned up through like run btc tornado cache and then exited and so it's an ongoing investigation but we brought hugh on to talk about the vulnerabilities that he was exposed to and how he got how he got attacked by this hacker and so if you are worried about uh how this may have happened and you want to protect yourself we have an article coming out on the bankless newsletter and this video is coming out tomorrow on the bankless youtube uh the attack on hugh carp postmortem uh thanks hugh for coming out and and sharing those all this information and i think d5 it's an unfortunate reality it's an unfortunate part of this crypto industry that these are the things the the things just work this way and uh you know tip of the hat to hugh for sharing how he got attacked to make sure that none of us fall to that same fate yeah if you are a d5 power user super user you've got to tune into this when i heard about hughes hack i think it happened in december uh he lost eight million dollars this way uh so it's a massive you know attack and it's scary that this came through metamask so if you're a d5 power user super user make sure you tune into this and glean some some of those lessons from hugh's experience that's why he's making it public to help the d5 community so take a look at the article and check out the uh the youtube video that comes out tomorrow uh by the way david we should mention that we we are teaming up with lattice wallet as well over the next uh two weeks because we're really excited they've got some new lattice wallets in stock so think of david's showing his right here okay so see that screw this is like a legend it's like a hardware wallet big screen but it has a big screen and what's nice about the big screen is that you can see all of the transaction details on that screen and it's it's much more human readable so uh we're teaming up with lattice they wanted to give bankless readers bankless watchers first dibs on some new stock that they have on lattices so we'll include a link to the lattice and we're going to be publishing some more about the lattice kind of a hands-on experience from from david and i um here shortly but that is a tool for d5 power users to prevent the hue hack um actually reading your transaction details before you click send so stay tuned for that we've got liquidy on meet the nation david i don't know if we have time to tease that and then we also had the dollar milkshake theory with with brent johnson a podcast that came out on monday um so so take a look at that but maybe just give us uh give us a quick high level of your conversation with liquidity what is that project and when is that going to be posted on bankless youtube yeah that's going to come out this week on the bank list youtube liquidy is a governance minimized stablecoin it's a similar protocol to maker dow but with less governance features and it's also much more much similar to rye which is also a governance minimized stable coin project but rye importantly is not making a dollar peg stable coin they're making their own peg yet um maker dow is making a govern a a dollar stable coin uh in dai but it's not governance minimized it's pretty heavy on the governance so liquidy is kind of trying to be this middle ground between maker dao and rai where they're pegging it to the dollar but they're having governance minimization uh and so that our that video is coming out on the bankless youtube this week yeah what's so cool we say this all the time is uh we're gonna see all the things attempted in d5 all of the experiments will be attempted here and this is just another one that's kind of a hybrid of the two models here so super cool all right david uh before we get into talking with polygon i've got to ask you the question i always ask on the state of the nations what is the state of the nation today sir yeah the state of the nation is expanding we are expanding our territory expanding our real estate the whole conversation about l2s is to create like new virtual real estate that isn't so crowded right uh ever since uh haseeb qureshi came on the podcast and he gave out that metaphor of how like defy is manhattan or the ethereum l1 is manhattan i've really been a fan of this like a real estate or just like physical landscape metaphor um i made my first uh loopering wallet this week and so i now have a plot of land on the loop ring l2 and so that's my new plot of land there's not as many inhabitants there and so gas gas fees are really really inexpensive and really really uh instant uh and so people are tr are flowing out of like uh you know manhattan trying to find new areas of land to settle on and one of those areas of land is polygon which we're bringing on to the bankless state of the nation this week and so the state of the nation is expanding we are expanding the fold we are moving outside of manhattan and settling in the suburbs a little bit uh yeah i i think that's a great articulation of what's going on right now so uh david before we get into this conversation with the polygon folks let's take a minute to tell the bankless visitors about our fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible if you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with d5 tokens and products you need to download the

project matic and mihalo who is the co-founder of a project aiming to create the polka dot of ethereum well these two have fused their brains together in their teams together to create polygon formerly called matic which is ethereum's internet of chains a quick disclaimer before we get in i'm actually an advisor on this project because i think uh so much of it so uh keep that in mind as well it's not the reason we had them on we have them on because this is a fantastic project that you need to know about i'm not an advisor so i get to be the bad guy it's not um so let let's start here if we could guys um this narrative if you go to the polygon website and you sort of see the description of what polygon is it says ethereum's internet of blockchains i want to get to the ethereum part in a little bit but first can we talk about this idea of an internet of blockchains what is an internet of blockchains and why is that something that people should be paying attention to and is that the future yeah uh first of all thanks thanks ryan and david for inviting us even though david you're not an advisor and it's amazing that you actually still invited us really here yeah um thanks for the the question ryan uh i guess ethereum blockchains is a concept that uh appeared a couple of years ago and it's um it's a it's a i would say a belief or or a bet that in when this whole crypto ecosystem matures uh there cannot be one chain to rule them all as as some like to say and the reality will necessarily be a multi-chain reality uh as i said once the ecosystem matures and i would say there are two prime primary reasons for that one is that blockchains are hard to scale as we i guess all know by this point they are very sophisticated machines built with security and resilience and this decentralization in mind but they are hard to scale as i said so uh um as we are as more and more people are joining the bankless nation and uh there's more users basically competing for the limited throughput it becomes i would say relatively obvious that the future will have to be multichain the second major reason i would say is that um so far both i would say sandeep and i through various roles he worked with probably definitely 100 plus blockchain projects and if there's something that we realized is that different projects have different requirements basically when it comes to uh technology and the features their their projects and their community require sometimes some of them are more focused on security some of them are more focused on privacy etc so that being said um any single blockchain if we assume the existence of uh that single blockchain that rules them all uh you cannot tune those parameters basically to to cater to those uh specific requirements so that's i guess i would say that's probably the second major agreement that uh um explains why the future as we believe would have to be a multichain future okay um if we agree on that that there is sorry sorry ryan if there is a multitude of blockchains it becomes uh relatively obvious that we definitely should connect them we don't want it to exist as isolated islands and that's where the whole now we i just have the whole picture i mean the internet of blockchain is a concept of multi-chain uh reality where chains are connected uh among each other and can communicate and exchange messages and collaborate if you want so so definitely the polygon thesis is believes that there is going to be some internet of blockchains but polygon wasn't isn't the first project to say that there have been some other projects that have been saying this for a while maybe we could touch on them so i remember in 2017 uh a project called cosmos is talking about the internet of blockchains so that's one approach and uh another has been the polka dot network which is uh talking very much about uh an internet of blockchains maybe sandeep could you build on what mahalo was saying about the internet of blockchains and talk about these uh these two attempts cosmos and also polka dot and how they're kind of similar or distinct from what polygon is building yeah sure so uh i think one of the biggest thing that we know we also keep discussing among amongst ourselves is that both of these attempts like first thing is very clear that 99 of i would say like i don't have exact number but 95 to 90 99 percent of all the blockchain developers ethereum developers right first like you know uh principally like slightly wrong step we believe or you know at least from our opinion is that these uh you know ecosystems don't like try to create a separate uh you know environment than ethereum right so they don't kind of utilize those network effects ethereum already has secondly uh you know the one more important part is both of the platforms are uh you know sort of opinionated in the in their in their sense right so like they have a particular kind of solutions that they are looking to build right like uh you know like an opinionated approach like for example in cosmos you have like each of the separate or the chains actually uh they have their own you know security and then they connect to the cosmos hub and then you know the problem is that you know if let's say one chain is communicating to some other chain how do they how do they trust the you know the things that are coming from the other chain similarly with polka dot uh you know polka dot is trying to build a shared security thing right so you know you will have a like a central chain which will have some validators and they will kind of uh you know validate on para chains which would be like shared security chains again like that is also one flavor of uh you know kind of application so you know what when we teamed up like you know one of the biggest parts of our synergies was that we uh you know after talking to so many developers uh is like you know like the eventual solution that will end up winning the overall like the scalability or or winning the infrastructure side of thing would be something that is unopinionated that means like that caters to the requirements of the developers uh you know as for their their projects right so those those two are i i would say are the are the most important things in my mind that how we differentiate from that and like first i already mentioned that you know being being closer to ethereum and then you know building on top of ethereum and providing the scalability to like you know the the projects which are already there on ethereum by providing evm compatible chains and then you know connecting them via via ethereum and one important thesis we also have is that you know eventually whatever happens ethereum is going to be the ultimate settlement layer and the business activities will move to these various flavors of of you know uh you know like the execution environments be it like you know standalone chains be it shared security chains or l2 chains which derive their security from ethereum so that would be like you know so that's that's the main idea around it sandeep why do you think that why do you think ethereum will be the settlement layer for this entire internet of change yeah so i think like the uh the ethereum's primary uh you know this thing like a decentralized and secure programmable money uh you know part is is the it has been proven over the years and then the like overall the developer ecosystem there are multiple things like we can go on and on about it but then you know like like we were just talking about the the kind of hacks that you know d5 environment is in is already having now right so and then you know previously apart from d5 also ethereum has seen so many like maybe like a billion dollar worth of attacks right and then ethereum has reached this stage which is a level of maturity where we can see like you know billions of dollars of defy and you know we are seeing all the like you know the traditional finance sector talking about it and all that so that level of maturity and the network effect it takes like time and and there is no shortcut to that like that's organic uh you know movement that ethereum has has has you know evolved in the last uh you know like six seven years right so for any other blockchain platform to reach that uh you know organically it is going to take time there is no shortcut no matter how big money you have raised no matter how many billions you have raised and you know like how much uh you know how you you are you're trying to build your developer community uh those tooling uh though you know your wallets uh your your security paradigms for your smart contracts and all that everything you know takes time so like ethereum is at a stage where it's very hard to you know take back or take those network effects out of ethereum um you know that's what that's what i feel that that's why we believe that you know this programmable money paradigm which has proven itself over the time with with a huge amount of decentralization and security uh i think that will that will control the you know central sort of uh network effects in order to become the uh or in order to remain the settlement layer and the business activity that can happen uh you know on the side chains or when sidechain means like you know other kind of execution environments ryan you're muted ah thank you so let me kind of summarize sandeep for for folks that are kind of new to this because i think and i've seen this on discord i've seen this on twitter um there's a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt going on about ethereum given high gas fees so um ethereum kind of quote-unquote killers are coming in and saying hey we've we've got more advanced technology we've got a chain that doesn't have these high gas fees d5 is going to migrate over to our chain um a chain like the binance smart contract chain comes to mind or a chain like uh like the polka dot network comes to mind all of these kind of ethereum killers and i i think what you're saying is the difference between sort of an ethereum killer or a competitor and what you're doing with with polygon is that that basically um your polygon is ethereum's internet of change because you're using ethereum tooling that works out of the box so like the ethereum virtual machine all of the wallets all of the infrastructure all of the smart contracts can just be ported over so you've got that which is kind of ethereum native if you will but but secondly um the the plan for for polygon or any layer two is also to use ethereum as a settlement layer and also to use ethereum's security uh so all of ethereum's economic security if you guys were building out sort of an optimistic roll up or a zk roll up or something the polygon chains would essentially be backed by ethereum's economic security if you're an eth killer competing as another layer one a cosmos for instance you have to bring your own security to the table you're not bootstrapping that on the uh the value of ether the token and its economic security if you're polka dot it's the same thing you're sort of so a layer two is something that uses ethereum as a settlement and it uses ethereum for for security and uses some of the ethereum tooling like the evm is that an accurate representation of the difference between a layer 2 and an eth killer yeah largely nicely and i think mihaelo can expand on that like you know multiple like uh one part like mihalo has you know very uh nicely articulated is the various degrees of you know connectivity to ethereum so there is there's like you know there's various kind of teeth rings so one is a like a very strongly coupled t3 into uh you know tethering into the ethereum layer which will be like a layer two uh you know trading like for example zika roll-ups optimistic roll-ups then you have another level layer of or kind of connectivity which is like let's say in the form of bridges right so and then there are multiple flavors to it so for example the polygon pos chains if you see the whole of like although many people think of it as a separate like a proof of stake uh you know side chain uh but then it actually the whole of pos logic actually stays inside of ethereum so all the validators actually have to register on ethereum they you know they make periodic checkpoints onto ethereum whatever is happening on the side chain they put a proof of even on and i'm talking about the you know polygon postmatic network pos chain you know they put the checkpoints on to the ethereum uh this thing and their rewards staking rewards are actually given out bases the checkpoints that they've given so like there is a there's a lot of like you know the the connectivity to ethereum is also a spectrum right so you have the extreme end of like you know let's say optimistic roll-ups which actually are putting the transaction call data as well as the state route also on the ethereum and then you know they have you have the you know the standalone chains on other side like which might be an enterprise chain but still again like you know just something like what we what everybody is trying to do with quorum and you know you know ethereum enterprise alliance the idea is that if the larger number of developers are building on evm solidity and all that the ethereum ecosystem overall you know is so yeah like you summarize it nicely yeah mihaela before i kind of add anything to that yeah maybe just a few few uh lines but i think sandy articulated really pretty well uh first of all i guess the most prominent internet of uh chains projects out there are cosmos in polkadot and maybe avalanche and i first of all would like to say that these are amazing projects with very very good teams and uh huge kudos for all the work they're doing and um that being said i think that um i would say the fundamental from our point of view fundamental mistake and when these projects were initiated or started is the decision to build a separate ecosystem or some people would like to say ethereum killers we believe our bet is and we are i would say pretty sure of that that that was a strategic mistake like uh and uh internet we strongly believe in threat of change the future but internet of thing done right if you will is in ethereum's interactive of of chains so that's the only thing that in our opinion makes sense because of everything that you mentioned networking effects the maturity of the text tech and and all the other things um and that's what we basically decided to do that i would say that is i would say the major difference between us and these other projects that we mentioned and that major difference actually when you when you go a little bit deeper and you start really thinking about it it might not sound like a big deal but then like once you start going deeper into the weeds it really really can i would say even blow your mind like in a sense that um uh how you get so many more options in terms of the architecture you get by default higher security because you have all of a sudden like all these projects uh um cosmos beat cosmos or whatever for example has the relay chain as the let's say settlement layer or their source of security it is still of course i'm really not saying trying to say anything bad and we won't um i would never say anything bad about those those projects but you have a chain that is still not better battle tested it is just basically starting to run and you are using it as a source of security for the whole ecosystem of chains and that can can can be tricky and can introduce some challenges here you have the most battle tested and the most secure programmable blockchain in the world as your settlement layer layer and source of security i mean it's like a very huge difference you we have to admit that the second thing is all the tech stack like when you're building an ecosystem from scratch ethereum was i would say some sort of perfect storm happened and sandeep said no matter how much money you have it is going to be in my opinion extremely hard to to replicate the success of ethereum and all that organic interest and uh like the whole digital nation that gathered and formed around ethereum it's like really really impressive um so yes i mean that's i think that's like a really a major difference and um once you start building such a such a multi-chain system with ethereum in mind like there are i guess two again major impacts one is uh or aspects one is strictly technological and i would say pretty obvious you get to inherit all the tooling all the i mean the for example evm is a global standard for programmable programmable blockchains and all the ancillary tools and whatnot uh and the it for any competitor it will take years to reach to that point very dear it is now and the second thing is i would say a little less obvious and it's kind of abstract or maybe sociological if you will is that um i think the community understands if something is built i think community understands and will understand that that polygon is built as an integral part of the ethereum ecosystem both technologically and uh from the point of of you i mean from the cultural point of view if you will i think community is very much able to recognize these things so these two aspects i believe are putting polygon in a very good i say position so here's my my takeaway so far um uh sorry one moment while i adjust the screen uh so so my takeaway is that uh there is this construct this construction that we can label as like an internet of blockchains and that can be a relatively neutral thing to build we can build it as a neutral piece of infrastructure that we can deploy it wherever you know cosmos has it deployed as its own kind of like internet inter chain polka dot has its uh has it deployed as this you know l1 ecosystem uh and then you guys have it deployed as is strictly an extension of uh the ethereum based protocol as an l2 but it's the same con is more or less the same construct depending on with maybe some tweaks and parameters suggested but what you guys are saying is that when you when you take this neutral construct that is possible to be built in any sort of context and then you put it inside of the ethereum context you get to draft on some of what makes ethereum so awesome one of these things being the value of ether and the native security of ethereum the blockchain and then also you could also draft on all the multitude of assets that are being issued on ethereum right and so any sort of erc20 token and i and correct me if i'm wrong but any erc 721 token can also be uh work with matic natively with with matic right and and i guess the whole point of cosmos and polka dot is to also be able to make an interchange world so in theory i should be able to take my assets to cosmos as well um but the difference there is that you know cosmos isn't as natively integrated with the security of ethereum and having that native integration in the same way that like loopering offers you the same assurances that the ethereum l1 offers you so does matic slash polygon polygon now now known as polygon and i think uh mihailo what you were just finishing up with up there is that committing to ethereum is not only committing to the technology but also to the values and ethos of the community right and so like the energy that is in um avagaches like all of that community can actually be carried over without loss into polygon right because we are committing to the ethos and to the ethics that we think that ethereum brings to the world the politics that we think ethereum brings to the world is matched by polygon so far that's my takeaway do you guys want to add on anything to that i think you phrased it very well i think that's a very good recap of everything that we said so far like as you said and again these are these two aspects uh as you said assets can be indeed transferred to cosmos or to polka dot in similar manner relatively similar mental manner at least on a high level but it just comes when from that if if your design decision from the get go is that i'm building a system that is integral part of the ethereum ecosystem and on the other side there is a another design decision that says i'm building a separate ecosystem and then i'm gonna build bridges too it has to reflect along the way it will reflect many times it's like uh you and i decide to do this show from the your apartment or we decide to do it from the get-go from different environments and then think of a ways to connect it it has to reflect uh in all sorts of phases along the way and the second part is as you said uh um we are uh completely adopting ethereum at us and and uh eatos and the culture and we are i think uh already very much active uh members of the ethereum community and supporters all these years and all that so yes i would say that's a great trick ryan you're muted david i want to go back to something you said right because um and and feel free anyone to kind of chime in here but so here's kind of the thesis and the thesis that we've been talking about is that uh if you are a base layer one chain like you're a bitcoin or an ethereum or even a polka dot um you have to be in the game to compete as a money your asset has to compete in the game for a monetary premium right so bitcoin obviously competes for a monetary premium more recently i think people are realizing that uh ether when it's used as collateral as a store of value when it's used inside of the economic parameters of the theorem is competing as a money um and this has been always my my problem with like a dot or an atom in cosmos is that they don't seem to be competing as money right like the the folks on the cosmos project will tell you explicitly no atoms are not money there's some sort of a token a capital asset but they're not money um the folks on polka dot with dots they're not quite as clear but the challenge with treating dots as a money is that there's on chain governance so essentially you have issuance that's ruled by coin vote and and by plutocracy and the reason i think it's important that layer ones compete for money is because um that's where their security comes from their economic security at the end of the day comes down to what's the value of the token so bitcoin's economic security and its double spend prevention is based on the value of bitcoin as an asset ether's economic security ethereums is based on the value of ether right so you have to be competing and playing in this money game and if the other layer one chains aren't completing competing as a monetary asset they don't have a credibly neutral plan to compete as as a money they can't possibly be the the chain that offers the highest security and at the end of the day it seems to me that d5 will all move to the settlement layer of the chain that offers that the highest security so i wanted to just throw that idea out there um you know to you guys because we've been talking about kind of network effects and sort of the evm and the tooling and that's all true too i also think that there is a network effect in in being a money uh that you can't easily be replicated by a and we've been calling them eat killers but like you know that that's just the term that the industry uses you know it's your point guys these are uh these are good projects these are good teams everybody has you know the the best uh intense i suppose but it it seems to me that unless they compete as a money they can't possibly be as economically secure as ethereum so i guess what i what i see in sort of the polygon approach is you don't have to bootstrap you know the polygon token as a money you could just you know use the economic security of ethereum and that's an advantage too because it's really hard to create a monetary asset that the world accepts as a money any comments on that from sandeep or mahalo i i think that's absolutely a great point and uh definitely positioning ethereum as as money has has been very valuable in terms of increasing the security of the whole ecosystem primarily tiering mainnet and then and indirectly the whole the whole ethereum ecosystem and that's something that uh i think everyone it should be an obvious thing to to to understand and admit and that being said of course for us um that's that synergy basically that between polygon and ethereum like once you build this integr integral part of the system uh our best interest very much reliability best interest and ethereum ether being strong or hard money and uh having uh i mean providing uh or enabling high security to us so so it's like a really nice incentive alignment between um in this case this particular case polygon and ethereum or any other basically ethereum ecosystem project and ethereum yeah just to just confirm it it either is money i just want to say it oh well you know can we talk a little bit about the uh the types of of change that polygon has so it's it's not just one solution right uh and actually i'm gonna share my screen here this is a quite a great way to look at it there are multiple types of to scroll up it's not just zk roll up it's not just a plasma proof of steak chain you guys are kind of like this list of different chains kind of encapsulates all of the different approaches maybe besides state channels or that sort of thing but all of the different uh internet of chain types approaches that are being attempted on ethereum today and you guys are are doing them all at once maybe could you go over each of these uh solutions and kind of talk about their advantages and disadvantages and how far you are in the in the process of actually bringing them to market sure so something do you want me to take this one out yeah so maybe i can start with the the first two if you if you see the uh current uh like the matic pos hybrid pos and plasma chain that actually is very interesting which is not very talked about is that on a single chain you have an option of two different uh kind of right so you can either choose a pure pos uh you know a solution for you and then you can actually choose uh you know like a like a pure or a plasma based solution also i mean the the benefits and you know the the pros and cons are like you know uh i mean a lot over there for example like with with uh you know like with simple pos uh you know the solutions which only want to rely on the uh you know security of the of the of the proof of stake layer they uh you know end up using that more like for example some sort of nfts and you know like uh you know like some some dow votings and all that where they don't need like that hard level of security like you know as i think i think that uh that analogy of having a manhattan versus a you know suburbs so you know the per per uh square you know mile number of policemen uh in a in a manhattan area would be much bigger than the you know like a suburb so i think that's that's a very nice analogy to do that so you know like so the kind of use cases which want that they can have that if if the projects like for example uh you know as far as we know like for example auger wants like more ethereum based on chain security like which is which comes with plasma using fraud proofs and things like that so then you know you can use you you can use that but that comes with its own kind of caveats where you know the development and you know like you need to put more developer protocol uh you know specific developer as into it and things like that so similarly you have other different different other solutions and you know maybe mihaelo can take uh from there uh and i think he has a very nice uh you know this thing of categorization of uh you know the larger piece of solutions into two different two main ones one one are the standalone chains and other ones the secure chains so yeah mellow like if you want to take over from there yeah sure thanks yes as sandeep said basically uh we like to categorize because the the ethereum scaling and infrastructure ecosystem is is very vibrant and there's a lot of flavor flavors and a lot of projects offering different solutions and and the the whole ecosystem is really amazing i would say what we what polygon introduces here is basically some sort of we are trying to introduce structure for the first time maybe for the first time in this in this uh fantastic and vibrant and organic ecosystem ethereum's ethereum is developing organically by default and that's a wonderful thing and and very powerful uh but organic things often lack structure so so um speaking of different projects we kind of realized that there's there is awareness about different scaling solutions but it's kind of hard to navigate that ecosystem and understand the trade-offs and deal with some implementation complexities i would say and polygon is i would say a community-driven effort to introduce some structure in that beautiful organic a bit chaotic scaling ecosystem to to introduce structure we can start first by defining let's say two major categories of of ethereum or polygon chains uh first one are these standalone chains i would say uh that's how we call them standalone chains are chains that do not necessarily uh um inherit security from ethereum they by default have their own validator set and they are in in simplest terms you can think of them as some sort of side chains or enterprise chains and uh it is i would like uh to say first of all i guess to understand if if some people are generally into international blockchains projects those chains would be something similar to cosmos zones i think it's fair to compare them with cosmos zones because cosmos zones also have their own validator sets and they are by default responsible for their own security um in ethereum we already have i would like to say a very high success with change like that for example if you google there's something on github called ethereum atlas it's like a list of uh ethereum compatible chains that are currently live and have assigned chain ids and there's already i think 60 plus chains over there plus there are i would say hundreds of enterprise implementations and all these chains are in that group standalone chains and they are live they are running they are like fulfilling their purpose and i think um they're to be honest i think they're not getting enough attention or at least as much as attention as they deserve we are the community tends to focus on layer two solutions uh strictly layer two solutions in narrow sense and we will get to them in a minute but i just wanted to say that i think these standalone chains are also providing a lot of value to the ethereum ecosystem and community and i think we are often forgetting that all these chains are still using ethereum in one way or another to generate their assets to their bridging uh to ethereum to transfer assets back and forth they are using ethereum for checkpoints for all sorts of of uh activities and their in my at least humble opinion uh significantly contributing to the ethereum network effect and the ecosystem overall and i think we're kind of doing them a bit of an injustice but uh because let's say we have hundreds of such chains in production today and layer two solutions we unfortunately still have maybe dozens alive but like a layer two strictly layered two solutions um get probably like 90 percent of the attention so that's just something i wanted to um briefly say so polygon uh uh and the polygon sdk that will be releasing soon supports by default building these standalone chains once you have a standalone chain as i said you can interact with ethereum in various ways use it for checkpointing transferring assets even staking like we do for our metic pos chain which is one example of such standalone chains etc so i would say it's like it's a really really important component of the ethereum multi-chain so that's the first group of chains the second group of chains are what we called secure chains these are the chains that derive security from ethereum and this would be a layer two solutions in the narrow sense like and there i really like your analogy ryan when you said that we are actually at like an ice cream shop or uh instead of providing any specific flavor we are actually like an ice cream shop where you uh developers or project founders can come and pick their basically pick the flavor that fits their requirements and needs the best um yeah that being said um we are kind of um we spend a lot of time also working and me personally and sandeep and the whole team spend a lot of time analyzing different layer two solutions uh working with specific projects to to help them find the optimal scaling solution and and one thing we realize is that there is no silver bullet for ethereum scaling there is no one-size-fits-all flavor that will at least be believed that and that's our web that will fit that will be an optimal solution for all the projects out there we believe that multiple scaling approaches will definitely coexist in the long term and that's how we decided basically to offer a multitude of solutions of any specific solution we we have like of course also enormous respect for all the teams out there like a huge shout out for teams like two teams like metrolabs uh optimism and all these things are doing fantastic work and we will be working with those teams hopefully closely in future and already working with many of them but they are by default also focused on one specific solution one specific implementation so once you're in that position also you cannot you have no other option but to um you're actually betting on that solution you're all in on that specific flavor we think it is not really a safe bet because as we know ethereum scaling ecosystem is still in developing the whole industry is basically developing these industries we must not forget 10 years old in total and ethereum and programmable blockchains are like five years old in total so this industry will still see a lot of changes innovation turbulence and all these things so that's why we decided to um and because of there is no one-size-fits-all solution these were the reasons that made us basically introduce something that the community already likes to call layer two aggregator like you have dex aggregators that came along and aggregated multiple taxes that's how uh poly one is basically aiming to aggregate or offer a multitude of layer two solutions to projects and themes out there so i hope that's about how that works and so on on polygon we just went through a couple examples of the change that we that we found like um you said uh shared security uh blockchains standalone blockchains and i think if people are familiar with uh cosmos uh terminology this would be application specific blockchains i think would be how they would have called it um but then we also have other polygon chains which are things like you know just a plasma chain zk roll-ups optimistic roll-ups things that we've seen in the rest of the ecosystem but my question is why well how is this different than just a normal optimistic roll-up chain and like how does consensus of the many polygon chains happen and where does that consensus happen when it when in relation to ethereum right so like are these blockchains polygon chains all talking to each other or like where is the canonical like convergence onto one kind of state of truth as to what is true about the polygon l2 and then how does that get communicated to ethereum because we have these all of these different flavors of blockchains how do they interoperate or like how does how does polygon come to know what is true about all these various different blockchains like where is that actually happening yes that's uh that's a fantastic question uh basically there is uh in polygon in the the multi-chain reality that we envision there is no such thing as global consistency like strong global consistency we kind of believe that it is pretty much not possible to to achieve on on a like a global scale like in let's say in traditional systems be it financial systems traditional financial systems or web 2 systems you'll always have some um either autonomous systems or some systems that are functioning dependently and can fail independently and uh by allowing that you are actually making the system more resilient that's what we believe so there is no such thing as a global consistency because um let's say i think polka is an example of a project that that strives to achieve global consistency and on the other side cosmos is a project that aims to uh um isolate security and avoids global consistency as as a goal and we believe this this cosmos approach the project cosmos took is is a better one um because it these global consistency approaches number one never can scale unlimitedly that's simply i would say not possible by design because you always have some sort set of validators that at the end of the day has to validate this proof so there's always an upper limit to how much you can scale and the second thing is that it's actually really hard to achieve right once you have multitude of chains all of them at the end of the day can produce some there can be malicious activities or even mistakes unintentional non-malicious mistakes that can cause invalid transactions let's say to appear in that specific chain and if you are strongly insisting on a global consistency global security of the system uh the question is what happens then and i i say it it has to happen uh sooner or later in in any such multi-chain system so yes that's the approach when it comes to security and we are we strongly believe that polygon really tries to be as unopinionated and as flexible as possible like every project every community that i'm polygon should decide for themselves what level of security suits them if this security is absolutely critical for them i would probably at this point at least advise using something like zk uh roll roll-ups or validium implementations if possible because they provide like high level of assurance and all the transactions of that implementation get validated on the ethereum directly some other chains for example like enterprises they really do not require that strong security of ethereum but they require many other things from the ethereum ecosystem so they might decide to pick something like a standalone chain and form their own enterprise network and interact with ethereum and as they all generally want to so so um the approach to securities i would say absolutely unopinionated and and uh flexible i would say yeah go ahead go ahead please i mean i mean just uh one like like if david your question is regarding like where is where everything converges right like and if your question was not regarding the security then like everything converges on ethereum that's the whole point right so like all the assets and everything like the inter you know communication let's say between two enterprise chains so we are already working with a with one particular enterprise implementation where let's say both chains are run by enterprises themselves but then they communicate with each other using a checkpoint like we have uh like you know a cryptographic proof on the on the ethereum engine so basically everything converges back to theater that's the whole point but yeah sorry absolutely absolutely no no no no thanks for that's a great point everything converges on ethereum like in ethereum means the nexus we envision ethereum as the one and only nexus of all this activity especially economic activity in this multi-chain uh reality okay guys we're gonna we're gonna pause first for some sponsors and when we get back we'd love to talk to you some more about some of the d5 projects using polygon today the the the full landscape of ethereum layer two and the projects out there and then hopefully we can get to the matic token and the token economics so guys stay tuned and uh let's we want to tell you about these sponsors first gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in d5 or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in eth so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com all right guys we are back with the polygon team mahalo and sandeep guys uh i want to talk about d5 projects that are using polygon today and what you guys are seeing with the growth so it seemed over defy summer uh gas fuse got really expensive and there was a frenzy oh we gotta get to layer two and then they cool down right but now we're back into this frenzy gas fees are high again it seems like there's uh you know an uptick a massive uptick in conversation about migrating maybe even starting uh d5 projects on layer twos can you talk about some of the projects that are using polygon today um i wanna maybe bring attention to uh two things that that i found were sort of interesting maybe reflect on that the first is this this tweet there's now 200 million dollars in total locked value on the polygon plasma chain and the pos bridge so on polygon 200 million in total locked value so where's all of that coming from and what projects are using polygon today yeah so uh you know a large part of it is actually and which is the good news is that uh you know it is stable coins uh so like one of the like in the d5 side of things like prediction markets like you know you know like i think the the the polygon peers chain is like really doing well over there with poly market uh you know like some of the bigger you know friction markets for example in the space poly market is on uh is on on you know the is on polygon then you have this uh sport x which is doing a canada based team very very doing very very well their sport x token is doing very well uh similarly like you know augur team has multiple times said that you know they are integrating their uh this parts uh you know uh ui and all that and then you have other ones like plot x and you know the upcoming upcoming one some of the upcoming months they are doing so uh you know the prediction markets things are going very things are going very well and due due to these prediction markets a lot of stable coin come to matic so uh like the the polygon uh you know psg so the previously like out of like when when the tbr used to hover around i think 50 to 60 million dollars like 40 to 50 40 to 50 million dollar was uh was in stable coin but now i think some of the because of quick swap so basically quick stop is a uni swap clone uh you know on on the on the on on polygon so that is also attracting a lot of liquidity and uh now i think you you have a free you have a few tokens like avigachi token is there then you have you know sport x token which are which are like available in pretty uh large numbers uh you know in terms of their usd amounts uh so so yeah those are there then you have a lot of other protocols like you know ez5 for example which is which is sort of a fork of compound but they want to do a lot of like micro lending kind of use cases because we still believe that for for the larger kind of like multi-billion dollar uh you know tbls and all that like i think ethereum is is still like ethereum is the best layer for that for those those veil like you know let's call it like will defy for a lack of a term right so for that like ethereum remains to be the the biggest this one but and you know like some of these maybe some of these protocols can have a like a micro versions of them on on the like on on this chain which is now like guarded by more than 100 100 million dollars of uh like steak like on the proof-of-stake of thing so uh like so easy five is basically into micro defy cases you know this thing so they are now uh innovating on top of it and trying to bring bring let's say under collateralized loans or payday loans for example like some of the cool features some of these projects are trying out then you have uh you know like synthetics kind of applications like like auro pocket is there which is issuing uh let's say gold and silver silver actual like you know back by custody so it's not purely d5 it's like c5 d5 but then they are issuing let's say silver and gold backed you know actual you know assets on on on the on the psn so similarly like you know there are multiple multiple these like b5 plus nft is also becoming pretty hot so avigorchi is is is one of them so sandeep all these projects right that you mentioned uh you know one you mentioned was was poly market which we're familiar with we've done a tactic on before it's a prediction market and i remember when we when we first started using uh poly market the first tactic bankless tactic we did on poly market was on main chain right um but now this is all on polygon today is that correct so if i am using poly market i can use my same metamask instance so same user experience i've had previously but it's going to be faster and no gas fees because or low gas fees because it's now on on polygon is that correct yes yes and you know you can actually say that no like you can say no gas fees because why because the applications actually pay those gas fees uh for you so it's like it's like kind of a web 2 model so you know if you want to attract the mass users you need to have that kind of model where you are like the gas fees is so low that you know you can maybe a decent application or a mid-tier application can actually have a hundred dollar worth of you know matic tokens uh and then you know they can pay the gas and so poly market itself that's just an example of a project where instead of like they started in manhattan but the rent was too high it got too expensive so they're just moving to the suburbs that's all they're doing just moving to the suburbs you get the same user experience and because their numbers are smaller than something like a uniswap so they're not doing billions in total locked value they might be doing millions today well that the economic security i don't know if they're using your proof of stake chain or what but let's say they are there they are okay so the the economic security offered by the polygon proof of state chain well that's good enough that's all you need in the suburbs when you're doing lower amounts of of total locked value and then i suppose the idea with polygon is if they needed more economic security later they could migrate essentially to a polygon you know layer two that's that's based on optimistic roll-ups or zk roll ups you know in the future uh so that's kind of what's going on here can we talk about this other post too so i saw this this was super interesting the question in my mind for polygon and all of these ethereum layer 2 solutions because polygon isn't the only one of course and i know our listeners know that there's all sorts of layer 2 projects in ethereum's internet of chains but avagachi went through this is a nft project they went through why they picked polygon and it was for these reasons one sufficient decentralization like you guys had enough decentralization for their needs and enough economic security evm compatibility right of the box they could just migrate things uh production readiness so the nice thing about polygon is it's ready like right now some growing network effect which we just talked about so this does seem to be a case where you know some suburbs might do better than others right like brooklyn might do better than the bronx for whatever reason um developer ecosystem and interoperability with other nft projects those are some of the reasons they mentioned a going with uh with polygon is this kind of common how do you attract d5 projects to your specific layer too like what are they looking for and how does polygon differentiate itself yeah so before i hand it over to sandeep uh sorry sorry sandy i just want to one small thing to to add or a small correction that the user experience is actually far better once you move from the ethereum mainnet to to to polygon it's far better and you're uh able to to allow your end users the i would say web 2 user experience which is like probably critically important like highly likely if you talk to ux engineers and then the experts everyone will tell you if you want to disrupt an app or a system or or an industry the disruptor has to offer at least the same level of user experience if not better at least the same and we now have still this reality of people having to learn about gas and acquire it and all these things that are like huge huge barriers to to entry and these things are pretty much gone once you uh in the case for example of avegarti or poly market once they moved to to to polygon yeah so sorry something printing it over too yeah so with d5 kind of projects like you know now that the the the stake on the network is like growing growing like you know like now i think it's like around 100 million plus uh proof of stake is guarding the the network and we have like 90 plus validators to give you a context like i think uh me hello correct me if i'm wrong but like you know cosmos has primarily 100 validators or something like that right so like i don't have an exact number but roughly like like that number right so you know imagine you have a you know ethereum side chain or layer 2 chain which is guarded by almost like equal number of validators that are you know like a very uh high profile uh you know layer one project like that is there so that you know that's why like uh avigorchi mentioned that sufficient decentralization is there uh and then you know the the stake is also pretty high so for uh you know some of these d5 use cases as you mentioned like for poly markets poly market now which are which are handling let's say 40 to 50 million dollars for now right so they are pretty happy uh having a having uh you know the the the assets over there and and also like you know they're all the all the user assets are not not being managed by one particular smart contract like only those amounts which are on bets they are actually in the smart contract so that also like kind of diversifies the the risk profile over there so uh so that's why like you know d5 projects are now getting more and more attractive attracted towards the uh towards polygon uh but you know like d5 plus nft because nft is like you know as you can already you know realize that you know 30 nft you need hundred dollars to mint on the main chain so like nft projects are you know they're in droves and droves and i think that uh avigachi you know even mentioned article even mentions that you know uh there is like a you know like or even open c uh is is looking to have a nft store uh you know on the this one because so many like high profile games like almost you know like out of if you pick like let's say 10 you know gaming and ft projects you will find that you know six seven eight of them would be on on on polygon so because of the you know obvious benefits that low cost uh you know uh transactions and and all that and even like i think for nfts even whenever like you know the other solutions like optimistic roll ups and more secure solutions will come in but they will definitely have more uh you know that their gas footprint will still be pretty high because optimistic roll-ups actually are putting all the transaction data on the ethereum main chain right so for the nft kind of use cases this level of security as well as the you know the to and fro bridging with ethereum works very well very well so that is attracting now nft plus d5 use cases which is kind of you know you you must already be seeing that a lot of projects are exploding in that yeah and that's going to be huge i think dave and i have talked about so much in the rollups and otherwise like like nfts are going to be a gateway for people to discover crypto uh you know they're gonna come because they saw a tweet from their favorite celebrity and they're a big fan of the community and they might just enter on a layer two rather than the way we all entered which was like we bought some ether we bought some bitcoin which is it's just gonna be a fan uh fascinating inroad another question about in general ethereum's layer twos because um polygon is not the only layer two of course there's optimistic roll up there's zk roll up starkware's doing some stuff uh dave and i are gonna be doing a lot more on layer two on bankless in in the coming months in fact we're talking to a panel um you know recording tomorrow with a panel of uh defy applications who are talking about selecting their layer two and the criteria and they used to select and that'll be on the podcast coming next monday guys but i i guess a question for you is it is it like a battle to the death kind of competitive landscape is are all of these ethereum projects really uh fighting each other like kind of is there a layer two wars going on or are the projects all friendly and working together to solve this as a community what's what's the feeling right now i i would say definitely not i would say that definitely there's a lot of room for or all these fantastic projects to to work and grow and uh gain traction and uh we will definitely act in the same manner and so far like i personally know founders of i guess many of those or most of these projects and we are already directly collaborating exchanging knowledge helping each other or even planning on some things that maybe we'll be able to share more in the future maybe even things like mergers and stuff like that so no i i would definitely say ethereum uh uh there's no such thing as ethereum scaling wars what you might see actually on twitter which is uh or elsewhere it's probably like healthy debate between researchers because each of these scaling solutions every scaling solution has traders like any any other technology in the world every technology has traders so when you see some sometimes some uh conversations uh around that it's just basically mainly researchers discussing the those trade-offs and and [Music] that's about it i would say so as as far as it goes for us and and i would say all the other projects there's no such thing as ethereum scaling wars there's like a lot of room for for for everyone especially for us like you know where we are looking to aggregate and provide a better you know developer experience for the for the users and you know kind of making it easier to navigate through this whole you know layer to space uh i think you know especially for us it's not like that so speaking about trade-offs um since polygon has you know optimistic roll-ups or zk roll-ups as a potential polygon chain what if somebody was thinking about doing a native optimistic roll-ups or doing optimistic roll-ups via polygon what are they giving up when they go to the polygon version of optimistic roll-ups what what is what's the cost of doing this it's it's not always it differs from case to case but for example with optimistic roll-ups we uh our optimistic roll-ups uh uh technology is not ready yet it will be ready in months to come uh we cannot i cannot share any more details at this point before we hopefully able to share uh very soon with the whole community but the thing is sometimes for some solutions we will have partnerships with specific uh specific project that is working on that specific type of scaling for example for example like partnership with starker just giving an example here with other solutions we have our own implementations the i guess the major difference would be that we are really trying to make it easy to use for other projects to to to implement their own uh rollups or validiums or zika implementation and the other difference is that it should be easy to switch as ryan nicely said you can start with one scaling solution one implementation and as the time goes and your project maybe matures and your community becomes stronger you might decide that you actually want to change the specific implementation and move from let's say from let's say zk you maybe even started with zk chain and then your community became strong and you are realizing that you can have your own standalone change that can actually even introduce some nice uh incentives for your community members and for your let's say projects native token and whatnot so all kinds of possibilities are possible so uh i think polygon can evolve can allow any project to evolve or to follow the evolution of every project from in terms of infrastructure and technology that we that we support we're like you're like we are there to support you with your infrastructure we will provide you good infrastructure so you can focus on what you do best is your project your application and and uh its adoption the last thing i'd love to overcome yeah it does and so the last thing i'd like to cover and you guys may not be willing or uh want to kind of weigh on on this too much but i think it's an interesting it's a super important point for uh bankless listeners to to sort of wrap their heads around because we're not only going west on the journey and actually using these protocols but we're also investing in them and i think it's it's kind of curious because uh what we what we see here on like the you know the token market cap top 10 list is a number of um alternative non-eth layer ones that are in the top ten list right so we've talked about this before so polka dot right now is valued at a fully diluted valuation of 28 billion dollars that's billion with a b we've got um binance chain which is uh 19 billion we've got cosmos somewhere here with their their atom token that's at 6 billion right now what's interesting i think is if you're evaluating uh things using sort of the the bankless lens which is there are you know asset super classes and you're either competing as a as a commodity or you're competing as a store of value or a capital asset or in ether's case all three of those things we would argue the question in my mind is what are these alternative layer ones competing as and if they're not competing as a money as a store of value and maybe they're competing partially as a commodity they're mostly competing as a capital asset so um what's interesting to me is to observe the relative market cap difference between like the polka dots and the binance chains of the world and the uh the the atoms cosmos of the world versus like the like loop ring for instance right um loop ring is a ethereum layer two it's 859 million in terms of market cap or even like polygon is you know 517 yeah half a billion so i i guess what i'm saying here is it seems to be the case that either these killers are like way overpriced in terms of of market cap or the the eth layer twos are way underpriced or it could be the case that these eath killers are basically these alternative layer ones are just sort of being assumed that they will accrue some monetary premium in the way that that ether does and being priced based on the value of ether so i think if you if you guys are thinking about like alpha leaks and opportunities um there's got to be some like mismatched pricing here and i'm not saying this will play out like now or this cycle even because you know uh who knows what retail will will buy as they're entering the market but i'm talking about like like long term and long term it seems to be the case that if you're a layer one you have to compete as a money otherwise you're just competing with the other layer twos and if that's the case why is polka dot 28 billion in market cap versus some of the ethereum twos layer twos which are in the you know still the hundreds of millions it doesn't make sense to me uh and it seems like they're you know one of us is going to be right i guess on on these bets i don't know maybe that maybe the polygon folks don't want to to weigh in on this because it's you know talking about like you know tokens and that sort of thing but david i'd at least like like to hear what's your take on this i mean how do you see things yeah i i would say that i think if you are a token on an l2 you are uh not bothering to compete as like a native trustless uh money right you are you are giving up that um that value accrual mechanism to the native l1 right you are you are not you're just not even bothering to fight that fight and instead you are trying to focus on what um what is the core competency of the l2 which is to be an extension of the l1 while also providing uncompromising levels of of security um and i think i think maybe the conversation could turn into uh the actual role of the mat of the matic and then i'm probably i'm assuming there's gonna be a rebranding in the future of thematic token in the polygon network and the role of polygon validators can you guys explain the relationship between validators and the token and ethereum yeah so uh basically like uh the the thematic token is essentially a proof of stake token uh which is used for uh used by the validators to kind of you know to stake uh and and you know and basically earn the rights to become or kind of validate the transactions and then transactions uh have the same you know gas model as ethereum so if you are a validator uh and you uh you know you have staked your token you have earned the right to validate those transactions you get to have the transaction fees plus you also get to you know participate in putting the checkpoint on ethereum like this is specifically for like i'm talking about this pos and plasma chains i mean there can be future kind of chains which might not like you know have a checkpoint or have stronger checkpoints uh you know that that will depend on the kind of solution but then essentially it's like the proof-of-stake uh you know mechanism uh you know basically the validators actually uh earn the right on the transaction fees right so the value approval mechanism is is actually directly dependent upon the adoption so if the large amount option comes in and then like the network starts generating hundreds of millions in transaction fees uh then you know if you are a validator in this network you get a piece of that file right and then you know let's say a 10 return for you yearly is a good enough return and then the network is let's say generating 100 million per year in the uh you know transaction cost then let's say a billion dollar worth of tokens can be staked right and that that amount of tokens are out of the supplies so sandy this this is essentially the same role that uh the atom token plays in the cosmos network correct exactly yeah exactly he said what are the fees actually denominated in so i've got my matic token i've got my validator i'm staking my matic to my to my mata uh i'm taking stake my tokens to my validator processing uh transactions on the matic l2 and i'm getting fees uh how are those fees measured and what are what is the denomination of those fees how how do the fees happen so the current pos chain uh the the plasma chain they have the fees denominated in matic tokens itself but then that's not the primary value approval system of this so in future like uh you know i and mihallo have been discussing that you know we can very easily make let's say eat as the uh as the gas fees in that and that actually increases the user experience we kind of realized that you know that like later on in the cycle that you know we should have like with this change also it could have been the the gas piece so that people also have a mental model easy easier mental model that okay on ethereum i am paying 350 or like whatever gray as the gas piece and here i'm paying like you know maybe one to five grey as a gas piece so you know that could be a default option so but in terms of like uh you know currently it's matic and then in future it can be again like as mihalo said that you know we want to make it like completely unopinionated so like the default option might be eve in future but then there can be some change which say that hey i want die to be my transaction fees mechanism and then as a as a validator you earn the fees in whatever token the the relative like the chain you are validating on uh you know denominates its piece on so and so with ethereum gas fees the gas the amount of fees that is paid by the user to the miners or in the in future the validator is determined by how much demand there is for block space how how is the fee size determined on polygon so it's exactly the same model the the the free market model for the for the gas uh gas fees and you know we are also exploring like the new uh like you know like erc one one five uh one one factor nine uh kind of uh scenarios uh so so yeah like currently but the model is exactly like ethereum when the when the demand goes up and there are larger number of transactions then validators choose the higher gas fees uh paying transactions yeah but the but the scalability of the current chain is pretty high like you know it's around like uh you know 7200 tps in some of our major you know measurements so like network is right now far from uh you know that stage so and then plus there are sticking rewards so the validators also subsidize some sort of piece right now and and the top of that just to add to that now we are introducing a multitude of change so it's not like mcqs even though it's not it's nowhere near the peak capacity but we we will have a multitude of chains hopefully in the future that will all just have significant uh capacity and just yes that's the general intention well all of those uh well all those chains may halo be um if they're proof of stake in polygon will they all be backed by maddox economic security in some way not not necessarily not necessarily we also think it's like a kind of a slippery slope or a double-edged sword it's always like um i guess it's always um tempting to to tokens are very powerful mechanism i would say like in token powered systems are really amazing to to analyze and the way if you think like something like bitcoin or ethereum works as a let's say fully independent but again consistent and functional system only driven primarily at least driven by the token that that's like a very very interesting paradigm and it's tempting to try to use that powerful uh tool as much as possible but it also can introduce friction so we want to uh uh like for developers that are building end user apps on polygon for them the primary concern should be the user experience of their end users for us primary our primary concern is the developer experience the experience for people who are building on polygon so we we kind of have to be very flexible if someone there will be options and there will be many cases i believe where people like to take ether or their native token or our native token to secure their their system so we just want to um there's that famous miss called let 1000 flowers bloom we just want to allow uh all sorts of architectures setups whatever basically works the best for any specific project or the community we think some some projects made that mistake previously and if you're forcing someone to stake uh um let's say 100 000 of your native token which is by default wallet time because this is a very volatile i mean market and by in its nature i mean you are kind of um instantly rejecting uh 90 percent of developers i would say out there and that's definitely something to to consider so yes i hope that answers the question we just want to be we just want to allow people to pick their favorite or optimal setup for their specific projects and we believe uh like that field that will uh provide in the long term the best value to to all the participants including talking holders metric token holders hearing talking holders developers basically all the stealth stakeholders in the system if you set up the system properly in the long term like everyone will be happy i guess so there are a number of questions in the bank list youtube and and thanks everyone who's in the youtube for being there in the chat box the chat box i know is a very fun place to be while you're there please like and subscribe we won't be able to get to every single question but there is a question i want to get to is the road map for polygon um what's what's on the road map what do you guys have as like you know deadlines or deliverables like what can we see coming down the pipeline yeah so we are we are yet to publish a fully detailed and timelined uh roadmap uh but then we like the next uh upon release is our polygon sdk which is like equivalent of uh polka dot substrate uh which you know you you can use to launch your own chains uh like you know parachains in in polka dots so that is very close uh but then you know beyond that like all the all the things uh you know a timed roadmap is yet to be published so yeah we will share it with the community very very soon basically but probably in the next couple of weeks two months well actually before we get we close out i would like to squeeze one last question in here because i've seen this ask a couple times in in the uh chat box is sandeep this one's for you uh we've really recently saw some hostile regulation out of india when it comes to crypto and blockchain development i was wondering if maybe you could get your comments on that about your opinions on on the government stance towards our industry yeah so uh you know that like india has a like when people see india's crypto regulations they actually don't see the the background india is coming from like as as near as like you know 10 years back uh there used they used to be a saying even though india is like you know fourth or fifth you know largest uh you know country by gdp but there you used to be a saying that you know like you know like if you have two billion two trillion dollars of economy in the in the in the white markets you have 2 billion worth of you know 2 trillion worth of economy in the black markets so government is actually this the current government has been trying to put a lot of like you know curbs around like how people can you know move their money around and all that like bringing everything to system everything to the books and then suddenly you you introduce crypto and boom everything is gone right so their discomfort is you know their discomfort you know it's pretty understandable uh and they are like you know generally the tendency is to scare away the retail uh because you know there are like it's a pretty large country and then you know you have a lot of scams coming up and all that so uh i think that's their intention mostly but right now seeing the like the global scenario where like elon musk is buying you know bitcoins and you know like these micro strategies of the world and all that i think they would be i don't see like you know the kind of like media sensationalism that has been done that there will be a outright blanket ban and all that like it's it's very hard to do in india in a democratic country like india it has like almost similar like values of liberty and all that as uh you know as you have in the u.s so it's very hard to ban things outright previously government tried to do that and it was like you know it was pushed by the by our judiciary and supreme court actually issued an order against it so i think like for any of the any of the people who are like especially in india they are panicking on this like just relax even if there is a you know difficult regulation comes in government will give you time to you know liquidate your assets no need to panic sell or anything secondly for for polygon the you know like matic network when we evolved into polygon this idea of larger like you know like kind of a you know like a sub foundation for ethereum in the sense itself like you know we are working for the ethereum ecosystem in in that sense we at least we internally culturally believe so we actually have already expanded our entities into multiple geographies so we are we are like immune to any particular geographies you know and previously also when we had built our entity structures we had built for these eventualities right so we have like an our token entities in british version virgin islands and then you know our you know the other token interfacing entities are in singapore indian entities absolutely free from any sort of relation to crypto so you know like no need to worry especially related to uh you know uh to the to the team and the protocol and then now it's a very diversified team with with our entities in you know in europe and uh you know and in multiple other uh areas of the world so no need to worry about that and the team is also pretty distributed also yeah well guys oh go ahead no just one sentence that basically the polygon is a i i want to stress again we consider it a community driven project and it is not owned by anyone it's not located in any specific country or anything like that it belongs to the whole community belongs to the world and everyone is very much free and welcome to contribute and it has as i think we all can see it is a quite powerful but quite ambitious vision so we will definitely need all the help we can get uh um to build this to make this all happen so yes we are inviting everyone to to join us whether you're technical or not if you i don't know if you heard about polygon if you understand what you're building it if you like it if you see it might be a good fit for you please reach out to us we are welcoming you with open hands well fantastic guys uh me hello sandeep thanks for spending some time with us and describing polygon uh it's been a pleasure this really feels like 2021 will be the year of layer two on ethereum and thanks for your work in making that happen thank you so much brian thanks david for having us here thank you guys those pleasures to be here all right uh bagless community there are a number of ways to get involved if you're a developer of course uh mihailo mentioned that you reach out to the project reach out to polygon and see what they're doing also if you're a user i would encourage you to start using layer 2. so that poly.market application is one way to do that you can experience too that's a good way to get your arms wrapped around this technology and the investments you're making this space as well is be a user that's number one thing you can do to inform yourselves of course risk disclaimers guys none of this has been financial advice eth is risky so is d phi so is layer two you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier
