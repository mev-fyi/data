when you are talking to the cryptocurious ladies of web 3 who are trying to get into the space and they perhaps they say something along the lines of oh i don't think this is for me what do you say next i mean usually i ask like why do they feel that way and honestly most of the time it's rooted in an experience that made them feel stupid like they did something they felt dumb and then they thought i gotta go like i'm not gonna do this and i feel like that's been so much of our community calls are basically therapy where people are like i feel really dumb like can i ask you this question or like i had this experience online or in person or listening to something and it's like undoing that work because i think people are clouded by that negative experience and that's just a shared experience that i think a lot of women have and makes them feel left out and and it makes it really hard for them to want to participate in any way
