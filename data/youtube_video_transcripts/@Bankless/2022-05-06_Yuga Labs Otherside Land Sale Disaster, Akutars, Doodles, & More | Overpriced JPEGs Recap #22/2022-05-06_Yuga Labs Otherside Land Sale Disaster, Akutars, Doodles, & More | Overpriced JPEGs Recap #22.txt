dm with some brand new internet friends we are going to dive straight in of course the biggest story of the week is you hugo labs which will be coming up i will give you all my thoughts i have strong strong thoughts about other side and the land sale they did but i want to start with a new company they've raised 6.9 million dollars backed by alexis ohanian and his venture fund and also open c and it's called americana americana chips turn physical objects into nfts i should shout out my friends uh my friend ryan oh yang who has a company called if you know that is also doing something very similar uh ryan you're the best but i want to talk about this concept so they basically you can apply chips to physical items that connect those physical items to the blockchain i think the opportunity here is massive and so exciting and i want to talk about it what we are talking about is the capacity to create a global digital database of things of all things and i think that opportunity is um is is the implications of that or maybe even bigger than people are thinking so having this global database on the blockchain of all of our items will create really global price transparency which you know depending on the industry that's more or less of a problem but in general greater transparency credible greater global price transparency is so empowering for the consumer right opacity benefits the rich and the powerful transparency benefits the collective and the many we know that price transparency is a huge problem in the art market oftentimes i think somebody who i interviewed said this like they had a friend who worked at a gallery and and the person working in the gallery wasn't even allowed to know the price of particular artworks so uh getting visibility into the history of items whether it be cars furniture pottery anything and anything and everything um is it's just incredible i also think what it does for the consumer experience and the potential for the consumer experience is really really interesting so i want to play out some hypotheticals here um i just came back from the amazon and i have been reading a book about the history of amazon the company so it's been a big couple of amazon weeks for me and uh this is is quite obvious to us now but one of the big unlocks for amazon the business was their their personalization feature the fact that if you ordered books from amazon because in the early days of course it was just a bookstore you could go back and it would recommend other books for you it could personalize your experience shopping on amazon um and that was something that barnes and noble really couldn't offer you in the same way even though barnes noble maybe had your buying history for you just at that barnes and noble store they weren't customizing your experience in the store based on that and i think what we will see increasingly is as our purchasing history is tied with our digital our online and our physical purchasing history has the potential to be tied to a central digital identity of ours the capacity for personalizing our experience even in an irl setting i think we'll go we'll go up i think it's really interesting to think what stores can do when they can if we so choose to let them tap into our wallet tap into our digital identity see what we like and then make recommendations in store about maybe what we're drawn to we started to hear this uh scott galloway and cara swisher actually have been talking about this when it comes to like apple like why don't they get personalized experience or personalized treatment when they arrive at an apple store uh given that they're big customers apple should know who they are when they you know enter the store and and provide experiences specifically for them i think we'll see increasingly that kind of personalized experience across all stores and crypto and having a central digital identity is a huge part of that and then having this database of things where my digital identity shows not just what i'm buying in the digital realm but also potentially what i'm buying in the physical realm because those physical items are also being uh stored and and uh itemized in a central blockchain database i think it's it's incredibly exciting what could come from that we're we're maybe a decade away from these kinds of experiences but this is where the world is moving and uh americana is on the forefront of that so wanted to flag that company for you to check out and also shout out if you know my friends ryan sorry if you all can hear the honking in the background i am in new york city shout out my friend ryan oh yang and his company if you know okay y'all the absolute biggest story of the week of course has to do with hugo labs and board apes because nobody can move media cycles like the board ape yacht club that's what you get when gweneth paltrow and jimmy fallon and every other celebrity in the world seemingly has bought or been gifted your token uh okay by now you all probably know the let's call it a scandal with you labs and the other side metaverse land drop that they did last saturday i'll run through it really quickly here just in case you've been living under a rock but i really want to make a more macro point around this whole topic so all right last saturday yuga lab launches their other side metaverse land drop they broke ethereum demand was absolutely out of control gas wars were absolutely out of control an estimated 100 million dollars were lost in gas fees people trying to scoop up the 55 000 other side land pieces that were for sale i don't even think it was a full 55 000 because some of those were going to board ape yacht holders and uh mutant ape yacht holders the real scandal though in my opinion came after this debacle which was the hugo labs response and hugo labs essentially blamed ethereum very much seemed to divert attention or blame from themselves and took this as an opportunity to say i guess you know ethereum can't handle us and if we're going to scale the way we want to we're going to need to create our own 8 chain this was really not taken kindly from the community who felt like there were any number of ways that hugo labs could have at least mitigated how bad this was that there was a hundred million dollars lost you had somebody from syndicate dow tweeting saying basically hey with like these couple gas optimization tweaks in their smart contract we could have saved like 80 million dollars of this um vitalik did come out and basically say you know gas optimizat a gas optimized contract really wouldn't have solved this thing fully so i think there's some back and forth about that uh but but all in all this felt like laziness on the part of yougut the other thing that's strange is they had kyc'd everybody who wasn't an ape holder or a mutant holder um they had actually done kyc on everybody so in theory they had a sense of how many people might be trying to buy in and they could have used that information to try and mitigate the situation that went down by having time windows for you know different people had different time slots in which they could try to mint i mean it it it seems like absolutely there is some blame to be laid at the feet of you collabs and their unwillingness to take it really rubbed people the wrong way i will say this uh i'm about to lay some fud on you labs which is not a particularly brave thing to do since right now yuga labs is already being kicked from a variety of different corners and this is not meant to say i'm overall bearish on yugo labs i think they have a lot going for them namely a crazy amount of resources and a certain amount of brand moat just you know their community the visibility of them but i i will say one thing here which is after the acquisitions they made of me bits and of crypto punks which was very quickly followed up as people might remember a couple months ago very quickly followed up with the announcement of apecoin the release of the trailer for other side people were just salivating i mean just in plain view just ogling over yuga labs and uh zenika and i had a conversation on this podcast in which i asked him how much luck he thought played into the the leading projects in this space which was a couched way of of me saying what i really wanted to say but i wasn't really bold enough to say at the time which is i felt like hugo labs was getting way too much freaking credit because as far as i could tell like we were all salivating basically because they had managed to get eight coin listed on all of the major exchanges at once and it was like oh the execution of yuga labs and and yes there was a great execution of like the the announcement of the acquisition quickly followed by apecoin and their ability to just build on their announcements but like this wasn't like mastermind steve jobs building apple over a decade like this wasn't some like crazy mastermind scheme this was like you know solid above average executing from a brand with a lot of money that should be able to execute but here's the real point here's the bigger picture point you go labs should not be doing a land sale at all why two really straightforward reasons first of all in terms of a community strategy it's a big fat loser it's a terrible community strategy we'll talk about why it's also long-term i think a terrible economic strategy and we'll talk about why so on the community front there was a leaked deck from you labs a little while back that showed their plans for this broader metaverse and talked a lot about the the bigger yugo ecosystem that they were planning on building and that that leaked deck said they want to invite the larger nft community into the board ape ecosystem call it they know board apes are wildly expensive this is a problem that all nfts all nft projects face we talked about it i talked about it extensively with doodle's co-founder poopy like if you only have 10 000 nfts or you know add mutant names 30 000 nfts whatever like how do you get more people into your ecosystem but i'd say go even broader like forget trying to invite the larger nft community in if you're yugolabs you're trying to get the whole freaking world in you want eight billion people into your ecosystem that's how big you should be thinking and it's the attention economy i mean board apes should want to be the oasis from ready player one like board apes should be shooting for yoga labs should be shooting for every human on the planet puts on a headset every day and a hundred times a day are logging into the board apes metaverse right like why not the problem is they're not gonna do that with 55 000 pieces of land it's never going to hold eight billion people so you're limiting the number of community members realistically that can fully participate in your ecosystem now they may say no we're not at you know people eight billion people maybe can be on these 55 plots of land no inevitably you are limiting the number of users you are going to have let's talk about why roblox roblox is a perfect example roblox has benefited from a huge network effects people's friends are on there building games so they want to get on there and build games and everybody's able to participate because there's an infinite amount of land there's an infinite potential for user generated content this should be the most obvious concept in the world for those of us in web 3. you want to maximize the community the community's ideas you want to open source this you want anybody with a good idea to build a game in your world or to build a top of the game that you've already created in the case of hugo labs they clearly have some specific gaming ideas and stories and concepts in mind but you should want people to be able to build on top of that and so finally taxi infinity is literally dealing with this right now axi infinity did a land sale a couple of years ago at this point they've done very little with that land and they alluded to and sort of mentioned earlier this year that they would likely be giving out free land at various points in addition to the land that they've already sold to people now this of course made the community furious the people who hold the axe infinity land because they felt like are you kidding me like i spent all this money on the land and now you're gonna dilute the share of my land by giving out free land but actually wants to give out free land because they've recognized this exact problem that you collabs has now just painted themselves into which is they don't actually want to limit the creative potential of their universe by who can afford to buy the land and therefore determine what gets built limited land means limited builders means limited upside potential that's just the reality okay why is this economically stupid hugo labs has now just set themselves up to be beholden to 55 000 land holders they are expected to create a return for these 55 000 land holders who may or may not themselves do anything to boost the value of the land who may or may not themselves do anything to boost the value of this community again this should be a very obvious concept to anybody who's in web 3. you collabs should end up feeling beholden to whoever is creating the most value is being the most productive is doing the most in their metaverse that's who they should be rewarding not rewarding the 55 000 people who happen to be available on a saturday night at 9 00 p.m eastern and had the apecoin to buy into their land sale like that's not inclusivity this is a dynamic you see play out in other failed land-like contexts where you have speculators who buy up land and then just sit on it and don't do anything productive with it necessarily or then lease it out to somebody who can maybe do something productive but they're just rent seekers it's everything that web3 wants to do away with which is centralized control and put hands that put the power and the benefit instead into the hands of people who are actually the creators who are actually the builders so that's also they've painted themselves into an economic corner now in a situation where they have to reward a bunch of people who were free on a saturday night here's the other thing by now having this economic duty you could call it obligation to these 55 000 land holders they don't get to prosper as much from the potential here so this is a funny thing this is probably a broader point about something that's going on in web3 that i think is very interesting in like the rest of the business world people are obsessed with recurring revenue and like every business is trying to become a recurring revenues or recurring revenue business where they have some sort of recurring revenue model roblox has a recurring revenue model right they you can have a subscription to roblox where you on a recurring basis or buying robux and then you get all sorts of other benefits for being a part of their ecosystem the nft world is obsessed with one-time purchases that get you like lifetime access benefits and in theory the recurring revenue here is secondary sales um but that's not the kind of consistency that makes you comfortable if you're reading like a profit and loss statement or you know you're reading financial papers you want to know that every month you have whatever you know your netflix with your x number of subscribers every month paying and so i think there's a really interesting potential with recurring revenue models in metaverses that is maximized when you haven't done a land sale okay so let me spell out another vision here which is board apes yoga labs creates an open metaverse world where there's infinite amounts of land they still build their awesome incredible game that everybody wants to be a part of but you also have you also tap into the community and incredible user generated content and games and this whole ape world that looks like the ape branding but is tapping into community potential and becomes wildly popular and successful now maybe you charge people on a recurring basis to for continued access to that metaverse and maybe you know people pay monthly and every time they you know pay their monthly fee on that recurring basis they get a new nft and it's their monthly nft that unlocks that world and they get to log in with that nft and now every month they're getting their nft that represents their re-upped subscription and they're using that to unlock the world i don't know perhaps that's not the right way to do it but i think there are so many interesting models here for metaverses and i feel like all we see get tapped right now are just like one-time land sale which just limits your potential in so many ways it's disappointing too because yoga labs does have the total potential to create the interoperable oasis and they have the community they have the brand recognition they have the name brand like they could have done it and i think this was just a complete missed opportunity so my prediction though is somebody will get this right i'm sure this project's working on it i think there'll be a big nft project i i'm bullish like i like the idea of these nft projects building their own metaverses i said it when hugo labs made their announcement i think that makes a lot of sense that's where the energy is right now that people have connections to their nfts these nft projects should be launching their meta versus they just shouldn't be doing it like this so my prediction is you will have an nft project that launches a metaverse in my opinion in the right way which is to not have finite land sales to have it be infinite and i think doodles could be it i think doodles it's is so savvy i think they are building a very clear brand identity i think they could create a very interesting world like this fuo fuocious could also potentially do something like this but if i were gonna as a betting woman i'd bet on doodles but somebody will do this and that is my prediction it'll be an awesome nft project that will succeed not by doing a land sale but by taking the longer term vision approach creating consistently day after day an amazing metaverse experience that people want to be a part of and monetizing it later this is the final point i'll make you collabs has raised i think half a billion dollars from this land sale between primary sales and secondary sales 500 million dollars they have raised from this without having to really show proof of anything and we need to start inverting that process where these these brands start getting to monetize us after after they've proven themselves and building the metaverse first and monetizing it later especially for these brands that already have a lot of money and have vc backing i think that's the way to do it okay long rant over living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the default apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po-apps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 to the next scandal of the week man y'all it has been it has been a week or two uh aku my beloved akutars and the very bad no good terrible 34 million dollar smart contract error uh again you are probably familiar by now with the fact that as part of the akutar mint and the aquitar dutch auction an error was made in their smart contract which means there is 34 million dollars locked in a smart contract that they will never be able to access perhaps as importantly and tragically that 35 million dollars was going to be used in part to refund users who took part in the touch auction and paid a higher price than those who who bought in later i'll explain that in a minute it was also going to go to help refund any aquatar mint pass holders who had been told they would get a half an eth price reduction on the final price sale price of the of the aquitars in the dutch auction uh aquidar did the aku team made good on their promise to the community again we'll talk about this but they were not able to use the 34 million dollars for any of that this has got to be such a painful mistake my heart goes out to the aquitar team uh you know i i'm kept up at night by some of the mistakes i've made in nft land and they've never cost me more than a few thousand dollars so this one is uh is painful um let's talk uh briefly about what happened so i've talked about aku and akutars several times on this show i'm very bullish on it that still is true uh it's a project founded by michael johnson xmlb player and i think he's created a really vivid world even with the the bits that he's released thus far which is he's done like 10 nft drops um and and now this alcatar drop which is his like which is the the 3d avatar drop of this whole ecosystem and they were doing something really cool they were doing a dutch auction but instead of everyone paying whatever price they paid wherever the dutch auction sold out so if it sold out at one east anybody who had bought into the dutch auction had bought bought into the project above one east would get refunded to that one eighth level this is a concept we've talked about before on this show as we've talked about dutch auctions and how they get structured it's something that carlini of penelope's who's on this on the podcast has talked a lot about publicly that that's the way dutch auctions should be done and so aquitars finally they were they were going to be the ones to do it um but this is of course novel and they clearly did not have the right level of auditing in place to pull this off my understanding of essentially what went wrong here and i don't think i have this exactly right um but is some variation on like it was like a counter error right so everything was being run through a smart contract and once the project sold out the smart contract was going to automatically identify okay it's sold out that means it sold out at this price that means this number of wallets need to get refunded at this particular level it would trigger the release of the remaining funds to the the akutar team and if they had you know 15 000 akutars that they were releasing the counter accidentally went up to 15 000 won which meant that that triggering event to unlock the funds to unlock the refunds etc never got hit and never will get hit because they don't actually have that 15 thousand and one nft to be sold um so really painful error to make and i think the the uh the other indictment of the team here is that you had people who warned them people on twitter good folks who were saying that there were errors in this smart contract and the aquatar team seemed to be it felt to people like they were being somewhat dismissive of um of those warnings they were receiving which makes it you know extra painful when when the people pointing out the bugs turned out to be right um i think akhitar and the occu team has handled this very well they've you know totally owned up to their mistake they did right by the community which of course cost them tremendously from you know i'm sure they used the community you know the treasury that they had built up from their other nft sales and they said hey look we're moving forward we made a mistake uh we're moving on and we've made right by the community and here we go onward and upwards so there's nothing more they can do you know i think from a community perspective everything you were promised you uh you received and i'm still very long-term bullish in this community in some ways i've joked before like it's the teams that have these sort of mistakes or these sort of hacks that you know i i trust the most moving forward because i think they learn their lessons that are unlikely to make these kinds of mistakes again in the future but so uh i uh i'm bullish aku this hasn't that hasn't this hasn't dampened that long-term bullishness in the bulls corner for aku we had an announcement that came earlier today this is wednesday may 4th uh talking about two new hires the aku team has made i'm going to just read this to you all uh this is from the aku account we are excited to finally introduce you all to two incredibly talented world builders and creatives who have been working with us to expand the akuverse into a broad landscape of story-driven avenues places where we all know aku should live hiri hart oversaw star wars creative at lucasfilm and she executive produced pixar's soul and luca so there's no doubt she brings world building experience second to none sorry world building expertise second to none and more importantly we are on the same mission she has the same big dreams for aku that we have and stephen fetter has been partnered with kiri since he was her vp of film at lucasfilm on star wars he also helped build the renegade artist focused studio annapurna pictures his whole career is about helping elevate creators voices blessed he brings that spirit to aku uh seems like they've made two impressive hires and i just think aku has has good potential better potential than so many projects out there when it comes to creating long-term intellectual property that has deep resonance for its community from the very beginning it just it's set up with that kind of potential the the the nft drops the 10 nft drops they did initially that were animated there's a feeling they evoke and they they are just so clearly well poised to be films tv shows video games like that there's so much you can do with this character i feel it so strongly so uh go a guitars poor execution but onwards and forwards okay wow it's just been scandal after scandal um this perhaps not really such a scandal but ryan carson announced he is leaving moon birds uh really it seems like this is about him starting his 121 g fund he's basically starting a fund to invest in nfts i would love to be a part of it i'm not yet an accredited investor god damn this is my whole other this is my soapbox about accredited investing should not be about the income you've made for the last two years it should be about your financial literacy and we should all be subjected to like a financial sophistication test just like we have a driver's license test and that should determine whether or not you're an accredited investor but i could not invest in ryan carson's fund but i am bullish on it i'm bullish on ryan i know he got some i guess hate from the community people really didn't like some of his tweets you know when he was ceo of moon birds i'm gonna be honest unpopular opinion i did not mind it the stuff that people were getting like kind of rubbed the wrong way by i didn't see problems with like any of it i think he got in trouble for some floor talk he did he got in trouble got in trouble whatever that means you know people didn't love that he talked about his his buying strategy for moon birds i didn't mind any of that stuff and you know i know um kevin rose had to come out and apologize a bit because uh ryan you know said oh after this uh after the situation with hugo labs you know i have no doubt that moon birds will be a top five project and kevin rose set out like you know came out and said hey we're gonna we're gonna get there on our merits not because other projects fail we don't have to root for other projects to fail for us to succeed but again like i just didn't take it that seriously like okay ryan was making a joke about hugo lab's failed execution and he was being a little tribal and the little pro moon birds like i don't know i i wasn't uh i wasn't particularly bothered by by ryan's marks but i know i know others were kevin has also now said kevin rose has come out and said you know basically he doesn't need a co anyway because he is going to full-time move to moon birds i think he was like you know i expected moon birds to be successful but i did not expect it to be nearly this successful this quickly so it now requires my full-time attention so kevin rose will be full-time building moon birds that's good i think necessary once you're when your project has quickly risen to being a thirty eighth floor project um and that's that's that on moon birds i think there's you know we're in a lull we'll see i'm sure there will be a lot more to talk about when it comes to moon birds in in the future but for now uh i think it's it's time for them to show us what they've got a lot of money was invested in the team and it's it's now time to see what they can do okay cool cats i feel like cool cats has become the like ugly stepsister or like forgotten forgotten blue chip uh but there has been some news out of cool cats recently their ceo stepped down i didn't even know they had hired a ceo this is this shows you i guess i don't know if it's if that's an indictment of me or of cool cats but their ceo chris hassett has stepped down seems like there's no bad blood for whatever reason it just didn't work and they have now hired a like a leading head hunting firm like if coca-cola wants to hire a ceo the head-outing firm that coca-cola would use cool cats has hired to find them a new ceo which i'm glad that they should they are they are taking themselves seriously they are a major brand they are a massive company and they should be working with the best to find the absolute best person to lead cool cats into its next phase it's definitely been struggling a little bit to find its identity to find its footing to succeed and uh i hope its next chapter will be uh more bullish than this last chapter has been for them i think gaming moving into gaming was the wrong move i think they move i think they did it too quickly you know hindsight's 20 20 maybe that's the obvious call to make now but um yeah it's uh they they need to figure out their new road their new road map on a bright spot doodles has announced that they have some big announcements coming i continue to be very very bullish on doodles i i felt that way since my interview with poopy i think it's very clear this is one of the most talented teams in the space bar none and they are strategic they are hard working and they just understand the industry and uh i will wait with baited breath to see what their upcoming announcements are like i said maybe one of them will be their their open metaverse where they don't do a damn land sale finally our on a final note here berkshire hathaway held its annual shareholders meeting this past weekend i uh little known fact about me i'm like a total warren buffett fan girl i absolutely love warren i went to the berkshire hathaway shareholders meeting back in 2016. i wrote like a whole op-ed about it because i loved it so freaking much they call it the woodstock of capitalism and it's just like the most joyful gathering of people and it's it's the absolute best of capitalism it's capitalism not run amok it's capitalism where money is deployed to make companies better and it benefits us as consumers and so i i absolutely love warren buffett i love charlie munger his business partner however warren and charlie do not love bitcoin they do not love crypto charlie called out bitcoin specifically in some very harsh terms he called it both stupid and evil neither of them are ones to mince words um he said it was stupid because it could very easily go to zero he said it was evil because it undermined our federal reserve system which we desperately need and look i don't begrudge them they're bitcoin fud at all obviously i don't agree with them uh i'm more of an ethereum maxie than i am a bitcoin maxie so i would never uh desperately defend bitcoin but but obviously i think they have this totally wrong and i think they they are fundamentally misunderstanding the value proposition here but berkshire hathaway cannot be denied it it deserves nothing but reverence and respect from all of us they have the most consistent high long-term returns of any company if they were a hedge fund they would be returning it's like 20 year-over-year returns that they've they've managed in the last many decades i mean they are so incredibly consistent and they're consistent because they invest in businesses that they understand warren buffett knows what his sphere of competency is he talks about it over and over again understand your sphere of competency he compares it to like a strike zone understand where what what zone in which zone you can hit a home run and wait for the pitch to be in that zone and crush it that's what he does he can wait for pitch after pitch until it hits his his uh zone of competency they missed tech stocks right they didn't invest in tech companies because he couldn't understand the multiples he couldn't understand the value proposition there and um so you know he misses plenty of things but he when he hits he hits big and uh i just love them so this is really just a warren buffett and charlie munger appreciation plug and here's the reality i want to give some credit to their fud uh here is what i'll say warren buffett determines the intrinsic value of a company and then he buys stock in companies whose stock price is below whatever he's determined its intrinsic value to be how does he determine intrinsic value well that of course is the secret sauce but you know fundamentally it's about looking at a company's moat it's looking at its revenue it's looking at its free cash flow it's modeling things out right like they can look at a whole bunch of financial indicators numbers shareholder letters annual uh annual letters whatever and and make really savvy businesses and decisions about these companies the reality is how do you determine the intrinsic value of dead fellas of course you can't what's the intrinsic value of bitcoin i don't know like and nobody can know this and these are much more gambly assets this is these are glorified casinos we're playing in uh these are these are very much we are glorified gamblers those of us who are playing the nft space and sure we can have a feel for things and there are people who have clearly managed to do well consistently and probably have some skill and but a lot of this is luck and it's certainly not based on the kind of mathematical rigor that warren and charlie apply to their investing strategy and we have to acknowledge that and we should not feel so territorial about our love for entities in the blockchain to not be able to acknowledge the that there's some truth in the shade that warren and charlie throw our way all right folks that's our show for today i am so
