[Music] hey y'all a quick note before we kick off this interview today on the podcast i have quinn campbell marketing lead at axiomfinity and i was told beforehand that for legal etc reasons we could not talk about the axi hack uh quinn was open to me asking a question about it and he would just have to say basically i have nothing i can say on this so i didn't end up wasting his time by asking it but i did want to say that before you go and listen to this episode because it is a little bit the elephant in the room to interview somebody from axiomfinity during this time and not ask about the hack that just happened i've talked about it on the podcast in other episodes if you want to go check out the latest recap episode zenika and i talk about the axihack um but it does not come up in this episode i promise however you should still listen it's still great we get into the sustainability question which is at the heart of the axi debate people who are bullish versus bearish on axi and i learned a lot from quinn i think he will too but wanted to put that out there hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and here with me today we have quinn campbell marketing lead at the one and only axi infinity you all know it one of the most important companies i would say okay is this over overstating it like in the world like i think this is it's so pioneering in terms of what axi has ushered into our world and uh i think when the history books are written we're going to be able to draw a line from what axi did to a lot of things that are very important down the line so um very excited to be talking with you quinn we were just joking earlier you're my first axi guest which is kind of crazy to think about it's long overdue i appreciate that intro carly yeah we believe uh historians are going to be looking through twitter threads and discord server chat history in the future uh definitely i think like uh business books like business case studies definitely will and then like the books about the future of you know how how the economy played out and how like jobs played out will definitely have axey in that story um before we dive in really deep into everything we want to talk about here today we're gonna take a quick moment to get a word from our sponsors living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private

you had this history of like you were at deloitte and then you got your masters in or was it masters in chinese studies at hopkins that's right and then it was like and then you're at axiomfinity and i'm wondering like were your parents like what like what is how do you explain what axey infinity is to your parents or that's how that goes yeah that that's definitely a tough one right uh in terms of yeah i mean the the journey's been been a fun one for sure um yeah i always have kind of had a bug for china i spent about five years um living there as well um and uh yeah i left deloitte and ended up in in traditional games publishing um which which was a blast but it kind of uh really quickly i started to get turned sour on it and the reason why is because i realized every game we were publishing we were taking about 70 to 80 of all the revenue on and the game devs themself were actually only capturing 20 of the revenue and that just felt so wrong to me right because you're helping these devs make their dream come true and they push the game out and then they only get 20 of the of the money off the top of of the game that they created and and so i realized the you know middlemen were the problem and and i was a middleman and so it was right around the time i i saw mavis hub which is kind of what actually loads through right and it just immediately clicked that this is now this way to distribute directly to your community and that's what web3 unlocks in a way that that traditional games never could be for and so i i knew i had to be there uh and yeah it was a it was definitely a big jump explaining what what the heck actually was to everybody uh but i think in its simplest sense right like it's digital pet collectibles we've all seen that before pokemon digimon right and it's a card battler which also we've seen before in in pokemon at the same way right in terms of the web three sides of things like that's kind of a next step when it comes to unlocking that in in people's minds um i think at the end of the day right a lot of nft games they try to market that they're nfts but we actually those are the tools those are the tools to creating what the ultimate kind of end game is we don't want to really market that it's an nft game we want a market that it's like a free and open economy you know where you actually have true ownership rights and things like that so those are the kinds of things that i'm actually really using to explain to people this might be naive to say but it also feels like that shouldn't be such a leap for a pokemon or yugi yugioh players you can tell i was not one of these girls it you guys you probably played a little pokemon growing up i honestly don't think i ever did but i remember boys in my class at lunchtime having these cards but i i almost feel like i my parents were like discouraging of it and i couldn't tell you why not what we're here to discuss um i was gonna say i feel like it would be a more natural concept there than say somebody who's used to a video game model perhaps only and so forth like you owned your pokemon cards and by owning that pokemon card it had value and you could sell it and some of these have accrued tremendous amounts of value so even that dynamic is is pretty familiar when you compare it to these like actual tangible physical games card games especially right it's a much easier kind of concept to grasp because you do own it you it can increase in value to be honest most of us who ever owned pokemon cards they weren't investments we we but we still wanted to own them because it has this incredible nostalgic value it has a flex value versus your friends you just want to have it for your own right another example i give is like i grew up playing lacrosse i certainly could have gone to a play it again store right a used sports gear store and gotten all used gear or even rented it and given it back at the end of the season but my preference was still to own it you know and that's most people's preference still and it turns out that in the digital space it's really not too different we've just never had that capability of actually owning things before you talk about your aha moment it sounded like was oh my god being at a traditional game studio looking at the middlemen which i can give you this example yeah give it give me the example and then i'll ask you so i i with i was voodoo where i was at and i published this game called fat pusher uh which was a blast and the dev was the solo dev named batsaya he was 23 years old based in ulaanbaatar mongolia we became super tight through the whole process he had like a newborn at home and we pushed this game live and you know the game did like millions of dollars and he himself i think did like two or three hundred thousand dollars which for him was super impactful and it was so cool to get to be a part of his life in that way but i'm just looking at this discrepancy like betsya you created this game and it's so it's such a bummer to see what you're missing out on at the end of the day and so i just i had to find something else and like i said i i stumbled across nft gaming because of a clubhouse chat actually like way back when that was still really a thing and yeah it was just this immediate click like there are no publishers in this space right you don't even have to be on app stores now we'll get into that that's definitely an ultimate goal but these games are doing it all with direct distribution to communities and and that was like the aha moment for me and the old model evolved to what it was because you needed help with the distribution and you needed these middlemen to get your game out there and to get it in front of players and to actually have anybody use it and in a whole bunch of ways social media so many things have evolved since these early models came into existence that have made going direct to consumers so much easier and that's sort of fundamentally this shift that we're living through in blockchain and everything that the internet has ushered in so it's also my understanding that that really was the intention of sky mavis when it launched what it look this guy maybe launched i believe in 2018. it's founders saw crypto kitties and they were like how can we take blockchain to empower players and creators of games do i have that right would you articulate that in any sort of different way just starting with that that initial intention with the game because we're going to get into how it's evolved in ways that have had mixed reactions yeah yeah i know that's that's a totally fair way to think about it right it was a lot of our kind of og community and founders all came from cryptokitties and cryptokitties really really um kind of set the tone for how nfts could be used but it was just this breeding game play and and i think that that you know especially our core team saw this like hey we can take this this play around asset um kind of aspect and port it over to really any game uh and that's what they did as they started building out axe the infiniti and what's so cool you know i guess you may not have played runescape either but i think that a lot i did play runescape there you go almost everybody our generation did it's crazy it's crazy middle school um yeah so runescape is a great example because there's this really big it still exists today black market economy for gold in runescape it's like farmed a lot of times it's farmed in china and then they kind of illicitly resell the accounts to people who are willing to pay for them uh all that's it's massive it's ongoing and it's illegal right runescape doesn't let it happen they can't really do a heck of a lot well actually infinity just flipped it on its head and said screw it let's just condone that right yeah everyone's going to do it anyways where does this mark this black market runescape gold what's the marketplace for it so the last i saw was you you it was on ebay i i haven't played runescape in so long i don't know where you buy and sell the accounts now but yeah it's out there um and and so if people are gonna do it anyways and if it it turns out that's what people really want then why not just tokenize every asset in the game therefore allowing it to be freely tradable give players a marketplace where they can do it easily instead of having to do some sketchy transaction through ebay right and then take a 4.25 marketplace fee off the top of it in throughout all of that you are opening the economy allowing it to be player owned letting players do what they really want and taking a fee to kind of run everything on on all the players behalf that's kind of what axey started out as and then you know there was another big step but we'll save that part okay let's do this really briefly and i don't want to spend let's let's make it like 30 seconds because i'm sure most people understand it but for those who don't give like the the high level flyover of what actually is how it works definitely so it's a card battle or game really similar to like pokemon in that sense right and it has these really cute digital collectibles we call axes they're the pets so every time you want to play uh it's a battle of three axes one player's three axes against another three axes like a bot or another player so in order to start playing traditionally you would have to buy three axes uh in order to unlock the game essentially and and then at that point you can play now you know your the composition of your axes is totally controlled by the different parts that make up each axi and that's what makes each axis so unique there's like seven or eight different parts depending on how you think about it so let's say you want to build a really specific team you know based on the parts to like theorycraft the team you want you can go on the open marketplace and buy other axes that have been created because they're all nfts or each axi can be bred seven times so you can also get really clever about breeding your axes to try to produce a specific you know team that you want desired team or but that's grown so much people breed specifically to sell on the marketplace what builds are going to orbital people be wanting right there's an esports aspect to it as well so there's a lot of depth that has popped up but i think that's the the 10 000 foot view beautiful and then i think that i'll add here there's really two tokens to be aware of there's slp which is smooth love potion did it used to be called something else small love potion smooth love potion yeah okay because i've like watched you like intense uh axey youtubers from old ones yeah and i this was even you know probably months ago before this interview when i was first trying to understand it and somebody was calling it small love potion and i'm like the odds are that i'm wrong and yet i feel like it's i've always heard it smooth love potion it's crazy how fast stuff goes stale in this space content goes stale overnight in the nft space it's amazing yeah it's everything it moves so fast okay so smooth love potion that is your you know in-game kind of economy currency when we talk about if you've heard something about axe infinity you've probably heard the fact that you have people internationally who uh you know are making a living essentially playing the game and that's because they were earning slp this in-game economy token battling with their axes and then converting that slp into an ether and ultimately a fiat or something like that then you have axs which is the axis shards and that's your governance token and and this will get us to which something we'll probably touch on later which is this ultimate vision that's about decentralizing axi right and and axs you need it to to breed but really it's this uh sort of promise of the users having more ownership over axi itself did i get that right yeah i think i think you nailed that so uh axey infinity the game is kind of owned and operated by axey dao and axey dao is a separate organization then sky mavis sky mavis were the developers but you know we are a private company whereas axi dow is is essentially owned and controlled by axs token holders right now is a lot of that concentrated within sort of sky mavis and its vcs so we have we have the kind of social contract that that we have with with our community right now it's it's really really impressive um we are driving towards solid solid uh kind of product market fit uh and the social contract that we have is that we are kind of entrusted to really drive and govern the game and axey dow in a way that's going to get us the product market fit you know within the next couple years and over that process we're also going to build out uh what true governance kind of looks like and when you say product market fit does that mean scaling like scaling to be a i don't know what's what's the benchmark that a game looks to be because right now axi has 2.6 million wallets or you know like millions of users which is great but on the scale of games is is maybe small yeah you can define us in so many different ways right we we look huge for an nft game yeah we have a long way to go in terms of comparing it to traditional games and the biggest games in the world and that's where we see ourselves uh and then even beyond that the game itself is really a trojan horse and we're building kind of a network state this is the first true digital nation and how big will that be beyond what a game is so when you talk about product market fit just to be clear you are it is like our ultimate goal with this product is to be one of the biggest games or be a very big game period not just within this category of nfts you know i'm a comedian i'm not a female comedian or like whatever the you know like i don't want to have to have that asterisk next to me is what you guys are saying i mean we're not just an nft game yeah right and and carly the truth is very soon no one's going to call it nft gaming anymore we're just we're just going to it's just gaming right yeah yeah though do you think this is a macro question which maybe i'm inserting here too too early in the interview but like uh you you know you have i get the comparison to free to play often that people make with like nft gaming and we still have this category of like free-to-play games that are distinct from other categories of games do you see blockchain gaming and the use of nfts in games as like there will always be some that have it some that don't it's a part of this broader ecosystem and you will have that category or you like no it's taking over the whole game that's such a hot button question that's uh it really is i i i don't think that i don't think that games without um some type of digital ownership element to them will really really continue to persist and be super popular in the longer term right do you think that all future games that are made or do you think like call of duty or insert popular video game up to this point we'll start introducing it oh absolutely they'll introduce it absolutely yeah uh all of them are thinking about it right it's it's just because there's backlash traditional gamers hate nfts um and it's because they think they're cash grabs by developers when really it's the exact opposite it's what unlocks um kind of consumer protection and true ownership anyways uh as soon as as soon as players are on board uh every every game dev will and is the key to you and that and this will tie to axe in all sorts of ways and but you know having a a blockchain game that is really fun which i like i hesitate to say that because it almost sounds like i'm potentially insulting at axi but we'll talk oh i get a sustainability question right it's like you know it takes a long time to develop a game and actually has pushed the space forward in so many ways and is continuing to build and all these ways we're going to talk about um but we haven't yet seen a game come out on blockchain that really is the equivalent of like a triple-a game studio game and that's coming totally they're definitely being built uh you know there's there's like new 10 new nft gaming projects a week it feels like and and we actually have conversations with a ton of them because you know we're we're actively looking for for third-party devs to build on on ronin on our network uh you can totally see the difference right there are many that that start with nfts first and those probably aren't going to be long-term sustainable game plays when you see these games that build gameplay first and then find ways to sprinkle on digital asset ownership as cherries on top those are those are the games that are fun and those are the games that are really going to stick and i think it's similar when you look at axi when i look at axi classic right v2 which is kind of what we're just about to start phasing out um i see a game that was built by a bunch of guys that wanted to build a game and it's awesome and it's adorable in a way and it worked really well when i look at axiom from the origin which we just launched about a week ago i see a game that is actually built by a legitimate game studio and you can see how much more fun it is almost instantaneously we're going to get into axi origin because as something i said to you before we kick this off i do really want to frame this conversation or address head on the sustainability question which i know axe is very upfront about it is sort of the the core of the debate around axis like is it sustainable and we'll get into why that debate exists but let me first just cover um guilds because i think this is such an incredible thing that we saw ushered in because of axia infinity and and the scholarship programs uh much like describing axi i'm sure lots of listeners are familiar with these but just for for the few that aren't can you give the the the flyover of what are guilds and the scholarship program guilds are such a cool concept right and scholarship programs and guilds often go hand in hand although we're seeing a transition away from that now which is cool um essentially like i said axi classic especially in order to play it you had to purchase three axes uh in order to kind of get access to the game you know depending on token prices at any given time that set of three axes could have been you know a hundred dollars up to six hundred dollars even at one point um which is prohibitive to a lot of a lot of players didn't get more than that it did yeah four place four places were very high uh towards the end of last summer um and you know it's prohibitive not only because maybe you don't have enough money but a lot of players actually do have the money but they say why do i want to spend 600 to try a game i might not even like the game and i get that right so but these all these tokens these these nfts these axes they they're they're yield generating to some extent because they can be bred and resold or because if you're winning in the game you're earning slp which can be kind of right exchanged back to fiat so guilds came along and and i think i credit ygg with a lot of normalizing all this and they realized that they could essentially purchase all these assets guilds were asset rich and time poor and then they could hire people in parts of the world who were time rich and asset poor and essentially hire them to work these assets in the game to to to take a team of three axes play axe infinity with it for x hours per day earn slp and then keep some share of the slp for themself and then the guild would would take some share of it as well so it's this really cool model that that sprung up and the philippines it seems like was where it predominated mostly like it was just it was it was huge in the philippines is that right yeah it really really caught fire there yeah at one point a large over half of our players were in the philippines wow do you have a sense and i i partly asked this to you because obviously you may know because axis may be done research into it and also you got your masters in in chinese studies and do you live in vietnam did i see that i'm moving to vietnam in about a month you're moving so you're interested in that part of the world like why the philippines it caught the way it did so actually inherently it has this incredible k factor right that word of mouth kind of virality uh the the the number of people that one node the number of nodes one node will onboard is incredibly higher than your average game so wherever it sticks it tends to kind of catch why the philippines i think we had some early nodes there if you will uh also english usage is high axis not localized it's being localized at the time it wasn't so it kind of stuck there and we had a couple like really big um um kind of high profile people there and again i credit ygg and kind of gabby for spreading a lot there and i think it was a confluence of factors and it really just caught fire at one point the the government in the philippines i think like threatened to come after uh axey as like an unregistered player like how did that play out i yeah we're the first game that is is impacting uh state and local politics in some way yeah uh the federal government of the philippines issued kind of a statement um just wanting to make sure that all players earning slp were paying taxes on their slp that's certainly something we want to be in line with and so we we issued a similar statement there are local politicians um who are including axi in some ways this is the philippines in some way shape or form within their political campaigns um so there's a lot of awareness in the in the philippines kind of up the chain of axi i've heard this critique i will say i personally find it bizarre and i can maybe give my thoughts on it i imagine we we feel similarly but um that is critical of axi and the to earn model which obviously i'm assuming that term started with axiom came from axi um as being just highly exploited and i think looking at these scholarship and scholarship programs in particular and it just being like a very clear like you have the kind of rent seekers like the landowners and then the laborers and the laborers are doing the work and they're paying rent it's almost what you're describing of like it feels like a middleman or something you know like um how do you respond to those criticisms so we our community has done a really great job of self-policing there were definitely some really highly exploitive scholarship programs at certain points that were paying out stupid low you know percentages um our community's done a great job of self-policing and really trying to push those out we're working on an internal scholarship um kind of tool that will help keep some like market average of what proper payouts should be as well um but you know it's definitely important that things stay fair there i think you touched on an interesting thing too around where did this play to earn kind of concept come from um that's a really really cool history because it wasn't actually something that we pushed uh we because we want all of our assets to be on chain uh slp was tokenized right slp is just like an asset you'd see in a normal game you could win gold right in a normal game but it's not tokenized and the game itself is like a closed car a walled garden well because slp was our in-game asset it's it's it's the faucet is when you win a game the sink for burning that slp is to breed your axes right so this this uh flywheel was created but because it's tokenized obviously it can be taken out of the game and and you can do whatever you want with it some of our community members actually got on a dex i believe it was sushi i'm not sure which though and they lp they created a liquidity pool of slp and and just like that you had the ability to play to earn so it wasn't even actually us who really pushed that it was our community uh that created the the ability to play to earn in the first place and that term played earn was that did that stem from the axi team where did that start that one that one came from the community as well and and we're actually pushing toward might even the media to be honest a lot of a lot of articles were coming out we think play and earn is is a more proper concept um and and so that's that's how we really term it ourselves and that i feel like is a shift that is sort of what's underway right now with x infinity origin and this this gets us to where i want to go so i do just want to quickly uh round out my thoughts i was calling it bizarre i this criticism of like oh it's so depressing to me that you have these people in developing countries like you know working away at games and it's exploited and i'm like to me it's just more choice i'm sure there's dark things that go on and i'll show that but i find that argument weird like nobody's going there with a gun saying this is how you have to make your living you know like how is how is more options for ways that people can earn earn money not a positive thing exactly it's just another option in in the job market right yeah it's another tool in the toolbox that exactly exactly okay i just wanted it well i was calling it bizarre and i didn't want it to make it seem like i think it's like bizarre to have any sort of critique of people making sub optimal wages or any of the rest of it okay the sustainability question this has been i think the debate that has dogged axi i said earlier actually he's very aware of it is very upfront about it but let's just dive into it a little bit more the the i think the center piece of this right is is this a ponzi scheme in some way right like is this sustainable with the problem being a lot of its players up to this point have played the game to make money and that was why they were there and so they're there to extract something from the game you also have fees that are paid out and so you also have you know axs token holders extracting something from the game as it's played and obviously the central challenge there being like in order for that dynamic to continue you constantly need new money flowing into the game and you need new players constantly coming in but eventually the rubber meets the road eventually you know you can't there's a limit to how many new players you can get and suddenly then you have diminishing returns and the whole ecosystem starts to fall apart so that's that's do you want to add anything to that on this question of sustainability or is that kind of the summary you say you'd say on on that's that's the summary of the of the critique right uh yeah well let's let's talk about what you guys are doing about it then it's been again and axi knows this axis is like we get it we know that that alone is unsustainable talk to us about where we are right now in terms of the the transition to to i don't know change the model evolve the model however you would frame it yeah i i think we we feel that more than anybody else in the space right every every open economy nft game will face this at some point and that's what's so exciting to me about axi is we're solving it uh and so i think we're creating a playbook for people to follow right and you get so much credit for that by the way i think there's like you know there's fun every community is gonna get fun but i think fundamentally like just the credit to axi for being the first to do all of this you know you're you're building the plane as it's flying there's a good way to put it that is a good way to put it yeah um yeah so it right and there's so many different aspects to it and um but what we really believe is at the end of the day um this extractive model it doesn't work and and and that's proven that's that's proven out already and no no open economy can run that way right no nation state has that either now what it means for play and earn to me it's it's not everybody who puts money in will make an entire roi out of it you know some players absolutely will some players won't but the truth of it is that to have a fully sustainable economy you're not you're looking for players who aren't only trying to get in for roi we want players who like to play the game exactly and that's that's hundreds of millions of people who are playing current non-nft video games right we don't have to look far it turns out people love to do that anyways and so that's why serving up a truly fun game is is is our number one uh goal to actually meet that right so that's step one and we've done that with origin we're doing that with every future game that's coming as well of which there there will be many um and then you sprinkle in this ability to own your own assets you sprinkle in earning mechanics so players who are extremely skilled they will be rewarded and they actually probably will play turn right uh other other archetypes of players like collectors people who are playing and really trying to collect top tier axes and and and know what they're doing there they they may be they able to earn as well subsets of scholars will be able to earn as well so it doesn't entirely disappear but the other piece that unlocks and this is what's really interesting for a player like me when i play a traditional game okay let's say i play uh let's say i play fortnite and i buy like a marshmallow skin you know the dj marshmallow his skins are really hot right now uh it's a sink i'm not getting any money back i know it when i put the money in now let's say i go and play axey i'm not trying to play to earn i just enjoy playing it and i kind of like that i can owe my assets and they're cute i put a hundred dollars in and then i decide to leave in two months and maybe i can resell my assets for 75 when i compare that to fortnight where i lose 100 of my value versus actually where i lose only 25 percent of my value it still is a completely different um ownership mechanism right uh and so in that sense like play and earn or owning the ownership mechanics within a game is different and and i i'm spending because i want to play the game but it's still a cherry on top to me that i owned my mechanics in the first place let me ask a question i don't know that you can answer such a fun interviewer i am aren't they that's a blast for you um and there's gonna be a uh maybe a funky lead-in to this but i hope it's actually educational and interesting for people too something that i learned as i was looking into this is you guys uh made a change the economics i think at the end of last fall and my understanding of what this is and you can correct me is um there was this unsustainability thing happening there were a lot of bots at like the low level who were coming in and able to make money basically by doing very very little um and and not being very good players but they could make enough that if it's you know if you're running a bot farm that's doing it it's obviously worth it to you and you guys made this shift where uh basically players who were under a certain level who like weren't playing well enough earned nothing suddenly as opposed to the little bit that they could maybe earn previously and again that that sort of wipes out the bots it also meant that a lot of players that maybe weren't so good left the game and that like shifted this window so it suddenly was a much more competitive game so it wasn't just players that were bad that left and weren't making anything now you had the players who were maybe able to make a little bit more because they were playing against all these bad players who had maybe been in the middle of the whatever window they were now at the bottom of the window you know and they were kind of struggling to earn and yet on the flip side the best players now could earn a bit more and it feels like the shift came partly in this timeline of um there was a period of time when playing axe infinity you could have earned more than minimum wage in the philippines or the average wage i think in the philippines and then as more players joined that went down and so this shift i don't know if this was its intention but part of what it did is it meant that the top players now could earn a better living but it did mean that people sort of in the middle of the bottom were earning less do i have that summary correct yeah that's more or less right i believe we've actually done away with that um those low um gates on earning mechanics as well but but yes that that's more or less what happened at the time and when we really think about it right our goal then was to start get rid of the bots that had to happen we also wanted to start to control slp issuance in some way because it got out of hand and that was a big part of the sustainability question um so when we look at how do we control slp issue issuance we want to make sure that we're rewarding players who are bringing the most value to the game that's what nft gaming does everyone everyone's time is valuable everyone should be rewarded for the value that they helped create just by playing a game i'm bringing value to the game because i'm bringing player liquidity to the game but you can start to segment the value of that player liquidity and we want to make sure we're getting the most player liquidity at the higher ends of the competitive spectrum because those are those are high value players as well and so by helping to shift that mmr uh the the the kind of player skill level uh window of things we were able to increase player liquidity at the top end of the spectrum as well so we're driving higher value players and making sure we're rewarding them really well do you guys think about it and this is part of this difficult question that i don't know you can answer like the the media quote unquote who's framing things in terms of like wages in the philippines yeah do you guys think in those terms of like we want this to be a game that some people can play to make a living on in parts of the world our number one goal is to build a fun game that with a player-owned economy and truly digital assets okay uh yeah that that's that's number one [Laughter] as there's earning mechanics in it that's awesome uh we love that people can earn off the back and can supplement their incomes or or in some places in the world can you know drive their entire you are driving the economics and there's tokenomics to this and you are thinking about slp you know inflation deflation you're thinking about all those things so inevitably it it it sort of seeps in these dynamics of how much can somebody earn a given day with slp or whatever yes some of it can't be ignored but you know in in our central banking uh calculus that's going on and you're bad bernanke exactly some variables are taken into account somewhere not yet it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces

mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web 3. let's get into axia infinity origin this is now a totally separate game essentially from axi infinity correct and you've already talked a little bit about it it's much more traditional game studio game um why is this a big leap forward for this game how does it tie into this making it a sustainable question which of course is just making a fun game yeah so i think there's kind of like a a small answer and then there's my really hype answer so on the the small answer side like it's it's revamped it's faster it's more professional in terms of like being a game studio who builds a great game uh and the art is beautiful um i think that's kind of the small answer the really hyped answer is we're now it's free to play we're giving free starter axes three free starter axes to anybody who joins the game and doesn't own nft axes and that to me that's the biggest unlock for our space right when you look at onboarding into nft gaming my goal is i want you know my my my 62 year old mom who plays a match 3 she plays candy crush i want her to be just as likely to play candy crush as she is actually infinity and with axey classic there's no way she's going to download metamask bridge her assets to ronin get her own wallet go spend 400 on a team no way no way but now you know once we're live on the app store she can press download and start playing with three free starter axes immediately that's that's how we're bringing this to the world and just to be clear because i think this is really cool too the the key point here which i think you said but it's easy to gloss over is that these are not nfts so the point is this is not diluting the the value of axes because these aren't axes that you can buy and sell in the way you can the nft taxi so if you want to play in a more earning uh capacity you actually do need to still buy into the system buy into the ecosystem these are non-nft axes that just allow you to hopefully if you're you're guys getting to get addicted to the game is that is that right yes so we will bring people in we'll give them these non-nft axes these cannot be bred uh resold obviously nor are they earning mechanics off the back so if you want to participate in earning mechanics you can certainly buy but what's even cooler is let's say you don't you don't care about earning mechanics but you just want to own a piece of the economy you want to own an asset that aligns your incentives with with everyone else you can also buy for for that reason as well you mentioned the app stores which i think are huge to this this is this question of distribution that we kick the call off with this is key to going from two million players to again whatever the biggest games in the world have um i know at one point you guys were talking about launching on i think steam and then apple and google play was it after that that steam had their weird announcement about will never have nfts nft gaming so that's sort of off the table is the is the plan still like google and apple play and being in these app stores and and how is that going i know there's been the apple's also made it very difficult to make nft or blockchain games or assets they're moving slowly they're moving very very slowly so i think it's worth starting with this when we think about a traditional web3 game nft game there's really three proven distribution channels it's community it's content creators um and it's it's ecosystem plays which in our case is guilds right when a guild on board's a scholar it we also grow so we're doing everything we can to completely unlock and optimize those distribution channels on the side we're also really grinding on web 2 proven channels the biggest ones there that's google play and it's the app store we we're we have meetings with with teams that both i got lunch along with uh psycho and jihos in san francisco about three weeks ago with the app store's head of blockchain right they all get it they know that this is here to stay they have a lot of respect for everything that nft games are building um and we're leading those conversations right now it's just gonna be a slower process and and that's fine you know the biggest things for them are it's not a question of is this a fad what it really is is their own player protection they've built so much into a traditional web 2 app experience that really protects players and they don't yet know how they wrap that into a nft game or a web 3 app download as well which are they concerned about community backlash because they're so much uh they're not they're so many feelings in the gamer community around nfts no they're not and i i think if they push it as well the the kind of social stamp of approval um will will be really really nice um but you know we're working hand in hand with them ultimately we've kind of gotten a nod to actually help them rewrite some of their policies around nft gaming um so we're really hoping that we can blaze the way here for a lot of nft games to follow us and all of our future games as well it's funny i'm once again sort of seeing the echo with free to play i interviewed justin waldron who founded zynga and it was zynga who first got in-app purchases in the app store uh through you know whatever you could buy poker chips in the app with real money and the app store was very opposed to that and then they showed them the way and here we are uh you mentioned the the distribution channels the web3 native distribution channels for gaming you mentioned the guilds which we've been talking about i'm curious it feels like there's a lot of opportunity around guilds which i think will continue to be huge in this space for axia and as other games you know in other games that exist and continue to come out do you see any where do you see that evolving do you see business opportunities where you're like here's what the guild world needs uh tell me give me some thoughts i'm so excited by the future of guilt it's incredible right we've had this massive proliferation of guilds there's hundreds of them maybe thousands many have successfully raised like some impressive raises with vcs and everything um and a lot of them have really been focused on like the traditional scholarship extractive model and some of those will stay around but the coolest ones right now are completely transitioning right because it turns out there's like so much that we need in the web3 space in the guild space especially so some of the ones i'm most excited about like the guilds who are doing software as a service packages right whether it's like to help uh nft gaming platforms be better at what they do or to help other guilds be better at what they do like these are guilds that don't even have scholars and and they're crushing it uh lifestyle guilds are the ones that are most exciting to me um so like there's a guild called metagoons right now which i just am enamored by to be totally honest uh and they have a merch drop coming out and it's really badass merch and like they kind of remind me of like 100 thieves to some extent except cooler and web 3 focused but like they're building this brand and like what it means to be a brand in the nft gaming space like we need a lot more of that to be honest because that's what's defining culture and so explain to me let's start which is like basically with guilds and you know up to this point i think what you're describing is at this point revenue has primarily come from guild members play games and earn something but then also you have these scholars that kick back you know that you you're loaning out your axi and they kick back money to you if they win and that's been the primary revenue source for with guilds and you're describing branching out so there's additional revenue sources for example just becoming like a a brand that sells merch and sells tickets to irl events or whatever else i mean basically what we're seeing with pfp projects that are trying to become brands is that do i have that right yeah yeah i think you hit the nail on the head they all they all really started with having scholars but what they started to realize was like holy  we have this really impressive like uh user base and labor force if you will all of whom are hungry and like are badass and web3 want to do so much more than just play a game like let's all work together and and and actually build something way cooler and so now you have like these guilds who like uh are they launching pfps some of them are all of the top content creators are aligning with guilds or starting their own right so it's like you're seeing this really become the future of what nft gaming is the games are just the platforms uh and it's the guilds and the players and the communities who are interacting on top of it and building amazing back to origin uh are there other so we've got this critique around sustainability you know is the economic model sustainable solve they're quite obvious make a game that people actually just want to play obviously that's that's one goal with axe infinity origin it's also uh how do we get how do we still have this growth model and and get more people into the game the the free non-nft axes is part of that distribution will be part of that etc are there other uh critiques you've heard or or maybe it's not even does that be a critique but just like imperfections within you know the previous axi ecosystem that has been leveled up or is being solved with axi origin yeah i mean so i mean even if we look at origin itself right like it is it's we're in early access right now uh and there's we have i think we have we have half a million testers right now half a million weekly active users after just seven days uh and so we're working out a lot of the kinks and and a lot of the bugs within that um longer term one thing i'm super excited about with origin is more sinks for slp and that was something that actually classic didn't have the only sink for slp was to breed your axes uh it turns out you know people actually would spend slp for other reasons other than just breeding their axes right maybe it's it's runes and charms which are like ways to level up your axes oftentimes it's also just flexing right like if we think back to web2 when i buy a marshmallow skin it doesn't give me powerups it's social signaling bingo right it's the same same reason why pfp projects work and we want to build a lot of that into origin we've got a great road map for that as well okay so it's it my impression and it seemed like you're maybe alluding to this a little bit you're obviously in early access you're collecting community feedback feels like there's been a lot of successes here i know your your team sent me some numbers beforehand and touting all the successes that i have you know over a million pvp matches and all these free-to-play players and all these new users with ronin accounts and blah blah so safe to say there's been a lot of success here there also has been i think just a bunch of community feedback uh and definitely some fraughtness elements of the game itself which it seems like philip law i think is somebody who you guys hired recently who seems to be really beloved who's really taking the time to understand community feedback on the origin side um and then there's also which we're going to talk a little bit about sort of maybe some fraughtness around land and and axe's metaverse play and i want to talk about that um do you have any learnings takeaways from you know running a game or working within a company that also has a huge community that are part owners that's the key part yeah that um both because they actually are and and and because of the way this space is and so you know it's it's the decentralization piece what have been your learnings there that's such a cool question right and our community lead syntax is his handle paul is is his name um his like his biggest role right now is is really teaching a lot of us on the team what it means and how you actually do a lot of that um i think i think we've learned it the hard ways a couple times over and but we're starting to get a lot better at it uh and basically i mean look i can actually give you an example right so we're we're working on uh creator program uh axi creators it will really be the first of its kind nft gaming creator program which we're psyched about um we tried to roll it out maybe two months ago um we didn't collect any community feedback ahead of time we didn't connect with anybody i i was leading it and i took a very web 2 approach where i said hey i think this is what's best let me push it out i was destroyed for it and quickly learned my lesson from that i called off the program and now we're just starting to give it life again and what does that mean like it's it's this really cool kind of almost political campaign and it's very grassroots like we're starting with one-on-ones with so many of our top creators saying hey what should this look like what do you want to see coming from this here are the pain points that we have how should we solve this and then from there it grows out into a you know another concentric ring and then it's a twitter thread and then it's a twitter space and all of this is us just pitching stramit and i think the biggest learning for me is every single time someone raises like hey that's wrong it's okay well what should we do about it and we force the community to solve our problems for us because they're our problems they're not our problems and then by the time we push something live everyone's been heard everyone has voiced their concerns when someone else voices another concern it's not sky mavis who pushed that idea in the first place it's all of us in the community so the community jumps in to defend it against someone else and it really it's it's very much kind of grassroots consensus building from the start it's much more open-ended than a traditional web 2 kind of project would be on this theme can you speak to or maybe talk a little bit more about the path from where we are today to decentralization we spoke a little bit about it earlier but it's definitely something that axis talked about this this moving towards greater decentralization greater power for axs um i know there's more you want to say on that than we've yeah it's so important like i said i we have this really really great um kind of social contract in place right now where where we're trusted to really push it our axs holders are um are they really believe you know they're long-term focused but you know we're taking steps this uh progressive decentralization is so key we're all bought into it so our next biggest step we want to roll out what is essentially you could think about it like a token gated reddit uh and it's very close it's gone through a bunch of internal testing but it's this form where you can connect your ronin wallet where you hold all your actually assets and all of our axs holders if they meet the threshold which will be you know low enough for mass participation we'll be able to post and interact with everybody we can vote we can look at what most top voted uh upvoted comments and issues might be so that's a really big step towards this progressive decentralization i think the next thing on top of that is we're setting up a bunch of councils we've just created like a competitive integrity council so these are like right where um there used to be sky mavis stepping in and saying hey you know we're we think this is cheating whatever it might be in game and here's the ban that happens that doesn't look great in a game that's supposed to be truly decentralized now we have this council which is community led and and respected who can actually make the decisions for us i'm doing the same thing with the creator program we'll have a creator council who actually leads and makes a lot of the tough decisions for the creator program itself so these are like the short-term steps we're taking ultimately it's it's going to get there over the next couple years to be something that's truly governed i think the coolest thing that could happen and it's the mechanics are there for it one day axs holders could decide that sky mavis shouldn't even be the lead dev on axe infinity anymore uh and and it could definitely happen over the next couple years that's wild do you like and the distribution of axs you think will will be that way like part of it is that you know you have to have sky mavis or vcs or things to sell the axs or am i uh i love that you're asking that right we we uh we can hold we're committed to holding about 20 of it uh in the long term right for the forever should we should we decide to keep it um right now we control a mass amount of it because we are you know pushing towards product market fit but we're committed to distributing uh the the funds the pools where a lot of them are held we're committed to distributing those over really the next four years so you know we have to reach a very broad uh and and diverse token holdership of axs and that's really a huge goal for us okay last theme here because i know we're running up on time and maybe we'll do a couple like rapid fire ending questions about the future but um but but the metaverse play for i'll call it um i said this to you at the beginning of this before we started recording but the obvious thing for somebody like me who's sort of a noob to this whole world both gaming period and then nft gaming and all and all the rest of it axi making like a roblox play is like a no-brainer um and it seems like that's what you guys are doing with lunacia which is very much not fully rolled out yet but you know you have land sales and the idea is that ultimately people will be able to build their own like axi games and little worlds on that land that you can go visit and it's interactive did i summarize that right tell me about lunacia lunacy is lenasia is it's an exciting one it's a massive program that we've uh kind of had to to revamp um uh real recently uh we've got we've got the roadmap in place it's a couple year multi-year road map um with a really cool kind of lead game design designer who's pushing all of it and phil is the steward of it right um yes there's this land gameplay that's coming out it'll it'll be probably the second major axi gameplay um there's a lot of forms to it you know phase one is starting out a bit more basic but we want to unlock this land gameplay for people as soon as possible um as it gets into later phases you know there will be a lot of ability to kind of build on your own gameplay but what i think is uh uh excuse me build like using your own um plot right but what i think is is like really important kind of second to this is this like developer sdk or this idea that that third parties can build whether it's on their land or just on ronin in general um that is uh developer kit software developer yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah um so that that's that's huge like that's near and dear to my heart too because that's when we truly become i don't even like the word metaverse but that's when we truly become like a metaverse right uh and it's yeah i was gonna ask uh can you distinguish for me the the like a land game play because that's that's like a thing now you know what that is to me because in my head that just means roblox and users can build on it but that's clearly not true because there's a distinction between land gameplay and then i would land i would say that yeah i would say like the roblox style thing is one example of land gameplay yeah but it can also be more centralized is that the alternative that you're describing is sort of the starting point that evolves into a roblox style play yeah right and i think our early our early style land gameplay is more about like you know i own my own land because i have that i'm a i have access to this gameplay uh and then once i'm on my land i can like farm assets harvest assets uh use the resources right use those resources to construct things and and kind of support battles and things like that there was some recent fraughtness i keep using that term around this yeah it feels like it applies because uh and so i think there were a couple things i think there was frustrations people were maybe hoping that the plans around this were further along they thought it was maybe going to be connected to axi origin it seems like they've really been to their two distinct categories within the axi ecosystem uh there was talk of free land being given out to folks or being available to folks which i think upset people who felt like i bought this land where's my utility for it do you want to speak to any of that or can you speak to any of that yeah it's a to the extent that i can right i like i i feel for our community members i'm a land holder myself as well um i know that timelines got got pushed back i think that was a big part of it timelines got pushed back and and expectations were met in a different way than people had been hoping for um and and i get that right and that's that's another area that we need to work on is is how we communicate things and how we how we get feedback and build things with community before we actually make an announcement i i totally get that um you know there's a phased approach we've already i think a lot of the the land holder sentiment being down was around the ability to earn earning mechanics for the land that they were holding in the shorter term because in this in this presentation we rolled out we kind of said it might be like nine to 12 months um we we've changed uh attack on that we we're working on an ability to earn in the much shorter term until we have kind of uh the more robust land game play rolled out uh we're working with our our land holders to do that that we have this land holder channel in the axi discord that's super active and so we're working really closely with them to build something in the shorter term to allow them to earn whether it's some kind of land staking capability or like a land mini gameplay where you have like this proof of play to earn uh it's still up in the air but you know we want to we want to make this one right for sure okay rapid fire ending questions uh the question i just had was not in the least rapid fire it was like pay me a picture of the future of axi um i think i've said that i think concert tickets are how nfts go mainstream you mentioned earlier axey's trying to trojan horse things this is like a common theme axe he's going to trojan horse people into the blockchain do you think gaming is how this goes mainstream would you fight me on my concert you're going to say it's gaming i'm going to say it's concert tickets is that the fight look contra tickets can happen too but uh it's it's got to be gaming right we've already done it most of our players had never touched crypto before axi and then guess what they had the ability to learn web 3 while playing a fun game and now we actually bring them in through free to play and then just teach them about things while they're playing it's uh it's it's scary i don't play any games am i like really that much i don't believe that i literally don't i don't have a single game on your phone i will check this right now i occasionally play bubble popper while i'm like watching something i don't even think i have it downloaded though i have bubble shooter i have two versions of bubble shooter on my phone that is those are literally the only games i have my phone i'm gonna lose all my nobody's gonna follow me anymore they're like how can you possibly be a credible voice in web 3 when you're like not just not a gamer like you're not a gamer you got to download more just to say you have more on youtube i know i do i mean i played wordle for a couple days okay yeah but i literally have not a single sporkle party i also have sporkle party i'm we're boring people now but sporkle party you know that game it's like a it's like a um trivia game that you play in a group where like you know you have to i don't know whatever i actually haven't played that one but here here's because nobody is actually a gamer plays sports party i play non-gamer games and i hardly play those how often would you say you play a game like maybe once a week or something like that oh my god not even no all right well you may be a special case but what i do want to say is like most people are gamers they just won't they just don't think of themselves that way when you think of a gamer you think of like a high schooler playing zombies in their parents basement but the truth is my mom who plays match 3 is a gamer just like she's a tv watcher so it's absolutely massive the the window of people we have access to you are definitely right i mean again my mother plays scrabble on her phone she plays games on her phone um so i probably am like the really freaky outlier from people so so but we'll see we'll see who wins down the line we'll have to see how many people are playing circle blockchain games versus how many people have bought an nft in the form of some sort of like ticket right okay well quinn thank you so much i really appreciate you hopping on here there's obviously so much to unpack in the axi ecosystem in general so we've like done the first pass at it all but uh we'll definitely have to have you slash other you know axey folks on in the future to keep keep the conversation going absolutely carly this was a blast thank you so much for having me yeah [Music] thank you so much for watching this episode of overpriced jpegs if you liked this conversation if you liked this episode
